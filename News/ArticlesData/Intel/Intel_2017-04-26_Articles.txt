The Waymo driverless car is displayed during a Google event last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world’s biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG’s Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp. acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV, and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-21. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. “Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming, and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact.  Others such as General Motors Co. are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive PLC are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp. has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc., competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house — as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology.

Or the memory or the video card (or lack of video card). The primary reason your cheap laptop loudly chugs along at glacial speeds is because of the hard drive. Cheap laptops use cheap hard disk drives, which are much slower than the solid state drives found in better computers. But Intel's new Optane Memory changes that. This little $70 chip makes a cheap hard disk drive run as fast as a solid state drive. All images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo It does all this by using a brand new type of memory. That sounds very boring, but memory might be one of the most important components in your computer. What the hell is memory? Memory is anything in a computer that reads and writes data. There's memory in your processor, in your RAM, and all the way down to your USB drives. "It's like a pyramid," Greg Schulz, a storage analyst and operator of StorageIO told Gizmodo. "As you go down the pyramid the capacity is cheaper, but slower." So the tip of the pyramid is the memory in your CPU, then comes DRAM, then NAND-based flash storage like SSDs, then hard disk drives. At the very bottom would be the oldest and cheapest kind of memory tape drives. After you understand the pyramid there's only one other thing you really need to understand. Volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory tends to be faster — it's DRAM or the stuff built into your CPU. It's crazy speedy and writes at the smallest possible read/write level: the byte level. Yet volatile memory can't actual remember anything when it loses power. So the minute you restart your computer volatile memory forgets everything it's learned. The first time you open a big program on a computer after a restart, it takes longer than usual. Why? Your computer's DRAM has forgotten all the crucial info it needs to open the program quickly. Non-volatile memory doesn't have that problem, but it's also a lot slower, and can't write at the byte level. So what is non-volatile memory? It's the stuff that maintains all the data it learns even when it's not receiving power. It's persistent memory. As soon as something is classified as persistent memory it can take on another name: storage. Every hard drive, floppy, or thumb drive you use is persistent memory. Intel Optane memory is cool because its uses an entirely new entry on the memory pyramid: 3D Xpoint memory. 3D Xpoint slots in right between DRAM and NAND. It's as fast as the volatile stuff — capable of reading at that crucial byte level — but it's also persistent. It's the best of both worlds. What Is 3D Xpoint Memory? "Since digital memory was created, there's only been 8 major memories, the most recent being 3D Xpoint," storage analyst Greg Schulz told Gizmodo. The last big memory before 3D Xpoint? That was NAND, which was introduced back in 1999. "These things only come around every couple of decades." 3D Xpoint was announced by Intel and Micron way back in 2015, sixteen years after the last big memory leap. At the time the two companies promised that 3D Xpoint was a thousand times faster than NAND, but just as persistent. Which would mean a whole new ultrafast medium for storing data. Yet it's taken nearly two years to go from announcing the memory to actually putting it in hardware you and I can buy. What The Hell Is Intel Optane Memory? Intel's Optane memory is the first instance of 3D Xpoint being used in consumer-level products. There's already a 3D Xpoint storage drive available, taking advantage of its incredible speed, but that drive is also only 375GB and retails for $US1500. Optane memory is Intel's shot at giving consumers an affordable taste of 3D Xpoint's incredible speed. What it does it function as a cache system for your primary storage drive, storing necessary data sort of like RAM might, but holding onto that data in between restarts. The memory stick fits in the .M2 slot on Optane ready motherboards. Bring your own screw. If that concept sounds familiar that's because people have been using faster non-volatile memory as a cache system for the slower stuff for a while now. Notably, Apple has its optional Fusion drive for iMacs. That one combines an SSD and HDD, with the SSD functioning as the cache system while the HDD handles storage. While it is definitely cheaper, and larger, than a solid state drive alone, the speeds don't quite get to solid state levels. Seagate's also introduced such a drive, though it goes with the more generic "hybrid" name. A 2TB hybrid drive with 8GB of onboard flash memory is about $100, but Intel's new Optane setup is similarly cheap. A32GB Optane memory stick and 2TB hard disk drive costs around $150. The cost of a 2TB solid state drive? Nearly $1000. So why spend $150 instead of $100? Because Intel Optane is really damn fast. OK, How Good Is Intel's Optane Memory, Then? I put Intel's new hardware through a series of benchmarks to test just how much it could improve the performance of HDDs and SDDs. In the case of the former, it improves speeds so much that you'll never, ever want to use a Optane-less HDD again. This was best exemplified with Adobe Premiere and Adobe Photoshop. Both apps are notorious for taking forever to open. When I opened a project in Premiere on a regular HDD it took 52 seconds. Opening a huge project in Photoshop took 37 seconds. Yet once I'd activated the 32GB Optane memory chip, those processes took 11 seconds and 7 seconds respectively. Shockingly it actually made the HDD faster than a SSD too, and bizarrely, in the case of Premiere, the HDD with Optane was actually a full two seconds faster than the SSD with Optane. HDD with Optane inside is crazy fast, and the shorter the bar the better the performance. Opening projects in Adobe apps gave the Optane memory its most impressive results, but Optane dramatically improved the traditional rotating platter hard disk drive's performance across the board. The HDD took 5.5 seconds to open Google Chrome, but the HDD with Optane took less than two seconds. Opening a 4K video in Windows' native video player took six seconds with the HDD, but it took only 1.5 seconds to open it when the Optane memory was enabled. Again, shorter bars are better. The solid state drive combined with Optane memory didn't see the same kind of insane performance improvement as the HDD. Indeed in the case of the above productivity tests, the SSD and SSD with Optane memory were neck and neck with no real noticeable difference in speed. But that changed when we tried loading games. The storage drive has to read a lot more data when opening a video game versus opening an app like Photoshop or Google Chrome, and it takes a lot more time to read that data. Consequently, the insane speed benefits of Optane memory are much more apparent. When opening Mass Effect Andromeda the Optane memory enabled storage drives were both twice as fast as the drives without Optane memory. Speeds were less dramatic in the case of loading levels. In both cases Optane memory made the storage drive approximately 20-per cent faster. The SSD with Optane loaded a Mass Effect level in 28 seconds while the SSD without loaded it in 34 seconds. The HDD with Optane loaded the level in 49 seconds while the one without did it in 61 seconds. Overwatch, a game that takes up much less space on a storage device, also saw exceptional improvements in loading times. Though the speed improvements weren't consistent. While Overwatch loaded twice as fast on the HDD with Optane versus the HDD without, it only loaded a single second faster on the SDD with Optane versus the SSD without. I observed the same disparity when benchmarking the time it takes a computer to boot up. The HDD with Optane booted twice as fast as the HDD without, but the SSD with Optane only booted 2 seconds faster than the SSD without. If all your systems run on SSD there's really no need to go out and drop money on an Optane memory stick. While it can, on occasion, improve the speeds of an SSD it's not nearly a big enough improvement to warrant spending $US44 ($58) minimum on Optane memory. Yet if you have a computer where all the systems and apps are on a HDD? Optane memory will make your computing life better. Unfortunately, there are some pretty damn big caveats. Chief among them is that Optane memory only works with computers that have a seventh generation Intel Kaby Lake processor inside — and Kaby Lake only started shipping very late last year. This means that the big old desktop gathering dust in your garage can't benefit from Optane memory. In fact, few people can, because Optane memory currently only works with desktop CPUs and motherboards, and Optane compliant motherboards and CPUs only started shipping this year. So unless you're a computer builder, the benefits of Optane memory are still outside your grasp. But Intel has assured Gizmodo that we're going to start seeing a lot of Optane memory enabled desktops and laptops from computer makers later this year. So someday very soon, cheap is no longer going to mean slow. If you see a laptop with an Optane inside sticker slapped on the front, rest assured, that's a good thing. README Optane memory retails for about $70 for a 16GB stick and $120 for a 32GB stick. Go ahead and spend the money on the 32GB version. It makes HDDs twice as fast as they normally are, but it doesn't axe the annoying kathunk sound HDDs make. Benefits to SSDs are small now, but later generations of Optane memory could change that. A 32GB Optane memory stick and 2TB HDD costs less than a 500GB SSD. Even if storage isn't crucial to your PC build, that's a great deal. Comments dunkyboy @dunkyboy Apr 27, 2017, 4:14pm Any idea how the last result is explained? How is a HDD/Optane faster than a SSD/Optane combo. Seems counter-intuitive. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Announcement  ⋮  Hardware Intel Quietly Launches Xeon Platinum and Gold Series Processors With Up To 28 Cores / 56 Threads By Usman Pirzada 8 hours ago 14Shares Share Tweet Submit In a PCN (Product Change Notification) sent to partners (via Computerbase.de), Intel has quietly launched the Xeon Gold and Platinum platforms. The lineups boast a wide variety of clock speeds and core configurations with the flagship going as high as 28 cores clocked at a hearty 2.5 GHz. Interestingly, the socket actually appears to be the R3 socket (LGA 2011-3?) and there is still no official word on the 32-core chip we spotted earlier this year. Intel launches Xeon Gold and Xeon Platinum lineup for server market; Skylake uArchitecture, AVX-512 instruction set, H0 Stepping and more Intel’s Xeon Gold and Platinum lineups go as high as 3.6 GHz clock speed with the low core variants (think Xeon Gold 5122) and as low as 2.0 GHz for some specific low power variants. The Xeon Gold lineup has the nomenclature of 61xx while the Platinum lineup follows the 81xx nomenclature for CPU naming convention. Let’s talk about the absolutely monster CPU that is lurking in this lineup though: the 28 core, 56 thread Xeon part. Related Intel’s Flagship Xeon E5-2699 V5 Skylake-EP CPU Leaked – Features 32 Cores, 64 Threads, Will Compete With AMD Naples The Intel Xeon Platinum 8180 is the part believed to have 28 cores and is clocked at an astounding 2.5 GHz core clock. This is very impressive for a processor with this amount of cores. It also has an L3 cache of 38.5 MB as well as a TDP of just 205 watts. The architectural improvements that set Skylake apart from Broadwell can be found throughout this lineup so it would be fair to call it Intel’s Skylake rollout to the server market.

The amount of DIMMs available has been increased to 3 DIMMs per channel for a grand total of 18 DIMMs per CPU. So far Intel has four families of Xeon planned: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. The Platinum family will be the 8000 series, gold will be 6000 and 500, silver will be 4000 and bronze will be the 3000 series. Core scaling is thought to start from 10 cores all the way up to 28 cores (or even 32 cores if the processor we saw earlier ends up being part of this lineup.

Keep in mind, however, that the nomenclature might no longer be accurate. The Skylake Purley platform will be divided between three major categories 2S, 4S and 8S/8S+. This includes the family range from Xeon E5 to Xeon E7. The expected nomenclature should assume the ‘v5’ suffix thanks to the Skylake microarchitecture present in the processors and includes the Xeon E5 2600 v5, Xeon E5 4600 v5, Xeon E7 4800 v5 and Xeon E7 8800 v5. The E5 family includes the dual socket and quad socket designs (2S and 4S) whileas the E7 family includes the 8 socket design structure with the C602 chipset and a scalable memory buffer. Related Intel Launches Xeon E5-2699A V4 22 Core Processor – Skylake-EP Xeon CPUs Arriving in 2017 One of the biggest advancements that Skylake will have is the Intel Omnipath Architecture integration which will be called Storm Lake (Generation 1). The PCH will be codenamed Lewisburg and will also ship with updated Ethernet controllers. Another very important point to note is that the platform will be scalable up to 8 sockets – which is frankly an absolutely insane amount for CPUs working in tandem in any given configuration. Specific SKUs have not been disclosed at this time. Since we already have in our possession the complete slide deck for this platform, I have taken the liberty to post the important bits here: Skylake EX Purley will be spread out amongst the entire scalable segment – unlike the previous iterations. The TDP will be configurable from 45W to 165W and will require Socket P. Another interesting point to note is the fact that not only will Purley update the number of PCIe slots to 48 but they will finally be configurable in x4, x8 and x16 divisions ( a major update). Previous reports had hinted on Intel working on some secret project that will prove Skylake to be quite a big architectural jump and not simply another Haswell. While we haven’t seen any evidence of this revolutionary change on the mainstream side, Skylake Purley does appear to be the aforementioned jump, incarnate. According to Intel’s own slides, Skylake Purley is poised to be the biggest update since the age old Nehalem platform. Along with the improved performance per watt that comes with every article iteration, Skylake EX Purley will actually ship with 6 channels of DDR4 as opposed to 4. It will also include the AVX 512 instruction set and will boast the 100G OmniPath interconnect. Skylake Purley will also have Cannonlake graphics support not to mention FPGA integration (another important upgrade). The new platform also comes with an updated socket. The socket has been upgraded to feature 3647 pins that gives it the LGA 3647 name. The socket is surrounded by 12 DDR4 DIMM slots. This is due to support next-generation hexa-channel memory and Intel’s Optane DIMMs for faster latency solutions. Overall, Purley will be expanding Intel’s server platform with a range of new features.   Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Related Intel 14nm Skylake-EP and 10nm Cannonlake-EP Supported on Purley Platform – Up To 160W TDP, Arriving in 1H 2017 Oct 5, 2015 17 Intel’s Next-Gen Skylake-E / EP Processors To Feature Support on LGA 3647 Socket – Hexa Channel Memory Support Confirmed May 31, 2016 315 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The Best Stock to Buy in This Multibillion-Dollar Market This stock is well-positioned to benefit from the coming growth in the autonomous-car market. John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Apr 26, 2017 at 8:10PM According to market researcher PwC Strategy&, the total revenue generated by the automotive industry, ranging from carmakers to technology providers, is currently about $5 trillion. By 2030, this will grow to an estimated $7.8 trillion, and the industry's profits will grow from $400 billion to $600 billion. Much of the increase in revenue and profit will shift away from carmakers and auto suppliers to technology providers, such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as cars become more like computers on wheels and we move further along the spectrum of autonomous vehicles. NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 car computer powers the Volvo XC90 SUV. IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIA INC. Driverless cars will require highly sophisticated technology, such as sensors, software, and computer processors. Intel, NVIDIA, and Alphabet are leaders in these essential technologies and investors are eyeing them with interest. In addition to choosing a company with the best technology, it's important for investors to consider which company stands to reward shareholders the most from the coming boom in driverless cars.  Let's take a look at where the three tech giants mentioned above stand to determine which one is the best driverless-car stock for investors looking to get the most bang for their buck. A game of partnerships These major tech companies have been in a partnership-forming frenzy to create alliances with leading car manufacturers to accomplish the automotive equivalent of landing a rover on Mars. Alphabet has been working on self-driving cars for several years and has racked up 2 million self-driven miles, but it's not planning to build its own car. Its renamed Waymo division (which stands for "a new way forward in mobility") is working on partnerships with carmakers. For its part, Intel plans to acquire Mobileye, an Israel-based technology company purely focused on developing computer vision, data analysis, mapping, and other computer systems for driverless cars. But investors considering Intel or Alphabet as a driverless car investment should be mindful of one very important thing. Any future growth from driverless cars will only provide a marginal benefit to Intel's and Alphabet's top lines. Intel's 2016 revenue was $59.4 billion and Alphabet's was $90.3 billion. Let's compare that with the market opportunity.  PwC Strategy& estimates the revenue opportunity for those providing the technology that helps cars drive themselves will cross $50 billion by 2022. Intel has estimated that the market for vehicle systems, data, and services will be $70 billion by 2030. If Intel captured 100% of the $70 billion estimated to be the market opportunity in driverless cars, then its revenue would increase 118% over the next 13 years, or about 6% per year. Throw in a few more percentage points of annual growth from its existing business, and investors are looking at a company that might get 10% per year in annual revenue growth, which might be enough for Intel stock to keep pace with the S&P 500 index, but nothing more.  Alphabet generated $90 billion in revenue in 2016, so its potential upside from driverless cars also offers shareholders marginal benefits. And with so many companies jockeying for position in the driverless car market, it is unrealistic that one company is going to control 100% share of the market. If you're looking for a stock with plenty of return potential from driverless cars, you want to find a company that has a small amount of revenue compared to the estimated size of the opportunity. That way there is plenty of room for the company's revenue to expand exponentially by winning market share in the driverless car market and provide shareholders the potential to beat the S&P 500 index over the long term. That leads me to NVIDIA. Company Market Cap Annual Revenue in Recent Year Intel $173 $59.4 Alphabet $600 $90.3 NVIDIA $61 $6.9 Data source: SEC 10-K filings. All dollar figures in billions.  The best self-driving car stock A better option is NVIDIA, which is just as well-positioned in the driverless car market as Intel and Alphabet and has the room to see its top line soar. NVIDIA generated $6.9 billion in revenue in 2016 and it has the necessary expertise in developing a crucial piece of technology powering the brains of driverless cars -- the graphics processing unit (GPU). The GPU developer has been forming an impressive list of partnerships with several major automakers, including Volkswagen AG's Audi, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, Honda Motor Co, BMW, and Tesla among many others. NVIDIA is even partnering with Baidu to develop automated parking, HD mapping, and advanced automated vehicle control. NVIDIA has also signed agreements to supply its DRIVE PX 2 car computer to truckmaker PACCAR, as well as major auto suppliers such as ZF and Germany-based Bosch. NVIDIA's revenue from its automotive segment totaled $487 million in fiscal 2017, which ended in late January. The graphics specialist is not a pure-play on self-driving cars, as the company is also selling graphics processors to video game enthusiasts and cloud computing providers, among other uses of its graphics technology. But given its relatively small amount of $6.9 billion in total revenue, the company will benefit shareholders much more from any future growth of self-driving cars compared to larger peers like Intel and Alphabet.

(Seng Mai / The Myanmar Times / March 28, 2011) Distributers of computers and laptops with the latest generation of Intel motherboards in Yangon have been affected by a global recall. Ko Kyaw Htun, the sales manager of Golden Power Technology Co, which distributes Asus products that use Intel motherboards, said the company quickly contacted customers and asked them to bring their computers in. “As soon as we heard about the announcement in the first week of February we started recalling affected products from the market. It took about a month but we’ve retrieved all of them now,” he said. According to the Intel announcement, design errors in the chips could affect performance when linked with some hard disks and/or DVD drives. “People bought these products because they were supposed to be faster. It was a bit disappointing to find the motherboards were not actually any faster than the model they replaced,” said Ko Kaung Myat, the marketing manager of Royal Smart, which distributes MSI products. He worried that the recall might damage public opinion about MSI computers. “Customers need to know clearly that it was not MSI’s fault – this is an Intel problem,” he said. Companies affected by the recall include Gigabyte, Asus, MSI, Elite Computer Systems and Biostar. Replacement motherboards began arriving in early March and are labelled with ‘New B3 Stepping Revision Chipset Motherboard’ stickers to differentiate them from the unrecalled products. “We were quite lucky because the products with defective motherboards were en-route to Yangon when the recall was announced and were returned. The recall did delay the arrival of our newest products by a couple of days but it was not a major problem for us,” said Ko Soe Ngwe Ya, a spokesperson for KMD computer sales and service centre.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / New Intel 28-core, 56-thread Xeons imminent New Intel 28-core, 56-thread Xeons imminent Paul Taylor 12 hours ago CPU, Featured Announcement Intel has released a Product Change Notification (PCN) document informing would-be customers of its new Xeon CPU models. Apart from announcing new server CPUs, the PCN also heralds a new tier system for the segment. The long list includes a listing of 45 Xeon processors, including 11 Xeon Phi MIC-architecture co-processing units. The Xeon CPUs proper, though, range from the high-end Xeon Platinum 8180 CPU (containing 28 CPU cores / 56 threads, running at 2.5 GHz and sporting a total cache of 38.5 MB), down to the Xeon Gold 5122, rumoured to have 12 cores and 24 threads. The new Skylake-SP (or EP, depending on who you ask), are reported to contain 1MB of L2 cache per core. The new tier system, which Intel had been rumoured to be adopting, breaks Xeons into four segments: “Platinum”, “Gold”, “Silver” and “Bronze”. The Platinum tier identifies the 8-socket 8xxx-series, the Gold identifies the 4-socket 6xxx- and 5xxx-series CPUs, the Xeon Silver corresponds to the 4xxx-series dual-socket systems and Xeon Bronze is reported to be the 3xxx-series uniprocessors. Purley, Intel’s new server platform, which uses yet another socket (LGA 3647), has been scheduled for a Q2 release for a while, and taking into consideration the type of CPUs this PCN discloses, this is clearly aimed at the datacenter / HPC segment which AMD Naples will eventually come to, rather than Ryzen or any other HEDT SKU. No conspiracy theories there. Unfortunately Intel has not provided any additional information about the 4xxx- and 3xxx- series Xeons. While Intel has not yet officially announced the CPUs, some stores are already listing them – no technical details, but pricing available. The Xeon Platinum 8180 costs a whopping £9600, while the ‘M’ variant, costs north of £12500. The cheapest CPU on the list, the 3.6GHz Xeon Gold 5122 costs over £1150. KitGuru Says: Skylake EP/SP is on the verge of hitting the market as planned. AMD has nothing yet to fight it off, and it has been notoriously quiet on the Naples front.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Drone Robots: Market Shares, Strategies, and Forecasts, 2017 to 2022 Drone Robots Market    Wiseguyreports.Com Adds “Drone Robots Market -Market Demand, Growth, Opportunities, Manufacturers, Analysis of Top Key Players and Forecast to 2022” To Its Research Database. Description:     The 2016 study has 228 pages, 127 tables and figures. Worldwide drone robot markets are poised to achieve significant growth with the use of cameras on stable flying platforms that are used to help implement aerial entertainment and advertising. Entertainment light shows, advertising drone robots use LED technology to do innovative skywriting. Aerial visualization lets advertising firms achieve new ways of reaching large numbers of people with a relatively low cost, effective means and lets the drone robots do the work in an automated manner.   Smart drone robots can be preprogrammed to do skywriting. They use automated process leveraging integrated circuit technology to make words in the sky. Every industry more productive with better, more flexible visualization.   Smart drone commercial uses provide the prospect of trillions of dollars in economic growth. Smart commercial drones connect seamlessly and securely to the Internet and to each other. Smart commercial drone aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has reached a level of maturity that has put these systems at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. Procurement in every industry and around the entire world is adapting to drone availability. Drone advertising use cases are evolving rapidly. Banner pulling and skywriting are offered.   As U.S. regulators open up the skies to commercial drones by late 2016, fantastic growth will occur, accompanied by tremendous job growth. The fact that job growth will be achieved is enough to drive regulators in the US to ease constraints on drone use. There is incentive for the government to establish reasonable highways in the sky that are enforceable and useful to people.   Worldwide, drones are accepted as grownup toys, flying cameras useful for adding a perspective to life, to filming every event, every outing. Drones are achieving acceptance in a variety of advertising applications indoors. The ability to fly a preprogrammed route makes them useful in a confined space. Drone robot markets are leveraging robotic platforms in every industry.   Intel RealSense technology can be used in a variety of innovative applications.

This platform will replace the Intel X99 boards using the LGA 2011 socket that debuted back in August 2014 and is expected to to have a lifespan of the same length. This is going to be an important release for Intel due to the recent pressure AMD put on them with the Ryzen 7 (8-core/16-thread) processor release and rumored Ryzen 9 (12-core/24-thread) processors that are expected to debut later this year. The Intel X299 platform will bring the new LGA 2066 socket to market for Skylake-X processors and Kaby Lake-X processors lunch. The upcoming Intel Skylake-X processor series is expected to have 6, 8, and 10-core parts with 140W TDPs. We’ve heard rumors of a 12-core Skylake-X processor, but it appears that might be launching at a later date with most insiders saying August 2017. Intel isn’t going to release Skylake-X processors and call that good enough though. It also appears that Intel will be releasing the Kaby Lake-X quad-core processor series for those that just need a quad-core solution with 112W TDPs around the same time. Intel X299 (Basin Falls) Chipset Overview – Image Credit Benchlife Since IDF 2017 was recently canceled, we expect that Intel will be showing off the new HEDT platform at Computex 2017 in Taiwan as all the Taiwan-based board makers will be there and can show off their flashy new high-end Intel X299 chipset powered boards. Computex 2017 will begin on Tuesday, May 30th and is one of the largest computer trade shows in the world that takes place for five days. We can see Intel Skylake-X and X299 being the headline for high-end desktops at Computex 2017. The folks over at WCCFTech have reported that the X299 platform will be announced on May 30th, reviewers will be able to publish reviews on June 16th and then customers will be able to buy retail products on June 26th. In other news there are also rumors of Intel moving up the launch of its 14nm Coffee Lake processors into August 2017 rather than holding them until January 2018 due to increased competition from AMD Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 processors. That means we’ll have Intel Z370 chipset based boards coming in August along with new Core i3, i5, i7 processors and of course a handful of new unlocked K-Skus for overclockers and enthusiasts. Thank you AMD for the increased competition as it appears to have woken up Intel and got the fire lit again! Competition is good!

Subscribe About RSS Brought to you by Transition Tech Defense Acquisition Watch Listen Attend Community SPONSORED CONTENT tech How tech convergence will drive IT transformation in government Share Written by FedScoop Staff Apr 26, 2017 | FedScoop This podcast and article were produced by FedScoop for, and sponsored by, Dell EMC Federal and Intel Federal. The economics of IT-as-a-service, and the new generation of business models they’ve enabled, are bringing a fresh wave of opportunities to government to transform their enterprise IT operations, according to top technologists at two of the world’s leading technology firms. Cameron Chehreh, chief operating officer and chief technology officer at Dell EMC Federal, and Steve Orrin, chief technologist at Intel Federal, both voiced optimism that federal agencies have never been in a better position to take advantage of advances in enterprise IT architecture and applications to transform their digital operations. The advent of software-defined networking, new data and infrastructure services, along with applications that can handle large volumes of data in dedicated data centers and in the cloud, have dramatically reduced enterprise IT costs, the executives said in an exclusive FedScoop podcast on government IT transformation. Dell EMC’s Chehreh said the economics of as-a-service investments have become more efficient for government. Those models, along with the evolution of agile development practices, can help agencies significantly improve and transform the type of digital services they offer to the public. “As-a-service doesn’t just apply to cloud-based offerings now,” he adds. “These ‘as-a-service’ models are becoming the norm for buying enterprise IT. Along with the economics of these technologies dropping as far as cost, it really is a brilliant opportunity for the government,” he said. “At the core is this concept that data is key and that data is going to drive this evolution,” Orrin says. “So being able to invest in these key transformative capabilities – to drive access to the data, to create those new business models, to create those new services, to take advantage of the application logic and the data stored throughout the enterprise…is really going to be the game changer here.” That’s one reason why agencies should look at investing in agile IT infrastructure sooner than later, even as budget constraints tend to prolong the decision to move off legacy systems. Another reason, says Orrin, is the degree to which “security is being baked in from the hardware up. And so now, security doesn’t have to be an impediment to innovation.” Chehreh contends that contrary to the perception that government agencies are lagging behind the private sector in adopting available enterprise technologies, federal agencies are more on par with the commercial sector than is commonly thought. “There are a lot of great pockets of transformation occurring,” he says, pointing to the Federal Communications Commission as an example of an agency that has successful migrated to an agile enterprise IT environment. Asked what IT developments they and their organizations see on the horizon that are driving their companies’ investment strategies, both technologists pointed to an intensified focus on security by design, and security as a key enabler to enterprise transformation. Orrin says another development that’s driving innovation forward is “access to advanced telemetry, so that you can have applications and data and systems auto-tuned to the environment and the infrastructure.” “That leads to a new data center model we’re seeing around disaggregated computing capability – being able to spread out your application workloads across multiple compute and virtual nodes to take full advantage of your data center,” he says. “Converged, and hyper-converged technologies, are going to be great focal areas for us,” at Dell EMC, says Chehreh. “And then really driving into the software-defined space in the enterprise.” “The last piece for us is all about the software, and taking transformational technologies, like a Pivotal Cloud Foundry, to build these 4th generation, next industrial revolution-based applications.” Find out more about how IT transformation is helping agencies get the right foundation for better mission outcomes. -In this Story- Cameron Chehreh, Dell EMC, Intel, Sponsored Content, Steve Orrin Related news Defense Air Force launches bug... by FedScoop Staff • 11 hours ago Defense Box receives DOD Level 4... by Billy Mitchell • 12 hours ago Tech Agencies look to digital... by Samantha Ehlinger • 13 hours ago About Sponsor RSS © 2017 Scoop News Group | All Rights Reserved Search for: The best federal IT news, delivered straight to your inbox.

Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe said it filed the suit April 14 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The suit is focused on the CM700, a DOCSIS 3.0-certified modem that uses the Intel Corp. Puma 6 chipset that can bond up to 32 downstream channels and up to eight upstream channels.   In response, a Netgear official said it’s the company’s policy to not provide public comment on pending litigation, “but for the sake of our customers, we would like them to know that we have full confidence in the CM700 cable modem.” The suit against Netgear shares similarities with another class action filed against Arris that centers on the SURFboard SB6190, a D3.0 modem that also uses Intel silicon. Arris declined comment on the suit, but announced last year it was working with Intel on a firmware fix. RELATED: Arris Faces Lawsuit Targeting DOCSIS 3.0 Modem "Netgear and other cable modem manufacturers shipping modems with the defect should recall the affected models and issue refunds,” Noah Schubert, a partner at Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe, said in a statement. The firm said it is also investigating whether other cable modems containing the Puma 6 chipset, including modems from Linksys, Cisco, Hitron, and Arris, also suffer from the same alleged network latency defect. In the Netgear suit, the firm claims that the problem stems from Netgear’s decision to swap out Broadcom silicon with Intel’s Puma 6. Want to read more stories like this?

Expert buying advice on Intel's sixth- and seventh-generation CPUs By Jim Martin | 26 Apr 17 Specifications Intel 7th Generation processors are available for laptops and desktop PCs Price when reviewed Price depends upon model, Price depends upon model Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Price comparision from , and manufacturers Kaby Lake vs Skylake When Intel announced Kaby Lake, it quickly became obvious that the traditional tick-tock update cycle was at an end. Kaby Lake is essentially just a ‘tuned’ version of Skylake, but it does bring some important new features with it. For the unfamiliar, Intel used to operate on a tick-tock schedule which meant that it would (on a tick) introduce a new processor which had a new design (manufacturing process). Then, the next processor range (the tock) would improve and optimise the same architecture to offer better performance. Kaby Lake is the effectively the second ‘tock’, improving upon Skylake which was already a ‘tock’ following Broadwell (the tick). Broadwell was Intel’s fifth-generation of Core processors, but for various reasons never really appeared for desktop PCs, only laptops and laptop/tablet hybrids. Amazingly, Intel is planning another optimisation of the 14nm architecture, and 'Coffee Lake' is expected to arrive at the end of the year alongside 10nm Cannonlake. Although we now know that this kind of extended cycle will be the norm in the future, it’s all rather besides the point of why you’re here, which is to find out the differences between Skylake and Kaby Lake. Don't limit your choice to Intel, though. AMD's Ryzen processors offer a compelling alternative these days. What are the new features in Kaby Lake? So we’ve established that the seventh-generation Intel Core processors are fundamentally just optimised sixth-generation chips. For desktop PCs, they both use the same LGA 1151 socket and you can therefore drop a Kaby Lake processor into a motherboard that was running a Skylake chip (and use the same CPU cooler). However, because Kaby Lake has a few new features, this is generally not a good idea since you’ll miss out as the 100-series chipset doesn’t support them. (And if you do go down that route, then be sure to update your motherboard’s BIOS before you swap chips.) 4K video First, Kaby Lake has an upgraded graphics chip which supports encoding and decoding HEVC. This is the latest video codec which is designed for 4K video and it means a Kaby Lake chip will let you watch Netflix, Amazon or any other 4K video in HEVC format without sweating. It also supports VP9 decoding, which is Google’s codec designed to compete with HEVC. Since the GPU is handling the load here, the CPU cores can be put to use for other things, so your PC won’t grind to a halt while you watch. Also, Kaby Lake supports HDCP 2.2 which, put simply, is the copy protection used for 4K video and you’ll need it to hook up a compatible monitor and watch copy-protected UHD content. It’s a real boon for laptops, since native support for HEVC and VP9 means the processor doesn’t have to work as hard as a Skylake chip would – it would have to use its CPU cores to decode the video – and therefore battery life should be longer when watching 4K video. Intel says that it can be up to 260 percent better, in fact. Optane Second is support for Intel’s new Optane Memory. This is like an NVMe SSD – but faster - and sits in the same M.2 slot on the motherboard. But it’s only compatible with the Z270 chipset, which requires a Kaby Lake CPU (you can run a Skylake processor in a Z270 board but you won’t be able to use Optane Memory). Performance Third, Kaby Lake chips perform better than Skylake. Not by a great deal, but there is a slight improvement. Base clock speeds are higher compared to the equivalent Skylake processor, and it’s the same for Turbo Boost frequencies. Although you’d have to use benchmark tools to notice the difference for most applications, you should have no trouble detecting the improvement in 3D graphics power, at least for the mobile chips. The Kaby Lake U-series processors (we’ll come to them later) have Intel Iris Plus graphics which promise up to 65 percent better performance than the GPU in equivalent Skylake chips. Sadly, in the desktop chips, the Intel HD Graphics 630 GPU is largely identical to the 530 found in Skylake. The only real upgrade here is the HEVC and VP9 support. PCIe lanes Skylake processors have 20 lanes of communication to the PCH (Platform Controller Hub) but Kaby Lake adds an extra four. With the 16 PCIe lanes on the processor itself, a Kaby Lake system can have 40 PCIe lanes. USB and Thunderbolt These extra lanes are important particularly as PCIe is now being used for storage as SATA speeds become too limiting. Kaby Lake also supports the latest version of USB-C (USB 3.1 Gen 2), which means speeds of up to 10Gb/s rather than 5Gb/s with Skylake. Again, that’s native support without needing a separate controller or add-in card on the motherboard. Similarly, there’s native support for Thunderbolt 3.0. Kaby Lake systems can have up to 14 USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports and three PCIe 3.0 storage slots. You can spend up to £550 on a Z270 motherboard such as Asus Maximus IX Extreme, although most are considerably cheaper. Ultra-low-power Kaby Lake-Y One confusing aspect is that Intel has rebranded the ultra-low-power Kaby Lake chips, which you’d imagine would be called Core m as they were with Skylake, to Core i3, i5 and i7. These so-called Y-series chips have a TDP of just 4.5W and offer much, much less performance than their U-series counterparts. They tend to be used in thin and light hybrids such as the Dell XPS 2-in-1 but the ‘Core i’ branding can fool you into thinking you’re getting the same chip as in the XPS 13 laptop. So watch out for that. Which is better, Kaby Lake or Skylake? Clearly, given a choice of two PCs or laptops at the same price – one with a Skylake CPU and one with Kaby Lake – you’d choose the Kaby Lake machine. For laptops with integrated graphics, you’ll see better performance from a Kaby Lake chip thanks to the Iris Plus GPU and also better performance and battery life when watching 4K Netflix. Indeed, a Skylake-based laptop may not even have the raw CPU power to play 4K video. Then again, not many laptops have 4K screens. Intel Kaby Lake: Specs Intel 7th Generation processors are available for laptops and desktop PCs Intel 7th Generation processors are available for laptops and desktop PCs OUR VERDICT If you already have a PC with a sixth-gen Skylake processor, there’s no point upgrading it to Kaby Lake. You’ll miss out on most of the new features and you won’t notice the increase in performance unless you’re moving from a bottom of the range i5 to, say, the Core i7-7700K. If you have an older PC with an Ivy Bridge (third-generation) or Haswell (fourth-generation) processor, then it could be time to upgrade – unless it was the top-of-the-range Core i7, in which case you might not notice much of a performance boost. However, things are more complicated now that AMD has released Ryzen. The top models have eight cores and 16 threads, and have proven themselves not only faster than Intel’s current best (the i7-7700K) in many CPU-based benchmarks, but they’re also great value too. You can’t buy a laptop with a Ryzen processor yet – they’re due in the second half of this year – but there are plenty of Ryzen-based PCs now available and they’re arguably a better buy than Kaby Lake.

Microsoft has published a knowledge base article that gives an insight into how its flagship operating system is evolving. The note, which relates to an unsupported processor error, outlines a change in policy for Windows. Microsoft said Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 will no longer run on seventh-generation processors from Intel and AMD, such as Intel’s Kaby Lake and AMD’s Bristol Ridge series of chips.

What this means, according to analyst Gartner, is that PCs with Intel’s Kaby Lake processor will not support any OS before Windows 10. “This makes Windows 10 the definitive release and unavoidable for any company working with Windows-based devices,” it said. Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, said: “Organisations recognise the need to move to Windows 10.” Gartner’s latest survey on Windows adoption found that the total time to evaluate and deploy Windows 10 had shortened from 23 months to 21 months. Atwal added: “Large businesses are either already engaged in Windows 10 upgrades or have delayed upgrading until 2018. This likely reflects the transition of legacy applications to Windows 10 or replacing those legacy applications before Windows 10 migration takes place.” The survey reported that, on average, companies are planning to migrate at least 30% of their PC installed base to new PCs on Windows in 2017. While the hardware restriction will lead to people upgrading, Gartner’s survey also found that security was a main driver to move to Windows 10. It reported that 49% of respondents said that security improvements were the main reason for the migration. The second most popular reason for Windows 10 deployment was cloud integration capabilities (38%). Among the organisations surveyed, Gartner found that Microsoft Hello was the highest-ranked capability enticing users to move to Windows 10. It suggested that the integration of Active Directory and Azure was stimulating Windows 10 upgrades. “Windows 10 will remove the duplication of authentication and applications, and smooth the path between different applications,” Gartner noted. .............................................................................................................................................

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Tablet Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 Update Gets Bugs Fixed and Quality Changes By Costea Lestoc. Published on April 26, 2017. 0 Users of the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book have received another update from Microsoft for their devices. The recent one is quite similar to updates in the past few weeks, not because of the content of the updates themselves but because they are only for the Creators Update of Windows 10 According to reports from Microsoft, one of the changes in the recent patch adds new updates for the driver, which will hopefully improve the quality of video playbacks. Updates for the Surface Book Cortana seems to have received an increase in the quality of her speech recognition capabilities.  Surface Book has received driver updates for its Intel(R) Smart Sound Technology (Intel(R) SST) OED, Realtek High Definition Audio(SST), and the Intel(R) Smart Sound Technology (Intel(R) SST) Audio Controller. One of the main changes for this update is that it is going to increase the quality of video playbacks on your installed applications when the device is offline. The updates for the Surface Book can be downloaded in both Zip and MSI formats from the official Drivers and Firmware website available in Microsoft’s Download Center. Updates for the Surface Pro 4 Similar update for the Surface Pro 4 as is with the Surface book, the Intel(R) Smart Sound Technology (Intel(R) SST) OED and the Intel(R) Smart Sound Technology (Intel(R) SST) Audio Controller have received new driver updates that will aim to increase playback quality on applications when offline. The Surface Pro 4 updates are also available for download on Microsoft’s Download Center in both of the aforementioned formats. A thing to note about these driver releases is the fact that they are only useable for the Creators Update for Windows 10.

Ryzen and Intel 7th-gen processors are priced at similar levels, while they have different strengths. AMD’s Ryzen processors boast an increased number of cores and superior multi-threaded performance, but fall short of Intel’s quad-core processors in terms of IPC and single-thread performance. Due to their similar pricing and specifications, consumers can confidently decide to purchase either a Ryzen or Kaby Lake chip, depending on their individual use cases and choice of chipset. With Ryzen CPUs in the local market for a few weeks now, MyBroadband spoke to South African hardware retailer Wootware about the popularity of AMD’s new processors in South Africa. Ryzen’s popularity Wootware’s Rory Magee said AMD’s Ryzen 7 1700 octa-core processor is the most popular Ryzen desktop processor among local consumers. “Of the Ryzen 7 CPUs, the Ryzen 7 1700 has been the most popular by a fair margin, and this also seems to be the case internationally,” said Magee. Magee said the six-core Ryzen 5 1600 could quickly overtake the Ryzen 7 1700 in South Africa, though, due to its attractive value. “The Ryzen 5 1600 looks like a strong contender to become AMD’s new most-popular CPU, given that it represents a compelling price-to-performance ratio, features six physical cores, and includes AMD’s Wraith Cooler,” he said. Magee added that the popularity of AMD’s Ryzen processors has been steadily increasing in South Africa, chipping away at the market share of Intel’s 6th and 7th-gen processors. “There’s been a significant uptake of AMD’s Ryzen platform and processors, and that’s just accounting for the Ryzen 7 range without taking the newly-released Ryzen 5 range into account,” said Magee. “It seems likely that AMD will be taking a significant double-digit percentage share of new desktop CPU sales.” Now read: Biostar unveils world’s first mini-ITX Ryzen motherboards Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 7th generation AMD desktop processors Headline Intel Kaby Lake Ryzen Wootware Share your thoughts: AMD catching up to Intel in South Africa Latest news Build your own network-attached storage at home Twitter to show all-day live sports and news AMD catching up to Intel in South Africa Partner Content No fooling with Telkom’s Big Deal in April Don’t call it a comeback Get dangerous with the new Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 Trailer Show comments Join the conversation Autoload comments Comments section policy: Any attacks on MyBroadband, its journalists, or other readers will result in a ban.

If you’re a gamer, though, you’ll want to watch out for the list of winners, because some great creations have come out of this competition. The Intel Level Up Game Developer Contest has a rich history going back a decade, starting in 2007 as an engineering-driven contest centered around a programming challenge. In recent years, though, Intel decided to use Level Up to see what kind of entertainment game developers could create. Intel has also added a lot to the Level Up contest, such as bringing in sponsoring companies (including Epic/Unreal, Green Man Gaming, Razer, and Unity), and calling on industry luminaries (such as Tim Schafer, Founder of Double Fine Productions; and Chris Avellone, former Creative Director/Chief Creative Officer/Co-Owner of Obsidian Entertainment) to judge the entrants. The inclusion of industry businesses and veteran game artisans raised the contest’s visibility and prestige. Above: Tim Schafer, Double Fine Productions Image Credit: Double Fine Productions “I love seeing all the games — some from indies I am very familiar with, and some from new voices with crazy ideas,” Schafer says. “I hope to see ideas that are truly new every year — game mechanics I’ve never seen, fresh artistic visions. The enthusiasm and creativity are incredibly inspiring to me.” However, the most important addition — certainly to the entrants — was the introduction of valuable prize packages. This year, the Game of the Year grand prize winner will receive a $5,000 cash prize; an agency-driven digital marketing campaign valued at $12,000; and an offer of a distribution contract with Green Man Gaming. With winners receiving rewards of this scale, it’s no surprise that last year’s contest inspired 331 total submissions from 28 countries around the globe — a nearly 50 percent increase over the year before. From the podium The 2016 Game of the Year and Best Action Game went to Ellipsis, a speedy “avoid-’em-up” game from Munich, Germany-based Salmi Games. For winning those two categories, Salmi Games received $8000 in cash, a marketing campaign, and a Razer laptop. Yacine Salmi, the studio’s CEO/founder, also indicates that the contest “opened up many doors for us.” “It was an incredible moment for us,” Salmi says. “We really didn’t expect to win. At that point, we had been selected for a few showcases and won some smaller prizes, but nothing on the scale of the Intel Level Up competition. It’s an unbelievable honor, especially given the quality of the other games in the competition.” Another winner from 2016 was Pocketwatch Games’ Tooth and Tail, a real-time strategy game that won for Best Character Design. Andy Nguyen, producer/designer at Pocketwatch, said that the studio won $3000 in cash and a Razer laptop. “Intel Level Up has been one of the most beneficial and helpful awards contests for Tooth and Tail,” Nguyen says. “Intel has been a great friend to Pocketwatch for years. They understand indie development and have consistently gone out of their way to help the small guys. Intel’s support team is always quick to help us in a pinch.” Changes for the better The indie game-development community is rapidly growing, not least of which because computer systems in 2017 are very powerful, and getting the high-quality tools that are needed to construct a game is so much easier these days. When you look at a new game, you can’t tell if the title was built by a large team working at a major studio in a physical office space; or a handful of programmers and artists, all working out of their respective homes and collaborating over the Internet. The Intel Level Up Game Developer Contest is providing a valuable showcase to some of these up-and-comers, and in some cases, helping them with resources and networking that’ll better enable them make the best game they can. Do you think you have what it takes for your game to be among the best in 2017? The only way to find out for sure is to head over to the Intel Level Up Game Developer Contest page and submit your entry. Perhaps you’ll find that you’re the next Salmi Games or Pocketwatch Games.

Optane is Intel's branded non-volatile 3D XPoint memory, which has lower latency access and higher endurance than NAND. Earlier this month we saw reviews of the standalone 375GB P4800X Optane SSD, like one from PC Perspective which were based on remote access to an Optane SSD system in Intel's facilities, a server featuring a P4800X and a P3700 SSD for comparison. The PC Perspective reviewer notes: "It is worth pointing out that this testing method is not ideal and is not something we would have recommend or suggested to Intel." The Anandtech P4800X review said: "3D XPoint memory has better endurance than NAND flash, but not enough to get away without wear levelling." Interestingly the reviewer found: "3D XPoint memory does not have large multi-megabyte erase blocks, so a low-level format of the Optane SSD needs to directly write to the entire drive, which takes about as long as filling it sequentially. Thus, while a 2.4TB flash SSD can perform a low-level format in just over 13 seconds, the 375GB Optane SSD DC P4800X takes six minutes and 47 seconds. This is long enough that unsuspecting software tools or SSD reviewers will give up and assume that the drive has locked up." The review points out that, "With limited capacity but the highest level of performance, this Optane SSD most closely fits the role of SLC NAND based SSDs," and says it's a fit for users needing consistently low latency, particularly with low queue depths. The endurance is not that great; "In terms of total petabytes written, the P4800X only has four-fifths the endurance of the SLC-based Micron P320h." Prices for the P4800X look to be around $1,520, about $4/GB, more expensive than NAND GBs, but it's not yet available from etailers. Anandtech's review concludes: "If your workload matches its strengths, the P4800X offers performance that cannot currently be provided by any other storage product. This means high throughput random access, as well as very strict latency requirements - the results Optane achieves for it's quality of service for latency on both reads and writes, especially in heavy environments with a mixed read/write workload, is a significant margin ahead of anything available on the market." But ... The Optane SSD is ultimately an expensive niche product. If you don't need high throughput random access with the strictest latency requirements, the Optane SSD DC P4800X may not be the best choice. It is very expensive compared to most flash-based SSDs. It is a version one product and can be expected to improve as well as having more detailed information about its power consumption become available. M.2 format Optane Reviews such as those of PC Gamer and Ars Technica look at Intel's 16GB and 32GB Optane M.2 memory sticks and talk of $44 (16GB) and $77 (32GB) prices – more expensive than similar capacity NAND, less than similar capacity DRAM. Such Optane memory is supported by Kaby Lake 200 series chipsets with Kaby Lake (7th generation Core) CPUs, as a cache for use in accelerating local disk drives; it is not a standalone SSD. The XPoint and disk form a single volume and data accessed via the cache has a dramatically lower latency than if it were accessed from disk, once the cache is loaded. The reviewers were generally unable to do comparative tests of a similar function and cheaper NAND cache and disk, because the Kaby Lake B250 chipset used didn't support it. Although a comparison between a Samsung SSD and the Optane cache + HDD combo showed that the SSD was faster and more consistent, as it did not slow down whenever the cache had to be reloaded. The Optane works as a write-back cache, with writes being cached in the Optane drive before being written, more slowly, to the paired disk drive. Once Windows disk blocks were in the cache a Windows reboot took 20 seconds instead of the 56 seconds needed with a reboot from a 7,200rpm disk. The reviewer said: "Random reads with short queue depths—the perfect workload for a cache drive—are clearly a strength of Optane relative to flash." But a reboot from a Samsung 960 EVO SSD also took 20 seconds. The reviewer's price thinking was revealing: The 32GB Optane costs $77. The WD Black hard disk is $73 from Amazon right now. That's $150 in total. For $139, Amazon is selling a 250GB Samsung 960 EVO. Clearly, 250GB is not as big as 1TB. If you really need the space but you're really on a tight budget, maybe the hybrid is the way to go. But if 250GB is enough for your needs, the plain SSD is the better bet. To be more explicit: "The 250GB SSD is going to provide a better experience (because it's always fast, rather than only sometimes fast), and it's going to do it at a lower cost." Anandtech's reviewer cannot say that an XPoint-disk hybrid combo will be faster than a NAND-disk hybrid combo and suspects that it's not. The conclusion is that users will be better off using a full SSD rather than an Optane XPoint cache-spinning disk hybrid. ® Tips and corrections 12 Comments MORE Intel Xpoint Optane More from The Register Intel touts bug bounties to hardware hackers Website and Intel Security (McAfee) products excluded from 'Wild West' payouts scheme 2 Comments Intel reveals Optane will need a 7th-gen core and a PC-centric launch You're going to need a whole lot of Intel Inside to make this work 16 Comments Intel redesigns flawed Atom CPUs to stave off premature chip death Faulty LPC clock bus timed out Intel loses its Lustre – Chipzilla bins own-brand HPC file system Between killing an OpenStack research team and killing IDF, we see a pattern here 15 Comments OpenStack: Pleeeeease stop panicking, Intel and Rackspace still love us Also, er, yeah, Chipzilla pulled the plug on that big project 6 Comments Regular or premium?

It seems now that Coffee Lake is alive as well. Intel Coffee results (well assumed Coffee lake SKUs) have shown up in the SiSoft Sandra Results database as wccftech spotted. The procs spotted ate embedded 4-core units and 6-core desktop parts. It is unclear when Intel will release Coffee Lake though as first the Sky and kaby Lake X procs will be released. Coffee Lake would be released together with the Z370 / H370 chipsets and logic assumes a release later this year in the Q4 region. Intel 300 series desktop processor motherboard would be based on the current LGA 1151 socket, and since the SiSoft results shows a Kaby lake Client Platform entry, it could very well be compatible with Socket 1151 motherboards. Earlier rumours stated that the 300 Series chipset's Coffee Lake-S processor will provide 6 Cores 12 threaded CPUS, which is Intel's first in the mainstream platform to enhance the number of processors and threads.  The 6-core part spotted in the Sandra data-base does not seem to have Hyper-threading enabled indicative of a Core i5 version, it’s clocked at a 3.5 GHz base clock frequency. There’s no mention of the Turbo clock frequency. The chip features 1.5 MB of L2 cache (6 x 256 KB) and 9 MB of L3 cache. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ...

They show a larger spread in performance. This is just a relevant as you comparing Broadwell to Coffee Lake. Also who is to say the bench run with the Coffee lake i5 is accurate the bench may not be utilizing the new CPU correctly for all we know. Best to wait till we see these chips in the wild.

It's also way faster with smaller transfers - good for certain database workloads. http://images.anandtech.com/doci/112...size-sweep.png Quote: If your workload matches its strengths, the P4800X offers performance that cannot currently be provided by any other storage product. This means high throughput random access, as well as very strict latency requirements - the results Optane achieves for it's quality of service for latency on both reads and writes, especially in heavy environments with a mixed read/write workload, is a significant margin ahead of anything available on the market. At 50/50 reads/writes, latency QoS for the DC P4800X is 30x better than the competition http://www.anandtech.com/show/11209/...-performance/8 Not to mention that it's roughly 3x longer endurance. But yeah, its like you said, there is a market for Optane its just not one that any of us care about. Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

In a market that’s seen an explosion in the number of 2 in 1 notebook/tablet hybrids, the Yoga Book really stands out. The concept is incredible. You can use it as a notebook and type on it, you can draw on it with a stylus, you can transfer written notes into text. And it’s tiny, with a 10.1″ screen, it weighs in at 690 grams and is less than 1cm thick! While the concept sounds amazing.. and it really is.. there are some caveats to consider when evaluating the Yoga Book. Read on to find out.   While the market has its fair share of notebook class 2 in 1’s, there’s next to nothing in the way of hybrids in the 10″ range. Lenovo has seen there is a real market here with this size and weight class being too large for smartphones and too small and thin for a relatively higher TDP processor. Enter the Lenovo Yoga Book. The first thing you notice when opening the beautifully crafted metal body is the lack of a keyboard. It’s also powered by an Intel Atom CPU, so it gives away some performance, but from this it gains very good battery life. We have an array of creativity based features such as a fully featured graphics tablet, stylus and handwriting to text functionality. Design At first glance, there’s no doubt the Lenovo Yoga Book is simply gorgeous. The Yoga Book comes with an all metal construction. Our sample came finished with a beautiful gunmetal grey which really does give a refined and classy look to the unit. Champagne gold and carbon black finishes are also available. Obviously it’s a 2 in 1 that can function as a tablet, in tent mode and of course as a laptop. Picture courtesy of Lenovo The screen is a 10.1″ 1920 x 1200 IPS panel. This means any 1080p content will have small black bars at the top and bottom, though in our opinion, the extra screen real estate more than makes up for that. Lenovo’s specs indicate the screen is capable of 70% of the color gamut, though it doesn’t say which one. While the screen appears to be perfectly acceptable to us in general usage, with typical IPS wide viewing angles, a high pixel density and enjoyable movie viewing, 70% is quite a low number and is something that should be considered a negative for artists and professionals who rely on color accuracy for their work. Given the target market for the device, we think this is something that needs to be improved if/when there is a Yoga Book 2. The speakers are surprisingly adequate. A thin and light device often compromises on sound, and while the speakers in the Yoga Book won’t win any sounds pressure contests or reproduce bass you can feel, they do a good job without too much brightness in the midrange which often plagues cheaper speakers. If you’re playing a movie in bed at night in tablet mode, the speakers will do the job. The Yoga Book comes with Lenovo’s excellent watchband hinge. The company has somehow managed to bring aesthetics and functionality to an otherwise overlooked aspect of notebook design. Many Lenovo models use this hinge including its premium lines so clearly the engineers have done a good job. Specifications The Yoga Book comes with the choice of either Android 6.0.1 (as our sample came equipped with) or Windows 10. Which one you choose will depend on your usage patterns. Both models are currently priced at $899 SGD. Other markets appear to have the Windows 10 version priced higher making the Singapore pricing quite good value at this time. The CPU powering the Yoga Book is a Intel Atom x5-Z8550 SoC. This is a Cherry Trail CPU that we’ll come right out and say is pretty average at best, with several ARM SoC’s beating the Atom handily. In fact Intel have struggled so much competing against ARM in the mobile SoC space that they have pulled the plug on the planned next generation Broxton range. Don’t bet against a Yoga Book 2 being powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 with 802.11ad wi-fi and Bluetooth 5, running Windows 10 and therefore all the desktop class apps.. That sounds tasty..but we digress.. The I/O ports are very limited indeed. You get a single outdated Micro-b USB port for charging, single Type-D micro HDMI port, a headphone jack and slot for a micro SD and/or nano SIM card (which was absent from our test model). There’s also a power button and volume up/down button. Micro USB really should disappear in favor of USB Type-C. Ideally we want to see 2+ ports which would allow the unit to charge and have another USB device fitted at the same time. Right now with the Micro USB you’ll need an adapter to use pretty much any USB device at all. Other key features include 8 and 2 megapixel rear and front facing cameras, 4Gb of memory and 64Gb of onboard eMMC storage.   The Real Pen and Create Pad The Real Pen is a dual use stylus/pen accessory bundled with the Yoga Book. Impressively, it doesn’t require batteries. You can use it as a conductive pen or as an actual pen with ink. You can remove the stylus nib and replace it with real ink to use for the handwriting feature. Lenovo calls the bottom half of the Yoga Book, the ‘Create Pad’. This works in one of three ways. The first is the form of a graphics digitizer that works with the Real Pen. It is a full-blown, electromagnetic resonance (EMR) tablet, designed in partnership with Wacom, who know a thing or two about tablets. The second use allows the Yoga Book to take digital copies of hand created content at up to 1cm above its surface, such as you would have while writing on a notepad. It does not require special paper. First you must switch the stylus’ plastic nib to one of the included ink based nibs. The stylus and tablet interact via a electromagnetic field so the tablet knows where the pen is relative to the pad. At the same time the stylus provides a signal to let the computer know when it is being pressed against paper, so, as you write with the stylus, and the content appears on the paper, so too does it appear on the main screen. This is probably the most distinctive capability of the Yoga Book, and could be the device’s ‘killer app’. Students in particular may find this a great feature. The now for the third use: The Keyboard The Yoga Book comes equipped with a fully digital capacitive keyboard. It provides haptic feedback in the form of a buzz when each key is tapped. The keys are fixed cannot be changed. It looks beautiful, almost Star Trekkish and will definitely generate ooh’s and ahh’s from curious onlookers. While consumers generally have become more used to capacitive keyboards in the era of smartphones and tablets, there is a reason we still have physical keyboards. The problem is accuracy or lack thereof. I found myself making a great many typo errors during general usage and had to look at the keyboard more and more. On a regular keyboard with feedback, you can feel if you have made a mistake or hit the edge of an adjacent key. If you are more of a touch typist, you’ll find yourself looking at the screen and discovering your text is full of mistakes. The keyboard also has a problem with latency. If you are a fast typist, you may find the system is not capable of keeping up with you and the unit will be buzzing all the time as keystrokes are registered. The idea is very very cool, but it does need to be refined to better mimic the feel and usability of an actual keyboard. The Yoga Book would be more usable with a dedicated keyboard, and leave the drawing/writing part to the actual screen itself. The OS and Apps As mentioned, The Lenovo Yoga Book comes with a Android 6.0.1 and of course some Lenovo software to power the Yoga Book’s unique features. While it does the job well enough, its just not the same as a refined desktop OS. You notice it with the little things.. resizing windows, switching between tabs, the mouse control. Android still feels like a phone OS. With its intended stylus oriented functions, and general tasks, it does fine though. For the most part, Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow) performs the same as its smartphone cousins. Things like the settings and application menu’s will be very familiar to users of Android phones, as will the swipe operations and general navigability.   In addition to the usual offerings from a Android device, there are links and shortcuts to a whole range of apps; Gmail, Docs, Maps, Drive, Play Store, it’s all there. Of course being a Lenovo product, the company has added it’s own apps to the basic OS. The File Manager is very much like what you’d see in a Windows file explorer. There’s also a couple of introduction apps designed to take first time users on a tour of the features and capabilities of the Yoga Book. These are worth a look for your first time poke around the system. The user manual is there too. Share it is Lenovo’s own cloud sharing solution, though with so much Google on tap, you might as just well use their cloud and sharing services.   Below is the Note Saver app. This app, along with the stylus is what you’d use to create irreplaceable works of art like the one you see below.   Below is a test of the handwriting feature. As mentioned above, inserting one of the ink nibs into the stylus and writing on ordinary paper on the create pad instantly digitizes the written handwriting into the note app. My handwriting is not exactly stunning, but the point was to write this as I would normally write.. fast and messy! This is actually a very accurate example of my handwriting indicating the system and stylus’ EM tracking is highly accurate. A student in a lecture would find this feature quite useful. Picture courtesy of Lenovo   Performance We didn’t spend too much time benchmarking the Yoga Book since we don’t have a lot of comparable hardware to compare with (with Android) In Geekbench 4, the system scores 1159 in the single core test and 3288 in the multi core test. These results really show the weakness of the Atom processor. A Samsung Galaxy S7 with Exynos processor scores 1806 and 5228 respectively. Obviously Lenovo wanted the Windows 10 option so they had little choice but to go with the Intel Atom, however, we hope for the next iteration of Yoga Book, Lenovo will consider a Windows 10/Snapdragon 835 SoC combo which will destroy the Atom in performance.   Battery life was quite excellent. Lenovo claims 13 hours per charge and we did our entire setup and testing on a single charge. Given our usage pattern, we’d estimate around 10 hours from fully charged to flat though your mileage may vary depending on the workload. 13 hours is not beyond the realms of possibility. Conclusion Right now the Yoga Book struggles to define itself. It’s far too under powered to be considered a laptop even with the resource thrifty Android OS. While the Windows version should be better when using the Yoga Book as a laptop, the Atom processor will feel even more sluggish. Android is still a smartphone OS at its heart and its abilities on a productivity oriented device reveal its shortfalls. Multitasking remains an issue with Android.  While you have apps like Photoshop Express and Office, they have their shortfalls compared to their PC brethren. With Windows and a beefier processor you can expect to have a browser with many tabs open, a spreadsheet, word processor, email app, a media player or stream of your sports team going all at the same time. Add Illustrator or Photoshop or a CAD program for a more specialized user and its clear Android just cannot do this yet. Are you an artist or creator? You’ll likely need a screen with better color range. Are you looking for a work machine? You’ll need more CPU grunt. Are you looking for a media consumption device? A cheaper tablet can do that. Do you want something ultra portable? Consider a phablet. It’s aimed at artists and a handwriting niche market but it doesn’t kick goals the way a dedicated graphics tablet would. It is not a bad device though by any means. In trying to be a multi-use jack of all trades, in the end it is a master of none. Still, with a bit more grunt, the right OS (Google Andromeda?) and some tweaks to the keyboard and tablet functions (like using the stylus on the screen), we think a device like the Lenovo Yoga Book can be a real winner. While our time with the Yoga Book was very enjoyable, in the end it felt more like a companion device that was cool to use rather than one we’d consider as our ‘one device for all’ replacement. The concept is amazing, particularly the digitizing of handwritten content feature, which uses normal paper. It’s super light and portable with superb build quality, but we feel the Yoga Book is lacking a suitable OS and killer mass market appeal right now.  Right now it just feels a generation too early for what it is. We very much look forward to what Lenovo and other companies can do with the increasingly prevalent ultra portable 2 in 1 concept going forward. The Lenovo Yoga Book is currently priced at $899 SGD for both the Windows 10 and Android versions.         Pros: Premium design Battery life Ultra light and thin Digital recreations of handwritten content with normal paper Excellent build quality   Cons: Under powered Micro USB port Overall lack of ports Flawed keyboard   James Seaton Post navigation Previous Article Oukitel K6000 Plus Smartphone Review: Unlimited Battery Life Next Article The Meizu m2 Note is a Budget Phone that Appeals to Youths Related Articles NetworkingPeripheralsReviews Budget Wireless-N Router Comparison: EnGenius ESR-9850 vs. TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND CrimsonPisang March 3, 2011 AndroidGoogleNews Press image of the white Nexus 5 leaks, to be launched on November 1 Harish Jonnalagadda October 28, 2013 AndroidNewsSmartphones Sony and Ericsson part ways, remain friends TeamVR October 28, 2011 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Owens Published: Apr 26, 2017 7:20 a.m. ET Share Autonomous-driving tech merger could take until end of the year to close, and Intel must protect its turf from AMD and Nvidia Getty Images Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, is expected to report quarterly revenue of $14.8 billion on Thursday. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Intel Corp. is expected to release quarterly earnings Thursday afternoon, but the biggest change to its results is still months away. Revenue for the world’s largest chip maker has mostly been stuck in neutral for years as sales of personal computers have languished and smartphone makers have largely looked elsewhere for the brains of their devices. After missing the mobile boom, Intel INTC, +0.16%  is making a big-money bet that autonomous-driving technology will be a similar moneymaker with a $15 billion bid for Mobileye NV. MBLY, -0.15%  Along with an investment in German digital-mapping company HERE, Intel is looking to challenge Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.69%  in autonomous-car offerings. Intel’s deal for the Israeli self-driving specialist will take a while to close, however: The companies said when the deal was announced in March that completion could take up to nine months, which would put it close to the end of the year. Intel could provide an update to that wide timeline in Thursday’s conference call. Don’t miss: How Intel will try to avoid another acquisition fail with Mobileye While Intel attempts to build for the future, though, competitors are looking to take a larger chunk of the areas Intel currently dominates. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -0.59%  introduced new PC and gaming chips in the quarter with prices much lower than Intel’s, and shrinking margins in the PC group would suggest that Intel has lowered its prices to compete. A larger battle is shaping up in the server market, where Nvidia has found growing acceptance and AMD is expected to release its newest offering this quarter. Here’s what to expect Revenue: Intel revenue actually increased more than 7% in 2016, the company’s most substantial sales growth since 2011. However, much of that increase was attributable to the $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera Corp., which added a segment for programmable semiconductors to Intel’s revenue that contributed more than $2.1 billion, as well as a healthier-than-expected holiday season for PC sales. For the first quarter of 2017, Intel projects revenue of $14.3 billion to $15.3 billion, which would be an improvement from $13.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet expect on average for Intel to report revenue of $14.8 billion, directly in the middle of its forecast range. Contributors at Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from analysts, fund managers and academics, expect revenue of $14.9 billion. See also: Semiconductor stocks can be long-term winners too Earnings: While revenue gained for Intel in 2016, net income took a hit as the company faced restructuring charges from a massive wave of layoffs a few months after the Altera deal closed. Nearly $1.9 billion in restructuring charges landed on the 2016 balance sheet, with another $400 million or so expected this year. Intel projected earnings of 51 cents a share to 61 cents a share for the first quarter, with adjusted profit of 60 cents to 70 cents a share. The average analyst estimate calls for standard earnings of 57 cents a share, and adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share, according to FactSet. Estimize contributors on average predict adjusted earnings of 67 cents a share. Stock reaction: Intel has suffered in the past three months, falling 2.5% through Tuesday as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.05%  gained 3.9% in the same time. Results are different in the past year, though, as Intel has gained 17.5% in that time while the S&P has increased 14.4%. Intel’s performance following an earnings report has been split of late, with declines in three of the past seven quarters. The drops were much larger than the gains, however: Intel increased 1.1% to 2.4% when it benefited after a report in that time and fell 4% to 9.1% when it declined. What analysts are saying: Intel’s earnings could top expectations because of continued stabilization in PC sales, which represents Intel’s largest revenue source. Intel projected that PC sales would drop 5% in 2017, but first-quarter results tracked by International Data Corp. and Gartner Inc. showed a stronger performance. “We believe Intel could see upside in its PC business driven by better product mix and a slightly better-than-expected PC environment,” Susquehanna Financial Group analysts wrote. Susquehanna has a Positive rating on Intel shares with a $45 price target, tied for the highest on Wall Street, according to FactSet. Related: AMD stock plummets after Goldman Sachs says rally is unsustainable AMD’s Ryzen launch could keep the PC business from outperforming expectations, however, and Susquehanna slightly decreased its projected gross margin for Intel based on expectations of lower average selling prices to compete with AMD. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon also pointed out that year-over-year comparisons need to take into account a shorter quarter this year. “While some investors have gotten more excited about improving (or at least stabilizing) PCs, we note the presence of an extra week in the year-ago quarter,” wrote Rasgon, who has an Underweight rating for Intel and $30 price target, the lowest tracked by FactSet. The recent price spike for memory chips could also help Intel’s profit for the quarter. While the increase in memory prices has hurt the profits of same major tech players, companies that sell memory chips have enjoyed stronger margins, as Micron Technology Inc. MU, -0.74%  showed last month. Intel’s memory business is its fourth-largest segment, with $2.6 billion in 2016 revenue, and is expected to become its third-largest revenue driver in the second quarter, with analyst expectations of $744 million in sales. Overall, analysts believe Intel is a largely predictable tech behemoth at the moment, with little near-term upside until, and unless, the big Mobileye bet pays off.

Canaccord has a Hold rating and $38 price target on Intel stock. FactSet reports that 24 of the 41 analysts covering Intel have the equivalent of a Buy or Overweight rating on Intel stock, while just three give it a Sell or Underweight rating. The average price target is $39.84, reflecting 8.1% upside from Tuesday’s closing price of $36.87. More from MarketWatch Is the free food offer at Walt Disney World really worth it?

See also: Semiconductor stocks can be long-term winners too Earnings: While revenue gained for Intel in 2016, net income took a hit as the company faced restructuring charges from a massive wave of layoffs a few months after the Altera deal closed. Nearly $1.9 billion in restructuring charges landed on the 2016 balance sheet, with another $400 million or so expected this year. Intel projected earnings of 51 cents a share to 61 cents a share for the first quarter, with adjusted profit of 60 cents to 70 cents a share. The average analyst estimate calls for standard earnings of 57 cents a share, and adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share, according to FactSet. Estimize contributors on average predict adjusted earnings of 67 cents a share. Stock reaction: Intel has suffered in the past three months, falling 2.5% through Tuesday as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.05%  gained 3.9% in the same time. Results are different in the past year, though, as Intel has gained 17.5% in that time while the S&P has increased 14.4%. Intel’s performance following an earnings report has been split of late, with declines in three of the past seven quarters. The drops were much larger than the gains, however: Intel increased 1.1% to 2.4% when it benefited after a report in that time and fell 4% to 9.1% when it declined. What analysts are saying: Intel’s earnings could top expectations because of continued stabilization in PC sales, which represents Intel’s largest revenue source. Intel projected that PC sales would drop 5% in 2017, but first-quarter results tracked by International Data Corp. and Gartner Inc. showed a stronger performance. “We believe Intel could see upside in its PC business driven by better product mix and a slightly better-than-expected PC environment,” Susquehanna Financial Group analysts wrote. Susquehanna has a Positive rating on Intel shares with a $45 price target, tied for the highest on Wall Street, according to FactSet. Related: AMD stock plummets after Goldman Sachs says rally is unsustainable AMD’s Ryzen launch could keep the PC business from outperforming expectations, however, and Susquehanna slightly decreased its projected gross margin for Intel based on expectations of lower average selling prices to compete with AMD. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon also pointed out that year-over-year comparisons need to take into account a shorter quarter this year. “While some investors have gotten more excited about improving (or at least stabilizing) PCs, we note the presence of an extra week in the year-ago quarter,” wrote Rasgon, who has an Underweight rating for Intel and $30 price target, the lowest tracked by FactSet. The recent price spike for memory chips could also help Intel’s profit for the quarter. While the increase in memory prices has hurt the profits of same major tech players, companies that sell memory chips have enjoyed stronger margins, as Micron Technology Inc. MU, -0.74%  showed last month. Intel’s memory business is its fourth-largest segment, with $2.6 billion in 2016 revenue, and is expected to become its third-largest revenue driver in the second quarter, with analyst expectations of $744 million in sales. Overall, analysts believe Intel is a largely predictable tech behemoth at the moment, with little near-term upside until, and unless, the big Mobileye bet pays off. Read also: A big chunk of the Dow’s gains have come from earnings “We agree with management’s long-term decision to invest for growth; however, turning a battleship like Intel takes time and we believe other stocks will generate more attractive returns during this period of prolonged transition,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Ramsay recently wrote. Canaccord has a Hold rating and $38 price target on Intel stock. FactSet reports that 24 of the 41 analysts covering Intel have the equivalent of a Buy or Overweight rating on Intel stock, while just three give it a Sell or Underweight rating. The average price target is $39.84, reflecting 8.1% upside from Tuesday’s closing price of $36.87.

Supplier MSI www.msi.com Price $6999 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel 7th Gen Core i7-7820HK (quad-core, HyperThreaded, 3.9GHz Turbo) • 64GB DDR4 2400MHz • 4 x 128GB S SDs in RAID 0 mode • 18.3-inch 1080p 60Hz display Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Raw horsepower that lacks image quality. You know a gaming laptop is going to be rather powerful when it ships with not one, but two power bricks. They’re joined together via a special Y-shaped adaptor which plugs into the rear of this brute of a laptop, suggesting that it sucks down oodles of power. The huge 18.3-inch screen dominates the overall form factor of this beast, but it’s also darned thick, at 69mm at its deepest point. Breaking your back at 5.5kg, it’s not the kind of machine you’ll be taking in your check-in luggage. Obviously it’s this big for a reason, and MSI has absolutely crammed it with cutting edge hardware… for the most part. If there’s one rather strange oversight, it’s the screen. Sure, it apparently covers the full 100% sRGB colour range, though it doesn’t appear as punchy as other IPS screens we’ve seen. However, it’s only 1920 x 1080, with a maximum refresh rate of a mere 60Hz. Seriously? What’s the point in having the incredible horsepower within when you’re limited to such a stock-standard display? It’s possible to plug in up to three external 4K displays, but you’re still going to be stuck looking at a 1080p screen in the middle, and when it’s this big, the pixel structure is rather obvious.  That aside, the rest of the machine is admirable indeed. A SteelSeries keyboard with Cherry MX switches resides right on the edge of the machine, so you don’t need to wrest your hands on a hot palm wrest. There’s also a small touchpad that doubles as a numpad at the tap of a button the right. Given the size of this thing, we expected a decent set of speakers; while they’re rather loud, there is very little bass, so you’ll be needing to use headphones. There’s also another very good reason for using headphones; under full load this thing sounds like a hurricane. It measured 54dB under 4K load (we used Nvidia’s DSR to enable 4K playback on the 1080p screen), which isn’t uncommon on such powerful gaming machines. That doesn’t mean we have to enjoy all that fan-noise though.  Under the hood is arguably the most powerful gaming laptop we’ve yet seen. Obviously Intel’s new 7th Gen Core i7-7820HK does the CPU work, and it’s a beast. With quad HyperThreaded cores, it peaks out at 3.9GHz under load, and has a hefty 8MB cache. With a top TDP it’s no wonder this thing is loud. Memory hogs will love the 64GB of DDR4 2400MHz, but it’s the storage solution that is ridiculously amazing. Four independent PCIe SSDs are tied together in RAID 0 mode, along with a single 1TB hard drive. Yep, you’re going to be the first into the server, every time.  But the real kicker here are the twin GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs running in SLI mode. As the benchmarks show, they obliterate pretty much anything you can throw at it, in any resolution. Unlike previous Nvidia mobile GPUs, these are basically identical to the desktop model, so you’re getting true desktop power in a partially portable design.  Networking is taken care of via Killer’s Killer DoubleShot Pro, which combines Killer’s E2500 Gigabit Ethernet controller and one Killer Wireless-AC 1535 chipset for 802.11ac. There’s also a plethora of USB ports, including a Thunderbolt-enabled USB Type-C port. It might be the world’s most powerful gaming laptop, yet the choice of a low resolution, low refresh rate display is puzzling to say the least. If all you care about is stratospheric frame rates, then it’s a fine solution, but it seems a shame to waste all that horsepower on a HD resolution. Hopefully the next version has a 2560 x 1440, 120Hz panel at the least.  Related Reviews Review: MSI X99A Tomahawk motherboard hits close to the mark Review: MSI Z170A Mpower Gaming Titanium motherboard Review: MSI GTX 1070 Gaming X 8GB MSI X99A Xpower Gaming Titanium Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor If you care about corporate earnings, you should cancel any plans for Thursday. In what will likely be the busiest day of the current earnings season, some of the most prominent and highly valued companies in the world will issue reports Thursday, with the total market capitalization of the companies easily topping $2 trillion and likely approaching $3 trillion. In fact, just the six largest U.S.-based corporations divulging financial performance from the first calendar quarter top $2 trillion in combined market cap, based on Wednesday’s closing prices: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.03% GOOG, -0.07%  , which just became the second $600 billion company in the U.S.; Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.13%  , worth $524.2 billion; Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.18%  , which has jumped more than 21% so far in 2017 for a $434.6 billion market cap; Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +0.78%  , worth $183.9 billion; Intel Corp. INTC, +0.16%  , valued at $174.2 billion; and Abbvie Inc. ABBV, -0.09%  , with a market cap of $103.7 billion. Combined, those companies are worth $2.03 trillion. That list includes three of the four most valuable tech companies, missing only the most valuable, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.59% which plans to report May 2. Apple’s main rival in smartphones will also report Thursday, though it technically arrived Wednesday in the U.S., as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, +2.43%  reported earnings before Korean markets opened, posting its best quarterly profit in more than three years. Samsung isn’t even the only Korean electronics giant planning to release earnings Thursday, as LG Electronics Inc. 066570, -0.55%  plans a report after trading in that country ends. Stateside, Comcast and Abbvie will be joined ahead of the bell by Union Pacific Corp. UNP, -0.28%  , the railroad company worth $89.4 billion, and another pharmaceutical giant, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, -0.32%  , worth $88.6 billion. Two airlines, Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, -0.26%   and American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -0.45%  , will join the party along with KKR & Co. KKR, +1.60%  and Domino’s Pizza Inc. DPZ, +0.20%   After the regular trading session closes, the schedule might be even more packed. Joining tech heavyweights Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Intel is Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +0.98%  , the Seattle-based coffee chain valued at $89.7 billion, and Expedia Inc. EXPE, +0.24% Even smaller tech companies should command interest, like GoPro Inc. GPRO, -0.44%  , the Silicon Valley action-camera company that has struggled through a series of gaffes that helped drive its $14 billion market cap down to just $1.3 billion. MarketWatch will do its best to keep up with all the reports flying around Thursday, so check back for coverage of the results. In the meantime, settle in with some previews of specific reports, in order of market cap: Alphabet earnings: A new approach arrives amid YouTube ad controversy Microsoft earnings: Strength in Office expected to lead to a meet or beat Amazon earnings: Will AWS decelerate again?

Owens Published: Apr 26, 2017 8:10 p.m. ET Share Three of the four most valuable tech companies highlight busiest day of earnings season Getty Images These guys need a few more monitors to follow all of Thursday’s earnings action. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor If you care about corporate earnings, you should cancel any plans for Thursday. In what will likely be the busiest day of the current earnings season, some of the most prominent and highly valued companies in the world will issue reports Thursday, with the total market capitalization of the companies easily topping $2 trillion and likely approaching $3 trillion. In fact, just the six largest U.S.-based corporations divulging financial performance from the first calendar quarter top $2 trillion in combined market cap, based on Wednesday’s closing prices: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.03% GOOG, -0.07%  , which just became the second $600 billion company in the U.S.; Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.13%  , worth $524.2 billion; Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.18%  , which has jumped more than 21% so far in 2017 for a $434.6 billion market cap; Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +0.78%  , worth $183.9 billion; Intel Corp. INTC, +0.16%  , valued at $174.2 billion; and Abbvie Inc. ABBV, -0.09%  , with a market cap of $103.7 billion. Combined, those companies are worth $2.03 trillion. That list includes three of the four most valuable tech companies, missing only the most valuable, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.59% which plans to report May 2. Apple’s main rival in smartphones will also report Thursday, though it technically arrived Wednesday in the U.S., as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, +2.43%  reported earnings before Korean markets opened, posting its best quarterly profit in more than three years. Samsung isn’t even the only Korean electronics giant planning to release earnings Thursday, as LG Electronics Inc. 066570, -0.55%  plans a report after trading in that country ends. Stateside, Comcast and Abbvie will be joined ahead of the bell by Union Pacific Corp. UNP, -0.28%  , the railroad company worth $89.4 billion, and another pharmaceutical giant, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, -0.32%  , worth $88.6 billion. Two airlines, Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, -0.26%   and American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -0.45%  , will join the party along with KKR & Co. KKR, +1.60%  and Domino’s Pizza Inc. DPZ, +0.20%   After the regular trading session closes, the schedule might be even more packed. Joining tech heavyweights Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Intel is Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +0.98%  , the Seattle-based coffee chain valued at $89.7 billion, and Expedia Inc. EXPE, +0.24% Even smaller tech companies should command interest, like GoPro Inc. GPRO, -0.44%  , the Silicon Valley action-camera company that has struggled through a series of gaffes that helped drive its $14 billion market cap down to just $1.3 billion. MarketWatch will do its best to keep up with all the reports flying around Thursday, so check back for coverage of the results.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Intel announces second-generation Visual Compute Accelerator Intel announces second-generation Visual Compute Accelerator Paul Taylor 8 hours ago Channel, Server During the NAB 2017 event, Intel has announced a spruced-up Visual Computer Accelerator, the second of its kind, to take video-crunching to the cloud. With HD and UHD Video workloads in mind, the Visual Compute Accelerator 2  (VCA 2) has been designed with the purpose of creating smooth real-time UHD transcoding, live UHD VR experiences and reduce overall video footprint. While it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, this is not a graphics card. Intel has equipped this single board computer with three Xeon E3 v5 processors (i.e. Skylake), containing P580 Iris Pro Graphics. The CPUs themselves operate at 3 GHz (3.7 GHz boost), and the board takes SO-DIMMs (2 channels per CPU, up to 64GB DDR4 per CPU). Power consumption figures were not disclosed, nor how the device is powered, but we estimate somewhere around the 200W mark. A single card also soaks up a full 16 lanes on a PCIe 3.0 bus, so the hardware really requires a high-end platform to be installed in. This being said, the VCA 2 will not be sold to the general public, but rather be integrated into hardware like Haivision’s KB 4K encoder. Haivision is the first partner to announce such a product. While the VCA 2 is touted as a solution for video encoding/transcoding on the fly, it is in essence a server-within-a-server, and can be used for just about any cloud-based service you’d be interested, anything from game servers to secure remote desktops. It’s all about the horsepower. Intel did not disclose pricing of the product, but availability is as of right now. KitGuru Says: Video Streaming seems to be the engine driving the Internet this year, and so the marketing brains have all crafted their messages towards a “video-orientated” product. The VCA 2, however, is a lot more than a number-cruncher for video.

The XSLATE R12 can also be custom-configured with several connectivity options to ensure workers maintain data accessibility no matter where they’re working or the intensity of on-the-job demands. These include the SlateMate module, featuring a barcode scanner and HF RFID reader, an RJ45 + True Serial Port dongle, as well as pass-through antenna capabilities for WWAN, WLAN, and GPS in both the tablet and Secure Mobile Dock. “No one sits still anymore at work,” Gross continued. “The XSLATE R12 was specifically designed to eliminate downtime, minimize security risks and improve both data and device manageability for the millions-strong global mobile workforce. It’s the no-compromise, and complete, mobile office solution that today’s public safety, utility, construction, manufacturing and insurance professionals need to stay productive whether they’re multi-tasking or transitioning between multiple job sites.” Customers who choose to upgrade to the Intel Core i7 vPro processor will also benefit from increased security and mobile device management tools.

The short version: Barry heads to 2024 to try and learn Savitar's true identity, but his Future self doesn't know it. Everything sucks. So, he sticks around to help get Future Team Flash back together, and brings back some intel that could stop Savitar. Oh, and Killer Frost is on the loose and meeting with Savitar (who shows his true face, which we don't see. Grr). The good: The future, Emo Barry, the framing, the fights, and THAT SUIT It's always fun to get a peek at the future, and this one let us kick around for a whole hour in a very broken version of 2024. Cisco has lost his hands, Wally is crippled and catatonic, Joe and Future Barry haven't spoken in years, and Killer Frost has fully replaced Caitlin. Yay future? Look, it obviously doesn't turn out this way — mostly because that'd make for one hella-depressing show, right? — but giving Barry a front row seat at what happens if he fails and spirals into his own self-pity should be one heck of a wake up call. It was great to see the friendship between Cisco and Barry stretch across the timeline, and the little flourishes were great. Of course H.R. is a novelist/coffee house owner; and seeing a broken version of Barry Allen was actually pretty stark. Though, ahem, it's hard to get past that Emo Barry hair. Dude looks like he should be singing lead for my Chemical Romance, not shutting down metahumans. To that end, they framed the story almost like A Christmas Carol, with Barry visiting the "ghosts" of his friends, as he sees the ways everything goes wrong. Cisco loses his hands, the conduit to his power. Wally loses his legs, speed, and mind (a small part of the story, but dang, positively brutal). The guy who loves speed the most, never able to run again. Caitlin is seemingly lost forever to the dark side. Joe is bitter at Barry for abandoning him. Julian is, well, still Julian. And H.R. is still a big goof ball (who has to find those drum sticks, y'all). Letting Barry visit these players in what basically equated to vignettes, with Future Cisco as his tour guide, was an excellent framing device to tell this type of story. Giving Barry a few foes to fight in the future was also a nice touch, and it's been too long since Barry Allen got a chance to actually be a hero — unencumbered by the weight of being the guy who screwed up all of time. Barry sees that the future is a wreck and wants to help fix it, even if his real plan is to stop that future from existing in the first place. He sees bad, and wants to stop it. That's the heart of this character, and it's great to see them getting back to it. Plus, Top and Mirror Master are fun villains. Great to see them again. Last, but certainly not least: How long do we have to wait to see that future suit. Right?! The trim, the layering, the everything. That suit makes Barry's current suit look like a dumpster fire. Cisco needs to build this thing, pronto. I want to see it every week. You know, just without a version of Barry Allen sporting an emo-mop. The bad: The plot holes and contrivances inherent with time travel When you decide to let your time traveling hero start mucking around in the future to fix his problems, you open yourself up to a whole host of problems. And that's pretty much what happened here. So, Barry travel to 2024 to try and learn Savitar's real identity. No one other than Killer Frost knows it, but she ain't talking. So, that's a bust. Then, Barry asks Emo Barry how he eventually defeated Savitar after everything is ruined, and learns a scientist builds the tech in the years after Savitar killed Iris. So, umm, he's time traveling, right? He's in the future where this tech has existed, right? Why not travel to 2021 and get the trap once it's built, and use it in 2017? You've already wrecked the time stream by trying to "cheat" and get some intel, so why not just pull out the play from the playbook you literally know will work, and run it? Yes, Barry gets the files from his future self and brings them back, but did he not even consider just making a pit stop in 2021 and grabbing the device? Or contacting the doctor in 2024, and asking her to build another trap to take back? These all seem like obvious moves, if you've already established you're not afraid to screw around with time to solve this problem. Lines of the night "It will break you." - Future Barry "We should, threesome, do some, something else." - HR Lingering questions Barry brought back the intel on the Speed Force trap, so it stands to reason that will factor heavily into the finale. We'd look for the team to track down this doctor pronto. Who is Savitar? We got to see him actually step out of his suit this time around, though we don't actually see his face. Best bets? A prevailing theory is that it could be some far future version of Barry himself, and Killer Frost's reaction certainly lends itself to that being an option. She obviously recognized whoever crawled out of that super suit ... Could this be some screwed up Barry from an alternate future? He's made it clear he's "lived" this before. Could it be because he's literally on Team Flash? If not Barry, then it obviously seems to be someone we know, right? Maybe an Evil Future Cisco? That'd be a surprising juxtaposition, especially after they bro'd out in the future. They've set this one up in a big way, and the pressure is on to pay it off meaningfully. No pressure, Team Flash.

toolset helps harness enormous capability of NVIDIA, AMD, Intel GPUs - Strengthens Abaco range of mission ready systems, graphics computers - Significantly reduces GPU solution development costs and timelines News provided by Abaco Systems 26 Apr, 2017, 11:00 ET Share this article HUNTSVILLE, Ala., April 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- At Quad-A (The 2017 Army Aviation Mission Solutions Summit – Nashville, TN) Abaco Systems today announced ImageFlex, an innovative software tool designed to allow engineers to harness the full potential of NVIDIA®, AMD and Intel® GPUs for application such as real-time image processing and image visualization. ImageFlex greatly simplifies application creation by delivering a powerful set of high-level application programming interfaces (APIs) that exploit the full capabilities of the underlying GPUs while abstracting the complex details associated with each implementation. Applications built using the ImageFlex framework are easier to develop, test, debug and maintain, while speeding time to deployment by up to five times. The ImageFlex framework API is a user-friendly interface that provides an abstraction layer on top of OpenGL™ to allow developers with no OpenGL experience to rapidly create high performance image processing and graphics applications. It includes optimized, high quality image fusion, stabilization and distortion correction algorithms, as well as a reference implementation of "Skybox", an application that performs real-time 360° spherical stitching. The API facilitates full 'spherical' situational awareness by facilitating the use of 'cube maps' displaying equi-rectangular images. The reference implementation, along with a configuration utility, can enable users to integrate their own camera array and processing very quickly. Typical applications for ImageFlex include Degraded Visual Environment (DVE), 360° situational awareness, helmet mounted sight processing, and target identification and tracking. ImageFlex complements Abaco's growing range of mission ready systems by enabling applications to be developed and deployed in even less time. It also complements Abaco's extensive range of graphics hardware solutions based on GPU technology from NVIDIA, AMD and Intel, such as the FORCE2 and MAGIC1 rugged display computers as well as the soon-to-be-announced Project Elroy. Portable across operating systems, ImageFlex is potentially safety-certifiable. "ImageFlex is yet another example of how Abaco is combining hardware and software to drive down our customers' development cost while accelerating their time to deployment," said Mrinal Iyengar, Vice President, Product Management at Abaco Systems. "Like our other powerful software tools in the AXIS suite, ImageFlex provides customers with added schedule and performance confidence. It also further demonstrates Abaco's commitment to delivering to our customers not just hardware, but a complete solution development framework." ImageFlex features OpenCL ™and CUDA™ interoperability layers to simplify the problem of using the GPU for compute and display in harmony. It provides high quality implementations of GPU accelerated adaptive image fusion, lens distortion correction and image stabilization, all supported by a rich set of demos and reference examples oriented towards minimizing learning curves.

But one thing is for sure, it may be the most explosive growth driver in the history of the semiconductor space. In fact, in a new research report, Merrill Lynch feels that technology is so big going forward that low-power IoT chips could be in almost 1 trillion devices over the next 20 years. The Merrill Lynch team also notes in the report the keys to success for the IoT chips is the ability for processing, sensing, connectivity know-how, and most importantly, the ability to generate profits in a high volume, quick turnover marketplace. With the potential for chip sales to double to $34 billion by 2020, companies with direct exposure are sitting pretty. The analysts point to five stocks rated Buy at Merrill Lynch as long-term beneficiaries of the massive IoT trends: two large cap old-school leaders and three other smaller players that more aggressive accounts may like. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers, and the IoT is a big part of the shift. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. Earlier this year the company announced the purchase of Mobileye for $15.3 billion. The Israel sensor company gives the chip giant a leg up in the autonomous car competition, and it also adds many other capabilities. While some say the valuation paid is high, this is a big IoT segment going forward. Intel investors are paid a solid 2.96% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $42, while the Wall Street consensus target is $39.97. The stock closed Tuesday at $36.87 per share. Texas Instruments This company that has come back into favor big-time, and it was also a top first-quarter pick. Texas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ: TXN) is a broad-based supplier of semiconductor components, ranging from digital signal processors to high-performance analog components to digital light-processing technology and calculators. Some 65% of Texas Instruments sales are exposed to the well-diversified, business-to-business industrial, automotive, communications infrastructure and enterprise markets. In the most recent quarter, the company consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Reported revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were up 13.1% year over year, due in part to greater demand in its automotive and industrial sectors. Texas Instruments also increased its quarterly dividend earlier this year by 32% to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 annualized. The increase reflects its continued strength in free cash flow generation and its commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. Investors in Texas Instrument are paid a solid 2.43% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $92 price target for the stock, while the consensus price objective is lower at $82.11. The shares closed higher than that on Tuesday, at $82.36.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « New Apple Dubai Mall Store introduces Motorized 'Solar Wings' that Control the Environmental Conditions of the Store | Main | Apple Pay using Touch ID is targeted in new Patent Lawsuit » April 26, 2017 Report Claims that the Galaxy S8 with Gigabit LTE Modem will Smoke Apple's iPhone 8 for Fastest Downloads   Last week PhoneBuff presented their annual smartphone speed tests and this year's Galaxy S8+ vs. the iPhone 7 Plus showed Apple's smartphone the clear winner when it comes to opening a series of applications. Now a new report strikes back claiming that Apple's iPhone 8 may not support Qualcomm's new Gigabit LTE modem leaving the iPhone at a definite disadvantage. CNBC framed it this way: "The next iPhone may not be able to hold a candle to the Galaxy S8 when it comes to how fast you'll be able to download music and movies or surf the web."   C/NET reported yesterday that "Gigabit LTE will be a signature feature on many high-profile, premium phones this year. Yet Apple's next iPhone, which is still months away from becoming an official product, may not be one of them. Apple designs its own processor and uses modems from Qualcomm and Intel. But Intel's latest commercial-ready modem won't hit Gigabit LTE speeds, which could force Apple to slow down the Qualcomm version to ensure all iPhones are on the same footing.   If Apple opts to skip out on Gigabit LTE, the iPhone 8 will hit the market with a key disadvantage when the company is trying to position the 10th iteration of its iPhone franchise as the most advanced phone yet. The Galaxy S8 is just the first premium phone to tap into the technology. Qualcomm expects up to 10 Android phones this year to follow suit.   While consumers would normally ignore something as wonky as Gigabit LTE, carriers are starting to trumpet the technology as a catalyst for their faster networks. T-Mobile CEO John Legere boasted in January that his company would be the first with Gigabit LTE this year, providing a public spotlight to what could have been an obscure technical term.   What would the next iPhone presumably miss out on? Gigabit LTE promises a significant speed boost to your phone -- think 18 times faster than the average speeds posted by the likes of T-Mobile and Verizon in a recent test by OpenSignal. With those kinds of speeds, you can say goodbye to buffering as downloads zip by in a flash.   Yet in the bigger picture, "Gigabit LTE networks aren't really up and running in any meaningful market, with only T-Mobile mentioning select areas in a few markets capable of getting those speeds. Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in an interview on Monday that he didn't think Gigabit LTE would be available nationwide, but the technology would be one way the company could "highlight its network superiority."   But the technology isn't just about bragging rights. As carriers upgrade their networks, your Gigabit LTE-capable phone will get faster and faster. So a phone you buy this year might actually get better in 2018 and beyond.   While C/NET admits that it's unclear what Apple will do for the iPhone 8 and may in fact use Qualcomm's modems, they further state: "But if history repeats itself, Apple could disappoint some looking for the next iPhone to pack the latest and greatest everything."   On the surface the report comes across as a mild propaganda piece for Qualcomm. It's a story that could fit after the iPhone 8 debuts if Apple fails to address the modem issue. For now, however, no one knows what Apple will do, so it's just a lot of noise in the form of FUD (the tactic of using Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt about a competing product).   Apple continues to deal with Samsung as a supplier all the while fighting it out in court over patents, so there's no reason to believe that it'll be any different this time around with Qualcomm, if Apple decides there's no modem workaround.   For those wanting to know more about Gigabit LTE could download Qualcomm's PDF titled "Driving the Gigabit LTE Evolution" here.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

If hard drives are too slow and SSDs are too expensive, there has been another option for a number of years: hybrid hard drives. They include a small amount of flash memory to act as a cache to speed up your most common data operations. With the introduction of Optane memory, Intel is offering that cache separate from the hard drive. Now MSI is preparing to ship motherboards bundled with a 16GB stick of Optane included for free. Optane promises to be better than hybrid drives. Flash memory is now faster, the accompanying software handles caching intelligently and automatically, and the performance increase according to Intel is up to 28 percent. It also gives you the choice of which hard drive to buy and pair with it. MSI is including a 16GB stick of Optane pre-installed on three new motherboards, which represents a $50 value. The three motherboards in question are the Z270 Tomahawk OPT BOOST, B250M Bazooka OPT BOOST, and B250M PRO OPT BOOST. Related SSD vs. HDD: What's the Difference? SSD vs. HDD: What's the Difference? Although only confirmed on two of the above mentioned boards, it seems likely that all three will ship with two M.2 slots. One will be occupied by the Optane memory, while the other remains free for an M.2 SSD. Pricing for the motherboards has yet to be revealed, but they all support the latest Intel processors using the 1151 socket, have dual memory channels for up to 64GB DDR4 RAM, and include USB 3.1 support. The Tomahawk board is full ATX and clearly aimed at the overclocking and desktop gaming crowd, where as the Bazooka is a micro ATX for building a smaller, or more portable system.

Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favourites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use — can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports. The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anti-competitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn't standing still — and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Read more Net neutrality: Federal appeals court deals blow to telecoms companies Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback. Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai travelled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was “extremely well received,” according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality “on a public policy basis.” The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to “blacklist” sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an “internet slowdown” event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a “site loading” icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. For the moment, though, there's no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won't be until there's an actual FCC proposal up for debate.

Micron has four manufacturing sites worldwide, while setting up backend facilities in Xian (China), Taiwan and Singapore, said Allan. The backend site in Taiwan is dedicated to providing wafer-level packaging services for DRAM memory, while that in Singapore is engaged in the backend services of NAND flash memory. In addition to the US, where Micron is headquartered, the company has wafer fabs in Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Micron's 12-inch plant in Hiroshima, Japan was formerly owned by Elpida Memory, which Micron acquired in 2013. Micron fabricates mainly mobile RAM as well as PC DRAM chips using 20nm process technology at the Hiroshima fab, Allan disclosed. Micron has a 12-inch fab for the manufacture of NAND flash in Singapore. The fab has begun to produce 64-layer 3D NAND chips, with mass production slated to kick off by September 2017, Allan noted. The facility will also produce and sell a portion of its 3D NAND products to Intel. In Taiwan, Micron has two fabs for the manufacture of DRAM memory. Micron's fab in Taichung, central Taiwan is scaling up its output of DRAM chips built using 1Xnm process technology with mass production expected to kick off between September and October, 2017, while the fab in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan is looking to transition to the newer 1Xnm node from 20nm for the production of DRAM chips. Micron has three plants in the US. The 12-inch plant in Virginia, which opened in 2004, produces both DRAM and NAND flash products. Micron's Virginia facility is specifically engaged in the manufacture of high-margin products and products that have long product cycles, such as memory devices for automotive, industrial, medical and gaming applications, he indicated. Micron's Lehi facility, formerly a joint venture between Micron and Intel dubbed IM Flash, produces 3D NAND and 3D Xpoint solutions, while the Boise facility remains Micron's global R&D center. Allan pointed out that Micron's 3D Xpoint technology jointly developed with Intel will be adopted in enterprise devices. Mass production of chips built using the technology will be ready in 2019. Micron recently acquired a factory from touch panel maker Cando. The facility located in Taichung, central Taiwan will be utilized in establishing a backend site for Micron Taiwan. The new site in Taiwan will be dedicated to developing packaging technologies including wafer-level packaging and 3D IC integration, he said. As a center of excellence for leading-edge DRAM, Micron's new site in Taichung will bringing together fabrication and backend to build an efficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing with quicker cycle times that benefit customers, Allan noted. Micron's backend site in Xian, China is dedicated to providing DRAM backend services. Major customers of the site are China-based PC and communications device companies. Micron is looking to sell its Japan-based backend facilities to partner Powertech Technology (PTI). PTI announced recently plans to fully acquire Micron Akita, Micron's assembly and test plant in Japan. The pair also struck a deal under which PTI will take up Micron's stake in Japan-based wafer testing company Tera Probe. In response to speculation that China's chipmakers are aggressively headhunting talent from their fellow international companies, Allan said that Micron is committed to protecting its intellectual property rights and will pursue legal methods if necessary. The aim is to prevent China-based companies from stealing Micron's patents and technology. Various Chinese-language media reports indicated that Tsinghua Unigroup and other China-based memory chipmakers are headhunting talent from Micron's Taiwan-based units, which were previously Inotera Memories and Rexchip Electronics.

(Ethan Miller/Getty Images) 1. Skype gets some long-overdue upgrades to chat Skype, the popular video messaging app owned by Microsoft, is finally delivering on updates that were promised last October. The new upgrades should help alleviate some of the frustration that came from trying to use Skype's messaging features, which would send notifications to every device that was logged in to a Skype account.

Why Facebook's new custom gender options matter Facebook announced on Thursday that instead of being limited to identifying gender as male or female, users in the United States can now select a custom gender. Facebook also will ask for a custom pronoun to use when using the phrase, “they.” Advertisement The change is probably a small when examining the code behind the user interface, but it is is reflective of the a shift in societal norms.

Google brings back the countdown timer Back in October of 2013, Google teased users with a countdown timer for a few days. All that was required was inputting a simple term, “Set timer for 30 minutes.” But the timer was taken away, and the Internet had to provide timers in other places. But, Google has brought back the timer! The timer is a simple tool, with a popup window appearing at the top of the page after starting the countdown. When the timer hits zero, you can silence the alarm or just turn it off — and you will want to turn it off, it's incessant. The timer can also be paused or reset easily.

Push.co and IFTTT are a perfect couple for Valentine's Day TNW Labs has added integration of IFTTT and Push.co, making a way for you to create another way to stay informed and connected. IFTTT uses recipes that allow one to connect your smart devices together and automate parts of your social media usage. Push.co sends out news updates, and linking the service with IFTTT just made sense, TNW co-founder Patrick de Laive said. TNW is offering Push.co for free until February 28, so download the app while you can. Read more: “If you like IFTTT then you'll adore Push.co with IFTTT“ (TheNextWeb) 5. Track, train and socialize your dog with Wonderwoof The latest iOS app that is more canine than humanoid is Wonderwoof. Your dog is monitored by an on-callar 'bow-tie' connected device that is a GPS tracker and pedometer that communicates with an owner's app. The dog gets its own profile, which will help you and your pet set health objectives, track exercise progress and goals and earn  'bones' for rewards. The app can also provide reminders about medical visits and grooming trips as well as when it's time to be fed and when playtime is. The app also helps the dog socialize with an in-app Twitter feed — clearly the best way for dogs to talk to each other.  Read more: “Wonderwoof is an app and device that tracks a dog's training and health“ (TechCrunch) Print   Email   Font ResizeReturn to Top   RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES VIDEO: Goodbye to The Greatest Show on Earth (VIDEO) Attention shutterbugs: Photos wanted for Ayer's first town calendar Absentee ballots available for Ayer town election         Welcome to your discussion forum: Sign in with a Disqus account or your social networking account for your comment to be posted immediately, provided it meets the guidelines.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel Optane Memory launches for $44 and up (speedy cache compliments your hard drive) 04/24/2017 at 2:32 PM by Brad Linder 10 Comments Intel’s first consumer-grade 3D Xpoint memory solution is going on sale this week. First unveiled in March, Intel Optane Memory is basically a small solid state drive using a new type of memory technology and designed to be paired with a hard drive to offer the best of both worlds: the large storage capacity of a HDD and the speedy read/write times of solid state storage. Intel currently offers a 16GB module for $44 or a 32GB version for $77. So is Intel Optane Memory worth the money? Maybe. As Ars Technica points out, $77 is kind of a lot to pay for 32GB of storage in 2017. And if you’re going to spend that kind of money, you might be better off just buying a 120GB or 250GB SSD. While Intel claims its Optane Memory is faster than most traditional NAND Flash solid state drives, that’s only true if your system is only using Optane Memory. And Intel is really positioning these first drives as caching companions for hard drives. That means that sometimes your computer will benefit from Optane Memory. But sometimes you’ll still have the slow read/write times of a hard drive. There are certainly some situations where it might make sense to use Optane Memory + a hard drive rather than just using a solid state drive. For instance, if you need more than 250GB of storage, SSD prices can get pretty high, while hard drive prices are relatively low. So if you want to store a huge library of games, high-resolution videos, or other content, then it’s probably a lot cheaper to buy a 1TB or larger hard drive and use an Optane cache drive than to get a massive SSD. It’s also worth noting that Optane Memory does not provide a way to speed up old computers, because it only supports computers with Intel Kaby Lake Core i3 or faster processors. So you’ll need a relatively recent system (or at least a recent motherboard). PC World also notes that a high-end Samsung 960 Pro SSD currently offers better performance than Intel Optane Memory in several different benchmarks, but the Optane system handily outperforms hard drives and some cheaper SSDs, which could make it a cost-effective way to give a PC a bit of a performance boost. And as usual, if you want some really detailed thoughts about Intel Optane Memory, check out AnandTech’s writeup. Possibly the most exciting thing about Intel Optane Memory is what this week’s launch portends for the future. It’s likely that Intel will eventually offer Optane storage in higher capacities, making 3D Xpoint technology a viable alternative to NAND Flash for laptop and desktop solid state drives. At that point, rather than boosting the performance of systems with hard drives in some situations, Optane storage will offer permanently faster read/write times, longer endurance, and other improvements over existing SSDs.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 10 Comments on "Intel Optane Memory launches for $44 and up (speedy cache compliments your hard drive)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member Matthew Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

The 32GB Optane can push twice that at ~1,225MB/s (verified in testing) since it’s running over NVMe which can go up to 3,938MB/s.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Not the only difference. The SSD cache, just like any SSD have a limited write count (3000-10000), and as with any NAND memory, it can only be written as a whole block, so even if you only want to change one bit, in the worst case scenario you’d still have to write out 4096 bytes. Optane on the other hand have significantly more write cycles (the current models range from 30000 to 1 million), and each bit can be individually addressed. They are also faster, the current cheap cache models offer about 2-3 times the performance of an average consumer-grade SSD, but the higher end server-grade models can reach 10 times that, possibly even more in the near future, given the proper connection (not an USB3 port 🙂 ). Basically it’s non-violate RAM. Vote Up1Vote Down  Reply 1 day 18 hours ago Guest riddick Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

The real potential for Optane memory technology comes when it develops to the stage that it starts to drive a revision to the current bus architectures that connect data storage devices to the CPU.

Secondly, the small sizes they come in have a purpose: these are meant to act in conjunction with a large hard drive for large SSD to speed up disk operations. In other words, adding this to a computer with a slow 2TB hard drive, would make that 2TB drive behave almost as fast as an SSD, and a fraction of the cost of a large SSD.

"I want to tackle head-on the notion that the Nasdaq is overvalued, something we heard a lot of chatter about today because the index blasted through the 6000 level, and whenever we crash through big round numbers, it tends to cause instant soul-searching," the "Mad Money" host said. When the Nasdaq sees a big run, people tend to recall the last time it skyrocketed, Cramer said. In this case, it happens to be early 2000, when the index approached 5000 then dived thousands of points, crushing a whole class of investors. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer compares the 2000 dotcom bubble bust to today's market moves    Tuesday, 25 Apr 2017 | 6:33 PM ET | 11:33 To Cramer, the comparison feels somewhat forced. The companies that drove the Nasdaq to 5000 back then ended up either being overvalued or, in Cramer's words, "plain old worthless." So the "Mad Money" host decided to compare the leading stocks' future price-to-earnings multiples to see whether there is any weight to the argument that today's market is too pricey. In 2000, tech giants were already running the show. Microsoft traded at 59 times earnings, Cisco at 179 times earnings, Intel at 126 times earnings and Oracle at 87 times earnings. Now, Microsoft trades at 20 times earnings, Cisco at 13 times earnings, Intel at 17 times earnings, and Oracle at 16 times earnings. "When you consider that the average stock in the S&P 500 sells for 21 times earnings, not only are these four tech stocks ridiculously undervalued versus their prices back then, they're actually cheaper than the average stock in the S&P right now," Cramer said. When the tech bubble burst it dragged those market leaders into oblivion. But today, all four are considered value plays complete with regular stock buybacks and good dividends at a fair price. Cramer understands why some investors worry about market leaders like Amazon and Netflix, which appear to have inflated valuations like the once-doomed tech stocks did in 2000. But the "Mad Money" host is not convinced that this means the online powerhouses are due for a crash. "Amazon has the greatest sales momentum of all time," Cramer said. "I've never seen a company this large grow so fast in a market that's worth trillions upon trillions of dollars worldwide." Even in 2000, investors would pay up to Amazon's multiples for growth. But Cramer noted a key difference: unlike the growth stocks then, Amazon has huge cash flows and makes billions. "It just chooses to keep spending that money so it can grow even faster," he said. Netflix strikes Cramer as an opportunity stock, one that has massive growth potential that investors will also cough up cash to buy. As the streaming giant cracks into new global markets, it attracts eager money managers along the way. Moreover, the other stocks in the Nasdaq's top 10 biggest names are also relatively cheap. Apple trades at 14 times 2018 earnings and has a large dividend, big buyback, and lots of cash. Alphabet, parent of Google, may seem expensive, but at 18 times earnings is cheaper than the average and also has a mountain of overseas cash as well as a large buyback. Facebook sells at the average price of a Nasdaq stock. "Now, some of you might say, 'Wait a second, all of these stocks could still prove to be wildly overvalued if the global economy turns upside down,'" Cramer said. "But right now, things seem to be doing just fine, and they could be getting even better if President [Donald] Trump can push his tax cuts and repatriation plans through Congress." So as the indexes continue to rally, Cramer insists that you do your homework on the companies that market players have deemed too expensive. "Even though the Nasdaq 100 is up 14 percent year to date, I refuse to call it overvalued not only versus 2000, but compared to many other eras that I have to admit seemed a lot less risky," Cramer said. "One more reason to stay the course and do some buying if this darn market would ever give you a pullback." Questions for Cramer?

News & Analysis UMC Sees Weakening Demand at 28nm Alan Patterson 4/27/2017 00:35 AM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet TAIPEI — United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), Taiwan’s second largest foundry, said sales of its most advanced technology node have slipped for a third time under strong competition. The company’s 28nm process fell to 17 percent of overall sales in the first quarter of this year compared with 22 percent in the fourth quarter last year. It’s been a bumpy ride for UMC. The company has seen its portion of overall sales from 28nm decline on a quarterly basis for the third time since ramping up the process technology nearly three years ago, according to company reports. “There has been some weakness in demand,” UMC CEO Po-Wen Yen said on a conference call to announce the company’s first-quarter 2017 results. Demand for 28nm in the high-k metal gate niche has been good, CEO Yen said. Even so, some customers have been migrating products to more advanced geometries earlier than expected, he added. (Source: UMC) Larger rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) has successfully defended its cash cow 28nm node after launching it nearly five years ago. TSMC’s 28nm products rose to account for 25 percent of the company’s overall sales in the first quarter this year compared with 24 percent in the fourth quarter last year. The company has held on to a 90 percent share of the 28nm market even as competitors such as Intel are trying to take away business in that segment. “It feels like there is some oversupply in 28nm,” JPMorgan analyst Gokul Hariharan said on the conference call. Other analysts voiced suspicions that there is pricing pressure in the node that’s also supplied by TSMC and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. of China. UMC said it aims to increase 28nm to 20 percent of its total sales by the fourth quarter of this year. The process technology will probably contribute about 15 percent to company revenue during the second quarter, according to UMC CEO Yen. UMC will expand production of 28nm products at its new fab in Xiamen, China that’s a joint venture with the local government. By the end of this year, the company expects to have 39,500 12-inch wafers per month – including about 5,000 wafers at the Xiamen fab – in 28nm capacity. UMC is playing catch up in process technology. While TSMC and Samsung are ramping up 10nm, UMC is setting its sights on 14nm. For the 14nm process that UMC started shipping to one customer early this year, the company said it has a 2,000 12-inch wafer per month capacity. UMC’s 14nm is in test vehicle verification, and the company said it has no plan to expand output currently. While UMC didn’t provide information on 14nm in its sales breakdown for the first quarter of this year, the company said it expects 14nm shipments to increase during the second quarter. Bright spots Despite the headwinds, UMC’s utilization rate rose to 96 percent in the first quarter compared with 94 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. Demand has been good for WiFi, FPGA, application processor and baseband chips, according to CEO Yen. The company reiterated its plan for capital expenditures this year to reach $2 billion. UMC said the utilization rates in its eight-inch fabs as well as in 12-inch advanced nodes approached near full capacity, driven by strength in consumer and communication segments. Demand for automotive chips, which is increasing, still accounts for less than 5 percent of overall sales. The company said it expects business to be relatively flat during the second quarter this year, an outlook that’s in line with an earlier forecast by TSMC. UMC expects a pick-up in mature 12-inch wafer business due to higher demand from wireless, internet of things (IoT) and consumer electronics. However, the increased demand in legacy 12-inch wafer shipments will be offset by a decline in 28nm business, the company said. —Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times.

SEOUL, South Korea >> Samsung Electronics reported its best quarterly profit in more than three years Thursday and forecast improvement for the full year as its semiconductor division posted its highest income ever. The South Korean company’s stellar financial results beat expectations and reflect its ability to overcome the fiasco over its Galaxy Note 7s, which it pulled from the market when its batteries were found to be prone to overheating. That cost Samsung at least $5 billion. The secrets to its crisis-defying performance: microchips. “The semiconductor business will continue to see a boom for at least a year ahead and its earnings result is on a roll,” said Park Ju-gun, chief executive at CEO Score, a private corporate watchdog. Samsung Electronics is the world’s largest memory chipmaker and second-largest semiconductor company after Intel. Its semiconductor department generated $5.6 billion in operating income during the first three months of this year, more than double a year earlier. So nearly two-thirds of Samsung’s operating income during the first quarter was generated by its semiconductor business. The first quarter is typically a slow season for chipmakers but market circumstances were especially favorable for companies like Samsung that are positioned to quickly and efficiently mass produce microchips. Global supplies were tight and consumer demand for more sophisticated and high-density mobile devices that can quickly multitask and process more images, videos and other data was strong. Data centers around the world are also handling growing amounts of data, with more and more gadgets connected to the internet. The tight supplies and solid demand, pushed prices for Samsung’s key microchip products called NAND and DRAM up sharply, giving it fat margins. Such market conditions are unlikely to change in coming months, so analysts expect Samsung to rake in its best ever earnings in 2017. For the January-March period, Samsung’s profit jumped 46 percent over a year earlier to 7.7 trillion won ($6.8 billion), compared with 5.3 trillion won a year earlier. According to data provider FactSet, analysts had expected a net income of 7.1 trillion won. Sales rose just 2 percent over a year earlier while operating profit surged 48 percent to 9.9 trillion won ($8.7 billion). For the full year, Samsung said its components business such as memory chips and mobile-phone screens known as OLED will drive profits. Samsung is betting on the Galaxy S8 smartphone, which uses curved OLED screens that wrap around its corners. The S8 and S8 Plus with larger screens went on sale last week with strong pre-orders. Samsung is still facing some acute headaches. Five of its top executives, including Lee Jae-yong, the de-facto leader and the only son of its chairman, were indicted on corruption charges in a political scandal that brought on months of public protests and resulted in the ouster of the South Korean president. The trial is expected to continue for several months. The Galaxy S8 smartphones has gotten favorable initial reviews, though some consumers complained that the screen appeared to have a pink hue. Samsung said it was not a product quality issue and it will release a software update to allow subtle adjustments of screen colors. Apart from its earnings, Samsung announced that after months of review it would not change the company’s structure into a holding company. It said such a change carried more risks than benefits. That may disappoint investors who had thought such a change could boost share prices and increase transparency in dozens of Samsung businesses that are controlled by the Lee family despite owning only small stakes in each company, thanks to a web of complicated cross-shareholdings. Concern over transparency in the chaebol, as big South Korean family-controlled businesses are known, has intensified with the scandal over political donations that resulted in the indictments of Lee and other top executives. In a separate announcement, Samsung said that it would cancel treasury shares valued more than 40 trillion won ($35 billion). That will improve share prices and ease worries that those shares might have been used for the benefit of the Lee family, rather than for all shareholders.

Hot Topics: Anadarko shuts 3,000 wells Fatal car crash What happened to The Well? Sanctuary city Boulder County beekeepers News tips Anadarko shuts 3,000 wells in Colorado after deadly Firestone house explosion Oil and gas company operated well 200 feet from home that exploded By Amelia Arvesen Staff Writer Posted:   04/26/2017 03:55:27 PM MDT Updated:   04/26/2017 08:26:29 PM MDT A well head is seen Wednesday in a fenced-off area near the house that exploded and burned in the 6300 block of Twilight Avenue in Firestone last week, killing two people inside and injuring two others. (Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer) Erin and Mark Martinez (Courtesy Photo) Related Firestone house explosion Apr 20: Coroner officially IDs brothers-in-law killed in Firestone fire Apr 19: Brothers-in-law died in Firestone blaze Apr 18: Two bodies uncovered after Firestone house explosion, fire Investigators confirmed Wednesday that they're looking at a 24-year-old well operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation as part of their probe into the house explosion that killed two men in Firestone last week. That revelation followed an announcement by Anadarko that it has shut down more than 3,000 similar vertical wells across northeast Colorado, including the well that sits about 170 feet from the home at 6312 Twilight Ave. that exploded April 17. Investigators have not announced the origin or cause of the explosion. Frederick-Firestone Fire Chief Theodore Poszywak said in a news release that officials have determined there is no threat to other homes in that Firestone neighborhood, and have communicated that with residents. Joey Irwin (Saddleback Golf Course / Courtesy Photo) "We are fully engaged in this investigation to a final determination unimpeded by speculation to bring honor and any closure possible to the family and our community," Poszywak said. "...Our priorities are to ensure the safety of the neighborhood, and to complete a systematic, thorough and timely investigation to determine a conclusive cause." Anadarko — the largest Weld County oil and gas producer in 2014, according to state data obtained by Natural Gas Intel — did not directly link its well to the explosion, and said in a news release that "there is still much that is not yet known regarding the potential contributing factors." Advertisement The bodies of brothers-in-law Mark Martinez and Joey Irwin, both 42, were discovered in the basement one day after the explosion. Martinez's wife, Erin, was seriously injured and continues to heal in the hospital. A child, believed to be her 11-year-old son, was also injured. Family and friends said Irwin had been called to help the Martinez family with the hot-water heater in their two-story home that they had lived in since 2015. Both Martinez and Irwin were experienced handymen, working as a public works foreman and as a plumber, respectively. Construction crews building new apartments have continued working behind the neighborhood since the explosion. A chain-link fence that once surrounded the leveled home and its mildly-burned western neighbor now extends around a field east of the home, where the Anadarko well is located, south-central from the field behind its own tan fence. In its statement, Anadarko characterized the well as "an older vertical well that was drilled by a previous operator in 1993." The company said it has shut down all of its vertical wells "of the same vintage" across northeastern Colorado, and will keep them off until the company's field personnel conduct inspections and testing of wellheads and associated underground lines.

(Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer) Traditional vertical drilling accesses oil and natural gas reserves directly underground, meaning it is limited from reaching a wider section below, according to Anadarko diagrams. Horizontal wells start with a vertical well, but then diverge horizontally through layers of rock to tap into more than one point. "As such, the company has been working cooperatively with fire officials and state regulatory agencies in their investigations since the time of the accident," Anadarko said in its news release. The company — with other operations in Wyoming, Texas, Utah, the Gulf of Mexico, South America, Africa and New Zealand, according to its website — operates more than 3,000 producing vertical wells of the same approximate age as the one located near the site of the Firestone house explosion. The company said the wells account for a total production of about 13,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. According to the release, inspections will focus on areas where housing and commercial developments are in close proximity to existing infrastructure. The company also said wells will not be reactivated for two to four weeks. "Our teams will remain actively engaged with residents in the Firestone community," said Brad Holly, an Anadarko official. "Colorado residents must feel safe in their own homes, and I want to be clear that we are committed to understanding all that we can about this tragedy as we work with each investigating agency until causes can be determined." The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission also released a statement to say that crews are taking environmental samples and inspecting oil and gas wells in the area of the explosion, which includes Anadarko's oil and gas operation southeast of the house. The commission said it has been assisting the Frederick-Firestone Fire Protection District and the Firestone Police Department with the ongoing investigation. As of Wednesday, Anadarko shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, were down 12 cents at the end of the day and closed at $59.96.

I’ve been planning and working on the machine for over a week, and I’m finally at the point where I can share the results of my journey. This isn’t my first Hackintosh build, but it’s the first build where I decided to go about it without the assistance of the excellent tools over at tonymacx86. I’ve been long interested in building a Hackintosh using just the Clover EFI Bootloader, and that’s exactly what I did for this build. Going about it this way allowed me to learn more about the process, and helped me to see that the entire premise, while tedious at times, is actually fairly straightforward. In this initial post, I’ll talk about some of my reasoning behind my hardware choices, and share some initial experiences and benchmark results. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? Why I wanted a Hackintosh I needed a fast, expandable, quiet machine that runs macOS. Unfortunately, Apple doesn’t offer such a machine at the moment. Granted, there has been a renewed vow to focus on Pro machines, but those are still a ways off. As a video editor, the 2016 MacBook Pro is adequate, it’s just not the ideal editing machine for me. I wanted something powerful, relatively quiet, and highly expandable. At this point, building a Hackintosh is one of the few things that meets all three of these requirements. Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos Downsides of a Hackintosh Of course, a Hackintosh isn’t a perfect machine. It can take a lot of testing to get it right, and I’ve spent many hours trying to perfect my build. Almost everything that I care about works, but let’s be honest and say that nothing can replace the “just works” nature of a machine designed in Cupertino. For example, there’s the iMessage problem. There are known workarounds to get iMessage working, but it doesn’t work out of the box. As someone who rarely uses iMessage on the Mac anyway, I’m abstaining from touching it at this time. There are simple step-by-step guides that you can follow if you wish to get it working, but I’ve heard mixed reports from people who have tried these methods. The other major issue involves modern GPUs from AMD. In theory, these are the best GPUs to use in a Hackintosh because of their superior OpenCL performance with Final Cut Pro X. Unfortunately, these GPUs require an iGPU to be active, kext modifications, and often caused the latest version of Final Cut Pro X to crash. That’s not to say that AMD GPUs don’t work, because they do, it’s just that Nvidia GPUs are easier to get going for Hackintosh newbies thanks to easy-to-install Pascal Web Drivers. We’ll tackle the prospect of utilizing an AMD GPU in a later post. The good news is that there is a plethora of good help available on the web to help troubleshoot issues you encounter while building your Hackintosh. There’s the aforementioned tonymacx86, and there are also sites like InsanelyMac. The Hardware Corsair Carbide Series 330R Case As someone who edits videos, does voiceovers, and participates in podcasts, having a quiet machine was of utmost importance. For that reason I choose the Corsair Carbide Series 330R. The full-sized ATX Carbide Series 330 is a bit larger than I wanted, but that allows for plenty of airflow and expandability. The side panels, front cover, and top vent cover feature sound-dampening material to reduce noise emitting from inside the case. It’s far from the prettiest case, but I reason that since it’s going to be tucked away on the floor, looks take a back burner to performance. I’m not blown away by the Corsair Carbide, but I am satisfied with the results. EVGA SuperNOVA 750W PSU I was this close to buying a fan-less Silverstone 520W power supply, because it’s dead silent, however, 520W isn’t enough power for the 1080 Ti GPU. If I had opted for a lesser GPU, like the RX 480, I could have easily gotten by with the fan-less PSU. I decided on EVGA’s 750W offering, as it provides plenty of power for my rig and features a fully-modular design. It’s not dead silent, but it’s quiet enough to not be a distraction when recording audio. GA-Z170X-Gaming 7 Motherboard I’ve had good success with Gigabyte motherboards in the past, and this full ATX UEFI-enabled board is no exception. Although I’m not yet using it, I like the fact that the board features built-in Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1. The Gigabyte UEFI interface also makes the CPU super-easy to overclock. Intel Core i7 6700K 4.00 GHz CPU For the power you get, I think the Skylake Core i7 6700K is well-priced. I’m able to easily overclock this CPU to 4.6GHz, and the benchmark results speak for themselves. This 6700K is the same CPU used in the most recent 5K iMac, but unlike real Macs, Hackintosh machines can be overclocked to eek out even more performance. As a result, my Hackintosh is faster at single core operations than any official Mac product that Apple makes. And in multi-core tasks, only the 12-core and 8-core Mac Pro bests it. Noctua Quiet CPU Cooler Keeping with the theme of being quiet, the Noctua Quiet CPU Cooler does a good job of keeping the CPU at reasonable temperatures, while remaining whisper quiet. EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition For most Mac users, the GTX 1080 Ti is overkill in the greatest sense. However, if you plan on dual booting Windows, then having such a card can pay dividends. Most Mac users would probably be better off with a less expensive GPU, and Nvidia makes plenty of them. There’s also AMD GPUs, which offer better OpenCL performance, which benefits Final Cut Pro X, but I found that my AMD RX 480 resulted in random FCP X 10.3.3 crashes. But even with beta drivers, the 1080 Ti performs decently on macOS, and its performance is otherworldly on Windows. This will largely be a personal decision, but I prefer Pascal-based GPUs due to their simple install process, ease of use, and relative stability — even while in beta. Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR4 DRAM There’s no real reason why I chose this RAM other than the fact that I wanted 16 GB and the Corsair Vengeance featured good reviews at a reasonable price. I plan on upgrading to 32GB eventually, but wanted to see how the build turned out before buying all four sticks. 802.11AC Desktop Wifi Card I’ve been most impressed with this Wifi card. It features 802.11 A/B/G/N/AC, and Bluetooth 4.0. Best of all, it works out of the box in macOS Sierra 10.12.4. SanDisk Ultra II 960 GB SSD The folks at SanDisk provided these SSDs for a previous test, and I was able to reuse them for my Hackintosh build. This disk offers plenty of storage space to house everything on my boot drive, and while the speed doesn’t compete with newer NVMe options, it’s good enough for the time being. Along with these items, I’m also using a cheap hardwired Amazon keyboard and mouse. Apple’s Magic Mouse works fine, as does my Matias Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard, but it’s always a good idea to have hardwired input devices when working on low-level stuff like UEFI and bootloaders for instantaneous response. After the system is fully built, I switch back to my wireless peripherals for convenience. Overclocking One of the appeals of the 6700K is how easy it is to overclock. The Gigabyte motherboard makes overclocking super-easy, and I was able to drive the clock speed up to 4.6 GHz with just a few mouse clicks. Intel Power Gadget frequency chart macOS will not readily report the bumped up clock speed, but by utilizing Intel Power Gadget, you can quickly discern the true clock speed of the CPU. The Results In a soon-to-follow post, I will provide my full Hackintosh how-to walkthrough. The walkthrough will discuss each step, start to finish, that I employed for this build. Until then, I wanted to briefly share my experience with this machine. Here’s a list of things that work as expected: Sleep/Wake Shutdown Ethernet Wi-Fi Bluetooth Audio iCloud Mac App Store AirDrop Nvidia GPU 4K@60Hz via DisplayPort USB 3.1 Here are the things that don’t currently work: 4K@60Hz via HDMI iMessage Thunderbolt 3 Most of the things that don’t work I can live with. Although iMessage can be fixed, and Thunderbolt 3 probably can as well, I haven’t bothered to spend much time on either. The 4K@60 Hz HDMI issue is a bit more difficult to crack since no official Macs ship with the required HDMI 2.0 interface. But even with these downsides, I have a largely usable and powerful machine. In fact, this Hackintosh is faster than any Mac that Apple currently sells in some respects, with single core CPU scores besting the 2015 iMac with similarly-equipped 4 GHz Intel 6700K i7 processors, and multi-core scores besting every Mac outside of a handful of 12- and 8-core Mac Pros. Hackintosh GPU benchmarks My most important task, that of editing 4K video in Final Cut Pro X, performs well. Export times are decent, though they won’t compete with the results of CPU-based encoding afforded by Intel Quick Sync. But even more important is the fact that I can easily scrub through and play back 4K timelines in full resolution without having to transcode to proxy. All of this occurs without my machine sounding like a jet engine ready to leave the runway. Hackintosh CPU benchmarks Although it doesn’t always equate to real world results, the BruceX 5K Final Cut Pro benchmark is a popular way to test Final Cut Pro X performance. My Hackintosh can run this benchmark in 20 seconds on average, which is a very good score if you know how intensive BruceX 5K can be. Needless to say, I’m satisfied with this Hackintosh build. There are some things I’d like to change, such as introducing a faster NVMe boot drive (These SATA SSDs are slow by today’s standards) and adding more RAM, but those are largely trivial items. Stay tuned for our follow-up posts, which will detail the entire macOS install process from start to finish using Clover EFI Bootloader. In the meantime, share your thoughts on my Hackintosh build. Is there anything that you would change? Would you consider building a Hackintosh for yourself?

Global agreement helps manage climate risks, generates jobs Staff Report Major companies, including across the U.S. economy are urging President Trump to keep the United States in the Paris climate change agreement. The U.S. must stay at the table to help steer efforts to manage rising climate risks and compete in expanding global clean energy markets, according to a letter to the president Trump organized by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. “By committing all countries to action, the agreement expands markets for innovative clean technologies, generating jobs and economic growth,” the letter says. “U.S. companies are well positioned to lead, and lack of U.S. participation could put their access to these growing markets at risk.’’ The letter was signed by BP, DuPont, General Mills, Google, Intel, Microsoft, National Grid, Novartis Corporation, PG&E, Schneider Electric, Shell, Unilever and Walmart. These Fortune 500 companies are among the top U.S. retail, tech, power, energy, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and consumer goods companies, with a combined market capitalization of nearly $2.5 trillion. The Paris Agreement has been ratified by 143 countries, including the United States. The White House has said a decision on whether to stay in the agreement is due before the president attends the G7 Summit in Italy in late May. The companies told the president that U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement helps them compete and plan future investments by ensuring a more balanced global climate effort, setting long-term objectives, improving transparency, and encouraging market-based approaches to minimize costs. The letter also notes that strengthening global action over time will reduce future climate impacts that damage or disrupt business facilities and operations, supply chains, agricultural productivity, and water supplies. “U.S. business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response,” the letter says. “We believe the Paris Agreement provides such a framework.” C2ES President Bob Perciasepe said, “Business leaders recognize the costly impacts of climate change, and the opportunities for jobs and growth in a clean technology future.” “Corporate leadership was critical to delivering the Paris Agreement,” Perciasepe said. “But the agreement will only achieve its full promise if the U.S. stays on board. These companies from across the U.S. economy are laying out the clear business case for doing just that.” Paris Agreement Q&A Summary of the Paris Agreement Advertisements Share this: Reddit Twitter Google Facebook Email Like this: Like Loading...

Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favorites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they’d very much like subscribers to use — can’t slow down Netflix, can’t block YouTube, and can’t charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora.   Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports. EARLY TECH RESISTANCE The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn’t standing still — and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry’s giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback. Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was “extremely well received,” according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn’t hurt it because it’s now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality “on a public policy basis.” WHAT COMES NEXT The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet’s most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to “blacklist” sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an “internet slowdown” event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a “site loading” icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. For the moment, though, there’s no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won’t be until there’s an actual FCC proposal up for debate. And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. “Next steps haven’t been figured out yet,” Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. “I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,” said Engine’s executive director, Evan Engstrom. https://www.mail.com/scitech/news/5144074-internet-firms-winding-up-fight-net-neutrality.html#.7518-stage-hero1-8 Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Pennsylvania-based Open Source Security on Wednesday decided to stop making test patches of Grsecurity available for free. The software, a set of powerful Linux kernel security enhancements, includes features such as support for role-based access controls and chroot restrictions that harden Linux implementations. Two years ago, the Linux security outfit did the same for stable patches of Grsecurity. The company's decision to limit its open-source security software to paying sponsors stemmed from alleged misuse of Grsecurity's trademark by an undisclosed company that appears to have been Intel's Wind River. Asked whether the company in question was Wind River, Grsecurity creator and Open Source Security president Brad Spengler, in an email to The Register, declined to comment. In any event, when legal saber-rattling failed to produce the desired result, Spengler's company closed its free software spigot, except for test patches. Now those too have been paywalled. And as a consequence, there will be no more public PaX patches for future kernel releases, because PaX includes Grsecurity contributions. Organizations willing to pay the subscription fee – which once started at $200 per month but is now tailored on a per-customer basis – will be able to continue to benefit from Grsecurity patches. Freeloaders will have to explore other options, which Open Source Security contends don't exist. "Unfortunately, in contrast to Microsoft's post-Windows XP Trustworthy Computing initiative which drastically changed its security trajectory, the Linux community at large has failed to invest adequately in security over the past two decades," the company said in a blog post. "Partially due to this, there is no direct alternative to Grsecurity or even any option that provides a substantial fraction of Grsecurity's features or overall benefits." Asked whether he had anything to add to the announcement, Spengler pointed to a post from security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski as representative of his thoughts on the matter, and added: All I would say other than that at this time is that I've spent nearly half of my life (16 out of 34 years) on this work and published it for free for people to learn and benefit from. The testimonial we added to the site today from Tavis Ormandy speaks to the impact we've had on our field. There are many commentators and complainers today, especially when it involves free software, and very few people dedicating half of their life to creating useful original work. When those efforts suddenly get co-opted by companies using misleading marketing and essentially corporate-funded plagiarism, it's not conducive to the desire to create and publish new work. So we're refocusing our efforts back to those who respect and value our time. To date and going forward, Grsecurity's patches are and will be distributed under the GPLv2 free-software license, just like the Linux kernel. You could, therefore, pay for future code and release it for everyone, but that would be a surefire way to end your Grsecurity subscription for good. ® Tips and corrections 5 Comments MORE Linux Kernel More from The Register Linux-using mates gone AWOL?

Google, for example, plans to power 100 percent of its data centers and offices with renewable energy starting this year.  View photos President Donald Trump shakes hands with employees from Rosebud Mining Company.More Image: AP/REX/Shutterstock "U.S. business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response," the letter states.  Trump has launched an all-out assault on former president Barack Obama's climate change policies, which will likely make it impossible for the country to meet its emissions reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement.  Since all nations, including developing countries like China and India, are part of the agreement, the companies say staying in the Paris system will avoid the risk of "competitive imbalances" for U.S.-based companies.  In addition, the letter states the Paris agreement would help create jobs by spurring the clean energy market, and would avoid risks to businesses from climate impacts such as more severe storms and sea level rise.  "We urge that the United States remain a party to the Paris Agreement, work constructively with other nations to implement the agreement, and work to strengthen international support for a broad range of innovative technologies," the letter states.  View photos Google data center in Georgia.More Image: Google/REX/Shutterstock Other companies that signed the letter include the retail giant Wal Mart, and major electric utility PG&E, among others.  The Paris Agreement commits the world to limiting global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, of warming compared to preindustrial levels by the year 2100. This target is viewed as ambitious, given the recent increase in global emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.  Several members of Trump's team, including Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon, are urging Trump to pull the U.S. out of Paris altogether.  Other officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, favor staying in. The White House has promised a decision by mid-May when the Group of 7 major economies meets in Europe.  WATCH: Giant icebergs are a big tourist draw in Newfoundland, and a warning sign Reblog Share Tweet Share Popular in the Community Kourtney Kardashian Gets Caught Napping in Sexy Underboob-Baring Bikini 137 reactions3%75%22% Battling ISIS in Hatra, Iraq, and more: April 26 in photos 27 reactions4%58%38% Attorney for Aaron Hernandez's prison 'brother' adds new wrinkles to suicide mystery 1312 reactions5%65%30% Texas Kindergarten Teacher Allegedly Had Sex with 4 High School Boys, Including 2 at Once 3906 reactions5%77%18% From inauguration to 100th day: President Trump’s rocky ride in pictures 204 reactions5%59%36% Korean Americans who lived through LA riots lift legacy of silence Lawrence On Trump's Disastrous One-page Tax Proposal Rollout 3 reactions0%100%0% US veteran charged with killing PTSD 'therapy dog' as boyfriend filmed her 3863 reactions4%55%41% U.S. chief justice alarmed at Trump administration immigration case stance 2228 reactions4%68%28% Christopher Schwarzenegger Is Back With Mom Maria Shriver and Sister Katherine in Cali 1051 reactions5%74%21% Ivanka Trump visits Berlin's Holocaust memorial and more: April 25 in photos 146 reactions5%75%20% 'Let It Fall' doc offers searing look at LA riots from those who lived through it 1 reactions Trump Wins Freedom Caucus, Loses Moderates (& Maybe GA-6) With Trumpcare 1 reactions Military preparations ‘underway’ on North Korea, Trump aide says 2996 reactions5%68%27% Uber driver charged with raping California woman in car 707 reactions2%72%26% Al Pacino Celebrates 77th Birthday on Romantic Beach Date With 38-Year-Old Girlfriend 1392 reactions8%79%13% USS Carl Vinson ‘Cannot Shoot Down Missiles’ Werewolfking: Nothing but fake news.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Adidas is now the official sponsor of Spanish eSports team ASUS ROG Army Adidas is now the official sponsor of Spanish eSports team ASUS ROG Army Paul Taylor 8 hours ago Lifestyle, Software & Gaming, Tech News It seems like one of Europe’s best-sponsored eSports teams, ASUS ROG Army, has snapped up another major deal under the form of German sporting goods brand, Adidas. The company has announced it has signed a sponsorship with the Spaniards to supply them with custom-designed uniforms, bearing team and sponsor insignia, until 2020. Instead of throwing copious amounts of money at yet another pro athlete or team, Adidas has thrown its weight in with Asus and Intel, and will be supplying the ASUS ROG Army with new threads for a three-year period (and probably an undisclosed amount of money). ASUS ROG Army kit will also be put on sale in the Spanish professional videogaming league’s (LVP) official store, for team fans to snap up. To put this in perspective, the team will join the ranks of Real Madrid and Manchester United, as Adidas-sponsored athletes. A little over a year old, the ASUS ROG Army is one of the top Spanish League of Legends teams, but otherwise less-known outside Spain. Its team roster includes not only Spanish but also Serbian and Portuguese players. Now, it’s a matter of time until this type of sponsorship takes hold with Adidas rivals Puma, Reebok and Nike, and it sounds like a welcome boost to eSports in general. KitGuru Says: We all knew this was coming – mainstream sporting goods brands moving in on the eSports phenomenon, but hopefully this will mean monetisation, more sponsorships, more teams and more competitions with bigger prizes. Other brands will follow suit.

There are risks to that scenario, including the fact that Congress still needs to pass a resolution to keep the government funded by Friday Patti Domm | @pattidomm 8 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Brendan McDermid | Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on November 18, 2016. Thursday's blast of high-profile earnings, including big tech bellwethers, could help set the stage for new stock market highs in the very near future. There's a rush of earnings Thursday morning, including Union Pacific, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Ford, American Airlines, Comcast, Dow Chemical, Raytheon and Deutsche Bank, to name a few. But some of the tech names that have led the market's gains report after the closing bell and could be big catalysts into Friday's trading. That includes Amazon.com, up 21 percent year to date, and Alphabet, which has risen 12 percent. Microsoft, Intel and Starbucks also report after the close. There are risks to that scenario, including the fact that Congress still needs to pass a resolution to keep the government funded by Friday, though it is expected to happen. There are also wild cards, like the worrisome tensions with North Korea. Another factor that markets are warily watching is the string of softening data reports. Thursday data includes March durable goods orders, weekly jobless claims and advanced economic indicators, all at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists have been cutting forecasts for first-quarter GDP, expected Friday, but are hopeful the second quarter will bounce back. JPMorgan lowered its forecast to 0.4 percent for the first quarter on Wednesday. Stocks slid into the close Wednesday, in a sell-the-news move after President Donald Trump's much anticipated tax plan. The proposal contained a juicy corporate tax cut but was viewed as short on details and likely to be seriously modified. Nonetheless, it is an opening round in what is expected to be months of horse trading on taxes. "People are somewhat optimistic, but they wanted more detail," said Doron Barness, head of global equities trading at Oppenheimer. He said what the market is really focusing on are the nearby highs, like 2,400 on the S&P 500. That index closed Wednesday at 2,387, down 1 point. The Nasdaq was just under its high, set Tuesday, closing at 6,025, and the Dow was off 21 at 20,975. The Russell 2000 closed at a new all-time high of 1,419. "We've had some soft economic data, but people are ignoring that. You have North Korea stuff going on. People are ignoring that. Those are the kind of things that could bring the market down if more economic data comes out that's weaker and there's something geopolitical. But absent that, I don't see how the market doesn't go higher. People are not going to sell this market," said Barness. Earnings power As of Thursday, half the S&P 500 will have reported earnings, and so far profits are expected to be up about 11.8 percent from last year's first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. The companies that have reported so far, saw profits rise an average of 14.4 percent and beat expectations 77 percent of the time. "Obviously, it's all been about earnings, and obviously large-cap earnings have been coming in quite strong, and that's giving people a lot of optimism. You have the VIX back under 11 so it's risk-on," said Steve DeSanctis, Jefferies equity strategist. The VIX is the CBOE's Volatility Index, a measure of market fear since it is calculated based on the puts and calls on the S&P 500. It was at the low level of 10.85 on Wednesday, up 0.8 percent. Barness said if the S&P does get close to 2,400, it could hover there for a while. "What usually happens is we'll toy with this level, back and forth," he said. "If we go through, it's going to have velocity." He said that would force short covering, meaning traders who have short positions would have to buy as the prices go up. "There's a lot of euphoria going around. I hate to be the skunk at the garden party, but I'm just a bit more skeptical here. We've had a pretty big move in three days," said DeSanctis. Econorama Bond yields, which move inversely to price, also slid Wednesday amid concerns that the tax plan could widen the federal budget deficit, which would ultimately make yields rise. In late trading, the 10-year yield drifted to 2.30 percent, an important technical area that the market had held above for months — until last week. "Who is going to be right? The bond market is telling you there's sluggish growth ahead, and the stock market is not telling you that," said DeSanctis. UBS economists on Wednesday said they were sticking with their view that first-quarter growth is tracking at 0.9 percent, after government retail sales revisions showed a weaker-than-expected consumer in the first quarter. But they did note that Thursday's data on retail and wholesale inventories and the advanced merchandise trade, as well as durables could influence their forecast for GDP ahead of Friday's report.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Inside This Shocking Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Leak Apple's next processor could be amazing. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 26, 2017 at 6:00PM On social media, user KK Sneak Leaks posted a purported screenshot of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 running the popular Geekbench 4 processor performance test. The screenshot shows that the phone achieves a single-core score of 4,537 and a multi-core score of 8,975. These scores, if they're legitimate, represent approximately 30.6% and 56.8% increases, respectively, over the A10 chip found inside of the iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. Geekbench 4 identifies the chip as running at 2.74GHz, up from 2.35GHz from the A10, and it says that the L1 instruction cache memory per core has grown from 64KB to 128KB. Perhaps the most interesting thing, though, is that Geekbench 4 says it sees one processor with four cores. I don't believe that Apple laid down four physical high-performance cores (I expect a continuation of two high performance/two high efficiency core structure as seen in the A10), so my suspicion is that Apple has added a technique called simultaneous multithreading to the CPU cores (this allows the system to see each core as two, leading to improved core resource utilization). Indeed, you'll note that the multi-core performance uplift that Apple seemingly gets generation-over-generation with the A11 in multi-core performance is greater than the uplift that it gets in single-core. If Apple has implemented SMT, then it would manifest itself in increased multi-core performance with minimal impact on single-core performance. If this leak is legitimate, then what Apple has built with the A11 is extremely impressive. Delivering on the pocket PC promise If the leak from KK Sneak Leaks is legitimate, then Apple will not only have far-and-away the highest-performing smartphone processor core (the processor core inside of the Apple A9 is faster than anything fielded by the Android camp, though), but the company will be able to truthfully claim that the next-generation iPhone offers personal computer class CPU performance. To illustrate this, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i7-6567U scored 4,281 in single-core and 8,242 in multi-core in 9to5Mac's testing. If the A11 leak is legitimate -- and I suspect that it is -- then the A11 should offer better CPU performance than the chip inside of the current top-end 13-inch MacBook Pro. Intel has better processors out than the 6567U (Apple just hasn't used them yet), and Intel will probably put out faster notebook processors by the time consumers can buy A11-powered devices, but the point is clear: Apple could very well offer PC-class performance in its next-generation iPhone. The possibilities that this will open for app developers seem exciting, especially as this level of performance waterfalls down to lower-cost devices over the next couple years. Next step: GPU dominance? Based on Apple's seemingly incredible execution in CPU performance, I look forward to seeing what the company will deliver with its first fully custom graphics processor and beyond. Apple's Imagination (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF)-based graphics processors are already quite good, but Apple's track record suggests it will be able to really pull out in front with its own fully custom designs. It will be interesting to see if developers will be able to leverage Apple's chip superiority to build apps with features and capabilities that aren't possible on Android devices, which have a much wider range of processor capabilities, and that range has a much lower floor than Apple's.

Now, Charlie Intel has uncovered a slew of details, including marketing materials, a release date and more. Which battlefields will be covered in this entry, then? “Call of Duty returns to its roots with Call of Duty: WWII — a breathtaking experience that redefines World War II for a new gaming generation. Land in Normandy on D-Day and battle across Europe through iconic locations in history’s most monumental war,” reads a supposedly leaked description. “Experience classic Call of Duty combat, the bonds of camaraderie, and the unforgiving nature of war against a global power throwing the world into tyranny.” The D-Day landings have been done many times before, with Medal of Honor: Frontline, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2 all having some variation on it. Here’s hoping we see something fresh otherwise. Call of Duty: WWII returns to the beaches of Normandy, but how will it make this umpteenth take stand out from prior games? The popular multiplayer suite seems to be back in this iteration though. “Call of Duty: WWII multiplayer engages players grounded, fast-paced combat across many of World War II’s most iconic locations. Players will also enjoy exciting new ways to interact and socialise with their friends and the Call of Duty community.” Don’t care for competitive multiplayer? Then it’s claimed that a cooperative mode is in the game, complete with a “new and original story”. It’s believed that Call of Duty: WWII storms the beaches on 3 November 2017.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Mellanox Drops 11%: FYQ2, Q3 View Miss on Intel Delays, Tech ‘Transitions’ Shutterstock photo Shares of server connection technology maker Mellanox Technologies ( MLNX ) are down $5.60, or 11%, at $45.30, after the company this afternoon reported fiscal Q2 revenue and profit sharply below analysts’ expectations, in part blaming delays in new chips for server products from Intel ( INTC ), but also vague „technology transitions” of tech users and system makers. Revenue in the three months ended in March dropped 4%, year over year, to $188.7 million, yielding EPS of 29 cents. Analysts had, on average, been modeling revenue of $204.7 million, and net income of 49 cents per share. For the current quarter, the company sees revenue of $205 million to $215 million, which is below consensus for $223 million. CEO Eyal Waldman said the company’s revenue for its main „InfiniBand” product t was hampered by „delays in the general availability of next generation x86 CPUs, seasonal trends in high-performance computing, and technology transitions occurring across several end users and OEM customers.” The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

But experts say the final decision, expected next month, is anything but certain, and staying at the table could come with significant caveats, like a weakening of US commitments to curbing greenhouse gas emissions. "Given the unpredictability of decision-making by this administration, I am very reluctant to predict," said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. "But there does seem to be a growing convergence around a strategy of staying in the Paris Agreement but lowering the US target." The latest word on the administration's stance came from Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who said Tuesday he would not advise Trump to abandon the deal but rather renegotiate it. US Energy Secretary Rick Perry said he would not advise President Trump to abandon the Paris climate deal, but to "renegotiate it" Aaron P. Bernstein, GETTY/AFP/File That statement aligned Perry, the former governor of Texas, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who formerly headed ExxonMobil and has spoken in favor of honoring the US commitment to the Paris deal, struck in 2015 and signed by more than 190 countries. Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner -- who both serve as his advisors -- are also said to be in favor of the deal. On Wednesday, 13 major international businesses ranging from energy to pharmaceuticals to retail urged Trump to adhere to the Paris accord. "US business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response," said the letter signed by BP, Walmart, Google and others. "We believe the Paris Agreement provides such a framework." Speaking at a TED conference Wednesday, former vice president turned environmental activist Al Gore said there is a "better than a 50-50 chance" Trump will honor the Paris deal. "I certainly hope so, because that agreement sent a powerful message... and has already begun to accelerate the sustainability revolution." - Amending targets? - But some in Trump's inner circle, including advisor Steve Bannon, want Trump to keep his campaign promise to "cancel" the deal. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt is also said to be pushing for a US exit, according to Andrew Light, senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a global research organization. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt is said to be pushing for an exit from the Paris climate change accords Aaron P. Bernstein, GETTY/AFP/File "He is worried that if the US stays in Paris, that would become the basis for some kind of legal objection to his work now, to do things like dismantle the Clean Power Plan and regulations (former president Barack) Obama put in place on transportation and electricity sectors," Light told AFP. "I don't think the US staying in Paris interferes at all with what Pruitt wants to do with regard to domestic regulations," he added. "But if the US stays in Paris there is a very high likelihood they will also announce they intend to change the US target." The United States agreed at the Paris talks to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 26-28 percent by 2025, compared to 2005 levels. Under the agreement, signatories undertake to limit global warming to "well below" 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (two degrees Celsius) over pre-industrial levels, and to strive for 1.5 C. Countries submitted voluntary, non-binding carbon-cutting goals towards this goal. Light, a former US State Department climate official, said any US weakening of its target would violate the spirit of the accord. "But given that there is no strong compliance regime it is not really clear, to me at least, what other countries could do to try to keep the US from going through with some kind of revision," he said. The White House has said a decision will be announced before the G7 summit in Italy on May 26 and 27. "It is unclear, really, what they are going to do," said Frank Maisano, co-founder of the strategic communications practice at Bracewell, an international law firm based in Houston. "I think the sentiment is currently that they should stay in and for very good reasons, because we never had much success when we just pushed it to the side -- take our toys and go home," he told AFP.

But experts say the final decision, expected next month, is anything but certain, and staying at the table could come with significant caveats, like a weakening of US commitments to curbing greenhouse gas emissions. "Given the unpredictability of decision-making by this administration, I am very reluctant to predict," said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. "But there does seem to be a growing convergence around a strategy of staying in the Paris Agreement but lowering the US target." The latest word on the administration's stance came from Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who said Tuesday he would not advise Trump to abandon the deal but rather renegotiate it. US Energy Secretary Rick Perry said he would not advise President Trump to abandon the Paris climate deal, but to "renegotiate it" That statement aligned Perry, the former governor of Texas, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who formerly headed ExxonMobil and has spoken in favor of honoring the US commitment to the Paris deal, struck in 2015 and signed by more than 190 countries. Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner -- who both serve as his advisors -- are also said to be in favor of the deal. On Wednesday, 13 major international businesses ranging from energy to pharmaceuticals to retail urged Trump to adhere to the Paris accord. "US business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response," said the letter signed by BP, Walmart, Google and others. "We believe the Paris Agreement provides such a framework." Speaking at a TED conference Wednesday, former vice president turned environmental activist Al Gore said there is a "better than a 50-50 chance" Trump will honor the Paris deal. "I certainly hope so, because that agreement sent a powerful message... and has already begun to accelerate the sustainability revolution." - Amending targets? - But some in Trump's inner circle, including advisor Steve Bannon, want Trump to keep his campaign promise to "cancel" the deal. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt is also said to be pushing for a US exit, according to Andrew Light, senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a global research organization. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt is said to be pushing for an exit from the Paris climate change accords "He is worried that if the US stays in Paris, that would become the basis for some kind of legal objection to his work now, to do things like dismantle the Clean Power Plan and regulations (former president Barack) Obama put in place on transportation and electricity sectors," Light told AFP. "I don't think the US staying in Paris interferes at all with what Pruitt wants to do with regard to domestic regulations," he added. "But if the US stays in Paris there is a very high likelihood they will also announce they intend to change the US target." The United States agreed at the Paris talks to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 26-28 percent by 2025, compared to 2005 levels. Under the agreement, signatories undertake to limit global warming to "well below" 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (two degrees Celsius) over pre-industrial levels, and to strive for 1.5 C. Countries submitted voluntary, non-binding carbon-cutting goals towards this goal.

"But given that there is no strong compliance regime it is not really clear, to me at least, what other countries could do to try to keep the US from going through with some kind of revision," he said.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP) 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE New York — Internet companies are readying for a showdown with a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said in a Wednesday speech that he wants to ditch the Obama-era rules, hated by telecoms, that prevent broadband and wireless companies from interfering with the sites and apps that consumers use. He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC’s broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&T and Comcast for bad behavior. Pai, the nation’s chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. The FCC plans to release an official proposal for the vote on Thursday. Pai doesn’t have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality, but is seeking input on how to “approach” its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net-neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they’d very much like subscribers to use — can’t slow down Netflix, can’t block YouTube, and can’t charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality. Early Tech Resistance The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn’t stood still as Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called up small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. Calm Before The Storm The industry’s giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, earlier called on Pai to support net neutrality, and Wednesday issued a statement warning that his changes would “result in a worse internet for consumers.” Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was “extremely well received,” according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn’t hurt it because it’s now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality “on a public policy basis.” What Comes Next The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet’s most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to “blacklist” sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an “internet slowdown” event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a “site loading” icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. But until Wednesday, there had been no net-neutrality development to rally around. “Next steps haven’t been figured out yet,” Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. “I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,” said Engine’s executive director, Evan Engstrom. 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Updated: April 26, 2017 1:56 pm Follow @ATownPolitics NEW YORK | Internet companies are readying for a showdown with telecoms and a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favorites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they’d very much like subscribers to use — can’t slow down Netflix, can’t block YouTube, and can’t charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) EARLY TECH RESISTANCE The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn’t standing still — and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest.

CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry’s giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback. Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies.

(CAT) Stock Around Q1 Earnings How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After Q1 Earnings Recent Posts: Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is a Likely Short After Earnings How to Trade Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock After Q1 Earnings How to Trade Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) Stock Around Q1 Earnings View All Posts Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will report its quarterly earnings on Thursday, April 27, so today we’ll be looking at the setup in MSFT stock. But I should point out that Thursday is a major day for large-cap tech earnings, and arguably for the near- to intermediate-term direction of the Nasdaq-100. In addition to Microsoft, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Baidu Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU), Expedia Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are among the many big-tech firms dropping quarterly results after Thursday’s bell. But I want to focus on Microsoft, because given the most recent multiday rally in MSFT stock to the top end of its trading channel, the Q3 earnings report and outlook could turn out to be an important “show and tell” event — and provide ample opportunities for traders to pounce on. Before looking at the trading opportunity, let’s get some perspective. Microsoft shares make up about 8% of the Nasdaq-100, which frequently is represented by the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ:QQQ). Amazon, Alphabet, Intel and Microsoft together make up about a quarter of the index. While it is entirely possible that given these companies’ different businesses, their respective stock reactions to earnings could cancel each other out and thus lead to little movement for the Nasdaq-100, we at least have to consider what will happen if they trade in sync come Friday morning. Such a scenario could lead to a chart-altering move, and also likely jostle the broader U.S. stock market. MSFT Stock Charts When I last discussed Microsoft on Jan. 24 — two days before its last earnings repor t– O offered that should the stock be able to overcome the $63.50 area, this could open upside toward $65-$66. Sure enough, MSFT popped after the Jan. 26 earnings report, and the $66 price target was reached within one day. However, this area then acted as technical resistance … until Friday, April 21, anyway. On the multiyear weekly chart, we see that MSFT stock continues to grind higher and trade well above its 50-, 100- and 200-week simple moving averages (yellow, blue and red lines, respectively). Click to Enlarge We also see that according to the MACD oscillator at the bottom of the chart, momentum thus far in 2017 is making a lower high versus the 2016 momentum highs. I personally won’t assign too much credibility to this indicator alone. However, it is worth noting that MSFT stock is once again trading at the very upper end of the diagonal resistance line (upper purple-dotted line).

Subscribe Information that drives Canadian industry News Features Insights Technology Centre Events Plant Expo Upcoming Events More Digital Edition Plant West Salary Calculator Contacts Advertise Internet firms winding up for a fight over ‘net neutrality’ Government may downgrade prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive internet actions to voluntary commitments. April 26, 2017 by ASSOCIATED PRESS Topics General Industries Government Manufacturing Tags FCC government internet manufacturing net neutrality Technology NEW YORK — Internet companies are readying for a showdown with telecoms and a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favourites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon – which offer their own video services they’d very much like subscribers to use – can’t slow down Netflix, can’t block YouTube and can’t charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. EARLY TECH RESISTANCE The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn’t standing still – and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook – lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists have met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for start-ups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up DC meetings for the first time. CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry’s giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback. Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai met with big tech companies in Silicon Valley, a visit that was “extremely well received,” according to Oracle senior vice-president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality – Netflix – has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn’t hurt it because it’s now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality “on a public policy basis.” WHAT COMES NEXT The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet’s most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to “blacklist” sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an “internet slowdown” event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a “site loading” icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. For the moment, though, there’s no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won’t be until there’s an actual FCC proposal up for debate. And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. “Next steps haven’t been figured out yet,” Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. “I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,” said Engine’s executive director, Evan Engstrom.

Totalplay (totalplay.com.mx) now benefits from hardware abstraction, operational simplicity, and service elasticity, which in turn lowers OPEX costs. On top of all of these OPEX savings there are also some pure CAPEX savings, as fewer different boxes and spares need to be maintained. TITAN is a virtualized software-based encoder-transcoder designed for Cable, DTH, DTT and OTT. As a pure-software encoder, it does not make any assumption on the underlying hardware and can run in any environment, removing infrastructure constraints. By using Intel® VCA cards, ATEME is able to increase channel density by more than 10X over platforms without Intel graphics capabilities, while maintaining boundless quality. The result is a significant reduction in total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) per transcode channel. “ATEME’s virtual solution implements the functions of an encoder in software, and runs on a virtual machine in datacenters. This gives operators the ability to define logical systems by functionality, and not just by dedicated appliance. A virtualized environment will indeed have a much smaller physical footprint than one using dedicated appliances, which significantly reduces operators’ CAPEX and OPEX”, said Robert Oaxaca, Country Manager for Mexico at ATEME. “By providing solutions, guidance and support, ATEME now becomes a true enabler of video datacenters for operators who aim to modernize their video workflow.” About ATEME ATEME (ateme.com), Transforming Video Delivery. ATEME is a global leader in HEVC, H264, MPEG2 video compression solutions for broadcast, cable, DTH, IPTV and OTT.

The Arc de Triomphe is Illuminated to celebrate the ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement. Image: Yoan Valat/Epa/REX/Shutterstock By Andrew Freedman2017-04-26 16:20:15 UTC One day in advance of a pivotal White House meeting to decide the fate of U.S. involvement in the Paris Climate Agreement, the Trump administration is hearing from a diverse number voices urging it to keep the country in the treaty.  The agreement, which went into force in November 2016, commits all countries of the world to reduce emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane.  SEE ALSO: EPA chief calls historic climate treaty a 'bad deal' because this is our life now In a letter sent to President Donald Trump by business leaders, oil giants BP and Shell, along with tech firms such as Microsoft, Google, and Intel, tell the administration that the treaty presents both risks and opportunities for their businesses.  Tech companies in particular have been aggressive in their push to use more renewable energy resources to power their operations. Google, for example, plans to power 100 percent of its data centers and offices with renewable energy starting this year.  President Donald Trump shakes hands with employees from Rosebud Mining Company. Image: AP/REX/Shutterstock "U.S. business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response," the letter states.  Trump has launched an all-out assault on former president Barack Obama's climate change policies, which will likely make it impossible for the country to meet its emissions reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement.  Since all nations, including developing countries like China and India, are part of the agreement, the companies say staying in the Paris system will avoid the risk of "competitive imbalances" for U.S.-based companies.  In addition, the letter states the Paris agreement would help create jobs by spurring the clean energy market, and would avoid risks to businesses from climate impacts such as more severe storms and sea level rise.  "We urge that the United States remain a party to the Paris Agreement, work constructively with other nations to implement the agreement, and work to strengthen international support for a broad range of innovative technologies," the letter states.  Google data center in Georgia. Image: Google/REX/Shutterstock Other companies that signed the letter include the retail giant Wal Mart, and major electric utility PG&E, among others.  The Paris Agreement commits the world to limiting global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, of warming compared to preindustrial levels by the year 2100. This target is viewed as ambitious, given the recent increase in global emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.  Several members of Trump's team, including Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon, are urging Trump to pull the U.S. out of Paris altogether.  Other officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, favor staying in. The White House has promised a decision by mid-May when the Group of 7 major economies meets in Europe.  WATCH: Giant icebergs are a big tourist draw in Newfoundland, and a warning sign Topics: BP, Business, Climate, Donald Trump, Google, Microsoft, Paris Agreement, Paris climate agreement, Politics, Science, shell, World About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

PGS, a fledgling startup company made from gaming fans, has a pretty ambitious plan to take the Windows gaming experience portable. The company has been working on a hybrid smartphone for over a year which carries all the hardware of a smartphone and PC. Initially launched on Kickstarter, it amassed little over $300,000 and gained several critics in the process. Frustrated with the campaign, PGS pulled the device and went on their own, funding the entire thing in-house. What we now have is a near-finished design, which will no doubt be tweaked in coming months according to fan feedback. PGS stands for Portable Gaming Solutions, which is exactly what this device represents. It’s one of the most interesting things we’ve seen at What Mobile for quite some time, as most of these handheld inspired designs tend to be under-powered or heavily limited. Design reminds us very much of the 3DS, except the PGS Hardcore has an impressive trump card up it sleeves. The top portion can flip out, revealing two joysticks and an array of gaming controls. This is all encased in a white plastic finish, giving it quite a minimal and modern appearance. There’s two screens at your disposal, a 5.9-inch FullHD IPS main panel and a smaller one on the bottom portion. The specs for the second display are currently unconfirmed, though we don’t expect the resolution to be as high since it mostly act a utility screen. Interestingly, the first screen can half it’s resolution on demanding titles, which PGS say will get 3x the framerate. Not to be forgotten on camera front, there’s also a 13 megapixel rear camera and 2 megapixel front camera. Hardcore gaming… on the move? The Hardcore crams in far more technology than you’d expect, including two operating systems (Windows 10 and Android 6.0) running in dual-boot. Each OS has it’s own processor and RAM allocation, which is optimised for the respective operating system. For the Android partition, you’ll be getting a MediaTek Helio X20 or X25 (TBC) and 3GB RAM, while the Windows partition uses an Intel Atom x7 Z8750 and 8GB RAM. As a gaming focused unit, graphics is obviously a big deal. The Intel HD 600 graphics chip is (from what we can tell), a desktop level integrated GPU. This should mean you’ll be able to competently play desktop games on the move, at least on low settings. The Mali-T880 GPU handles Android tasks and is the fastest graphics processor in the Mali family to date. Putting all this into a device that’s only 15mm thick has obviously been a challenge, since the PGS Hardcore required an active cooling system to maintain temperature. The fan will kick in when the device goes into high power mode, though in low power scenarios a copper heatpipe will provide enough heat dissipation to protect the device. Connectivity comes courtesy of a USB-C port which supports microHDMI, meaning you’ll be able to hook the PGS Hardcore to an external display when you get home. A microSD slot will handle external storage up to 512GB, though the addition of 128GB Windows memory and 32GB Android memory should mean you have plenty of storage. It’s also worth noting that the Windows memory is UFS, meaning it’ll be much faster than the standard smartphone equivalent and better up to the task of running a full operating system. There’s also WiFi, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 and Wireless Charging but sadly… no headphone jack. A pair of stereo speakers does mean you’ll be able to enjoy audio on the move however. Using two operating systems and an active cooling system will obviously demand juice, so we’re pleased to see a massive 6,800mAh battery included on the PGS Hardcore. The PGS Hardcore is expected to debut in summer 2017 and will be available in three versions. The Hardcore will cost just $319, but you can also get a stronger titanium model for $599. A lesser version, the PGS Lite, will also be available for $259. This substitutes the second screen for a keyboard and has less hardware power.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Abaco Systems Announces ImageFlex to Reduce Time and Cost of Developing Advanced Image Processing Applications - Unique software toolset helps harness enormous capability of NVIDIA, AMD, Intel GPUs- Strengthens Abaco range of mission ready systems, graphics computers- Significantly reduces GPU solution development costs and timelines HUNTSVILLE, Ala., April 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- At Quad-A (The 2017 Army Aviation Mission Solutions Summit – Nashville, TN) Abaco Systems today announced ImageFlex, an innovative software tool designed to allow engineers to harness the full potential of NVIDIA®, AMD and Intel® GPUs for application such as real-time image processing and image visualization. ImageFlex greatly simplifies application creation by delivering a powerful set of high-level application programming interfaces (APIs) that exploit the full capabilities of the underlying GPUs while abstracting the complex details associated with each implementation. Applications built using the ImageFlex framework are easier to develop, test, debug and maintain, while speeding time to deployment by up to five times. The ImageFlex framework API is a user-friendly interface that provides an abstraction layer on top of OpenGL™ to allow developers with no OpenGL experience to rapidly create high performance image processing and graphics applications. It includes optimized, high quality image fusion, stabilization and distortion correction algorithms, as well as a reference implementation of "Skybox", an application that performs real-time 360° spherical stitching. The API facilitates full 'spherical' situational awareness by facilitating the use of 'cube maps' displaying equi-rectangular images. The reference implementation, along with a configuration utility, can enable users to integrate their own camera array and processing very quickly. Typical applications for ImageFlex include Degraded Visual Environment (DVE), 360° situational awareness, helmet mounted sight processing, and target identification and tracking. ImageFlex complements Abaco's growing range of mission ready systems by enabling applications to be developed and deployed in even less time. It also complements Abaco's extensive range of graphics hardware solutions based on GPU technology from NVIDIA, AMD and Intel, such as the FORCE2 and MAGIC1 rugged display computers as well as the soon-to-be-announced Project Elroy. Portable across operating systems, ImageFlex is potentially safety-certifiable. "ImageFlex is yet another example of how Abaco is combining hardware and software to drive down our customers' development cost while accelerating their time to deployment," said Mrinal Iyengar, Vice President, Product Management at Abaco Systems. "Like our other powerful software tools in the AXIS suite, ImageFlex provides customers with added schedule and performance confidence. It also further demonstrates Abaco's commitment to delivering to our customers not just hardware, but a complete solution development framework." ImageFlex features OpenCL ™and CUDA™ interoperability layers to simplify the problem of using the GPU for compute and display in harmony. It provides high quality implementations of GPU accelerated adaptive image fusion, lens distortion correction and image stabilization, all supported by a rich set of demos and reference examples oriented towards minimizing learning curves.

Garcia Lopez Cambra La Duke & Co INTRODUCTION The first known historical precedent is the CPL or Cyberathlete Professional League, established in the USA in 1997, and considered the first institution to organize competitions with a professional approach. From that moment, the protagonists of this "Matrix"-type reality became visible and distinguishable: teams of millennials with their own identity, publishing companies, events and competitions, online platforms, and distribution channels; all converging with major brands such as Red Bull, Samsung and Intel, and becoming massive sports events by means of today's ever popular "streaming". RELEVANT LEGAL ASPECTS We can start with a business aspect, such as the fact that Riot (authors of the largest online game in the world, League of Legends), requested and achieved that, in the US, professional video players be classified as elite athletes when requesting work visas. With respect to the subject at hand, Intellectual Property plays a preponderant role. The company that develops videogames and their copyrights; and companies that broadcast and/or rebroadcast competitions, must all ensure the audio-visual broadcasting and/or recording rights are upheld. Hence, collective management entities will also be mindful of the protecting of their catalogues. We could make a long list of legal aspects closely related to intellectual property, but let us at least mention the most important ones: Videogames, the fundamental center of the competition, have technical and artistic elements that must be protected, based firstly and obviously on the fact that we are dealing with an original work supported by media. Recently, public figures such as Diego Maradona, controversy included, are part of the variety of creative elements comprising videogames. We also have to mention that when organizing the event, the rights of the game's "Publisher" will be exploited, since it involves public communication and, why not? Also, public execution, on part of the players. We are thus faced with the need to provide a legal response to obtainment of licenses from the owner of the videogame, as well as payments to corresponding authors and interpreters, through the management entities. Most fans will follow the competition by means of a broadcast (television or online), where another company will be involved in the filming, live broadcasting and recording of the competitions. Whoever broadcasts the event must consider at least two scenarios: the negotiation of broadcasting rights over the videogame in question; and the audio-visual rights of the event. There will be public communication, as well as the provision and conversion of the broadcast. The Publisher shall also contemplate the issuance of licenses with respect to the audio-visual recording, resulting from the event (in addition to the game and competition, the event includes narration, commentary, images, replays, interviews, image rights of the competitors, team trademarks), mainly in favour of the issuer, who will be considered the producer of the audio-visual recording, along with its corresponding rights. LEGISLATIVE PROGRESS, FRENCH-STYLE In 2016, the France passed its "Digital Republic Law," which includes, among other things, some elements that seek to regulate E-Sports. First, it establishes the parameters that these competitions must follow to not be considered gambling. In that sense, it imposes measures related to participation costs, the maximum amounts to be offered as prizes, as well as certain specific obligations regarding the distribution of prizes, so that they are redistributed in an equitable manner. Finally, the labour issue is of vital importance. Players will be subject to the French Labour Code and must enter into an ad hoc employment relationship, for a defined term (written agreement), with the event organizer. The term of such agreements shall not exceed five years. In the event of a breach of contract, the agreement will adopt an indefinite term, along with the corresponding consequences for the employer. CONCLUSIONS Undoubtedly, one of the main aspects for the development of E-Sports the entry of new competitors into the game, namely, sponsors. For them, it will be vitally important that the rules of the game (legally speaking) are appropriate. Scholars agree that the main issues to be considered are: athletes and players' associations' rights; bets; match fixing; use of internal and privileged information; salary caps; distribution of income between teams and players due to broadcast rights; doping; and the contractual framework of the employment relationship between players and their teams. Finally, some interesting details: E-Sports grant their competitors access to university scholarships in prestigious academies and, in the 2022 Asian Olympic Games, there will be medal-eligible competitions.

It only seemed fitting that as a thank you to the readers that have supported us over the last two decades, that we try to give something back to you. I set out with a goal to do 20 days of giveaways, one for each year of AnandTech’s existence. To do so, myself, the other editors, and the sales team reached out to our friends at hardware vendors across the globe to line up hardware for our greatest giveaway ever. The results exceeded even my wildest expectations. 31 vendors have donated hardware for the AnandTech 20th anniversary giveaway, smashing even my most optimistic goals. We still haven’t finished adding up the value of all of the prizes, but it’s tens of thousands of dollars. It’s honestly almost more than we could handle, if not for the hard work of the Purch community team in helping out to organize all of this. So a big thank you goes out to our friends at Intel, AMD, HTC, NVIDIA, Seasonic, ARM, Asus, and more, for providing us with so many prizes to give out to you guys. I knew we had a lot of friends, but it’s only after you ask for free hardware to give to random readers that you realize just how many friends you have. And similarly, how these companies are eager to make a good impression with you. Starting today and running through May 23rd, we’re doing 20 days of giveaways. We have CPUs, motherboards, phones, tablets, video cards, cases, power supplies, laptops, and even some bona fide swag to give away. Each giveaway is only open for 48 hours, so you’re going to want to check in each and every weekday to enter that day’s giveaway(s). Many will enter, not as many will win, but with the number of prizes we have available the odds may be more in your favor than you think. However for our many international readers, I need to apologize. We’ve not been able to do international giveaways, and the 20th anniversary giveaway is no different. AnandTech/Purch is too big to do a clandestine giveaway, and that means we need to follow all of the relevant local laws on giveaways. And, as it turns out, there are a lot of countries out there who either dislike giveaways or require that someone in their country wins a giveaway in order for it to be offered there. As a result, we’re only able to open these giveaways to residents of the United States. I’m genuinely sorry we can’t offer anything outside of the United States, but I hope you can understand. Anyhow, for our first giveaway I thought it was only appropriate that we go full-circle and start back where AnandTech itself started: AMD. The AnandTech 20th Anniversary - AMD Giveaway Altogether, AMD has given us 6 prizes to hand out: a Ryzen 7 1800X, a Ryzen 5 1600X, or one of four Radeon RX 570 video cards. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X & Ryzen 5 1600X The Ryzen 7 1800X and Ryzen 5 1600X are AMD’s top 8-core and 6-core processors respectively, forming the backbone of their new Ryzen CPU family. Marking a rather dramatic turnaround for the company in the CPU space, the Zen architecture has massively improved AMD’s IPC and overall single-threaded performance, changing the competitive landscape of the CPU space almost overnight.   AMD Ryzen Prizes   Cores/ Threads Base/ Turbo L3 TDP Ryzen 7 1800X 8/16 3.6/4.0 16 MB 95 W Ryzen 5 1600X 6/12 3.6/4.0 16 MB 95 W As our own Ian Cutress put it in his Ryzen 5 review: “for anyone wanting to do intense CPU work, the Ryzen gets a nod here. Twelve threads are hard to miss at this price point”. AMD isn’t able to exceed Intel’s single-threaded performance, but the release of a powerful processor with so many cores has served to make the x86 market a lot more interesting. AMD Radeon RX 570 Meanwhile AMD also sent over 4 different Radeon RX 570 cards, each from one of their different board partners: Gigabyte, MSI, ASUS, and PowerColor. Gigabyte AORUS Radeon RX 570 MSI Radeon RX 570 Gaming X ASUS ROG Strix Radeon RX 570 PowerColor Red Devil Radeon RX 570 Gallery: AMD Radeon RX 570 Giveaway Cards The Radeon RX 570 is AMD’s recently-launched SKU for mainstream 1080p gaming. The cards all offer 32 CUs, 4GB of VRAM, and clockspeeds of 1244MHz or better. All of the cards are open air type coolers, with 3 of the cards using a dual fan configuration, while PowerColor’s card takes it up a notch with three fans. In our review of the RX 570, we found that the cards put up good numbers for a 1080p card, and should be able to handle 1080p gaming with few-if-any compromises, making it the cornerstone of an excellent gaming PC.

In a letter sent to Trump on Wednesday, the firms said the deal benefits U.S. companies by putting them on an even playing field with foreign competitors, creates jobs through clean energy work and minimizes the risks climate change poses to them.  “We believe that as other countries invest in advanced technologies and move forward with the Paris agreement, the United States can best exercise global leadership and advance U.S. interests by remaining a full partner in this vital global effort,” the companies wrote. ADVERTISEMENT Companies signing the letter included foreign firms like BP and Shell, gas and electricity provider National Grid, California utility PG&E, tech giants like Google and Microsoft, Wal-Mart, General Mills and others.  The letter comes as the White House mulls continued involvement in the Paris climate deal, an international agreement reached during the Obama administration to cut global greenhouse gas emissions.  Most companies that have taken a position on the deal have urged the U.S. to stay in it, though some coal companies are pushing Trump to leave the pact. Wednesday’s letter, organized by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, presents a similar message other companies have delivered to the White House: The Paris deal gives the U.S. the chance to influence international climate work and energy markets. The firms say that leverage protects companies, which will already be looking for opportunities to take advantage of a global economy focused on tackling climate change.   “Climate change presents U.S. companies with both business risks and business opportunities,” they wrote. “U.S. business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response. We believe the Paris Agreement provides such a framework." Tags BP Shell National Grid PG&E Google Intel Microsoft Walmart General Mills Paris climate deal   View the discussion thread.

By Chris Lange April 26, 2017 8:55 am EDT Print Email Tweet Semiconductor trends are considered to be leading indicators of technology and broader electronics demand. In a wider sense, semiconductor and tech stocks are considered to be leading indicators for the markets in general. A strong rally in the tech sector has pushed many of these companies to new highs, and both the Dow and S&P have recently pushed back near all-time highs on the back of a series of strong earnings reports. There are potentially more positive reports coming out this week with the likes of Alphabet and Amazon reporting on Thursday. The April 13 short interest data have been compared with the previous report. Short interest moves were mixed in these selected semiconductor stocks. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) saw its short interest decrease to 92.29 million shares. The previous level was 93.26 million. Shares were last seen at $36.87, in a 52-week trading range of $29.50 to $38.45. The number of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) shares short increased to 119.42 million from the previous level of 111.32 million. Shares recently traded at $13.49, in a 52-week range of $3.45 to $15.55. Note that, like Intel, AMD is one of the most shorted Nasdaq stocks. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) saw the number of its shares short drop to 15.98 million, compared to the 16.70 million reported in the previous period. Shares were changing hands at $53.00, in a 52-week range of $50.11 to $71.62. Short interest in Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) jumped to 13.35 million shares. The previous reading was 12.66 million. Shares were trading at $40.79, in a 52-week range of $19.46 to $40.87. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) saw its short interest rise only slightly to 43.60 million shares from the previous reading of 43.41 million. Shares were trading at $26.99, in a 52-week range of $9.35 to $29.87. And the short interest in Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) decreased to 3.70 million shares in the period, from the previous 3.92 million. Shares were last seen at $223.20, in a 52-week range of $139.18 to $227.75.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile There’s one impressive next-gen Galaxy S8 feature the iPhone 8 likely won’t match Image Source: Moe Slah, ConceptsiPhone Zach Epstein @zacharye April 26th, 2017 at 8:49 AM Share Tweet When it comes to smartphones, there are so many key areas that are important to users. Design, software, apps, battery life, price, and performance are all key factors, as is speed. And when it comes to speed, Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are the two fastest Android phones that have been released to date. They utilize new 10nm octa-core processors, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 in the US and Samsung’s Exynos 8895 elsewhere. They also sport the most optimized version yet of the Samsung Experience, formerly known as TouchWiz. But there’s another factor that contributes to smartphone speed, and a new report suggests Samsung’s just-released Galaxy S8 will smoke the iPhone 8 when it’s released later this year. Don't Miss: New rumor says everything we know about the iPhone 8 release is wrong There’s plenty we think we know about Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8, which is expected to be announced this September alongside new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models. To mark the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone’s release, Apple will reportedly give the iPhone a complete design overhaul. The home button will be removed from the phone’s face, and the screen-to-body ratio is expected to be even more impressive than the 83% achieved by Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+. We can also likely look forward to a new Touch ID scanner embedded in the display, new cameras on the front and back, nifty new augmented reality features, 3D scanning features, and a lightning-fast A11 processor. But where speed is concerned, it appears as though there’s one thing we shouldn’t expect: Gigabit LTE. In a speculative piece published this week, CNET noted that Apple’s upcoming new iPhones may not support the new faster wireless standard carriers are currently working to roll out. Dubbed “Gigabit LTE” because of its theoretical 1Gbps top data transfer speed, the new standard is already being tested by wireless carriers in the United States. Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ include support for the new faster wireless standard, and several other Android phones that launch in 2017 will also be compatible with Gigabit LTE. Apple’s iPhone 8, however, may not support the faster download and upload speeds offered by Gigabit LTE. As CNET pointed out, Apple uses modems built by both Qualcomm and Intel in its current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. Should Apple continue to utilize both suppliers, only one of the iPhone 8’s modems — the Qualcomm model — will support Gigabit LTE. As a result, Apple may intentionally slow the Qualcomm model to match the performance of the Intel model, as it has allegedly done with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. “This is not an area where Apple should want to cede competitive ground to Google and Samsung,” GlobalData analyst Avi Greengart told CNET. Operating on the assumption that this speculation turns out to be accurate, does it really matter? Does it matter if Apple decides to “cede competitive ground” to it Android rivals in 2017? Probably not Smartphone data connections aren’t like home internet connections, where capacity is important because multiple devices are utilizing available bandwidth. If you run a speed test on your smartphone right now, you might see speeds of 30Mbps, 40Mbps or even more. Those are blazing-fast speeds, but it’s only important to a degree. First, there aren’t very many mobile services that are even capable of using speeds that fast — just like how large file downloads on your home computer might only hit 5Mbps even though you have a 100Mbps connection. Beyond that, any service that actually does utilize faster Gigabit LTE speeds would devour data caps in no time. What about unlimited plans? Sorry, but they’re all capped as well. The amount of full-speed data varies from one carrier to the next, but all unlimited plans include soft-caps of less than 30GB per billing period. After that, data speeds are likely to be throttled. Down the road, next-gen technologies like Gigabit LTE and 5G will be crucial because more data-hungry services like live-streamed VR will roll out, and soft caps on “unlimited” data plans will be adjusted to accommodate them. But we’re not there yet, and we won’t get there anytime this year. Keep that in mind when Apple unveils the iPhone 8 (or iPhone Edition, or iPhone Pro, or whatever Apple decides to call it) this coming September.

Internet companies are readying for a showdown with telecoms and a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: Net neutrality. Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favorites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use — can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports. EARLY TECH RESISTANCE The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn't standing still — and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for start-ups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback. Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was "extremely well received," according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality "on a public policy basis." WHAT COMES NEXT The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to "blacklist" sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an "internet slowdown" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a "site loading" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. For the moment, though, there's no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won't be until there's an actual FCC proposal up for debate. And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. "Next steps haven't been figured out yet," Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. "I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver," said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.

Locally, Goodman-Bhyat recently published IntheFlow – Taking Mindfulness to Work, the result of her years-long research into the impact of implementing mindfulness practices in the workplace. Business leaders have backed the six-prompt formula that forms the basis of the guide and it was listed in the Top 10 Best South African Business Books for 2016. IntheFlow provides a way for leaders and teams to incorporate elements of mindfulness into their everyday lives and their workplaces. Allon Raiz, CEO of Raizcorp, noted that Goodman-Bhyat had managed to build the bridge between the hectic chaos of everyday business and the clarity and serenity that being present, and in the moment, brings. Putting it into practice “IntheFlow takes quite an ethereal concept and makes it practical for people to understand and, more importantly, to apply,” he noted. Global studies conducted on international organisations (including Fortune 500 companies) show a 19% decrease in stress, 37% increase in productivity, 40% increase in focus, 34% increase in emotional control and 37% decrease in feeling overwhelmed in companies where mindfulness practices have been introduced. And a recent study found that participants in six- to nine-week mindfulness courses experience a 42% stress reduction, as well as improvement in productivity, time management and job satisfaction. Goodman-Bhyat says introducing mindfulness practices in the workplace do not take massive amounts of time, strategising or financial investment. “But it does take commitment and championing by leaders who are invested in shifting perspectives and changing the status quo of ‘how we do things around here’. “When this happens, impact on an organisation’s wellness – from individual level to company performance, is indisputable.” Following the lead of their global counterparts, South African organisations are also starting to pay attention to the benefits of incorporating mindfulness-based programmes and principles in their work environments. Large corporations such as Woolworths and Old Mutual, as well as medium-sized and entrepreneurial businesses are investigating options for mindfulness-based training, leadership development, or group learning sessions. “Further, more and more executive education, MBA and leadership development courses conducted at South Africa’s top tertiary institutions are offering mindfulness training as an integral part of their curricula, so it’s inevitable that the concepts will start trickling into the business environment,” Goodman-Bhyat says.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Global Next Generation Memory Market to grow at a Outstanding CAGR of 66.63% during the period 2017-2021 Summary Orbis Research Inclusive Report: Global Next Generation Memory Market Report has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. Description Markets and Trends– Global Next Generation Memory Market 2017-2021 The Following Companies as the Key Players in the Global Next Generation Memory Market: Cypress Semiconductor, Fujitsu, Intel, IBM, Micron Technology, ROHM Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics, Texas Instruments, and Toshiba. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Adesto Technologies, Crossbar, and Everspin Technologies. Commenting on the report: “One trend in market is growing emergence of new FeRAM design using CMOS processes. Researchers have designed flexible FeRAM devices using state-of-the-art CMOS processes that involve sputtering, photolithography, and reactive ion etching. Their research led to a reduction in the gap between a rigid, inflexible semiconductor, which has high integration density, performance, and yield, and highly flexible polymer/hybrid materials that are low-performance electronics. To reduce the thickness of traditional silicon wafers and make electronics flexible, researchers used the existing standard CMOS fabrication processes.” Enquir For Global Next Generation Memory Market Research Report At: http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/enquiry-before-buying/256319 According to the report, one driver in market is low power consumption. Next-generation memory technologies are mostly used in battery-powered wireless sensors, as they consume approximately 50% less power than other flash memories. This increases the battery life, leading to a reduction in maintenance costs. Thus, vendors in the market get the advantage to compete based on prices. Moreover, due to lesser power consumptions, users prefer buying devices integrated with the next-generation memory technologies as their expenses also get reduced. In addition, next-generation memory technologies have the unique feature of a faster wake-up time. They also eliminate the need for data saving and restoring, unlike other flash memories. This gives next-generation memory technologies an additional benefit over other RAMs, along with the advantage of lower power consumption. Next-generation memory technologies help in the automatic update of systems, especially in wireless applications. All these factors attract device manufacturers and end-users, which will drive the adoption of these technologies during the forecast period. Further, the report states that one challenges in market is cyclical nature of semiconductor industry. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry affects operating results of equipment vendors due to severe downturns. The equipment manufacturers face risks such as overcapacity, low demand, and high price competition. Changes in customer requirements due to new manufacturing capacity and advances in technology affect equipment manufacturers considerably. Semiconductor manufacturing equipment vendors are largely affected by their capital expenditure. Device manufacturers reduce their capital expenditure and demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment during the overcapacity period. During the cyclical period, there is a reduction in purchases, delay in delivery dates, and order cancellations by customers. This, in turn, results in reduction of net sales, backlogs, delays in revenue recognition, and excess inventory for the vendors, which poses a major threat to vendors’ operations. In addition, the high price competition due to their low demand in the market affects their gross margins. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman ‘Life in Space’ Challenge Winners Aim to Improve Health Outcomes on the International Space Station by Sarah Murry SOURCE: HP, Inc. DESCRIPTION: When pondering the challenge of how to make astronauts’ lives better on the International Space Station, the winners of the “Life in Space” Challenge went back to basics. The winning team of five students from Carnegie Mellon University looked at how astronauts working on the International Space Station (ISS) spent their days. It turns out, they spend nearly two hours of their 12-hour shifts exercising – not only for good health, but to prevent muscle degeneration and mobility loss that would otherwise happen over time in an atmosphere with little-to-no gravity. In fact, astronauts lose almost 20 percent of their muscle mass due to prolonged exposure to microgravity conditions, which can be a serious health threat when missions on the ISS average about six months. “We wanted to tackle the problem by figuring out how the astronauts could do something throughout the day that A CAD rendering of the „Muscle Maximus” exoskeleton.could benefit their bodies but wouldn’t be too obtrusive,” said Kevin Yu, a member of the winning team and a mechanical engineering student at Carnegie Mellon. The “Muscle Maximus,” the Carnegie Mellon team’s winning product, was designed using HP ZBook Studio Mobile Workstations, powered by Intel® Core i7® processors. They won the challenge for proposing an innovative design for an “exoskeleton” (it looks a bit like human armor) that would apply resistance to an astronaut’s joints and muscles as he or she moved throughout their day on the ISS.  The contest kicked off in February with HP and Intel engaging with teams of engineering students from Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech, Ohio State, University of Texas, Oregon State University, Arizona State University, Virginia Tech University and Clemson University. Their mission: Develop a manufacturable product that can help improve the lives of astronauts in space. The finalist teams delivered a range of creative ideas, from a retractable-blade tape dispenser (these simple devices are too sharp to be safely used on the ISS and are currently banned) to a kind of mobile workbench so all of an astronaut’s tools can be tethered safely but also remain at hand. See the winning team’s video pitch. In addition to reducing exercise time, Carnegie Mellon’s Muscle Maximus is self-sustaining and doesn’t require any outside power source. Because it targets four major muscle groups, the device would also reduce the number of machines needed for exercise, freeing up more space in the ISS. The Carnegie Mellon team attributes their success to the diversity of thought and variety of science disciplines among their ranks, which included biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering and computational design students. Diane Turnshek, department of physics faculty advisor who lead the team, said that their concept beat out the competition because it not only could have immediate, measurable impact on the lives of astronauts on the ISS, but it could also be used by the Earth-bound who need help maintaining mobility. “One of the best parts of the competition is that NASA joined HP and Intel on the judging panel, and that they will continue to research and carry forward this idea so that it might become a reality.” Tweet me: .@HP’s #LifeInSpace Challenge Winners Aim to Improve #Health on @Space_Station http://bit.ly/2osq8Zk @CarnegieMellon @HPSustainable KEYWORDS: Innovation & Technology, Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, HP Inc, Life in Space Challenge, HP ZBook Studio Mobile Workstations, International Space Station (ISS), Muscle Maximus CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Every Drop Counts: Five Water-Saving Strategies from the Carlsberg Group’s Chinese Breweries Next PostNext Automotive Fuel Tank Market 2015-2022 Outlook Research Report Search Recent Posts GiftsbyMeeta Revamped the Gifts for Him Category on the Websit New Bobby Backpack Anti-Theft Backpack Launched For the daily commute In Crowded Trains, Buses and Busy Streets Maid Employment Agency in Singapore with over 30 years of experience offer families an easy way to find the best maid ONLY 2 Days Left for Reolink Argus Crowdfunding – Last Chance to Back/Win It Now Inaugural Medical Capital Innovation Competition Winners Announced Proudly powered by WordPress

April 27, 2017 02:40 AM NEW YORK (AP) — The head of the country's telecommunications regulator says there will be a vote in May on ditching Obama-era "net neutrality" rules that keep telecoms from favoring some sites and apps. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said in a Wednesday speech that he wants to ditch the legal basis for the net neutrality rules that regulated internet service as a utility, like phone service. He also wants to eliminate the FCC's broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&T and Comcast for bad behavior.

Description Research Report – Global Data Center Security Market 2017-2021 The Following Companies As The Key Players In The Global Data Center Security Market: Bosch Security Systems, Check Point Software Technologies, Cisco Systems, Fortinet, Honeywell International, Intel, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Trend Micro, and Tyco International. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Allegion, Arecont Vision, Assa Abloy, Axis Communications, Boon Edam, Byremote, Digitus Biometrics, EMKA, Exacq Technologies, FutureNet Security Solutions, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Hurricane Fence Company, MOXA, and Perimeter Protective System. Commenting on the report : “One trend in market is increase in the use of Docker container technology. Docker containers aid in the deployment of distributed applications easily. Many enterprises are adopting Docker container technologies by moving their applications from VMs. Several CSPs, managed hosting services, and Linux vendors are supporting container technology as an alternative to virtualization.These containers use shared operating systems instead of virtualizing hardware, which is proving to be more efficient than hypervisors with regard to the use of the system’s resources. The increased use of container technologies is also compelling vendors to focus on providing better security. As many CSPs and managed hosting services facilitate the move to Docker container technology, the need for security by the vendors will be a major revenue booster for the market.” According to the report, one driver in market is growing construction of data center facilities. There is a trend among enterprises to adopt cloud-based services for at least one of the operational needs of their businesses. In terms of cloud infrastructure, the CSPs are rapidly expanding their availability zones to come closer to the customer to reduce network latency and facilitate high-availability services. The major CSPs involved in the construction of data centers include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Aliyun (Alibaba Group). These CSPs are involved in the construction of mega data center facilities that can operate thousands of IT infrastructures. In 2016, Amazon Web Services added 11 availability zones out of which five were in the Americas, two in EMEA, and four in APAC. In 2016, Google opened two data centers in Oregon (US) and Japan. Microsoft opened data centers in the UK and Germany. It is also attempting to operate data centers under water on a trial basis. IBM opened data centers in the Nordic region and South Africa. Aliyun opened four data center in Australia, Dubai, Germany, and Japan.

Most of the applications belonging to organizations are vulnerable to attacks by cyber criminals due to the rapid adoption of cloud-based services, big data analytics, and IoT. The application layer is prone to more security risks as the number of connected devices increases. The open infrastructure of the Internet has increased privacy and security risks. Cyber attacks are leading to the loss of critical business data and also damaging the physical infrastructure of the data center. Many data center are identifying several attempts from hackers to gain access to critical information. This is also shooting up the OPEX that accounts for the resources needed to recover from such security breaches. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Plus investors were waiting for the first-quarter earnings reporting season to begin. Judging by the most shorted stocks traded on the Nasdaq, short sellers seemed comfortable overall. Moves in those shorted stocks were mostly positive between the March 31 and April 13 settlement dates. AMD saw one of the most notable gains, while short interest in rival Intel shrank marginally. But it was BlackBerry that led the trend, with double-digit percentage growth in the number of shares short in those two weeks. However, it just missed making the top six. Note that still only three Nasdaq stocks had more than 100 million shares short, as of the middle of this month. However, two of them remain very far ahead of the pack. Sirius XM The more than 266.00 million Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SIRI) shares short by mid-April was more than 1% higher than on the previous settlement date. That was only the second period so far this year in which the number of shares short grew, and it was 17.2% of the total float. At the most recent average daily volume, it would take more than 13 days to cover all short positions. JPMorgan downgraded Sirius, but that was after the short interest period. The stock ended the first two weeks of the month less than 1% lower, while the Nasdaq retreated almost 2% between the settlement dates. After hitting a 52-week high of $5.53 last month, the stock closed om Tuesday at $5.20 a share. The 52-week low of $3.74 was seen last summer. Frontier Communications After pulled back almost 8% in the previous period, the number of shares short in Frontier Communications Corp. (NASDAQ: FTR) rose around 2% to almost 257.30 million as of the most recent settlement date. That was 22.1% of the telecom’s float, as well as the 16th consecutive period with more than 200 million shares short. The daily average volume dropped sharply, and the days to cover jumped from around three to about seven. Concerns about whether Frontier can maintain its dividend have held the stock back recently. The share price was down more than 9% by the middle of this month. The stock has fallen further since then, and it hit a 52-week low of $1.84 last week. The 52-week high of $5.70 was seen about a year ago. The shares closed most recently at $1.96 apiece. AMD By the middle of April, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) had almost 119.42 million shares short. That was a gain of more than 7% from the total on the previous settlement date, and it represented 14.4% of the company’s float. Note that short interest has grown in seven of the past nine periods. And it still would take less than two days to cover all short positions. During the period, Goldman Sachs predicted the stock would underperform, and the April 13 share price was more than 15% lower than on the previous settlement date. The stock has reclaimed some of that ground since and closed at $13.49 on Tuesday, about 19% higher year to date. Shares have changed hands at between $3.18 and $15.55 in the past year.

On the back of a strong outlook for the global economy and steady worldwide growth in new car sales, Daimler raised its overall forecast, saying revenue, sales and pre-tax profit would "increase significantly" in 2017. "We expect to significantly increase group sales this year and achieve a new record," chief finance officer Bodo Uebber told reporters. Net profit in the three months to the end of March doubled to 2.70 billion euros ($2.96 billion) from EUR1.35 billion the year before, driven by sharply higher Mercedes-Benz sales of SUVs and E-class models. Revenue rose 11% to EUR38.8 billion as unit sales rose 10% to 754,259 cars, trucks, vans and buses. There were few surprises in the numbers after Daimler released preliminary figures on April 11, which showed that strong sales at Mercedes-Benz cars and one-off gains including the sale of a 15% stake in digital mapping service Here to Intel Corp drove earnings higher in the quarter. After release of the detailed report, analysts noted that the lion's share of additional earnings momentum is likely to come from vans and financial services, while the outlook for cars and trucks remains unchanged. Daimler shares were trading about 1.4% higher at EUR68.70 in Frankfurt. Daimler continues to produce strong profit growth even as the company invests heavily in new models and new technology to develop self-driving cars and digital mobility services. In the face of the steep costs to develop self-driving cars, Daimler recently announced it would team up with supplier Bosch GmbH to develop technology for robo-taxis, self-driving taxis, that could launch at the beginning of the next decade. Mr. Uebber declined to comment on ongoing investigations in the U.S. and Germany over allegations that Mercedes-Benz may have installed cheat devices to manipulate emissions in some of its diesel vehicles. Daimler warned in its interim report that it couldn't rule out that U.S. authorities could conclude that Mercedes-Benz employed illegal defeat devices. But Mr. Uebber characterized the statement as standard information about potential risks for the company's investors. Daimler has repeatedly maintained that the company didn't engage in the kind of emissions fraud to which Volkswagen AG (VOW.XE)pleaded guilty to in the U.S. and agreed to pay nearly $25 billion in fines, penalties, fees and compensation for consumers. Mr. Uebber said the company expects an increase of 1% to 2% in global new car sales, with slight growth in China, steady demand at about 17 million cars and light trucks in the U.S., and a slowdown of growth in Western Europe after the strong recovery in recent years. Strong demand for the GLC crossover, GLC coupe, the GLA and E-Class coupe is expected to drive sales at Mercedes-Benz to a record high in 2017, Daimler said. Sales of Daimler Trucks are expected to be at the previous year's level, benefiting from steady demand in North America and Europe and a stabilization of demand in Brazil. Daimler forecast that pre-tax profit at Mercedes-Benz would be significantly higher in 2017, while earnings at Daimler Trucks and Daimler Vans would dip slightly below the previous year. Daimler said earnings at Daimler Buses and the financial services unit would be slightly higher this year.

Call of Duty: World War 2 Release Date, Campaign, and Private Beta Officially Revealed For starters, there’s the Call of Duty: World War 2 Pro Edition. While Call of Duty fan site Charlie Intel states that it is exclusive to GameStop in the US, it is unknown which retailers in India or internationally will have it exclusively. Call of Duty: World War 2 Pro Edition contents: Call of Duty: World War 2 game Call of Duty: World War 2 season pass Call of Duty: World War 2 collectible steelbook Additional bonus content A season pass for Call of Duty: World War 2 is a no-brainer, as is a steelbook. They’re both items previous entries have had. Bonus content possibly refers to cosmetic items such as weapon skins. We won’t be surprised to see another, more premium edition of the game as well. And unless it leaks shortly, it will probably be revealed tonight. Photo Credit: Charlie Intel   Furthermore, pre-ordering the game at GameStop US will get you a limited edition hat. And no, pre-orders for Call of Duty: World War 2 have not started in India yet. Traditionally, distributor World Wide CD ROM finalises details for the country after E3 and Gamescom. We should see pre-orders start from September like we did with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. The official Call of Duty: World War 2 reveal is on April 26 at 10am PT (10:30pm IST), however it seems that much like Destiny 2 and Battlefield 1, the flurry of leaks set to unravel any kind of surprise Activision has in store.

Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Amazon together account for 90% of global demand for direct-sale servers and the reshuffle is related to Intel's planned launch of server CPU platform Purley in 2017, the sources said. Microsoft has unveiled server models developed through cooperation with Open Compute Project under Project Olympus, Microsoft's next-generation hyperscale cloud computing hardware design and a new model for open source hardware development, the sources noted. Project Olympus' hardware partners are Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Taiwan-based ODM Wistron's wholly owned subsidiary Wiwynn, the sources indicated. In addition, HPE's server OEM is Taiwan-based Foxconn Electronics. Facebook originally procured servers mainly from Quanta Computer but has shifted part of its orders to Wiwynn. While Inventec is currently the main supplier of servers for Google, Quanta has been actively competing for orders from Google and has expanded server production capacities in North America and Europe.

But Ireland is much more than payments and blockchain, in fact, IoT is starting to gain more ground. Ireland is the home to Intel, Google, Accenture’s AI Lab, several research institutions and universities as well as having a “reasonable” cost of living (as compared to SF, NYC, and London that is), Dublin is well suited to become a growing IoT hub. After spending time in Dublin and speaking at the Dublin Tech Summit, I found that IoT was one of the key themes of the conference with 20+ talks and panels geared towards the topic. During my time in Dublin, I met with a dozen of IoT startups at the conference and from Dog Patch Labs and here are a few key themes that emerged: Connectivity Is Still A Thing SiteSpy, a smart sensor powered by renewable energy that allows users to measure the exact location and orientation of objects – super useful for mobile network operators who need to know the exact positioning of their antennae. IoT Platforms Are Going Strong  Wia is a cloud platform that enables developers to build IoT apps, and Cesanta uses software libraries and embedded solutions to allow seamless communication between apps, devices, and machines. Ag-tech is Big This makes sense given Ireland’s landscape. Haysaver is a device that analyzes agricultural matter and looks at the nutritional value of feed as well as hay bale combustion, a problem that results in the death of livestock and destruction of food.

Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they’d very much like subscribers to use — can’t slow down Netflix or block YouTube. NEW YORK >> Internet companies are readying for a showdown with telecoms and a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favorites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they’d very much like subscribers to use — can’t slow down Netflix, can’t block YouTube, and can’t charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports. EARLY TECH RESISTANCE The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn’t standing still — and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry’s giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback. Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was “extremely well received,” according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn’t hurt it because it’s now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality “on a public policy basis.” WHAT COMES NEXT The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet’s most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to “blacklist” sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an “internet slowdown” event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a “site loading” icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. For the moment, though, there’s no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won’t be until there’s an actual FCC proposal up for debate. And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. “Next steps haven’t been figured out yet,” Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. “I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,” said Engine’s executive director, Evan Engstrom.

The telecom industry’s lobbying muscle pushed a consumer privacy measure to a swift death in Congress. Republicans struck down Obama-era rules that would have imposed tight restrictions on what broadband companies. (AP) NEW YORK: Internet companies are readying for a showdown with telecoms and a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favorites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use — can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports. Early Tech Resistance The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn't standing still — and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. Calm Before The Storm The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback. Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was "extremely well received," according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality "on a public policy basis." What Comes Next The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to "blacklist" sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an "internet slowdown" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a "site loading" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. For the moment, though, there's no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won't be until there's an actual FCC proposal up for debate. And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. "Next steps haven't been figured out yet," Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. "I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver," said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.

However, Vietnam’s IT human resources are alarmingly lacking both in quantity and quality, as commented by deputy prime minister Vu Duc Dam. Lack of human resources “To expand production, in the first recruiting batch of 2017, we are recruiting thousands of engineers and bachelors who graduated or will graduate before December 31, 2017,” read Samsung Vietnam’s latest announcement in March 2017. Samsung currently has eight centres and factories with more than 150,000 million employees over the world.  However, they require a huge amount of manpower in order to achieve their development plan. FPT Software has brought 10,000 staff on board, raising the total number to ten per cent of the total domestic IT human resources. To carry out the growth plan during the 2017-2020 period, chairman of FPT Software Hoang Nam Tien emphasised that they target to recruit 20,000 staff to all positions of managers, programmers, bridge software engineers, comtors, and project managers.  Many of these positions will offer high salary and work abroad, such as long-term employment opportunities in Japan with salary ranging from $2.800-$3.000 a month. “We have an advantage in  digital transformation capacity and the rapid scalability of human resources of 30-40 per cent per year,” said Tien. FPT Corporation is looking to recruit nearly 50,000 personnel for the positions of student interns, managers, senior leaders in the areas of engineering, technology, and economics by 2020. The demand for IT personnel is growing rapidly in Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT), Viettel, CMC, and a series of IT software companies, domestic startups, and multinational corporations operating in Vietnam, such as Samsung, LG, Intel, and IBM, to meet the demand to expand production and new orders. According to the latest report by VietnamWorks on the Vietnamese IT sector in 2017, manpower demand hit an unprecedented peak with roughly 15,000 job postings in 2016. As predicted by VietnamWorks, given that 80,000 IT employees will graduate from school in 2017-2018, Vietnam is projected to face a critical manpower shortage of 70,000 IT staff. As by 2020, the shortage will increase by 500,000 employees. According to the Ministry of Information and Communications, the total current IT manpower is over 600,000 employees. Of this number, employees working in the hardware industry make up about 300,000.  The remaining staff are working in the field of software industry and digital content creation. Vietnam is forecasted to require 1.2 million IT employees by 2020. Poor quality Not only the shortage of manpower, the quality of IT human resources is also cause for concern. At LG’s factory in Hai Phong, IT engineers working at the R&D centre have to further train and transfer in three years, workers involved in quality testing or product warranties must train from four months to a year, while assembly line workers will work after one month of training. At FPT, university graduate IT engineers are obliged to re-train for a year. To deal with training and re-training issues, Samsung has invested more than VND38 billion ($1.8 million) in supporting Vietnamese universities to develop high-quality IT human resources, while Huawei also spent more than $2 million on social programmes, mostly focusing on training and human resources development. At a recent meeting with FPT University, Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam pointed out that the demand for human resources in the IT industry has increased dramatically, while the number of university and college graduates is very limited and falls far below the requirements of enterprises. An important reason pointed out by the deputy prime minister is that “the higher education environment does not meet the needs of businesses and the economy.” Nguyen Thanh Nam, vice president of FPT University, said that the IT industry is developing, changing day by day, so authorities should compile a reasonable training plan in the shortest time so that ordinary people can also participate in the fourth industrial revolution. Minister of Information and Communications Truong Minh Tuan also affirmed that he will concentrate all resources to support, train, and develop human resources specialised in electronics, telecommunications, information technology, and information security.  He said the goal is not only to focus on quantity, but also to ensure the quality of expertise and especially to have the necessary soft skills and good foreign language skills to integrate further into the global technology market. “In 2017, the Ministry will work closely with the Ministry of Education and Training to ensure the IT and telecommunication human resources training will be closely linked to market demand and technological development trends in the world. Moreover, training activities, scientific research and activities be closely linked to  needs of enterprises in the field of IT and telecommunications will,” Minister Truong Minh Tuan said.

Tech companies are readying for a showdown with a Republican-controlled government over threats to net neutrality, a key issue for them and their users. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Internet companies are readying for a showdown with a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said in a Wednesday speech that he wants to ditch the Obama-era rules, hated by telecoms, that prevent broadband and wireless companies from interfering with the sites and apps that consumers use. He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC's broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&T and Comcast for bad behavior. Pai, the nation's chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. The FCC plans to release an official proposal for the vote on Thursday. Pai doesn't have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality, but is seeking input on how to "approach" its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net-neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use — can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality. EARLY TECH RESISTANCE The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn't stood still as Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called up small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, earlier called on Pai to support net neutrality, and Wednesday issued a statement warning that his changes would "result in a worse internet for consumers." Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was "extremely well received," according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck.

Tech companies are readying for a showdown with a Republican-controlled government over threats to net neutrality, a key issue for them and their users. Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File AP Photo Business April 26, 2017 3:13 PM FCC chief lays out attack on 'net neutrality' rules By TALI ARBEL Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK Internet companies are readying for a showdown with a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said in a Wednesday speech that he wants to ditch the Obama-era rules, hated by telecoms, that prevent broadband and wireless companies from interfering with the sites and apps that consumers use. He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC's broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&T and Comcast for bad behavior. Pai, the nation's chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. The FCC plans to release an official proposal for the vote on Thursday. Pai doesn't have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality, but is seeking input on how to "approach" its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net-neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use — can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality. EARLY TECH RESISTANCE The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn't stood still as Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called up small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, earlier called on Pai to support net neutrality, and Wednesday issued a statement warning that his changes would "result in a worse internet for consumers." Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was "extremely well received," according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality "on a public policy basis." WHAT COMES NEXT The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to "blacklist" sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an "internet slowdown" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a "site loading" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. But until Wednesday, there had been no net-neutrality development to rally around. "Next steps haven't been figured out yet," Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. "I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver," said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.

All he wanted was for Future Barry to reveal Savitar’s identity, but what he got was something very different. Disclosure time: I fully expected to hate “The Once and Future Flash.” All season long, Barry has made things worse when he travels through time. Why would an adventure to the future be any different? We still don’t know what the long-term ramifications of his visit will be, but as things stand right now, I’d classify his trek a success. We’ll have to wait and see if his visit does more good than harm or not. Image via The CW It will be complicated, at least, because the future that Barry traveled to will likely cease to exist now that he’s been there, regardless of whether he’s able to save Iris or not. In the meantime, his presence helped bring lost souls back together again. He didn’t know it, but Barry went on a rescue mission to save Iris, but he also ended up saving the future Team Flash. In the end, this future quest was different than those before. Barry was able to get information which actually could help save Iris, unlike his vibes to the future which only provided unrelated facts about future events. Now, he has “actionable intel.” What a buzz phrase these days… In the future, Barry found a dismantled Team Flash with the team members shattered by Iris’ death (except for HR who remained his cheerful, artistic self). Barry abandoned his speedster identity, his family and team to suffer the loss of his true love alone even though he eventually trapped Savitar away. The West family was left in shambles. Joe drowned in his depression. Kid Flash was no more after a traumatizing battle with Savitar left Wally with a shattered spine. Joe was then responsible for caring for his shell of son, Wally, and continued to visit Iris’ grave without Barry by their sides. The most shocking revelation was that Caitlin turned against Team Flash in the present day as Killer Frost and partnered with Savitar. It’s unclear if she helped take Iris’ life or not, but at some point, she did destroy Cisco’s hands, eliminating his ability to vibe. But the sting was really that one of their own betrayed them, and continued to in the future. She could have helped Barry by revealing Savitar’s identity, but she was too far gone and instead taunted him. Image via The CW While it’s odd that Future Barry never figured out Savitar’s identity even though he trapped him, it may not really matter in the quest to save Iris. Barry came back with a promising lead on how to trap Savitar in 2017. He has the speed trap device Future Barry used and the name of the scientist who created it. If he can find Tracy Brand and she has the knowledge to deconstruct it, perhaps Team Flash will be able to save Iris. But Team Flash also has another team member to save as well: Caitlin. She in a dangerous predicament with her Killer Frost persona taking over her body, and it’s even worse now that she’s with Savitar. This leads back to that important question: Who is Savitar? The list of possibilities narrowed after this hour. First, it must be someone that Caitlin knows and trusts given her reaction to his reveal. Prior to this episode, Wally was a popular guess, but since he’s in a catatonic state in the future, it’s not him. My guess has been Ronnie Raymond for a while, and given Caitlin’s now-revealed connection to Savitar, it further cements that theory for me. Ronnie has a legitimate reason to be upset with Barry for his death in the singularity. And, since Ronnie was taken from Caitlin, it would be understandable if he would want to make Barry suffer by taking Iris away. “The Once and Future Flash” used time travel to show us what a future without Iris would look like, help Barry get information he can use to actually try and save Iris, and further Caitlin’s Killer Frost story. It was emotional and intense. Most importantly, it propels the story forward for the last few episodes of the season. Image via The CW The longterm ramifications of Barry’s trip could be devastating, but in the short term, he was able to accomplish more than he possibly imagined. Rating: ★★★★★ Excellent Miscellanea:  — Julian: “2017. The year it all began.” — Killer Frost: “I’m not your friend, Flash.” — Killer Frost: “I’ll never tell. You’re gonna be so surprised when you find out.” –Barry: “I wasn’t there for you?” Joe: “Why start now? I need you to leave. Please.” –Cisco really wanted Barry to stick around. Could the technology he used to keep Barry in the future be used to slow down Savitar in the past? — Future Barry: “It will break you. She’s the love of your life, Barry. She was the love of my life.” — Team Flash! — The metas, Mirror Master and Top, causing problems in the future seemed a little out of place in the hour, but it brought future Team Flash back together again, so it worked. — Cisco: “Weird, it feels just like ‘Back to the Future — which would make me Doc Brown.” — Cisco: “Hey, you know you’re my BFF, right?” Barry: “You too, man.” — Killer Frost: “What do you need me to do?” — What did you think of Future Barry’s suit?

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Asus VivoPC X compact gaming desktop now available for $799 04/24/2017 at 10:21 AM by Brad Linder 5 Comments The Asus VivoPC X is a VR-ready desktop PC that’s about the size of a game console. It measures 11″ x 10.2″ x 3″ and weighs about 4.4 pounds. And under the hood, the system features a quad-core Intel Kaby Lake processor, NVIDIA graphics, and support for up to 16GB of RAM and dual storage. First unveiled at CES in January, the VivoPC X is now available for purchase. You can pick one up from Newegg or Amazon for $799. Amazon is also offering a VR bundle with an Oculus Rift headset and Oculus Touch controllers for $1398, but it’s actually cheaper right now to just buy the headset + controllers separately. The VivoPC X comes with a Core i5-7300HQ processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX1060 graphics, 8GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. The system features two HDMI ports, a DisplayPort, four USB 3.1 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, and has an M.2 slot for an optional solid state drive in addition to the included hard drive.

It maxes out at 16GB (Although I’m not sure if that’s actually true — the chip should support 32GB, methinks. The official spec sheet says 16GB though).

You know replaceable SSD, RAM, CPU, and (small) GPU. Because RyZen and Vega will make these systems cheap or redundant in the near future, so having it user serviceable is a much better option even if it means the total package is slightly larger.

"Post [Holdings] and Cardinal Health have one thing in common here: they're not getting enough credit for how they're trying to change their stripes with these acquisitions they just announced," the "Mad Money" host said. Post Holdings, the United States' third-largest cereal maker and the company behind Honey Bunches of Oats and Raisin Bran, is buying the United Kingdom's second-biggest cereal company, Weetabix, for £1.4 billion. Though the Street wrote the takeover off as being too pricey, Cramer sees the payoff ahead. Weetabix does business internationally, with operations in Asia and Africa, while Post gets 93 percent of its sales from the United States and the rest from Canada. "I think the international cross-selling opportunities could be enormous here," Cramer said, adding that the company is a smart acquirer that knows how to under-promise and over-deliver. Cardinal Health may have slashed its full-year earnings guidance, turning investors off to its future prospects, but Cramer sees upside ahead for its $6.1 billion acquisition of Medtronic's patient care, deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency divisions. "What really matters is that these Medtronic assets will help Cardinal Health continue to diversify itself away from that lousy drug wholesaling business that caused the darned shortfall in the first place, and they'll give the company's medical supplies segment a much needed shot in the arm," Cramer said. Furthermore, Cardinal's disappointing guidance could give the company just enough weakness to spring from, as it expects this deal to boost earnings by 55 cents in 2019. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images A pedestrian passes the bull statue in the Financial District near the New York Stock Exchange in New York. As the bull market surges higher and earnings reports continue to top expectations, Cramer turned to technician Mark Sebastian's charts to find out whether the upward move is at all sustainable. Being an expert on the CBOE Volatility Index — VIX for short — Sebastian compared the near term volatility tracker to the S&P 500 to show the strength of the market's trajectory. When centrist Emmanuel Macron came in first place in France's first-round elections Sunday, the S&P took off, rallying 1.6 percent since Friday's close. But the VIX saw an even bigger drop, cratering at the unusually low level of 10.5. "Looking at this moment through the prism of the big rally we got last November when the VIX plummeted, Sebastian thinks this is showing that we have got a lot more room to run," Cramer said. "Based on the action in the VIX, he easily sees the S&P traveling to 2,450 before it runs out of steam." Siegfried Layda | Getty Images Cramer is always up for analyzing the stock market's valuation when commentary suggests that it has run too far too quickly and is too expensive. So the "Mad Money" host decided to compare the leading stocks' future price-to-earnings multiples from 2000, when the dotcom bubble burst, to now to see whether there is any weight to the argument that today's market is too pricey. In 2000, tech giants were already running the show. Microsoft traded at 59 times earnings, Cisco at 179 times earnings, Intel at 126 times earnings and Oracle at 87 times earnings. Now, Microsoft trades at 20 times earnings, Cisco at 13 times earnings, Intel at 17 times earnings, and Oracle at 16 times earnings. "When you consider that the average stock in the S&P 500 sells for 21 times earnings, not only are these four tech stocks ridiculously undervalued versus their prices back then, they're actually cheaper than the average stock in the S&P right now," Cramer said. Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty Images A worker passes a bag of food to a customer at the drive-thru window at a McDonald's fast food restaurant in White House, Tennessee. Then, after Dow components Caterpillar, DuPont, and McDonald's surprised the Street with huge earnings gains, Cramer looked into the companies to see if their wins were real or one-offs. The market has grown used to what Cramer calls "manufactured earnings beats," or reports that come in a penny better than expected because of share buybacks or other corporate tricks. But not these companies. All three outshone expectations via execution of smart tactics that seemed out of reach several years ago, the "Mad Money" host said. Finally, Cramer spoke with Briggs & Stratton Chairman, President and CEO Todd Teske on Tuesday to gauge the company's future in light of the manufacturing stock's massive jump. Teske attributed the engine maker's success to its push into the commercial market as well as increasing sales, but said he was concerned with the United States' growing skills gap. The gap is extended by companies like Briggs & Stratton that rely on robots for a bulk portion of their manufacturing and thus require high-skilled laborers to maintain operations. "I and other manufacturing CEOs have been out there talking a lot about the fact that we need people who can run robots, program robots, CNC equipment, robotic welding and things like that," the CEO said. "It's a big issue." And while the manufacturer has training programs in place for new workers, Teske said that more should be done on a nationwide scale if the federal government tightens visa laws. "I think there's more that we need to do as a country because the skills gap is only going to get worse, especially as more jobs come back here to the U.S. if, in fact, some of the administration['s] policies start to take hold," Teske told Cramer. In Cramer's lightning round, he sped through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Magna International Inc.: "Well, you don't want to buy it for [a rumor it will work with Apple on self-driving cars] no matter what, because that's way too far in advance and if you do want autonomous driving, you know I believe in Waymo, which is Google, which is Alphabet, which is owned by my charitable trust. I think Magna is too cheap to sell, but it is related to autos and everything related to autos is stalled. But I am not going to tell you to sell it. I just can't count on buying it right here." Sprint Corp.: "Last night we had [T-Mobile CEO] John Legere on and he was lobbing his usual bombs and throwing the claymore mines around and doing the bazookas, and all I can tell you is that he had good things to say about Sprint. And in the conference call, he even talked about looking, you know, trying to figure out what to do with them, maybe Dish. I want to own Sprint." Questions for Cramer?

Digital Trends Home > Computing > AMD slips up as leak indicates its Vega GPUs are… AMD slips up as leak indicates its Vega GPUs are coming ‘this quarter’ By Mark Coppock — April 25, 2017 10:06 AM Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you've been waiting to build a new gaming PC around AMD's Vega GPU architecture, then you're wait might be coming to a close. AMD has made some waves lately with its new Zen architecture and Ryzen processors, offering a line of CPUs with competitive performance to Intel’s Core processors and even more competitive pricing. Now, AMD fans are waiting for the company to make its next move by introducing its next generation Vega GPUs. Until now, AMD hasn’t provided any information on when Vega might be officially introduced, leaving gamers waiting impatiently for stronger competition with Nvidia’s Pascal architecture. Today, however, it looks like AMD might have let the cat out of the bag, with its AMD Poland Facebook page indicating that Vega will arrive this quarter, as Wccftech.com reports. Of course, it’s entirely possible that someone at AMD Poland spoke out of turn, and so this information should be considered unverified at this point. But there’s other information that seems to confirm an imminent release, such as a Vega GPU showing in CompuBench benchmark results — something that usually happens shortly before a new component is released. In addition, AMD has now provided Vega OpenGL support for Linux, and the company has apparently devoted 80 percent of its driver engineers to Vega optimization for the past few months. Simply put, while nobody knows when Vega will arrive, there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that it’s going to show up in gaming PCs sooner rather than later. By the CompuBench results, Vega will offer at least competitive performance compared to the Nvidia GTX 1080 but significantly lower than the GTX 1080 Ti. Without knowing where in the Vega line the tested GPU is positioned, we don’t know if that’s low-end, midrange, or high-end Vega performance. Nevertheless, AMD fans should have some tantalizing options to choose from. AMD 687F:C1 GTX 1080 Ti Catmull-Clark Subdivision Level 3: 81.251 mTriangles/s 245.95 mTriangles/s Catmull-Clark Subdivision Level 5: 239.511 mTriangles/s 353.415 mTriangles/s Subsurface Scattering multiple view: 6,262.991 mSamples/s 9,610.488 mSamples/s TV-L1 Optical Flow: 56.729 mPixels/s 64.918 mPixels/s Level Set Segmentation – 128: 10,281.757 mVoxels/s N/A Level Set Segmentation – 256: 10,844.834 mVoxels/s N/A AMD recently released a new Radeon RX 500 Series of GPUs based on its current Polaris generation, and so anyone who wants decent AMD gaming performance without spending serious money has that option to consider. But otherwise, it’s looking like anyone planning on a truly high-end gaming experience won’t have too long to wait before they’ll be able to look outside of Nvidia’s lineup when choosing their next GPU.

Call of Duty: WW2 will be sold at stores, and some of the people working at those stores are so excited they’ve broken whatever NDAs they’re under to share images of newly-received marketing materials. The latest Call of Duty: WW2 retail leak, shared on Twitter by BERNiE HiGHROLLER‏ and passed on via Charlie Intel, shows off the Pro Edition, which is exclusive to GameStop in the US. According to this source, Call of Duty: WW2 Pro Edition comes with a collectible steelbook and the inevitable season pass, and “additional bonus content”, which usually means skins or multiplayer goodies. The images also make mention of a Call of Duty: WW2 PS4 beta, which is no surprise given how much Sony and Activision want to have each other’s babies. Oh, and pre-orders include an exclusive Call of Duty: WW2 hat. Like, a real world hat, not an in-game hat. I don’t think they wore snapbacks during WW2. Developed by Sledgehammer Games, Call of Duty: WW2 will be revealed at 10:00am PT/1:00pm ET/6:00pm UK April 26, so we don’t have long to wait before all this information will (probably) be freely available on retailer sites. An earlier retail leak dropped some details on Call of Duty: WW2’s campaign and standalone co-op story mode, and Activision itself accidentally leaked Call of Duty WW2 screenshots through the franchise website. Call of Duty: WW2 is expected to release on PC, PS4 and Xbox One on November 3. As usual, it will almost certainly be one of the biggest entertainment releases of the year, making every other game and most books, albums and movies look like small beans indeed. It’s no wonder Activision can’t keep a lid on it, hey.

Google parent Alphabet will provide an update that day. The search and ad giant has been in the news recently over concerns about ads appearing on inappropriate YouTube content. Amazon will also report, and we'll be looking to see if the firm can continue to push gross margins higher. Third, we have Microsoft, which has been on a roll recently, with the cloud growing quickly and legacy businesses holding their own. Intel is also due. We're expecting modest growth for the year as data center growth is offset by declines in PC sales. There are plenty of consumer firms reporting, too, including Chipotle, Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Starbucks, and Procter & Gamble. We'll get a sense of the industrial economy from Alcoa, 3M, Boeing, Ford, and GM. In healthcare, Express Scripts, Eli Lilly, and Amgen will report. And finally, oil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are due Friday. The first reading of first-quarter GDP will be released Friday, and director of economic analysis Bob Johnson is expecting an anemic start to 2017. Other data includes consumer sentiment gauges, housing metrics, and durable goods orders. Stay tuned to Morningstar for our take on these stories.

But that’s set to change in the next 12 to 18 months, so let’s look at what could drive M&A deals going forward. Digi-Capital’s Augmented/Virtual Reality Report Q1 2017 and deals database tracked $1.5 billion investments in the last 12 months to Q1 2017, and found only $600 million of M&As in the same period. That dynamic of investments outstripping M&As is typical of early-stage tech markets, when deal making is all about investment for growth rather than consolidation for dominance or cost. However, as the VR/AR market continues to scale, M&A deal flow is on the rise. Major corporations are actively honing their strategies on where and who to buy. Startups are also considering larger corporate parents to provide safe harbor, until the market is big enough for their business models to sing. And as often happens, early-stage companies that can’t raise the next round are looking for mergers with better funded startups to leverage their tech and talent. *Also Read:* How Virtual Reality Industry Hopes to Take Tech Mainstream *It’s good to be the king* VR’s apex predators are Facebook’s Oculus Rift and HTC’s Vive. But apex predators are giant, toothsome beasts that need to eat. A lot. High-end PC VR is compelling. However, buying the headset, controllers, PC, graphics card and premium software to make it fun put it beyond the reach of mass-market consumers. So while there are hundreds of thousands of Oculus and Vive users today, Digi-Capital’s forecasts see console/PC VR’s combined installed base only topping 20 million units by the end of the decade (Note: this is installed base, not annual unit sales, and excludes higher volume mobile VR). And this is for companies used to operating in markets with users counted in the billions. Facebook’s enterprise value is close to $400 billion, it paid $3 billion for Oculus, and Mark Zuckerberg might invest $3 billion more on top of that. Facebook could fund Oculus’ PC division indefinitely, and HTC also has a large cash stockpile (although perhaps not quite such a big one) to fund the Vive division. With two T-Rex’s and not enough food, something’s got to give at the high end. It’s not clear what deal (if any) might result, but watch this space. *Also Read:* Oculus Co-Founder Palmer Luckey Exits Facebook *Picks and shovels* While it’s not surprising to see corporates buying component makers and solution providers to accelerate internal development, VR/AR’s roster of buyers has been impressive for such an early stage market. Microsoft bought ODG’s patents for up to a reported $150 million. Apple bought Metaio. Google, Facebook, Intel and Snapchat each bought multiple component makers and solution providers. For core technology startups around mobile AR and AR smartglasses in particular, the high level of interest from corporate acquirers looks set to deliver more deals this year. *Consolidation blues* Some VR/AR sectors have become crowded already, with hundreds of startups chasing the same early stage consumers (and their wallets). The two sectors with lowest barriers to entry and the highest number of startups are VR video and VR games. While some of the best-funded companies have the resources to see them through, others are already facing the financial realities of this stage of the market. Expect to see consolidation in these sectors in 2017, with a spurt of investment and growth coalescing around mobile AR in the wake of Facebook’s AR Platform launch at F8. *Also Read:* Virtual Reality Firm Upload to Open LA Headquarters in April (Exclusive) *Through the looking glass* Nobody has come close to an Oculus-size deal in AR, with the largest full-stack AR acquisition being Intel buying Recon for $175 million. AR smartglasses could take a few years to conquer AR’s five consumer challenges (hero device, all day battery life, cellular connectivity, app ecosystem, telco cross-subsidization). Meanwhile, mobile AR could become the dominant form of consumer AR through a combination of Facebook’s AR platform and whatever Apple and Samsung introduce, if and when they enter the market. Given some folks’ wait-and-see approach to what the Facebook/Oculus deal means, AR’s consumer market might need to become more established before corporates leap to the first billion-dollar AR acquisition. *Everything else* VR/AR advertising, peripherals, distribution, social, enterprise and location-based VR have the benefit of not being overcrowded, but they also don’t have a catalyst to kick off M&A in a major way yet. For large scale deal activity here, the total VR/AR installed base needs to scale to where corporates can’t stay on the sidelines any longer, and also need specific skills and tech they can’t develop in-house. *Also Read:* Virtual and Augmented Reality Investment Hit Record $2.3 Billion in 2016 (Guest Blog) *Where do we go from here?* As VR/AR goes through a hinge year between last year’s launch and the coming inflection point around mobile AR, deal makers are being forced to consider where and when to move. Buy too early and risk being accused of irrational exuberance, buy too late and risk missing the boat. As always with VR/AR, it’s all a question of vision. All the investments and M&As in VR/AR for the last 5 years are tracked in detail in Digi-Capital’s Augmented/Virtual Reality Report Q1 2017 and bundled deals database. *Related stories from TheWrap:* How Virtual Reality Industry Hopes to Take Tech Mainstream Virtual Reality Firm Upload to Open LA Headquarters in April (Exclusive) Virtual and Augmented Reality Investment Hit Record $2.3 Billion in 2016 (Guest Blog) » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: KDKA CBS 2 Pittsburgh - 7 hours ago< > Embed Virtual Reality Goggles Offer New Experience At Kennywood 01:51 Kennywood's Sky Rocket coaster is pretty popular, but this year some riders will be offered a chance to ride while wearing virtual reality goggles; KDKA's Dave Crawley reports.

The winners were announced Tuesday. (Darron Cummings/Associated Press; Lauren O'Neil/CBC; Marion Curtis/Associated Press) Related Stories Webby Awards: CBC's Missing & Murdered podcast, NFB's Seances vie for online prize Lady Gaga, Pokemon Go and Steve Buscemi are among the winners of this year's Webby Awards. The annual honour, now in its 21st year, celebrates the best of the internet and web culture. Gaga won a pair of Webbys for her high-tech tribute to David Bowie at last year's Grammys, which was produced in partnership with Intel. Pokemon Go was picked as best game and won two other awards after becoming a smartphone sensation last summer. And Steve Buscemi snagged the prize for best actor, thanks to his performance in Louis C.K.'s web series Horace and Pete.   In total, there are 407 Webby winners this year, with prizes in the special achievement, web, online film and video, advertising and media, mobile sites and apps, social and podcasts and digital audio categories. On top of that, there's two winners in most of these categories: recipient of the Webby Award (chosen by the academy) and the Webby's People's Choice Award (chosen by public voting). Some of the nominees snagged both prizes. A few nominees with Canadian connections were named winners: the people's choice Webby for game or application in advertising and media was given to Absolut Deadmau5, a VR storytelling adventure featuring the hit Canadian DJ. And for the best use of data driven media award within the advertising and media category, projects with Canadian ties won both the Webby and the people's choice awards. Publicis New York was given the Webby for their "I'm Moving to Canada" campaign for Doctors of the World. It took the sky-high search results of people looking to move to Canada during the U.S. election and turned them into donations for Syrian medical aid.  FCB Toronto and the Canadian Down Syndrome Society won people's choice for their Down Syndrome Answers video series, which featured people with Down Syndrome answering and offering insight into the 40 most common questions asked about the condition.   The CBC podcast Missing & Murdered: Who Killed Alberta Williams​ was nominated for best documentary in the podcasts and digital audio category, but didn't end up winning. The awards will be handed out in New York during a ceremony next month hosted by Joel McHale. And of course, organizers will be strictly enforcing the prize's trademark five-word acceptance speeches. Here are a handful of some other notable winners, who will be feted in May: Artist of the year: Solange ​Best actress: Gillian Anderson, The Fall Social movement of the year: Women's March Best writing (editorial), web: The New Yorker (Webby winner and people's choice) Comedy: long form or series, online film and video: Jimmy Kimmel Live's mean tweets series With files from the Associated Press Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines Kevin O'Leary's path to victory wasn't easy, but is Maxime Bernier's any easier? read comments Trump won't opt out of NAFTA at present time, White House says read comments video United Airlines to offer up to $10K US to bumped passengers read comments Scientists successfully grow lambs in artificial womb, offering hope for preemies video O'Leary's moment of truth: Talk with advisers led Tory front-runner to bow out Latest Entertainment News Headlines The Handmaid's Tale has renewed resonance and a new audience video Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme dead at 73 video 'Putting my guts on the page': Calgary called graphic novel hub by high-profile creators read comments 'Stay away': Musicians urge Radiohead to scrap Israel show as promoters brush off boycott calls Fake Tragically Hip merchandise claiming to raise funds for cancer research dupes fans online CBC Books How turning to her Nishnaabeg roots helped Leanne Betasamosake Simpson overcome a creative challenge The advice Stacey May Fowles would give to aspiring writers The bestselling books in Canada: April 16-22, 2017 Most Viewed The Handmaid's Tale has renewed resonance and a new audience Musicians urge Radiohead to join boycott and scrap Israel show Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme dead at 73 Fake Tragically Hip merchandise claiming to raise funds for cancer research dupes fans online Fox News vehemently denies 'copycat' racial discrimination allegations Canadian investors look to L.A., where some celeb homes rival inner-city Toronto prices Bachelor star Chris Soules released from jail following deadly Iowa crash Madonna speaks out against biopic Actress Erin Moran of Happy Days fame dead at 56 Scott Baio explains 'if you do drugs or drink, you're going to die' remarks after Erin Moran's death Don't Miss Photos Defying expectation: AGO's Georgia O'Keeffe show dips into Quebec trip, soars beyond florals Advertising If you're an ad, make it clear, Federal Trade Commission warns celebrity Instagrammers Pot Art Meet the world's first artist-in-residence at a cannabis company VIDEO GAMES Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and the spinoff franchise that just keeps rolling Gold Rush 'Joke gone bad': Reality TV stunt leads to charges under the Yukon Waters Act Drizzy Worst behaviour: Woman breaks into Drake's California home, raids fridge Film Day Canadian films not your thing?

SolidRun, which is known for its NXP i.MX6 based HummingBoard SBCs and Marvell Armada 38x based ClearFog Pro and scaled down ClearFog Base networking boards, has spun a $349 (and up) Marvell MacchiatoBIN SBC that showcases Marvell’s high-end Armada 8040 SoC. The 170 x 170mm “community” Mini-ITX board ships with schematics and layout files, and offers an open source, mainline Linux 4.4x BSP. Marvell MacchiatoBIN from two angles (click images to enlarge) The Marvell MacchiatoBIN is notable for combining a relatively low price with support for high-end networking features like OpenDataPlane (ODP), OpenFastPath (OFP) and ARM network functions virtualization (NFV). Linaro’s ODP, which was announced back in 2013, is an open source data plane API that enables Linux software portability between networking SoCs, regardless of the underlying chip architecture. OpenFastPath is an open source implementation of a high performance TCP/IP stack. ARM NFV — ARM’s fairly recent answer to Intel’s NFV — is designed to work with ODP to enable virtual network function (VNF) applications, such as deploying virtual set-top boxes. The MacchiatoBIN’s Linux BSP is said to be optimized for ODP. The BSP includes U-Boot 2015.x, mainline U-Boot, UEFI EDK2, Linux LTS kernel 4.4.x, mainline Linux, Yocto 2.1, SUSE Linux, and netmap. Marvell MacchiatoBIN front panel view (click image to enlarge) Marvell’s Armada 8040 (88F8040) supplies far more networking support and overall firepower than the single- or dual-Cortex-A9 Armada 38x found on the 38x-MicroSOM computer-on-module that drives the ClearFog boards. Marvell also offers a similar dual-core sibling called the Armada 8020. Marvel Armada 8040 block diagram (click image to enlarge) Unlike the ClearFog and HummingBoard SBCs, the MacchiatoBIN does not house the SoC on a separate COM. The Armada 8040 is hidden under a heatsink needed to dissipate the heat from four Cortex-A72 cores that can run at up to 2GHz. There’s no GPU on this headless SoC, but you get networking acceleration, including a packet processor with a security co-processor, and DMA and XOR (RAID 5/6 acceleration) engines. MacchiatoBIN simplified block diagram (left) and detail view (click images to enlarge) The Armada 8040 also implements Marvell’s Modular Chip (MoChi) architecture and associated MoChi interconnect (MCI), which “enables driver-transparent expansion beyond the standard device offering.” MCI is said to support the MacchiatoBIN’s dual 10GbE and single 2.5GbE and 1GbE Ethernet ports, as well as the 4x PCIe 3.0, USB 3.0, 3x SATA 3.0, and microSD 3.0 interfaces. The SoC’s MoChI/MCI functionality is expressed via a USB-C port, and “is essentially transparent to the driver,” says Marvell. All the connected MCI interfaces appear to drivers as though they were integrated functions of the SoC itself, enabling a Virtual System-on-Chip (vSoC) implementation, says the chip designer. The Marvell MacchiatoBIN ships with 4GB or 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and offers unspecified, possibly optional amounts of SPI and eMMC flash. The microSD slot is available with an optional, empty 8GB card. In addition to the I/O listed farther above, you get USB 2.0 and UART headers, a JTAG interface, and a Marvell TDM low-speed module expansion header. The TDM header includes SPI, I2C, TDM, and power interfaces. A Mini-ITX case is standard, and power supplies for the 12V input are optional. Other community-backed networking boards include the Banana Pi BPI-R2 router board and Turris Omnia router board. Neither has 10GbE or 2.5GbE ports, however. Specifications listed for the Marvell MacchiatoBIN include: Processor — Marvell Armada 8040 (4x Cortex-A72 cores @ up to 2GHz); packet, security, DMA, and XOR co-processors Memory/storage: 4GB to 16GB of single-channel DDR4 RAM with optional ECC and single/dual chip select support SPI and eMMC flash (unspecified, possibly optional) MicroSD slot with optional 8GB card 3x SATA 3.0 connectors Networking: 2x 10GbE ports via copper or SFP 2.5GbE port via SFP 1GbE (Gigabit Ethernet) port via copper Other I/O: USB 3.0 port Micro-USB port with UART console support and converter cable USB 2.0 headers USB-C port with MoChi MCI interface 2x UARTs Reset and fan headers Boot and frequency selectors 20-pin CPU JTAG debugger Expansion — 4x PCIe 3.0 slots; Marvell TDM low-speed module expansion header Other features — Reset button; 3x heatsinks (1x CPU, 2x Ethernet); Mini-ITX case Power — 12V DC input and adapter with ATX connector; optional 12V (110/220V) or ATX power supplies Dimensions — 170 x 170mm (Mini-ITX) Operating system — Linux BSP with U-Boot 2015.x, mainline U-Boot, UEFI EDK2, Linux LTS kernel 4.4.x, mainline Linux, Yocto 2.1, SUSE Linux, and netmap/DPDK   Further information SolidRun’s Marvell MacchiatoBIN starts at $349 with 4GB RAM, or $498 with 16GB. An FCC waiver is required for U.S. import. More information may be found at SolidRun’s Marvell MacchiatoBIN product page, shopping page, and wiki.   Related posts: 64-bit STB SoC supports 4K video and Android TV Fanless network appliance runs Linux on Marvell Armada 370 Marvell lifts curtain on popular NAS SoCs Compact networking SBC runs OpenWrt on dual-core Cortex-A9 COM runs Linux on quad-core Marvell Armada XP SoC SBC packs six-port GbE switch, runs Linux on Armada 38x $39 network switching Pico-ITX SBC runs Linux on Cortex-A53 Open source OpenWRT router has automatic updates $25 JavaScript-savvy HDMI stick runs Linux Sensor oriented Marvell Cortex-A7 SoC targets IoT (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Back in November, an old video resurfaced showing that the Simpson’s predicted that Trump would become the leader of the free world. One in four of Donald Trump’s tweets contains fake news Well, our yellow friends have now given their assessment of the orange one’s approach to government and it’s pretty savage. Sean Spicer’s dead, Trump’s got 700 new followers and his daughter’s the new Supreme Court justice, Marge has run out of drugs and grandpa’s being deported. Yesterday it was reported that he has a button to summon a butler with Coca Cola (not fake news), so the idea of his hair automatically wiping a tear out of his eye doesn’t seem so far-fetched. It’s not looking good. We hope you enjoy… How have Donald Trump’s first 100 days gone in office?  Here’s a look at what he promised and how he’s performing on some of his key pledges. The Wall Mexican city Mexicali on the right, next to the border fence (Picture:  Gerald L Nino/Planet Pix) He had people chanting ‘Build the wall’ at campaign rallies, insisting Mexico would pay for it. Signing an executive order to start construction was one of his first actions as president. But progress has stalled, with Mexico refusing to pay, forcing Trump to propose immediate budget cuts of 18 billion dollars from US programmes like medical research, infrastructure and community grants. Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017 The spending plans face strong resistance from Democrats as they go before Congress in a budget vote which could lead to a government shutdown on the president’s 100th day. MORE: One in four of Donald Trump’s tweets contains fake news Immigration Trump tried to ban all immigration from seven Muslim countries (Picture: Creative Touch Imaging Ltd./NurPhoto) Trump pledged to ‘suspend immigration from terror-prone regions’ and introduce ‘extreme vetting’ at the border. Even North Korea's combat sunglasses are fake, says military expert One week after taking office, he tried to ban all immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. But judges blocked both the initial and a revised travel ban, leaving this cornerstone pledge snarled up in a legal fight. The US has imposed a ban on passengers having large electronics in cabin bags when flying from mostly Middle Eastern and North African countries, though. Islamic State (IS) Trump blamed Obama for causing the rise of Isis in Iraq and Syria. During the campaign he was confident he could ‘fix it fast’ and promised in his inaugural address to ‘eradicate completely from the face of the Earth’ radical Islamic terrorism. Trump said he could ‘fix it fast’ (Picture: Medyan Dairieh) This was unlikely to happen within 100 days (and the US-led military coalition had already been gaining on Isis before he took office). But Trump has been active militarily, deploying hundreds more troops to help retake Raqqa and authorising the use of the largest non-nuclear weapon ever used in combat by the US military, dubbed the ‘mother of all bombs’, on an IS hideout in Afghanistan. Nato During his campaign, Trump said the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was ‘obsolete’ and criticised other members for not paying their fair share. Trump and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (Picture: Ron Sachs/CNP/ABACAPRESS.COM) However, he has now made a complete U-Turn, standing in solidarity next to the Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. ‘I said it was obsolete. It’s no longer obsolete,’ Trump said. He also repeated calls for countries to meet a 2014 agreement to boost defence spending to 2% of gross domestic product over the next decade. Russia Until he took office, Trump said a closer relationship with Russia was a ‘good thing’, claimed Russian president Vladimir Putin had called him a ‘genius’ and suggested the country would ‘respect us far more’ once he took office. Trump speaks on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin (Picture: Getty) But Trump’s administration has been plagued with allegations of Russian hacking during the election campaign, as well as an FBI probe into the president’s associates’ alleged improper ties with the country. And Putin’s refusal to abandon Syrian president Bashar Assad over a chemical weapons attack on civilians has seen Trump admit relations could be at an ‘all-time low’. Jobs ‘We will bring back our jobs,’  Trump said again and again, in particular in the disenchanted Rust Belt. Earlier this month, Mr Trump said ‘we’ve created more than almost 600,000 jobs’ in the first three months of 2017, saying companies including Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Intel and Walmart were hiring thanks to him. Voters want jobs back (Picture: Cheriss May/NurPhoto) But in fact he had inflated the official figure of 533,000 jobs and took credit for growth that had, in several cases, been planned by companies before his election. Average monthly job creation was slightly down on last year at 178,000. He did fulfil his pledge to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal – which he had described as a ‘job killer’. China Before taking office he was critical of China (Picture: Getty) Trump promised to get tough on China by labeling the country a currency manipulator. But several months later, after meeting with Xi Jinping in Florida, he said: ‘Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? ‘We will see what happens!’ Obamacare Just a week before the election in November, Trump vowed to ‘immediately repeal and replace Obamacare’ – his predecessor’s landmark healthcare reform. He gave Congress an ultimatum (Picture: Richard B. Levine) But his first major piece of legislation had to be withdrawn after House Republican leaders failed to win enough support to put it to a vote. Mr Trump has since said he ‘never’ pledged to achieve the aim in the first 64 days, while it would not be in the ‘very distant future’ before he tried again. Supreme Court Mr Trump nominated conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to replace the late Antonin Scalia as a Supreme Court Justice, prompting an outcry by Democrats. Trump shakes hands with new Supreme Court judge Neil Gorsuch (Picture: Ron Sachs/Consolidated/dpa) But the Republican-controlled Senate extended a 2013 rule change to allow approval of judicial nominations to the Supreme Court by a simple majority, meaning they could confirm the president’s pick. Dog loves busker so much he refuses to move until song is over Undoubtedly a triumph for Trump, he said: ‘He will be a great Justice. Very proud of him!’ Gorsuch faced an early life-or-death decision on the execution of convicted murderer Ledell Lee in Arkansas and he cast a decisive vote as he joined his four conservative colleagues to let the state’s lethal injection process go forward. Golf The Golfer in Chief (Picture: Getty) Trump criticised Obama for golfing during the Louisiana floods in August and amid lengthy airport security delays in May. But according to US website PolitiFact’s Trump Golf Tracker, the so called ‘Golfer-in-Chief’ has played 14 times so far compared to his predecessor’s zero over the same period in 2009. Final score In all, Trump made 38 promises setting out his immediate and short-term priorities once in office and so far he has accomplished 10. But Trump is unlikely to see this as a shortcoming. ‘No matter how much I achieve, media will kill,’ he claimed. No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill! — Donald J.

CHANNELS CommScope Network Solutions Qualcomm 5G Insights Why fixed wireless services will lead domestic 5G deployments? 0 By Dan Meyer on April 26, 2017 Carriers Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) At the recent Enterprise IoT Summit, a panel of experts discuss what’s behind the initial use of fixed wireless deployments to test 5G technology. On this week’s “Carrier Wrap” we take a look at the “Fixed wireless access: The first phase of 5G” panel from our recent Enterprise IoT Summit in Austin, Texas. A number of domestic carriers have announced plans to begin trialing “5G” network technology, with some of those tests scheduled to begin this year. Most of those announced moves have centered on so-called fixed wireless deployments, which will see carriers offering wireless broadband services to customers in a fixed location. For instance, Verizon Wireless plans to begin trialing services this month, lighting up services across 11 markets by mid-year. The deployments are set to include select customers, with an emphasis on gauging the user experience, evaluating network performance and gain insight into the performance of services delivered over millimeter wave spectrum. The trial is said to include the deployment of “5G access units” across various parts of the markets linking radio signals to a virtualized core network set up with Verizon’s data centers, with a service focus on providing wireless internet access and voice over IP calling. AT&T has similar plans, announcing its first move late last year in launching a business customer trial using millimeter wave spectrum at one of Intel’s offices in Austin, Texas. The panel discussion at the Enterprise IoT event included Boris Maysel, director business development at Siklu Communication; Farooq Khan, CEO at Phazr; and Berge Ayvazian, senior analyst at Wireless 20/20. Topics discussed included why fixed wireless trials were being used as the first phase of 5G deployments; what types of operators fit the mold to offer fixed wireless services; long-term business aspects of fixed wireless deployments; and what spectrum and technology challenges are behind and could challenge the deployments.

By Tali Arbel / Associated Press NEW YORK — Internet companies are readying for a showdown with a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said in a Wednesday speech that he wants to ditch the Obama-era rules, hated by telecoms, that prevent broadband and wireless companies from interfering with the sites and apps that consumers use. He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC’s broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&T and Comcast for bad behavior. Mr. Pai, the nation’s chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. The FCC plans to release an official proposal for the vote Thursday. Mr. Pai doesn’t have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality, but is seeking input on how to “approach” its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net-neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they’d very much like subscribers to use — can’t slow down Netflix, can’t block YouTube, and can’t charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality. Early tech resistance The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn’t stood still as Mr. Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it is seen as possibly keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called up small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. Calm before the storm The industry’s giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, earlier called on Mr. Pai to support net neutrality, and Wednesday issued a statement warning that his changes would “result in a worse internet for consumers.” Consumer groups and tech companies have warned of a legal challenge. The current net neutrality rules were affirmed by a federal appeals court, which could put an extra burden on Mr. Pai to justify his changes. Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Mr. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was “extremely well received,” according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Mr. Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Mr. Glueck said. (Mr. Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn’t hurt it because it’s now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality “on a public policy basis.” What comes next The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet’s most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to “blacklist” sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an “internet slowdown” event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a “site loading” icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. But until Wednesday, there had been no net-neutrality development to rally around. “Next steps haven’t been figured out yet,” Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. “I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,” said Engine’s executive director, Evan Engstrom.

Bloomberg Fund started by an Israeli and a Palestinian looks for the next Ramallah startup Mobileye deal to fuel investment in late-stage Israeli startups In big day for Israeli high-tech, Valens raises $60 million, Dapulse $25 million Israel’s high-tech industry is showing signs on hunkering down, with fundraising by startups down 8% in the first quarter from the same time last year and an even sharper 23% in fundraising by the youngest companies. A survey by Israel Venture Capital Research and the ZAG law firm released on Wednesday showed that high-tech companies raised $1.03 billion in the first quarter as the number of deals dropped to its lowest first-quarter total since 2012. Among the youngest startups – those raising seed and A round investments – the decline was much sharper. Funding was down 23% year on year by $247 million and the number of deals was also down by double-digits, IVC said. “Venture capital funds, both Israeli and foreign, are shifting their activity focus to investments in later stages – in terms of companies’ product development stage, financing stage or capital raising round,” said Koby Simana, the CEO of IVC Research Center. But he warned that the decline threatened the future of Startup Nation. “If there are no investments in early stages and early rounds now, two years down the line there could well be a shortage of promising late stage companies,” he said.

Close While Silicon Valley experienced a slump last year, in Israel the pace of investment continued to climb, fueled by the Israeli industry’s global-leading position in the hot areas of cybersecurity and self-driving cars. On Wednesday, Shmulik Zysman, a partner in the law firm Zysman, Aharoni, Gayer & Company that co-sponsored the survey, said he hoped Intel’s $15.3 billion purchase of the Israeli self-driving-technology company Mobileye last month would whet investors’ appetite for Israeli startups. “The Mobileye deal, which shifted paradigms regarding valuations of Israeli companies, [should] have future impact on the industry in terms of growth in capital raising volumes. The deal is yet more proof of the high quality and standards of Israeli companies,” he said. More mature companies fared better on fundraising metrics in the first quarter, IVC said. The number of deals for older startups was up 5% to 74 in the three months, compared to the same time in 2016. In terms of capital raised, the most mature tech companies – those raising their C rounds – raised a record $285 million, up 21% from a year earlier. Venture capital funds, once the industry’s prime source of capital, have been displaced by other investors. IVC said that in the first quarter, VCs invested 26% less than they did in the first quarter of 2016 to just $577 million. On the other hand, Israel VC funds stepped up their pace of investment by 17% year on year to $162 million. Still, Zysman said he was concerned that Israeli startups are too reliant on overseas money, a phenomenon Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon said last month he hoped to reverse. “High-tech investments in Israel are biased toward foreign investments in low-risk companies, which is liable to affect the future of Israeli high-tech as a whole,” Zysman said.

Draws from the Marvel Cinematic Universe versions of the characters, without being forcibly tied into the films. Entertaining licensed music. Cons Stiff animations. Stale combat. Overly simple puzzle challenges. Bottom Line Guardians of the Galaxy is packed with Star-Lord and crew's humor and classic rock tunes, but this stiff point-and-click adventure game won't quite leave you hooked on a feeling. By Jeffrey L. Wilson Telltale Games' character-driven brand of interactive storytelling has long been linked to licenses from DC and Image Comics, but with Guardians of the Galaxy: A Telltale Series, the publisher takes its first crack at one of Marvel's hottest properties. Leaning heavily on James Gunn's cinematic take on the crew, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: A Telltale Series features the music, comedic teammate bickering, and space-faring adventure you'd expect from the title, but this PC game suffers from stiff animation and unchallenging puzzles that prevent it from reaching the heights of TellTale Games' biggest successes. The first episode in the $24.99 series is available now, with the remaining chapters set to arrive in coming weeks. //Compare Similar Products Compare Batman: The Telltale Series (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% The Wolf Among Us (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Game of Thrones: Iron From Ice (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Back to the Future: The Game ("It's About Time")   %displayPrice%%seller% Moonage Daydream While it's not the company's best, that's not to say that Guardians of the Galaxy is a bad game. The point-and-click adventure has merit, especially in the way it upends story expectations. Digging into any Telltale Games story runs the risk of entering spoiler territory, so I'll say just this: The crew chases an incredibly powerful McGuffin, encounters Thanos the Mad Titan, and...something happens. What occurs is a genuine surprise, and one that sets the tone for the rest of the game. View All 5 Photos in Gallery The remainder of the opening arc is a straightforward affair, as it deals with the aftermath of the team's success. Telltale Game's branching dialogue and options task you, Star-Lord's conscience, with keeping the band together and plotting its future. There's a lot of good character stuff at play involving Star-Lord, Drax, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket that both sheds light on the team's motivations and serves as interesting hooks between the action beats. The tight script highlights the various film-based personalities: Star-Lord is the cocky leader, Gamora is the hardened warrior, Drax is the brash blockhead, and Rocket and Groot have their chummy Han-and-Chewie-like interactions. If you dug the movie, you'll dig the game's characters. Behind it all is Telltale Games' excellent memory system, which causes characters to remember your actions and the intensity of your dialogue choices. This shapes how the game unfolds to some degree, as well as how other characters react to you in the future. For example, there's an important scene roughly midway through the story where you must decide to walk the hero's path by working with the Nova Corps (Marvel's space cops) or remain on the scoundrel's route, throwing your lot in with an intergalactic hustler. In many people's eyes, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Guardians of the Galaxy is the definitive version of team, so it should come as no surprise that this game, though it isn't tied into the movies, contains elements of the James Gunn team. Star-Lord dances his way through scenes, and classic rock music is sprinkled throughout the adventure to highlight character-building moments. In fact, the opening chapter, "Tangled Up in Blue," refers to a Bob Dylan track. The game feels very much like the Marvel Cinematic Universe's take on the team, despite different voices and more comic-accurate character designs. Black Tears Unfortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy's combat feels simplistic when compared to that of Batman: The Telltale Series. In that game, you leverage Bruce Wayne's strategic mind to plot how you want to take down villains. Do you rush in with fists flying? Do you utilize objects in the environments? Do you sneak through ventilation shafts? I wish Guardians of the Galaxy featured a similar, brand-specific combat system that would make its Quick Time Events (QTE) more than mere button presses. The game's combat is much like the fighting in other Telltale Games titles, which is unfortunate. How cool would it have been to bust out character-specific, team-up moves? Worse, Guardian of the Galaxy's fighting lacks drama, even when you're facing off against a universal threat. Telltale Games' Fables-based title, The Wolf Among Us, also used straightforward QTE combat sequences, but they were bolstered by the fact that the lead character, Bigby, disliked violence because there was a risk that he'd transform into a bloodthirsty wolf. Sadly, the ho-hum combat isn't the game's lone issue. Though the story is interesting, it lacks the weightier drama found in Batman: The Telltale Series and The Wolf Among Us. Part of this is the nature of the property; Guardians of the Galaxy is a comedy, after all. I suspect that it's also due to the story itself, which feels rushed in places. On top of that, Guardians of the Galaxy's puzzles don't require much thought. They're so simple that I wish Telltale Games had ditched them in favor of more action-oriented challenges. And the stiff animations that I complained about in Batman: A Telltale Series show up, too. In fact, they're worse here. The limited animation makes certain characters, particularly Rocket, resemble animatronic constructs. Minimum Requirements and Options Guardians of the Galaxy isn't a demanding title, but your gaming desktop or gaming laptop still needs decent specs. Telltale Games states that your computer must have at least a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU, an Nvidia GTS 450+ GPU with 1GB of VRAM, 3GB of system RAM, and the Window 7 operating system. As with the vast majority of PC games, Guardians of the Galaxy auto-detects your rig's hardware and scales the settings to meet your machine's configuration. That said, you can manually tweak ambient occlusion, depth of field, bokeh, render quality, texture quality, and anti-aliasing. I pumped all the settings to their highest possible options, and I was happy to see my Nvidia GeForce GTX 970-powered machine running the game at near 60 frames per second. Being a Steam game, Guardians of the Galaxy supports Steam Cloud Saves, as well as Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards. (Not Quite) Hooked On a Feeling Future Guardians of the Galaxy releases will likely suffer from the same graphics issues as this first episode, unless a visual overhaul takes place. That isn't very likely. Telltale's graphics engine appears quite limited in scope. Still, I'm looking forward to seeing how my decisions play out in upcoming chapters, as Guardians of the Galaxy has a solid core. The point-and-click adventure game is worth playing if you dig James Gunn's take on the interstellar team or Telltale Games' trademark storytelling.

Most Popular AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais By Associated Press and Tali Arbel Apr 26, 2017 Internet companies are readying for a showdown with a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said in a Wednesday speech that he wants to ditch the Obama-era rules, hated by telecoms, that prevent broadband and wireless companies from interfering with the sites and apps that consumers use. He wants to undo their legal basis and to eliminate the FCC's broad powers to monitor Verizon, AT&T and Comcast for bad behavior. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Pai, the nation's chief telecommunications regulator, said he will seek an FCC vote at a May 18 meeting. The FCC plans to release an official proposal for the vote on Thursday. Pai doesn't have an immediate plan to replace net neutrality, but is seeking input on how to "approach" its core: three hard-and-fast rules that bar broadband providers from steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites and services. Existing net-neutrality rules mean companies like Comcast and Verizon — which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use — can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. Most Popular He said the 2015 rules were unnecessary and have hurt broadband investment, a point contested by activists and companies that support net neutrality. Early Tech Resistance The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, hasn't stood still as Pai telegraphed his intentions, and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. Many internet companies have already been running the Washington playbook — lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, called up small internet companies to keep them updated and got more than 800 signatures for a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. CALM BEFORE THE STORM The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, earlier called on Pai to support net neutrality, and Wednesday issued a statement warning that his changes would "result in a worse internet for consumers." Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was "extremely well received," according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) At least one big supporter of net neutrality — Netflix — has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality "on a public policy basis." WHAT COMES NEXT The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to "blacklist" sites from the internet. Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. In 2014, smaller companies held an "internet slowdown" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a "site loading" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. But until Wednesday, there had been no net-neutrality development to rally around. "Next steps haven't been figured out yet," Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. "I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver," said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation With New Leadership In Place, House Intel Committee Set To Restart Russia Investigation Share on Facebook Share on Twitter With New Leadership In Place, House Intel Committee Set To Restart Russia Investigation Posted at 7:30 pm on April 26, 2017 by Susan Wright Share on Facebook Share on Twitter After the recusal of Rep. Devin Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, things seemed to sputter to a halt. Nunes was forced to step down from his role as committee chairman due to an Ethics Committee investigation, following his curious – possibly corrupt – handling of classified information involved with the Russia probe. For those who need a recap: Nunes traveled to the White House to view files and speak with a “source,” then called a press conference and announced that Trump had been “incidentally surveilled” without revealing his source or letting the rest of the committee he was in charge of see what he had. He did this to counter earlier testimony before the committee from FBI Director James Comey, who said there was no evidence to back up Trump’s March 4 Twitter claim of having been “wiretapped” by former President Obama. As it turned out, the “source” was somebody who had worked for Nunes, and the documents he quoted were big nothingburgers, in that they showed that while surveilling foreign officials, people within Trump’s campaign team were mentioned. Those names were covered to protect their identities. The result was a lot of partisan bickering, with neither side showing any confidence in the other to truly do the work necessary to get answers about Russian meddling. Congress took a two week recess, but Wednesday was their first full day back, and members of the committee met in the morning to talk about how to move things forward, sans Nunes. Trending 'Juicero' May Be the First Hilariously Epic Failure on 'The Internet of Things' Jim Jamitis From The Hill: “As Mike Conaway put it, we ‘touched gloves’ — and I think we’re all very hopeful that we’re back on track,” Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said, referring to the Texas Republican who is heading the probe. “I have every faith that we’re going to be back on track with Mr. Conaway. Clean slate, reboot — let me get my thesaurus out,” said Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.). That’s a good attitude, and we have to hope they mean it. “You gotta go into it with the impression that it will hold,” said Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.), who along with Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) is assisting Conaway with the investigation. “Otherwise we’re wasting our time. “I think both [ranking member Adam Schiff (D-Calif.)] and Mike are sincere that they want to get to the bottom of the issue.” Good. Thanks for that. One major bone of contention seems to be who to call to testify. Former acting attorney general Sally Yates was prepared to testify in March, but Nunes abruptly cancelled her appearance and shut down the investigation. In the past several weeks, the investigation had split into two competing tracks, with Republicans doggedly pursuing leaks of classified information and Democrats seeking to ferret out connections between the Trump administration and Russia. The committee has since agreed on a preliminary witness list — composed of “three or four dozen” names, according to Himes — and is in the process of setting a hearing date for certain Obama administration officials sought by Democrats. Progress. Yates is set to speak with the Senate Judiciary subcommittee in early May, and has been invited to speak to the House Intel Committee after May 2, when they will conduct a closed panel session with FBI Director Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers. It wasn’t immediately clear on Wednesday how the structure of the investigation will change under the new leadership format, with Rooney and Gowdy assisting Conaway. Democrats are also weighing bringing in additional members to form a kind of “steering group,” according to Schiff. But, he emphasized, “I’m very pleased with where we are right now.” “The main thing is we have moved past the cloud that we were under during the last couple of weeks, and I think we’re really moving forward in a very productive way.” There has been a lot of partisan bickering from both sides. Let’s hope they all mean it when they say they want to actually do the work necessary to find answers. This isn’t about their party. It’s ultimately about the integrity of our government and the well-being of the people.   Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Tags: Election 2016 Obama wiret Russian hacking Russian probe Recent Stories VIDEO: Not Only Is Bill Nye a Fraud, He’s an Extremist and an Enemy of Freedom Jim Jamitis Is the NFL ‘Blackballing’ Colin Kaepernick?

By Press Association Published: 19:34 EDT, 26 April 2017 | Updated: 19:34 EDT, 26 April 2017 e-mail Donald Trump promised to start work on a host of major reforms “immediately” upon taking office as US president. The billionaire Republican set out a 100-day action plan he called his “contract with the American people”, in which he made pledges on issues from immigration to jobs. He was also a vociferous critic of the previous White House occupant, Barack Obama, calling him out over his handling of everything from healthcare to how often he played golf. US presidents' average approval rating after 100 days in office. So how has President Trump matched up to candidate Trump? Here is a comparison of his campaign rhetoric against the reality. The Wall A youth looks at a new, taller fence being built along the border (Rodrigo Abd/AP) A key pledge that earned wild cheers at campaign rallies but drew derision from domestic and international opponents, Mr Trump’s contract included a vow to introduce an End Illegal Immigration Act that “fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall”. Within days of his inauguration, the president signed an executive order kick-starting the project and contract requests were prepared by US Customs and Border Protection by mid-March. But progress has stalled, with Mexico so far refusing to entertain the idea of paying for the wall, forcing Mr Trump to propose immediate budget cuts of 18 billion dollars (£14 billion) from US programmes like medical research, infrastructure and community grants and the allocation of 1.4 billion dollars (£1.1 billion) for a down payment on the border barrier. The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017 Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2017 The spending plans face strong resistance from Democrats as they go before Congress in a budget vote which could lead to a government shutdown on the president’s 100th day. Mr Trump has told a gathering of conservative media reporters that he might be willing to wait until September for the funding for the wall. But he has continued to defend the wall in a recent string of tweets. On Monday, he tweeted: “The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)! If .the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be! #BuildTheWall.” Immigration 'Immigration Ban Is One Of Trump's Most Popular Orders So Far' pic.twitter.com/wAelwuQ4BE— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 His contract promised action to “suspend immigration from terror-prone regions” and introduce “extreme vetting” at the border. And just seven days into his tenure, he issued an executive order which barred those fleeing from Syria indefinitely and imposed a 90-day ban on entry to the US for people from seven Muslim-majority nations. But the president appeared not to have anticipated resistance from the judiciary, with judges blocking both the initial and a revised travel ban, leaving this cornerstone pledge snarled up in a legal fight. The US has imposed a ban on passengers having large electronics in cabin bags when flying from mostly Middle Eastern and North African countries, though. Islamic State (IS) ISIS has infiltrated countries all over Europe by posing as refugees, and @HillaryClinton will allow it to happen here, too! #BigLeagueTruth pic.twitter.com/U5hDdIc4rC— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2016 Mr Trump accused his predecessor of causing the rise of the militant group in Iraq and Syria and subsequently failing to prevent their atrocities in the Middle East and the West. During the campaign he was confident he could “fix it fast” and promised in his inaugural address to “eradicate completely from the face of the Earth” radical Islamic terrorism. This was unlikely to be achieved inside 100 days and the US-led military coalition had already reported significant gains against IS, particularly in Iraq, before Mr Trump took office. But Mr Trump has shown a willingness to throw more resources into the effort to drive the extremists out, deploying hundreds more troops to help local Syrian forces retake the IS stronghold of Raqqa and authorising the use of the largest non-nuclear weapon ever used in combat by the US military, dubbed the “mother of all bombs”, on an IS hideout in Nangarhar province, Afghanistan. Nato LOOK WHO's HERE ! @usairforce F-35 Lightning II deployed to Ämari AB #Estonia #AlliedStrong #StrongEurope pic.twitter.com/sVX9TUJHHW— estNATO (@estNATO) April 25, 2017 Having said during the campaign that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was “obsolete” and criticising other members whose security he believed was being subsidised by the US, Mr Trump has now made a complete u-turn. The 28-nation military alliance had not undergone any substantial reform in response to Mr Trump’s barbs when, earlier this month at a press conference with the organisation’s secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, the president declared: “I said it was obsolete. It’s no longer obsolete.” He also repeated calls for countries to meet a 2014 agreement to boost defence spending to 2% of gross domestic product over the next decade. Russia Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia. At the right time everyone will come to their senses & there will be lasting peace!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 13, 2017 As a candidate and even as president-elect, the property tycoon said a closer relationship with Russia was a “good thing”, claimed Russian president Vladimir Putin had called him a “genius” and suggested the country would “respect us far more” once he took office. But Mr Trump’s administration has been plagued with allegations of Russian interference and hacking during the election campaign, as well as an FBI probe into the president’s associates’ alleged improper ties with the country. And Mr Putin’s refusal to abandon Syrian president Bashar Assad over a chemical weapons attack on civilians has seen Mr Trump admit relations are at an “all-time low”. Jobs JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!https://t.co/XGOQPHywrt pic.twitter.com/B5Qbn6llzE— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 6, 2017 “We will bring back our jobs,” went the much-repeated, eagerly-received rallying cry to supporters across America and in particular in the disenchanted Rust Belt. Earlier this month, Mr Trump said “we’ve created more than almost 600,000 jobs” in the first three months of 2017 and has hailed announcements by companies including Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Intel and Walmart that they are hiring in the US. But in fact he had inflated the official figure of 533,000 jobs and took credit for growth that had, in several cases, been planned by companies before his election. Average monthly job creation was slightly down on last year at 178,000. He did fulfil his pledge to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal – which he had described as a “job killer”. China Thank you President Xi Jinping and Madame Peng Liyuan for your visit to the United States 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/VLvzyDMiiY— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) April 9, 2017 The reality TV star promised to get tough on China “immediately” by directing his treasury secretary to label the country a currency manipulator. But several months later, after meeting with the China’s president Xi Jinping in Florida, the president appeared convinced of just the opposite. He tweeted: “Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? We will see what happens!” Obamacare We are taking action to #RepealANDReplace #Obamacare! Contact your Rep & tell them you support #AHCA. #PassTheBill https://t.co/opzrXJigGA pic.twitter.com/C7snoRafPI— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2017 Just a week before the election in November, Mr Trump vowed to “immediately repeal and replace Obamacare” – his predecessor’s landmark healthcare reform. But his first major piece of legislation had to be withdrawn after House Republican leaders failed to win enough support to put it to a vote. Mr Trump has since said he “never” pledged to achieve the aim in the first 64 days, while it would not be in the “very distant future” before he tried again. Supreme Court Congratulations to Justice Neil Gorsuch on his elevation to the United States Supreme Court. A great day for America! #SCOTUS pic.twitter.com/8KGFSk8BFj— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 10, 2017 Mr Trump nominated conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to replace the late Antonin Scalia as a Supreme Court Justice, prompting an outcry by Democrats. But the Republican-controlled Senate extended a 2013 rule change to allow approval of judicial nominations to the Supreme Court by a simple majority, meaning they could confirm the president’s pick. Undoubtedly a triumph for Mr Trump, he said: “He will be a great Justice. Very proud of him!” Gorsuch faced an early life-or-death decision on the execution of convicted murderer Ledell Lee in Arkansas and he cast a decisive vote as he joined his four conservative colleagues to let the state’s lethal injection process go forward. Golf Tiger Woods and Donald Trump hit the golf course (via @izzy_pecoraro) pic.twitter.com/qD9w7uqi0b— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) December 23, 2016 Mr Trump was a vocal critic of Mr Obama’s golfing exploits, calling him out for taking to the course during the Louisiana floods in August and amid lengthy airport security delays in May. But according to US website PolitiFact’s Trump Golf Tracker, the so called “Golfer-in-Chief” has played 14 times so far compared to his predecessor’s zero over the same period in 2009. Final score No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017 In all, his contract made 38 promises setting out his immediate and short-term priorities once in office and so far, according to the Associated Press, he has accomplished 10.

(Nasdaq: TSLA) hit its 52-week high – just one week after becoming the most valuable automaker in America. It's not the only one, though. There are actually 126 stocks trading at or near all-time highs. But don't worry about figuring out which ones to add to your portfolio right now… These eight are the cream of the crop. Buying High to Sell Higher Before we get started, I want to spend a minute on the misconception that buying stocks at 52-week highs is something you should avoid (which is based on the idea that they have nowhere to go but down in price). This simply isn't true. And too often, this myth is exactly why investors miss out on enormous growth and profit opportunities. In fact, when investors buy these stocks (and continue buying), it only strengthens the stock, propelling it higher – even after a pullback. That's the basis behind the adage "buy high and sell higher," made popular by Investor's Business Daily editor William O'Neil. O'Neil revealed historically proven data that stocks trading at their highs have momentum on their side, and a new high can beget more upward price action. This could be due to folks rushing in because they don't want to miss out on the stock, or it could be due to a belief in the strength of the stock. But the bottom line is new money will continue to drive stocks at their 52-week highs even higher. So it's important to not let the fear of buying high stand in the way of easy profits. Now, you can track stocks trading at 52-week highs on virtually any financial website, such as Barchart.com (which provides real-time and delayed intraday stock and commodities price action). I use my own proprietary tools to search for  stocks that are at, near, or making new 52-week highs. And here's what my scan revealed as of the time of writing: As you you can see, there are actually 10 stocks on this list instead of eight. But when I looked through the charts to see if any of these stocks aren't actually worth pursuing, Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY) popped up as a company that's been or is about to be acquired: And sure enough, Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) is in the process of trying to buy the Israeli application software company. The other one I determined was a stock not worth pursuing is Cirrus Logic Inc. (Nasdaq: CRUS). As you can see in the price chart below, CRUS made a new high but then reversed and closed lower. And any stock that makes a bearish reversal after a new high day is one you'll want to stay away from. So these are your top eight stocks to watch right now: Plug Power Inc. (Nasdaq: PLUG) Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO) Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) JD.com Inc. (Nasdaq ADR: JD) Tesla Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA) KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE ADR: KB) Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NYSE: NLY) And you've got a couple ways to play them: buying the stock outright or trading options. Buying the Stock Outright While you can certainly buy just a single share of stock, it can be costly – especially when you factor in fees. So for comparison purposes, here's the math on purchasing 100 shares of each stock listed above: PLUG @ $2.45 x 100 = $245 YHOO @ $47.21 x 100 = $4,721 BABA @ $111.70 x 100 = $11,170 BAX @ $52.84 x 100 = $5,284 JD @ $32.67 x 100 = $3,267 TSLA @ $312.39 x 100 = $31,239 KBH @ $20.05 x 100 = $2,005 NLY @ $11.39 x 100 = $1,139 Your total cost? $59,070. Trading Options (Specifically Long Calls at Least 90 Days from Expiration) Unlike buying and holding, trading options lets you control 100 shares of the stock at a much lower cost – up to 90% or more in most cases. It's basically like renting the stock. So here's a look at how much you'd pay trading long calls of each of the top eight stocks: PLUG 1 contract of the September 2017 $2 Call @ 0.70 = $70 YHOO 1 contract of the July 2017 $47 Call @ $2.54 = $254 BABA 1 contract of the July 2017 $110 Call @ $7.15 = $715 BAX 1 contract of the August 2017 $52.50 Call @ $2.61 = $261 JD 1 contract of the September 2017 $32 Call @ $3.25 = $325 TSLA 1 contract of the September 2017 $310 Call @ $32.75 = $3,275 KBH 1 contract of the July 2017 $20 Call @ $1.39 = $139 NLY 1 contract of the July 2017 $11 Call @ 0.56 = $56 And your total cost? $5,095. That's over a 91% cut in your cost – simply by trading options. And if you want to cut your cost even more – consider using debit call spreads or bull call spreads. Both strategies allow you to hedge an option by both buying-to-open and selling-to-open call options with the same expirations but different strike prices at the same time, on the same order ticket. This further reduces your risk, which caps your potential upside but increases your probability. Here's an example… You buy-to-open a July 2017 $110 call and sell-to-open a July 2017 $115 call for a total cost (or net debit) of $253 ($2.53 x 100 shares) per contract. The difference in the spread (between the call you bought and call you sold) is $500 ($5.00 x 100 shares) and the most you could make offset by the cost of the trade. So even if BABA takes off and ramps to the heavens, you will likely leave money on the table. But realize with the Bullish Loophole Strategy, you don't need that type of price move. All you need is for BABA to be trading above the sold strike of the spread, $115, at expiration to realize max profitability for this trade. Whichever method you choose, be sure to speak with your broker or financial advisor to determine what's most suitable for your portfolio.
