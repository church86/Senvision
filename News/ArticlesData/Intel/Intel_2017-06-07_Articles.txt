BENGALURU: Now one can dot that planet in the name of Sahithi Pingali, a Grade 12 student from city's Inventure Academy. She will be sharing the space with other luminaries in the Milky Way by having a minor planet named after her. This milestone is part of her winning streak at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) in Los Angeles, where she has been on a roll. Earlier this month at ISWEEEP (The International Sustainable World Engineering Energy Environment Project) Olympiad held in Houston, Texas, Sahithi won the Gold Medal for her research on 'An Innovative Crowdsourcing Approach to Monitoring Freshwater Bodies' which was based on city lakes. She has also researched on Varthur lake with her school team especially. The Lincoln Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which has the right to name minor planets, decided to name a planet after her. At the INTEL ISEF international finals, she won 3 special awards in addition to placing overall second in the category Earth and Environmental Sciences which included The ASU Rob and Melani Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives Special Award; A Special Award from King Abdul Aziz and his Companions for Giftedness and Creativity and US Agency for International Development Special Award Sahithi, after her winning her Gold Medal at ISWEEEP, said, "The interesting thing about my project is that it's all about crowdsourcing; getting students and citizens to contribute scientific data. OLOV was the inspiration for this - it was the dedication and commitment of my team members at Inventure that convinced me that high school students were capable of gathering such reliable data, while increasing their environmental awareness and knowledge of science. I hope students all over Bangalore will take this as a call for action to adopt lakes and lead the way for the rest of the world." Sahithi was first exposed to the impact of development on Bangalore's lifeline - our network of lakes - in July 2015, when she won a scholarship from Inventure to participate in the American India Foundation (AIF) program, to study the impact of urban development on scarce resources. Sahithi was also part of the Inventure team that participated in the Our Lakes Our Voice (OLOV) (an Inventure Change Maker initiative) aimed at students from AIF and Inventure doing an experiential case study on Varthur Lake, a 450-acre water body in Inventure's vicinity. She is currently pursuing an internship at the University of Michigan, where she's working with PhD students and professors in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department.

Share Share on Twitter Add to Google+ Connect on Linked in Share on Pinterest Subscribe by Email Print This Post It was a room full of Republican men, so you know the mansplaining was in full force. North Carolina Republican Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr cut off Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) during the Senate Intel hearing Wednesday with remarkably obvious sexism that was picked up by men and women alike, prompting Senator Elizabeth Warren to make a public show of solidarity telling Harris to “Keep fighting, Kamala!” Republicans shut Harris down as she was pressing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about giving Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump Russia probe full independence from the Justice Department, which we all can see Republicans definitely do not want to do- after all, if the Russians don’t help them win 2018 and anyone starts asking questions about how many Republicans won their seats in 2016 with the help of a foreign adversary during their cyber attack on the U.S., well that wouldn’t allow Republicans to keep ignoring the people. Watch the boys talk down to and cut off Harris if you haven’t had your share of this at your own work today yet: “Senator, I’m very sensitive about time and I’d like to have a very lengthy conversation and explain that all to you,” Rosenstein responded to Senator Harris. “Can you give me a ‘yes or no’ answer?” Harris demanded. “It’s not a short answer, Senator,” Rosenstein smirked. “It is. Either you are willing to do that or you are not,” Harris replied. Senator John McCain didn’t like that, so he cut off Harris, objecting, “Mr. Chairman, they should be allowed to answer the question.” “Are you willing or are you not willing to give him the authority to be fully independent of your ability, statutorily or legally, to fire him?” Harris pressed, trying to get an actual answer on a key matter. “Yes or no, sir. Are you willing to —” “Will the senator suspend?” Burr interrupted, before beginning his lecture about “courtesy”. “The chair is going to exercise its right to allow the witnesses to answer the question, and the committee is on notice to provide the witnesses the courtesy, which has not been extended all the way across, extend the courtesy for questions to get answered,” Burr chastised Harris. “Mr. Chairman, respectfully, I would point out that this witness has joked, as we all have, his ability to filibuster,” Harris replied. “The senator will suspend!” Burr demanded, cutting Harris off. “Mr. Rosenstein, would you like to thoroughly answer the question?” So that was fun. Girls, you must be courteous when dealing with matters of national security. Perhaps the ladies might wish to bring some muffins in for the next hearing, instead of asking questions that lack the proper amount of courtesy. Here’s Warren’s show of solidarity with Harris, who was one of three women on the panel today: Silencing @SenKamalaHarris for not being “courteous” enough is just unbelievable. Keep fighting, Kamala! #NeverthelessShePersisted https://t.co/58y15qWVzU — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 7, 2017 Just a few of the men who noticed: Burr rebukes Kamala Harris during intense questioning of Rosenstein about whether Mueller has full authority. "The senator will suspend!" — Manu Raju (@mkraju) June 7, 2017 Just now in the Intel hearing: A male GOP senator (Burr) tells a female Dem senator (Harris) to pipe down. Where have we seen this before? — Ed O'Keefe (@edatpost) June 7, 2017 Don't recall him treating Wyden that way. https://t.co/DDs5KmiyaF — Eli Stokols (@EliStokols) June 7, 2017 Burr just heavy-handedly stopped Kamala Harris from questioning Rosenstein. She was punchy but since when can't senators interrupt witnesses — Tom McCarthy (@TeeMcSee) June 7, 2017 Republicans interrupt witnesses and speak with contempt to them constantly, so their objection to Harris’ line of questioning and not being courteous enough is odd. Whatever they can do to keep the Russia investigation from moving forward as it should, they will do. If being courteous is a new qualification for Senators, someone better tell Republicans post haste.

Blog Intel 3D XPoint Found in Optane Module Jeongdong Choe, Senior Technical Fellow, Techinsights 6/8/2017 00:01 AM EDT  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet TechInsights recently acquired and tore down an Intel Optane M.2 80mm 16GB PCIe 3.0 and discovered a 3D X-Point memory die in the package. This is the first commercial 3D Xpoint product from Intel and Micron. The Intel 3D X-Point memory package size is 241.12 mm2 (17.6 mm x 13.7 mm) and a single X-Point Memory die is contained within. The 3D X-Point Memory die measures 206.5 mm2 with a 16.16 mm length and a 12.78 mm width. Memory efficiency in the die is 91.4% which is higher than the Samsung 3D 48L V-NAND (70.0%) and the Intel/Micron 3D FG NAND (84.9%). Memory density of the 3D Xpoint Memory is 0.62 Gb/mm2 which is lower than commercial 2D and 3D NAND products (2.5 Gb/mm2 for Toshiba/SanDisk and Samsung 3D 48L TLC NAND, and 1.28 Gb/mm2 for Toshiba/SanDisk 2D 15nm TLC NAND). However, compared to DRAM products, the 3D Xpoint memory density is 4.5 times higher than DRAM products with the same 20 nm technology or 3.3 times higher than Samsung’s 1x nm DDR4. Xpoint Memory products use 20 nm technology node for both WL and BL with 0.00176 µm2 cell size which is about half of the DRAM cell size. This is due to a stackable memory cell and 4F2 instead of 6F2 being used for memory cell array design. Figure 1: Xpoint Memory Package (Source: Intel 3D XPoint, TechInsights) Figure 2: Xpoint Memory Die (16 GB) (Source: Intel 3D XPoint, TechInsights) Intel Xpoint Memory is a PCM (phase change memory) with a double storage-selector stacked memory cell between metal 4 and metal 5. GST-based materials are used for the storage, while As (arsenic) doped chalcogenide materials (Se-Ge-Si) are used for the selector in which As might be used to suppress crystallization. This is likely a type of Ovonic Threshold Switch (OTS) structure. We found that the 3D Xpoint memory layers are placed between metal 4 and metal 5 and connected with a few selector contact plugs on metal 4. We’ll be digging deeper into the device to find more innovative technology, and we’ll share that with you in the near future.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Toppc breaks another world record overclocking… Toppc breaks another world record overclocking G.Skill's Trident Z RGB memory By Kevin Parrish — Updated June 8, 2017 1:08 am Subscribe Share The best part of this minimalist Pacific Northwest cabin is outside the window Why have 1 room when you can have 2? Our favorite transforming homes Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you To the mainstream PC gamer, this is a good example of how G.Skill's memory can be overclocked in a controlled environment, but don't expect these speeds in a typical air/water-based setup. Update 6/7/2017 8:39PM: We clarified information regarding Double Data Rate and the reported 5.5GHz speed. On Wednesday, G.Skill International said that a team of professional overclockers managed to speed up its DDR4 memory to 5,500MHz, the fastest frequency (speed) to date. Conducted by Taiwan-based Toppc, the team used a system based on MSI’s X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC motherboard and an Intel Core i7-7740K processor. The team broke the 5GHz barrier last year using G.Skill’s DDR4 memory too. “DDR4 5.5GHz has been our next target after we achieved DDR4 5GHz last year. We are extremely excited to finally make it happen together with Samsung components, MSI X299 motherboard, and Intel Core X-series processor,” says Tequila Huang, corporate vice president of G.Skill International. As seen here, the record was validated by HWBOT. The team kept the processor and memory cooled using liquid nitrogen, meaning the average PC gamer won’t see the overclocked speed using standard air and water-based cooling. The overclocking record relied on a single 8GB stick of G.Skill’s Trident Z RGB DDR4 memory, which is sold as 8GB or 16GB sticks in kits of 16GB and more. G.Skill’s 8GB stick actually overclocked to 2,750MHz, but the number is doubled because DDR memory (Double Data Rate) can handle two chunks of data per clock signal, which is a method of synchronizing the flow of data. It had a latency of CL14-14-14-34, indicating that the memory stick ran at 1,500MHz or 1,600MHz before the overclocking process. The quad-core Intel “Kaby Lake-X” processor used in the test bed had a stock base speed of 4.30GHz, and a boost speed of 4.50GHz. G.Skill introduced its Trident X RGB series at the end of 2016. As the name implies, these DDR4 sticks include RGB lighting that’s customizable through the company’s free desktop software. They include aluminum heat spreaders with a hair-line finish, and a fin-based design for better heat dissipation. Each stick consists of Samsung memory chips soldered on a 10-layer circuit board supporting overclocked speeds. “We are seeing amazing overclocking potential for these newly released hardware and we believe that more overclocking benchmark records will be achieved very soon by professional overclockers worldwide,” Huang added. Toppc initially broke the 5GHz speed barrier using a single G.Skill Trident Z DDR4 memory stick (4GB), MSI’s Z170I Gaming Pro AC mini-ITX motherboard, and a sixth-generation Intel Core i5-6600K processor slowed down to 968.17MHz (originally it runs at 3.50GHz).  The HWBOT info shows that the CPU was cooled by liquid nitrogen, and presumably the memory chip was as well to hit the overclocked 2,501.2MHz speed. Then during Computex 2016, G.Skill memory was used to break Toppc’s record, hitting 2,594.6MHz (aka 5,189.2MHz). This speedy feat was accomplished by Splave, who used the ASRock Z170M OC Formula motherboard and a sixth-generation Intel Core i7-6700K processor. Splave walked away from G.Skill’s OC World Cup Competition with $10,000 and knowing that he achieved a new world record for memory speed. Guess it’s time for another attempt.

Intel has responded to AMD’s highly competitive Ryzen CPU line with lower prices on some Core processors and an aggressive rollout of its own high-end chips. The X299 chipset and Core-X series of CPUs are the latest Intel response to the sudden increase in competition in the company’s most important market. PC component maker Gigabyte has a vested interest in knowing exactly how well all of these new processors and chipsets perform. One way of accomplishing that objective is to push them to their limits, which is exactly what it did with the Intel Core i7-7740K in a recent record-setting overclocking session, according to The Tech Report. Gigabyte has its own overclocking experts on staff, including the one known as HiCookie, who has his own team of five overclockers. This group put the Core i7-7740K to the test running on Gigabyte’s X299-SOC Champion motherboard, and used some fairly aggressive cooling techniques. Specifically, liquid helium at -220 degrees C was paired with a Corsair AX 1500i power supply. The team also used 16GB of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-4333MHz memory for the CPU test, as well as  G.Skill Trident Z 3600C17 RAM and dual Gigabyte Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs for the 3DMark tests. The results were impressive. First, the team managed to overclock the CPU to a staggering 7.5 GHz, which is a record-setting speed. The 3DMark results also set new records, scoring 356,678 points in 3DMark03, 71,928 points in 3DMark06 with a single GTX 1080 Ti, and 71,176 points in 3DMark06 with two GTX 1080 Ti cards. These are some impressive results for sure, and demonstrate that Intel remains firmly ensconced in the high-end of the CPU market. AMD has yet to release its full line of new CPUs based on the Zen architecture that includes the 16-core Threadripper, and Intel itself has its own even more aggressive Core-X processors on the way. Combine those with with AMD’s upcoming Vega architecture of GPUs, and it’s clear that PC performance has significant room for growth.

Macs & Mac OS X | 06 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (11) Apple Beefs Up iMac and MacBook Lines, Teases the iMac Pro by Adam C. Engst At WWDC 2017 today, Apple devoted a non-trivial segment of the keynote to new Mac hardware, showing off improved iMacs and performance-enhanced MacBook Pros and mentioning a speed bump to the MacBook Air in passing. After running through all the changes to today’s models, Apple gave a sneak preview of the iMac Pro, a workstation-class version of the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display that’s scheduled to ship at the end of the year. No mention was made of the Mac mini or Mac Pro, though Apple has already said that the Mac Pro is in the middle of a major redesign that won’t be done until 2018 at the earliest (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017). iMac -- The workhorse of Apple’s desktop line has long been the iMac, which Apple continues to offer in three basic models: a 21.5-inch non-Retina version, a 21.5-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, and the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display. On the CPU front, each model receives a speed bump thanks to Apple using Intel’s 7th generation “Kaby Lake” processors and increasing clock speeds. You can see the specifics on Apple’s Tech Specs page, but the summary is that Apple is focusing more effort on the 21.5 Retina iMac, offering just a single configuration of the non-Retina model. Benchmarks will show how much faster the combination of new CPUs and higher clock speeds will be, but I suspect purchases will mostly be based on price. Although the iMac Retina displays are already gorgeous, Apple claims to have improved them even more in both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch sizes, increasing brightness 43 percent to 500 nits and supporting display of up to 1 billion colors. The non-Retina iMac model drives its screen with the integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, but all the Retina models now take advantage of Radeon Pro GPUs, the 555 and 560 for the 21.5-inch models and the 570, 575, and 580 models for the 27-inch models. The notable win here is for the 21.5-inch Retina models, which were previously limited to integrated Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200. Apple has made the Fusion Drive standard in more configurations, and the company claims that the SSDs available in 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB capacities are up to 50 percent faster. You can also configure the top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with a 2 TB SSD for a whopping $1400. When it comes to RAM, all base models still ship with 8 GB. The non-Retina iMac and low-end 21.5 Retina model remain limited to 16 GB, but the high-end 21.5-inch Retina model can now take 16 GB or 32 GB, a welcome improvement. Similarly, the low-end 27-inch model still maxes out at 32 GB, but the two higher-end models can take 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. RAM in the 21.5-inch iMac models cannot be upgraded by the user, but you can install memory in the 27-inch model yourself. Unsurprisingly, Apple replaced the previous models’ Thunderbolt 2 ports with a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports that support DisplayPort for external screens, Thunderbolt at up to 40 Gbps, USB 3.1 Gen 2 at up to 10 Gbps, and various other protocols via adapters (see “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between,” 3 November 2016). All these changes are welcome for anyone in the market for a new iMac. I doubt they’re significant enough to warrant trading in an existing Retina iMac, unless Thunderbolt 3 is a necessity. The most interesting changes are actually in the 21.5-inch models, which move past the RAM and graphics limitations of the previous configuration while introducing a cheaper config. The 21.5-inch non-Retina iMac remains priced at $1099, with the two Retina configurations starting at $1299 and $1499. The 27-inch model comes in three configurations: $1799, $1999, and $2299. They’re all available now. Perhaps I’m just boggled by the number of changes Apple announced in the WWDC keynote, but I couldn’t see how to give more context for the changes in relation to previous configurations because the matrix of what models get which build-to-order options was just too complicated. If you want to price out different possibilities, I recommend opening several browser windows so you can compare the configurations side by side. MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air -- As with the iMac, Apple updated the processors in the MacBook and MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake processors running at higher clock speeds. That should improve performance, although likely not by that much. The MacBook Pro models also get improved graphics processing, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro models using Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 and 650, and the 15-inch models switching to Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs on top of Intel HD Graphics 630 and 640. You can now buy a MacBook with 16 GB of RAM, up from the previous limit of 8 GB, and Apple claims that the MacBook’s onboard SSD is up to 50 percent faster. That might make the MacBook a more attractive option, given that lackluster performance was one of its main disadvantages. Despite rumors to the contrary, the MacBook Air lives, but it sees the least change, replacing its stock 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with a 1.8 GHz model. It remains upgradeable to an Intel Core i7 running at 2.2 GHz. Although these changes are all positive, they do nothing to simplify the difficulty of choosing between the three models. Each falls into the three-dimensional graph of price, performance, and size in a different spot. You’ll have to decide what’s most important to you — cost, speed, or portability — and figure out which of Apple’s notebooks best fits your needs. As with the new iMac models, these updated notebooks are all available now. iMac Pro -- During the private media meeting in which Apple executives confessed to the company’s sins with regard to the Mac Pro, mention was made of pro-related announcements about the iMac coming this year. Apple has now revealed more of what that means, pulling back the curtains on the iMac Pro. Due in December 2017, the iMac Pro retains the same form factor of the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display, but swaps the brushed aluminum look for a space gray finish that extends to the Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, Magic Mouse 2, and an optional Magic Trackpad 2. The goal of the iMac Pro is to provide workstation-class performance within the iMac design. The hardest part of that is dealing with heat, because the iMac Pro will feature Intel Xeon processors in 8-core, 10-core, or 18-core configurations. Also playing into the necessary thermal architecture redesign is Apple’s use of a new Radeon Pro Vega GPU, which reportedly features a next-generation compute core and up to 16 GB of on-package high-bandwidth memory (HBM2). Apple says that the iMac Pro with Vega GPU delivers up to 11 teraflops of single-precision compute power for real-time 3D rendering and high frame rate VR. For half-precision computation that’s reportedly ideal for machine learning, the iMac Pro can deliver up to 22 teraflops of performance. (No, we don’t really have a sense of what that means, either, but Apple PR did a good job of making it sound impressive.) The iMac Pro will come with 32 GB of RAM by default, but for a machine in this class, the fact that it’s configurable to 64 GB or 128 GB is more important. A 1 TB SSD is also standard, with 2 TB and 4 TB SSDs as options. Unsurprisingly, the iMac Pro sports four Thunderbolt 3 ports, which enables it to drive up to two 5K displays and two high-performance RAID arrays at the same time. Other connectivity options mimic what’s on the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display now, with the exception of Ethernet. Instead of gigabit Ethernet, the iMac Pro will include 10 Gb Ethernet, which could be a big deal when transferring huge amounts of data between machines. How much will all this cost? A lot, with the base iMac Pro configuration starting at $4999. Apple claimed that a comparable workstation would cost about $7000, without a 5K display. Even still, given the high price of large SSDs and RAM, we anticipate that a loaded iMac Pro will easily meet or exceed that $7000 mark. But that won’t stop the audience for the iMac Pro. If you need the maximum performance from a Mac, the iMac Pro will provide it. At least until a new Mac Pro makes its debut, and many of those who live and die by the teraflop won’t want to wait.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Cohen   2017-06-06 10:48 And if anyone out there thinks the iMac Pro means that a Mac Pro ISN'T also coming, Apple's press release on the iMac Pro puts that misconception to rest: "In addition to the new iMac Pro, Apple is working on a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest-end, high-throughput system in a modular design, as well as a new high-end pro display." Reply Mackay Bell  2017-06-07 20:38 It seems that part of the reason they revealed that they were working on an expandable Mac Pro (and apologizing for the trash can version) is they wanted people to get excited about the iMac Pro, and not suck up all the air complaining about the lack of an expandable system. By getting that story out before the release, they could get a little more excitement going for the coming of the iMac Pro. Reply Alan Forkosh   2017-06-06 11:09 It's noteworthy that Apple didn't mention anything about the Touch Bar. As it stands now, Touch Bar is an orphan, present on only on the MacBook Pro line. It strikes me as something that can't really be considered a standard until there is a desktop version of it also--either a new keyboard or a standalone item to be paired with a keyboard. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 12:00 In fact, it turns out that Apple did release a new wireless Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. But not with a Touch Bar. Boo! http://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-has-a-new-wireless-magic-keyboard-with-a-full-numeric-keypad/amp/ Reply Paul Ellis  2017-06-06 13:53 The Touch Bar is a gimmick. It breaks all the rules of ergonomics and focus. It might possibly make some sense when positioned close the the screen, and therefore point of focus, on a laptop, but makes little sense for a desktop. If I were a developer, which thankfully I'm not, I wouldn't be wasting any time developing for it, and certainly not if I'd previously been stung by OpenDoc, QuickTime VR, etc. etc. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:57 I like what Apple is doing with the iMac and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assuming they'll make things right with the new Mac Pro once it finally arrives. The MBP seems fine. I still don't see what TouchBar is supposed to accomplish - I also think it's mainly a gimmick with poor ergonomics. Apple didn't spend any time on it at this WWDC. Does anybody think it might disappear during the next overhaul? I don't really get why Apple is keeping the MBA around instead of just trying to make an inexpensive entry-level MB instead. Since there is no inexpensive entry-level MB, I assume that means the MB is targeting the middle/high-end of the compact/light market. So with that in mind, why in the world did they not replace that USB-C with TB3? If this were a budget Mac at $999 targeted at schools and students, fine. But since this is a midrange Mac we're talking about, why leave it stuck with USB-C? Nothing TB3 offers can't be done with USB-C, but TB3 is just more versatile and it is no doubt the new standard across Macs - well almost, sigh. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:59 (cont.) My only real gripe on the Mac side is the Mac mini. How can Apple just let it sit there to die? Either kill it off already (so people know they'll have to go Hackintosh) or update it. But just leaving it sit there without a clear plan makes we wonder what message Apple is trying to send. It reminds me of the Mac Pro situation before pressure from pros and tech journalists forced Apple to take a stand. I see a lot of potential for the Mac mini, from cheap servers to simple office computers, offering a low-price entry point to the Mac universe, schools, home media servers, etc. I'm afraid all of that is "too techy" and not sexy enough for the new Apple. I really hope I'm wrong. I'm holding onto my trusty Core i5 Mac mini, but with its 4 GB of RAM (could be upgraded) and 500 GB HDD (could also be upgraded, but is that worth it?) its days are numbered even as my home media server. Reply Bertrand Morin  2017-06-06 19:27 Is the memory (RAM) upgradable in the iMac 27in. by the user, as it wad older iMac… Reply James  2017-06-08 07:58 Did you read the product page for the 27" iMac? If not, go back and read it again. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-07 01:08 Is there any indication yet if the new iMac models (both 21.5" and 27") have user upgradable RAM? There is some wording on the Apple page that you can upgrade the 21.5" RAM after purchase through Apple or an authorized dealer, but it not 100% clear. And the page for the 27" is completely silent. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 09:59 The 21.5-inch models are NOT user-upgradeable, but the 27-inch model is.

The giant chipmaker made the announcement as it reported lower-than-expected sales for the first quarter. This as industry analysts say an extended slide in global PC sales is showing no signs of leveling off. Intel, which has long been the world’s leading maker of PC chips, is now trying to expand into other types of computing. “It’s time to make this transition,” CEO Brian Krzanich told analysts. While calling the job cuts “difficult,” he said they would help the company sharpen its focus in new areas. The latest cuts follow an earlier reduction of about 5,000 jobs announced by Intel in 2014, and analysts say they may not be the last. “These companies are so big that it takes time” — and sometimes multiple rounds of restructuring — to change direction, said Patrick Moorhead, a longtime industry expert at Moor Insights & Strategy. Krzanich has been pushing Intel to change its focus from PCs to other computing segments that are growing and providing more profit. These include making microprocessors for “cloud computing” data centers, along with chips for Internet-connected gadgets, wearable devices and drones. “We are evolving from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices,” he said in a statement. Intel said the job cuts will include “voluntary and involuntary departures” over the coming year, some of them occurring as Intel consolidates some of its PC chip operations into fewer locations. A spokeswoman declined to say exactly which jobs or locations would be affected. Intel has large campuses in Portland, Oregon; Chandler, Arizona; Rio Rancho, New Mexico; and Santa Clara and Folsom, California. It also has facilities in countries including Israel and China. Most of the affected workers will be notified in the next 60 days. The cuts are likely to involve divisions making and selling chips for traditional desktop and laptop computers, Moorhead said. He noted Intel has signaled its plans to continue investing in chips for gaming consoles and new “two-in-one” devices that resemble tablets with detachable keyboards. Those devices are still seeing strong sales growth. Krzanich has been trying to change Intel’s focus since he became CEO in 2013, and he’s replaced several top executives in recent months. Intel said Tuesday that longtime Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will transition to a new position in coming months. But aside from the data center business, which now contributes nearly a third of Intel’s revenue, the markets for Intel’s other new products are still “very embryonic,” according to Mark Hung, an industry analyst at the Gartner research firm. “It’s going to take two to three years before they provide meaningful growth for the company,” Hung said. Krzanich cited Intel’s first-quarter financial performance as evidence the transition is working. Intel reported revenue of $13.70 billion for the first three months of 2016, up 7 percent from the same period a year earlier. That was slightly lower than the $13.73 billion that analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting. Global demand for PCs fell 9.6 percent in the first quarter, according to figures released earlier this month by Gartner. The industry has been in decline for the last four years, Hung noted, but some analysts had expected PC sales to level off this year. Instead, he noted quarterly PC shipments fell below 65 million for the first time since 2007.

So far, Microsoft says, the attack (which uses a variant of 2016's Platinum file transfer tool) has only been spotted in Asia, and fortunately it can only be exploited if an attacker tricks a sysadmin into providing administrative credentials. As Redmond points out, the new wrinkle doesn't create a new attack vector, but rather it “misused AMT SOL within target networks that have already been compromised to keep communication stealthy and evade security applications”. The feature being misused is AMT's Serial-over-LAN (SOL), attractive to an attacker because it's independent of the host operating system. It could be spotted by a separate standalone firewall, but it wouldn't be picked up by a host-based firewall. Another attraction to an attacker is that the embedded processor is designed to provide remote out-of-band capabilities like power cycling and KVM, even if the main processor is powered down. SOL can also communicate over the LAN if a physical connection exists, regardless of whether networking is enabled on the host. Microsoft also offers the hypothesis that if Platinum infected a system that didn't have AMT enabled, it could use stolen admin credentials and the technology's host-based provisioning to fire up a subset of AMT (including SOL) using its own credentials. Whether using stolen credentials and full ATM access, or the limited access offered by a host-based provisioned machine, Platinum then exploited SOL to transfer malware over the LAN. If you can exploit AMT's serial-over-LAN channel, the operating system won't see you Microsoft says it worked with Intel to analyse the Platinum variant, and says Windows Defender ATP can detect the activity. Intel's AMT got unwelcome attention in May, when critical vulnerabilities in the management technology first discovered in March became public. ® Tips and corrections 5 Comments MORE Microsoft Intel Vulnerability Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Microsoft raises pistol, pulls the trigger on Windows 7, 8 updates for new Intel, AMD chips Don't want to use Windows 10?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: What Happened in the Stock Market Today Two chip stocks were in the spotlight on a positive day for the market. Jim Crumly (TMFSpeyside) Jun 7, 2017 at 5:08PM Stocks moved slightly higher today, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) indexes both adding more than 0.1%. Today's stock market Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow  0.18%  37.46 S&P 500  0.16%  3.81 Data source: Yahoo! Finance Energy stocks slumped on lower crude prices, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLE) down 1.4%. Real estate stocks moved higher, and the Vanguard REIT ETF (NYSEMKT:VNQ) gained 0.7%. Two semiconductor chip stocks made waves today: Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) rose thanks to a design win, and those of Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) fell after an earnings report. Image source: Getty Images. AMD scores a spot in the iMac AMD investors have been on a roller-coaster ride in recent months. After a fantastic 2016, during which shares almost quadrupled, the market pummeled the stock last month following AMD's Q1 earnings report, sending it down 24% in a single day. Announcements made in concert with Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday have reinvigorated the stock, with shares jumping 13.6% this week, including 2.9% today. For decades, AMD has been locked in a battle with Intel for market share of CPU chips, the "brains" of personal computers. But with growth in PCs seemingly at an end, the semiconductor battleground has shifted elsewhere, and no market is hotter than the one for graphics processing units (GPUs), the muscular superchargers needed for compute-intensive applications such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, gaming, computer-generated imagery, and big data. This week, AMD revealed new versions of its Radeon processors and announced that they will be shipping in updated 21.5- and 27-inch versions of Apple's iMac. In a press release, AMD Senior Vice President and Chief Radeon Technologies Group Architect Raja Koduri said: "It is incredibly satisfying to see the capabilities of Radeon Pro 500 series in elegant form factors and enabling amazing content creation, gaming and VR experiences. Radeon Pro 500 Series graphics are enabling new generations of makers with compute-accelerated creative tools and new APIs, bringing their imaginations to life in ways like never before." AMD is focusing on lucrative opportunities at the high end of computing and has been making progress in battling Intel's dominance in server chips and high-end PCs. News this week provided some investor optimism that the company may take share from NVIDIA as well. Ambarella falls on weak guidance Shares of Ambarella, a maker of video processing chips, took a tumble today after the company announced first-quarter earnings Tuesday after market close. Good results were overshadowed by guidance for the upcoming quarter that the market perceived as weak. The company earned $0.07 per share, compared with $0.05 in the period last year, on sales of $64.1 million, up 12.2%. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding stock-based compensation and other items, was $0.39, compared with analyst expectations of $0.36. Revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter was $69 million to $72 million, whereas expectations were around the high end of that range. Ambarella stock has a recent history of falling after earnings announcements despite beating expectations, and the pattern continued today, dropping 10.3%. The company has been fighting the headwind of slumping sales and high inventories of action cameras made by GoPro. But Ambarella is actually making good progress in diversifying away from its biggest customer, as CEO Fermi Wang explained: "Q1 revenue of $64.1 million reflects our continued push to diversify our markets and customers with strong growth in the quarter coming from IP security cameras, including both professional and home monitoring markets, and continued growth in other cameras markets including wearable and automotive cameras. While our current markets continue to expand, we believe the combination of video with computer vision technology will be the real driver of new opportunities in both our current markets as well as emerging markets such as OEM automotive and robotics." The market has been tough on Ambarella in recent quarters, but long-term investors might start looking at the valuation, with the stock price only 13% above its 52-week low and a business that appears to be healthy. Jim Crumly owns shares of Ambarella, AAPL, GPRO, and NVDA. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Ambarella, AAPL, GPRO, and NVDA. The Motley Fool has the following options: short January 2019 $12 calls on GPRO and long January 2019 $12 puts on GPRO. The Motley Fool recommends INTC. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

(AMD) Stock Should Be Takeover Bait Ambarella Inc (AMBA) Stock Is a Lost Cause in Moore’s World This Is How the Qatar Investment Authority Should Be Run View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has risen from the dead under CEO Lisa Su, but it remains a small fry within the semiconductor space. It’s supposed to compete directly against Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphics chips, but Nvidia is worth $85 billion in market capitalization, versus just $10.4 billion for AMD stock. It is supposed to be the most direct competitor to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in microprocessors, but Intel is worth nearly $170 billion. Source: Shutterstock AMD is outgunned no matter where it turns. It only has the financial capacity to place a few bets. And while the new chips it showed off at Computex in Taiwan were impressive, it left unanswered questions about follow-up. The last time I wrote about AMD stock, I called it “trader” bait. That’s because just as Advanced Micro can go from $2 to $13 on good news, it can also go back down from $13 to $10 on bad news. Those kinds of swings are a trader’s dream, and an investor’s nightmare. Now it’s time to talk about what kind of trader it is bait for. Someone Needs to Buy Advanced Micro Devices It is time for someone else to own AMD. The much-hyped assault by Advanced Micro against Intel’s gaming chip castle was barely noticeable because AMD lacks the financial capacity to follow up. Its Radeon graphics technology might work well in clouds, and its Ryzen line might look good in game machines, but AMD lacks the cash to pursue the breakthrough. A buyer with imagination — and more important, a lot of cash — could. If Softbank Group Corp (OTCMKTS:SFTBF) could see $31 billion in value from ARM Holdings, allowing its microprocessor designs to be tweaked before manufacture and controlled by OEMs in distribution, how much is AMD worth? A Chinese buyer of AMD like Lenovo Group Ltd. (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) would gain intellectual property, and the engineers who created it, that could make a wholesale assault on Intel possible. A Korean buyer like Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) would get designs to fill its fabrication plants. An American buyer like Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) would get the ability to enter new markets. There are a lot of potential buyers out there. Moore’s Second Law What I have long called Moore’s Second Law — the fact that chip equipment costs rise exponentially with their complexity, even while complexity makes their processing cheaper — has forced the semiconductor industry to scale financially, beyond AMD’s capabilities.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. It's iMac, only better. Three years ago Apple introduced the 5K iMac with Retina display. Two years ago Apple introduced the smaller 4K iMac with Retina display and gave both DCI-P3 wide color. Now Apple is taking those displays, and the iMac in general, to the next level. In some ways, it's analogous to how macOS High Sierra refines the Sierra experience. These are all iMacs, all mature products, and the overall experience of using them is exactly what you'd expect. Only better. The displays are the same size, density, and depth, but even brighter and more colorful. The graphics card is faster. Intel finally got its Kaby Lake act together, so iMac is now on the 7th-generation Core-series processor. Memory can go higher. Storage is going faster. Ports now include USB-C / Thunderbolt 3. And even the Magic Keyboard can have a little more magic if you like — an extended numeric keypad. All of it still bound in the same razor-thin aluminum and glass enclosure, starting at $1099 for 1080p, and $1299 for Retina 4K. See at Apple About this review Imagine you get called to Lamborghini, told there's a new edition of your beloved hypercar coming out, and that you have 12 hours to drive it and write it up. Now imagine that but with new iMacs. Circumstances don't let you test the machine over time, but do force you to use every ounce of experience and insight you've earned over the last decade, testing and writing about and Apple products day in, day out, to push it as fast and as hard as you can and see what you learn. Since Apple not only announced the new iMacs but announced that they were immediately available for sale, it's my job to do whatever I can to give you the best buying advice I can as fast as I can. Here it is. For people who want: The best damn display in the business. Ridiculously fast storage options. USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports All-in-one design. Not for people who want: Nvidia graphics. Touch screen. Touch Bar and Touch ID. Modular, tower-style enclosure. In brief In an age where the vast majority of people buy laptops, desktop computers have to make stronger and even more compelling reasons to remain relevant. For iMac, that begins and largely ends with the display. Sure, you can get graphics and memory configurations beyond anything currently available on MacBook Pro, but it's that big, beautiful, Apple-branded display that still has many of us at "Hello". And this year it's brighter and more colorful than ever. Kaby Lake offers fine improvements, even in the age where power efficiency has eclipsed performance, and the Radeon graphics cards are so new I think Apple might have said more about them than AMD at this point. Add to that the flexibility of USB-C and Thunderbolt 3, and the ability to run macOS, Unix/Linux, and Windows, and you once again have the absolute best all-in-one on the market. At least, until iMac Pro ships. 😎 That display though It often seems like iMac begins and ends with that display. At 21.5 inches for the 1080p and 4K and 27 inches for the 5K, it's easy to see why: It's so big, so lush, and so engrossing that everything else disappears. It's almost surreal. When I first saw Retina on iMac, I thought it almost looked better than real life. Then, when I saw DCI-P3 Retina, I was fairly sure it looked better. Now that it's 43% brighter — 500 nits if you're keeping score — and implements 10-bit dithering for a billion colors, I'm convinced. It doesn't just look true to life. It looks truer to life. DCI-P3 really helped out with the reds and greens. But in some ways it was a mixed blessing: If your image was bad, you could really see it was bad. Now, 10-bit dithering makes sure all those reds, greens, and every color around and in between transitions smoothly and with no unsightly banding or stepping. The way it works is that 10-bit color information is sent to the TCON (Apple's custom timing controller), which then dithers it specially and temporally for display on the 8-bit panel. So, even if your image is bad, it looks as good as it possibly can. There's still no multitouch on the screen, of course. Microsoft might have made a similar-looking Surface Studio that folds down into a giant touch canvas, but Apple is sticking to its story that Macs are ergonomically ill-suited for touch, and macOS is optimized for a mouse and pointer, not a finger. Since I grew up using mouse-and-pointer computers, I never find myself reaching to touch my iMac display. Kids who grew up using iPads might, though. Considering Apple already has an extremely popular touch-first computing platform with iOS and iPad Pro, it makes little sense to expend the engineering resources to retrofit touch displays onto the Mac. Especially given how good the force touch trackpads are. Still, I wonder if enabling just touch navigation on Mac displays would be a convenient way forward. Especially for iMacs used in public settings and as kiosks. Swipe, pinch, poke would likely cover 80% or more of common touch use cases, and without the pain Microsoft experienced through Windows 8. Then, if Apple wanted to do a full touch 27-inch device, I'm sure many graphic artists and illustrators wouldn't mind an even larger iPad Pro. As it is, for everything from photo and video editing to podcasting to basic daily productivity, iMac works exactly how I expect a traditional computer to work. The new graphics normal The 1080p version of the 21.5-inch iMac comes with Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640. Once you step up to the 4K version, though, you immediately get discreet graphics: Radeon Pro 555 with Polaris architecture and 2GB of video memory. You can build-to-order (BTO) that up to Radeon Pro 560 with 4GB video memory and, for the 27-inch, 5K model, Radeon Pro 580 with 8GB video memory. It's enough of a boost, even comparing these models to the last ones, that if you were hitting the performance ceiling before, you'll now have some room to breathe. Or just room to do even more and hit the higher ceiling. That includes, of course, editing in Final Cut Pro X, rendering 3D, and even gaming. On average, I'm expecting up to a 2x improvement. I'm seeing just under that for video right now, but Apple says gaming and 3D are at least that, if not more. The bigger news, at least for me, is Metal 2. Apple already flattened OpenGL down to a much faster framework a couple years ago. Now it's redoubling that performance. Literally. It's enough to enable virtual reality (VR) on the Mac. I got to try out the Final Cut Pro X demo using an HTC Vive headset and it was striking. Apple's focusing first and foremost on VR content creation, but existing VR content should start appearing in time. It remains to be seen if the Mac gets the big VR games, like the recently released Star Trek Bridge Crew, and how they'll perform. But I hope it does and they do well. I don't want to maintain a separate PC or have to navigate Windows 10 just to game in VR. With Metal 2 and the also just-announced eGPU options coming later, the future is looking promising. Kaby Lake: The desktop story Kaby Lake Macs are here. "Finally". I snark-quoted that because Apple's very polite when it comes to explaining why Kaby Lake Macs were so long in coming. The company simply says they're here now and hope the recent updates speak to Apple's dedication to the Mac as a platform. Anyone who's been watching, though, knows the longer gaps between some of the more popular Macs aren't just because of Apple. They're at least partially because of Intel. Apple can't ship a computer with a chipset that doesn't exist. Two years ago, Apple couldn't even bump the 21.5-inch iMac because Intel hadn't made an updated version of the chip Apple used for that machine. Last year, some Kaby Lake chips shipped but not all of them, including the 4-core versions and versions with the graphics options Apple wants for iMac. It affects features too. iMacs used to support target display mode so they could be used as a monitor for other Macs. Intel kept delaying the integration of 5K-capable DisplayPort — and continues to delay it — and so Apple had to make it work without Intel. And those architectural realities created debt we're still all paying. Flash forward two and a half years later and we still don't have target display port back. But now, Kaby Lake Macs are here. So, what does that mean for iMac? It's a good question, since recent processor generations have been more about power efficiency than power. Kaby Lake does increase both the baseline and turbo frequencies for the Mac, so you can go a bit faster. If benchmarks are your thing, Geekbench put my entry-level 1080p iMac review unit at 4,595 for single core, 9,531 for multi-core, and 28,216 for OpenCL. My maxed-out 4K iMac review unit at 4,865 for single core, 14,111 for multi-core, and 55,885 for OpenCL. Power efficiency also helps, even on a desktop. A big part of the reason is the new, built-in hardware acceleration for H.265 (which I still have a hard time calling by its marketing name, HEVC). The successor to H.264, it allows for much more efficient video playback, including 4K video. On a MacBook, that translates to longer battery life. On an iMac, though, it translates into lower processor overhead. So instead of your 4K software-decoded video pegging the CPU and slowing down everything else you're doing, it just hums along and lets you do all sorts of other tasks at the same time. The 21.5-inch model comes with a 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz. The maxed-out 21.5-inch model comes, BTO, with a 3.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 4.2GHz. The maxed out 27-inch, BTO, a 4.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz. If you already have Skylake, you'll have to weigh the differences in processing and graphics power to see if the upgrade make sense for you. If you have Broadwell or earlier, though, it's compelling. More than just speed deep Beyond the processor, Apple's also switched iMac to DDR4 memory, and you can stuff up to 32GB in the 21.5-inch models and up to 64GB in 27-inch models. Fusion Drive is now standard on all higher-end 21.5-inch iMacs, and all 27-inch iMacs. Once I went SSD, though, I couldn't go back. Fusion Drive is a good compromise for those who want fast initial storage but are ok with bigger, if slower, second-stage storage. But I want it all blazingly fast, all the time. And I'll hang platters off the USB or TB ports for backups and larger volume storage. That's why I'm particularly thrilled Apple's made SSD 50% faster in iMac now as well. And you can max it out at 2TB, Ports, only faster In addition to the hold-over 3.5 mm headphone jack, SDXC card reader, 4x USB-A, and Ethernet ports, iMac now gets two of the USB-C /Thunderbolt 3 ports that debuted on the new MacBook Pro. They support DisplayPort, Thunderbolt up to 40Gbps, USB 3.1 (up to 10 Gbps) and, with adapters, can handle Thunderbolt 2, HDMI, DVI, and VGA as well. SDXC is the thing I've missed most from the new MacBook Pro so, I'm thrilled Apple's kept it on iMac. Otherwise, I'm all in on USB-C / TB 3. Sure, the USB consortium may change standards again in the future, but until they do, these are forward-thinking ports that'll enable everything from 5K displays to eGPU for a long time to come. Keyboard, only extended I've never liked numerical keyboards. They got in the way of where I wanted my trackpad to be. I was happy when I thought Apple had killed them. But my use case isn't everyone's use case, so, much less selfishly, I'm even happier they're back. Enjoy, spread-sheeters! Of course, I would have been even happier had Apple introduced a Touch Bar- and Touch ID-equipped version of the Magic Keyboard. Having sometimes arcane keyboard shortcuts and buried controls surfaced right atop the keyboard is convenient, but fingerprint login and authentication are becoming must-haves for me. Since the iMac keyboard is a separate bit of electronics, conceivably it could be updated again with the touch twins at any time. I'm just hoping that's sooner rather than later. Welcome to 2017, iMac! I had the opportunity to spend some extra time with the new entry-level iMac. At $1099 for 1080p and a traditional, 5400 rpm hard drive, it feels like the MacBook Air of iMacs. Again, if you've already gone Retina, discreet graphics, and SSD like me, you can't go back. With the 4K iMac starting at just $1299, that'd be my instant, emphatic recommendation for anyone who has the extra 200 bucks to spend. If you're buying in volume, if you're looking for a kiosk, or if you're considering a Mac mini for a student but really want an all-in-one, or you simply need the lowest price possible for an iMac, the 1080p is better than it was before. Noticeably. If you can find the extra money, though, the 4K is beyond worth it. The 5K, even more so. Combined, they make 2017 a solid year with solid upgrades to all the components that matter most — the ones that make iMac such an enthralling, compelling desktop experience. And we haven't even gotten to iMac Pro yet!

Should be enough for me for the next 3+ years. Recently upgraded my camera (Fujifilm GFX 50s) and the increased pixel count has put a strain on my old 13" MBP (pre-TouchBar era), especially during RAW workflow in Lightroom. Being mainly a stills photographer with no interest in video, the upcoming iMac Pro will probably be overkill for me anyway. Two thing's with the new iMac I'm a bit bummed about; 1. Card reader isn't UHS II like in the upcoming iMac Pro. A bit of a shame since my camera uses UHS II cards. Not a deal breaker though, since I can just plug the camera in directly via USB 3 to transfer files. 2. Doesn't come in Space Gray :( Will wait it out a bit and read impressions from photography forums, mainly to see how well the display calibrates, but I'm optimistic on that front. Also nice that Apple made the sane decision to keep some legacy USB ports. Won't be needing stinking dongles for my USB DAC/Amp and Wacom tablet, or even to charge my iPhone, for that matter.

Macs & Mac OS X | 06 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (11) Apple Beefs Up iMac and MacBook Lines, Teases the iMac Pro by Adam C. Engst At WWDC 2017 today, Apple devoted a non-trivial segment of the keynote to new Mac hardware, showing off improved iMacs and performance-enhanced MacBook Pros and mentioning a speed bump to the MacBook Air in passing. After running through all the changes to today’s models, Apple gave a sneak preview of the iMac Pro, a workstation-class version of the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display that’s scheduled to ship at the end of the year. No mention was made of the Mac mini or Mac Pro, though Apple has already said that the Mac Pro is in the middle of a major redesign that won’t be done until 2018 at the earliest (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017). iMac -- The workhorse of Apple’s desktop line has long been the iMac, which Apple continues to offer in three basic models: a 21.5-inch non-Retina version, a 21.5-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, and the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display. On the CPU front, each model receives a speed bump thanks to Apple using Intel’s 7th generation “Kaby Lake” processors and increasing clock speeds. You can see the specifics on Apple’s Tech Specs page, but the summary is that Apple is focusing more effort on the 21.5 Retina iMac, offering just a single configuration of the non-Retina model. Benchmarks will show how much faster the combination of new CPUs and higher clock speeds will be, but I suspect purchases will mostly be based on price. Although the iMac Retina displays are already gorgeous, Apple claims to have improved them even more in both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch sizes, increasing brightness 43 percent to 500 nits and supporting display of up to 1 billion colors. The non-Retina iMac model drives its screen with the integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, but all the Retina models now take advantage of Radeon Pro GPUs, the 555 and 560 for the 21.5-inch models and the 570, 575, and 580 models for the 27-inch models. The notable win here is for the 21.5-inch Retina models, which were previously limited to integrated Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200. Apple has made the Fusion Drive standard in more configurations, and the company claims that the SSDs available in 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB capacities are up to 50 percent faster. You can also configure the top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with a 2 TB SSD for a whopping $1400. When it comes to RAM, all base models still ship with 8 GB. The non-Retina iMac and low-end 21.5 Retina model remain limited to 16 GB, but the high-end 21.5-inch Retina model can now take 16 GB or 32 GB, a welcome improvement. Similarly, the low-end 27-inch model still maxes out at 32 GB, but the two higher-end models can take 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. RAM in the 21.5-inch iMac models cannot be upgraded by the user, but you can install memory in the 27-inch model yourself. Unsurprisingly, Apple replaced the previous models’ Thunderbolt 2 ports with a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports that support DisplayPort for external screens, Thunderbolt at up to 40 Gbps, USB 3.1 Gen 2 at up to 10 Gbps, and various other protocols via adapters (see “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between,” 3 November 2016). All these changes are welcome for anyone in the market for a new iMac. I doubt they’re significant enough to warrant trading in an existing Retina iMac, unless Thunderbolt 3 is a necessity. The most interesting changes are actually in the 21.5-inch models, which move past the RAM and graphics limitations of the previous configuration while introducing a cheaper config. The 21.5-inch non-Retina iMac remains priced at $1099, with the two Retina configurations starting at $1299 and $1499. The 27-inch model comes in three configurations: $1799, $1999, and $2299. They’re all available now. Perhaps I’m just boggled by the number of changes Apple announced in the WWDC keynote, but I couldn’t see how to give more context for the changes in relation to previous configurations because the matrix of what models get which build-to-order options was just too complicated. If you want to price out different possibilities, I recommend opening several browser windows so you can compare the configurations side by side. MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air -- As with the iMac, Apple updated the processors in the MacBook and MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake processors running at higher clock speeds. That should improve performance, although likely not by that much. The MacBook Pro models also get improved graphics processing, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro models using Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 and 650, and the 15-inch models switching to Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs on top of Intel HD Graphics 630 and 640. You can now buy a MacBook with 16 GB of RAM, up from the previous limit of 8 GB, and Apple claims that the MacBook’s onboard SSD is up to 50 percent faster. That might make the MacBook a more attractive option, given that lackluster performance was one of its main disadvantages. Despite rumors to the contrary, the MacBook Air lives, but it sees the least change, replacing its stock 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with a 1.8 GHz model. It remains upgradeable to an Intel Core i7 running at 2.2 GHz. Although these changes are all positive, they do nothing to simplify the difficulty of choosing between the three models. Each falls into the three-dimensional graph of price, performance, and size in a different spot. You’ll have to decide what’s most important to you — cost, speed, or portability — and figure out which of Apple’s notebooks best fits your needs. As with the new iMac models, these updated notebooks are all available now. iMac Pro -- During the private media meeting in which Apple executives confessed to the company’s sins with regard to the Mac Pro, mention was made of pro-related announcements about the iMac coming this year. Apple has now revealed more of what that means, pulling back the curtains on the iMac Pro. Due in December 2017, the iMac Pro retains the same form factor of the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display, but swaps the brushed aluminum look for a space gray finish that extends to the Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, Magic Mouse 2, and an optional Magic Trackpad 2. The goal of the iMac Pro is to provide workstation-class performance within the iMac design. The hardest part of that is dealing with heat, because the iMac Pro will feature Intel Xeon processors in 8-core, 10-core, or 18-core configurations. Also playing into the necessary thermal architecture redesign is Apple’s use of a new Radeon Pro Vega GPU, which reportedly features a next-generation compute core and up to 16 GB of on-package high-bandwidth memory (HBM2). Apple says that the iMac Pro with Vega GPU delivers up to 11 teraflops of single-precision compute power for real-time 3D rendering and high frame rate VR. For half-precision computation that’s reportedly ideal for machine learning, the iMac Pro can deliver up to 22 teraflops of performance. (No, we don’t really have a sense of what that means, either, but Apple PR did a good job of making it sound impressive.) The iMac Pro will come with 32 GB of RAM by default, but for a machine in this class, the fact that it’s configurable to 64 GB or 128 GB is more important. A 1 TB SSD is also standard, with 2 TB and 4 TB SSDs as options. Unsurprisingly, the iMac Pro sports four Thunderbolt 3 ports, which enables it to drive up to two 5K displays and two high-performance RAID arrays at the same time. Other connectivity options mimic what’s on the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display now, with the exception of Ethernet. Instead of gigabit Ethernet, the iMac Pro will include 10 Gb Ethernet, which could be a big deal when transferring huge amounts of data between machines. How much will all this cost? A lot, with the base iMac Pro configuration starting at $4999. Apple claimed that a comparable workstation would cost about $7000, without a 5K display. Even still, given the high price of large SSDs and RAM, we anticipate that a loaded iMac Pro will easily meet or exceed that $7000 mark. But that won’t stop the audience for the iMac Pro. If you need the maximum performance from a Mac, the iMac Pro will provide it. At least until a new Mac Pro makes its debut, and many of those who live and die by the teraflop won’t want to wait.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

The MacBook and MacBook Pro also get new CPUs, the MacBook becomes more expandable, and the MacBook Air receives a small speed bump. The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michael E. Cohen   2017-06-06 10:48 And if anyone out there thinks the iMac Pro means that a Mac Pro ISN'T also coming, Apple's press release on the iMac Pro puts that misconception to rest: "In addition to the new iMac Pro, Apple is working on a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest-end, high-throughput system in a modular design, as well as a new high-end pro display." Reply Mackay Bell  2017-06-07 20:38 It seems that part of the reason they revealed that they were working on an expandable Mac Pro (and apologizing for the trash can version) is they wanted people to get excited about the iMac Pro, and not suck up all the air complaining about the lack of an expandable system. By getting that story out before the release, they could get a little more excitement going for the coming of the iMac Pro. Reply Alan Forkosh   2017-06-06 11:09 It's noteworthy that Apple didn't mention anything about the Touch Bar. As it stands now, Touch Bar is an orphan, present on only on the MacBook Pro line. It strikes me as something that can't really be considered a standard until there is a desktop version of it also--either a new keyboard or a standalone item to be paired with a keyboard. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 12:00 In fact, it turns out that Apple did release a new wireless Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. But not with a Touch Bar. Boo! http://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-has-a-new-wireless-magic-keyboard-with-a-full-numeric-keypad/amp/ Reply Paul Ellis  2017-06-06 13:53 The Touch Bar is a gimmick. It breaks all the rules of ergonomics and focus. It might possibly make some sense when positioned close the the screen, and therefore point of focus, on a laptop, but makes little sense for a desktop. If I were a developer, which thankfully I'm not, I wouldn't be wasting any time developing for it, and certainly not if I'd previously been stung by OpenDoc, QuickTime VR, etc. etc. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:57 I like what Apple is doing with the iMac and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assuming they'll make things right with the new Mac Pro once it finally arrives. The MBP seems fine. I still don't see what TouchBar is supposed to accomplish - I also think it's mainly a gimmick with poor ergonomics. Apple didn't spend any time on it at this WWDC. Does anybody think it might disappear during the next overhaul? I don't really get why Apple is keeping the MBA around instead of just trying to make an inexpensive entry-level MB instead. Since there is no inexpensive entry-level MB, I assume that means the MB is targeting the middle/high-end of the compact/light market. So with that in mind, why in the world did they not replace that USB-C with TB3? If this were a budget Mac at $999 targeted at schools and students, fine. But since this is a midrange Mac we're talking about, why leave it stuck with USB-C? Nothing TB3 offers can't be done with USB-C, but TB3 is just more versatile and it is no doubt the new standard across Macs - well almost, sigh. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:59 (cont.) My only real gripe on the Mac side is the Mac mini. How can Apple just let it sit there to die? Either kill it off already (so people know they'll have to go Hackintosh) or update it. But just leaving it sit there without a clear plan makes we wonder what message Apple is trying to send. It reminds me of the Mac Pro situation before pressure from pros and tech journalists forced Apple to take a stand. I see a lot of potential for the Mac mini, from cheap servers to simple office computers, offering a low-price entry point to the Mac universe, schools, home media servers, etc. I'm afraid all of that is "too techy" and not sexy enough for the new Apple. I really hope I'm wrong. I'm holding onto my trusty Core i5 Mac mini, but with its 4 GB of RAM (could be upgraded) and 500 GB HDD (could also be upgraded, but is that worth it?) its days are numbered even as my home media server. Reply Bertrand Morin  2017-06-06 19:27 Is the memory (RAM) upgradable in the iMac 27in. by the user, as it wad older iMac… Reply James  2017-06-08 07:58 Did you read the product page for the 27" iMac? If not, go back and read it again. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-07 01:08 Is there any indication yet if the new iMac models (both 21.5" and 27") have user upgradable RAM? There is some wording on the Apple page that you can upgrade the 21.5" RAM after purchase through Apple or an authorized dealer, but it not 100% clear. And the page for the 27" is completely silent. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 09:59 The 21.5-inch models are NOT user-upgradeable, but the 27-inch model is.

As part of the announcement-heavy WWDC keynote, Apple has revved the iMac line with Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, higher performance graphics, brighter screens, and faster SSDs. The MacBook and MacBook Pro also get new CPUs, the MacBook becomes more expandable, and the MacBook Air receives a small speed bump. The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Add a comment  Search   Cached. Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2017 Adam C.

Here's all you need to know. Microsoft has come a long way since the original Surface launched but has stuck to the fundamental belief that users should be able to use a tablet as their primary computing device. If you get a Surface Pro you are running a full version of Windows 10. That means you'll be as productive as possible. The 2017 version of the Surface Pro looks to build on that by giving users new Intel Kaby Lake processors that provide better performance and lower power consumption than the Surface line has seen before. The new Surface Pro is the definition of having the performance and functionality of a laptop on the go, but now it has a new challenger to deal with. During WWDC 2017 Apple announced a new 10.5 inch iPad Pro, and thanks to significant hardware and software upgrades, it's now seemingly easier than ever to get things done on the iPad. So much so, it seems Apple is finally delivering on its promise of the iPad being a replacement for a laptop. With both devices shipping this month, it’s we thought we'd examine both and see which one deserves your cash as the best laptop replacement on the market. 10.5-inch iPad Pro vs 2017 Surface Pro: Design and hardware The 10.5 inch iPad Pro has the best screen-to-bezel ratio ever seen on an iPad. The screen is a Retina display with a resolution of 2224 x 1668, which packs 264 pixels per inch (ppi). The screen is also capable of displaying HDR and can get incredibly bright, up to 600 nits in fact. It also features the same wide colour gamut that can be found on the iPhone 7 and new line MacBook Pros. And finally, the screen features a 120hz refresh rate, thanks to the new ProMotion technology, meaning navigating around iOS 11 should be smoother than ever. The 2017 Surface Pro, on the other hand, comes with a 12.3-inch PixelSense screen that displays content at a 2736 x 1824 resolution. That means it has a pixel density of 267 pixels per inch which narrowly beats out the iPad’s 264 – though you're unlikely to notice the difference. A big design difference comes from the fact that the Surface device is designed more as a laptop replacement. It's a Windows 10 tablet that can transform into a laptop through the addition of an attachable keyboard. You can still use the iPad Pro with a type cover, in the same way as the Surface attaches to a type cover, but the presence of full Windows 10 makes the Surface device feel more like a laptop alternative. As such, the Surface Pro has become synonymous with the type cover, while the iPad Pro is still very much thought of as a tablet. Related: 10.5-inch iPad Pro vs 12.9-inch iPad Pro Hardware-wise, the 10.5-inch iPad is powered by the A10X fusion chip with a 64-bit architecture and six-core CPU. All of which means Apple's tablet should be an absolute screamer performance-wise. And if you're worried that increased performance will eat up battery life, fret not. Users should expect to get roughly 10 hours of battery on a single charge, which is the same as on older models. The highest specced model of the 2017 Surface Pro comes with an Intel Core i7 7660U Kaby Lake processor that should run a buttery smooth version of Windows 10. However, it’s worth noting there are also cheaper Core i5 and Core m3 models if you don’t want to get into four-figure pricing territory. The Surface Pro also has the iPad Pro beat on battery life, with Microsoft stating you should be able to get up to 13.5 hours of usage on a single charge. However, we’ll have to wait until both release to make the final call on battery life. In terms of internal storage, put simply, Microsoft offers more. You can choose between 128,256, 512GB, or 1T of storage on the Surface Pro, while Apple offers either 64, 256, or 512GB on the iPad Pro. Here’s a full look at both tablets' specs side by side: 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2017 Surface Pro Screen 10.5 inch 12.3-inch Display Resolution 2224x1668 (264ppi) 2736x1824 (267ppi) Primary Camera 12MP 8MP Secondary Camera 7MP 5MP Chipset Apple A10X Intel 7th gen core m3,i5,i7 RAM N/A 4/8/16GB Storage 64/256/512GB 128/256/512GB or 1T Battery 10 hours 13.5 hours Fingerprint Scanner?

The next instalment of Apple's mobile OS arrives later this year, so for now, you're getting iOS 10. But the new iOS 11 features look very impressive. They start with the improved dock that has seemingly been taken straight from the Mac. The dock allows the user to place as many applications as they want inside and also features a context-sensitive predictive apps area, which will display apps it thinks you might want to use. The dock is no longer limited to just being on your home screen, either. You'll now be able to swipe up to reveal it while in any application – this is where the desktop-like functionality begins on the 10.5-inch iPad. The new dock also allows for a completely new, and quite frankly overdue, multitasking experience on the iPad. After the dock has been summoned, you can drag the app you want to multitask with onto the display and a small window will appear. The size of each multitasking window can then be adjusted to your preference. Mission Control also comes to the iPad, or at least functionality that seems to replicate it. This displays all open apps, as well as the apps that have been paired together for multitasking, to allow the user to easily navigate around the device. Drag and drop is another feature that's making its way from the Mac to the iPad. Users are now able to, you guessed it, drag and drop anything they have open in one app to another. The iPad also gets a Finder replica in the form of the Files app. The smartest feature here is that all files from cloud services such as Dropbox are now seamlessly integrated so that you don’t have to log into a separate app to find all you documents. This marks the first time the iPad has received significant features from macOS instead of iOS doing all the giving to the Mac. Although these features are being marked as revolutionary, they are long overdue for a tablet that Apple has been positioning as a viable substitute to a laptop for a number of years now. The Surface Pro has a heritage in changing people's notion of what a tablet can do — anything that runs a full version of Windows 10 has to be taken seriously. Microsoft's tablet allows users to be incredibly productive as it can run the Microsoft Office 365 suite, which comes with full versions of all the Office apps you’ve come to love using. In case you hadn't got the hint yet, the big theme with the Surface Pro is that absolutely no compromises have been made in transferring the Windows user experience to a tablet. You have an awesome tablet experience when you want it, and you have a very capable PC experience when you need to be more productive, too. If you know Windows 10, then there is nothing on the 2017 Surface Pro that will surprise you. What you will find on the 2017 Surface Pro that you won’t find on a normal Windows PC is all the Surface Pen functionality that comes with it. Graphic designers, or just simply anyone that needs to take notes will really appreciate the stylus feature. Apple has its own version, in the form of the Apple Pencil, which is now even more responsive thanks to the aforementioned ProMotion technology, with Apple getting latency down to an impressive 20ms. 10.5-inch iPad Pro vs 2017 Surface Pro: Release date and price The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is available to buy now and will start shipping next week. The tablet starts at £619/$649 for the 64GB version, with the 256GB and 512GB versions costing £709/$749 and £889/$949 respectively. The 2017 Surface Pro is available to pre-order now with the product expected to start shipping on June 15. The pricing for the different specced models can be found below: 128GB Intel Core m3 (4GB of RAM) - £799 128GB Intel Core i5 (4GB of RAM) - £979 256GB Intel Core i5 (8GB of RAM) - £1249 256GB Intel Core i7 (8GB of RAM) - £1549 512GB Intel Core i7 (16GB of RAM) - £2149 1TB Intel Core i7 (16GB of RAM) - £2699 10.5-inch iPad Pro vs 2017 Surface Pro: Summary You’re getting more of the same with the 2017 Surface Pro, which is great because the Surface Pro line has been a viable substitute to a laptop for a while now. The specs have been greatly improved, with Kaby Lake set to make Windows 10 on the Surface buttery smooth. Microsoft's hybrid can be an amazing tablet when you want it to be but also an incredibly capable computer when you need to get serious. The only caveat with buying a Surface is that to make the most of its productivity features, you’re going to have to shell out for a Type Cover (£150). If you’re already planning on purchasing one of the well-specced versions of the Surface, you’re looking at a very big investment. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro certainly wins in the price category, even if you decide to max out the tablet’s memory. But the cheaper price is supplemented by the fact it’s still uncertain how productive the 10.5-inch iPad is going to allow you to be. Although iOS looks more functional than ever, it still looks restrictive and the lack of support for a mouse means, in practice, multitasking may prove to be more difficult than Apple is demonstrating. If you’re looking for the perfect tablet, then the iPad takes the title every time. However, if you’re serious about replacing your laptop with a tablet, then the 2017 Surface Pro looks to be the right device for you. We'll have more once we've reviewed both.

Improve Swings With Data Design & Architecture Doc Portrait PDF Landscape PDF Doc EMail Share Facebook Twitter Available to Premium & Purple Members The hardware turns cricket into a game of numbers Leo Lutero 7 june 2017 The game of cricket is a lot about technique and fine-tuning. Well, not anymore, as hardware by Intel and start-up Speculur could potentially turn it more into a numbers game. With the Speculur BatSense installed on a cricket bat, the attributes that make up each swing is measured and transmitted by a patch that’s stuck just below the bat handle. Powered by an Intel Curie system-on-a-chip, the attachment records important data about each swing: the back lift angle, impact angle, bat speed at impact, time to impact, follow-through angle and max bat speed. The hardware is very straightforward, as an enclosed round disc that syncs data to either a propriety app or a computer. Here at PSFK, we have seen the Intel Curie on wearables. There are these clothes that read you stress levels in real time. Another one is its use in the Shift IQ for running, where it uses clever algorithms to provide coaching for your running. The Speculur system was first debuted at the International Cricket Council (ICC) Champions Trophy, together with other Intel products. The BeatSense was used to provide a deeper look into every swing by the top players. With every hit, the commentators had more information to work with to make their call, spotting errors and praising perfection in real-time. Along with BeatSense, Intel also employed drones for a more in-depth analysis of the play. The drones measured the playing field, providing information on the topology that could affect a player’s performance. Those at home were treated to a much more intimate look at the world’s second most popular sport. According to the Speculur website, the device will be available at leading sports retailers soon. No word yet on just how much it will cost.

Feral Announces Requirements For Dawn of War III On Linux With OpenGL & Vulkan Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 7 June 2017 at 08:39 AM EDT. 11 Comments A day ahead of Feral's much anticipated Linux (and macOS) port of Dawn of War III, the game porting firm has announced the system requirements. Feral lists, "On Linux, you'll need at least 3.4GHz Intel i3-4130 running Ubuntu 16.04, 8GB RAM and an Nvidia 650Ti with 1GB of VRAM. We recommend a 3.4GHz Intel i7-4770 running Ubuntu 16.10, 8GB RAM and an Nvidia 980Ti with 4GB of VRAM. AMD and Intel graphics cards are not supported on OpenGL. Please note: Experimental Vulkan support on Linux will require driver version 381.22 for Nvidia, Mesa 17.1 for AMD, or Mesa 17.2-devel for Intel." Good to see that RADV is in shape on Mesa Git while RadeonSI with OpenGL is not until the bindless textures support lands in the near future. Interesting that Intel ANV Vulkan should even be working. There will also be a PPA for those wanting to use the bindless-patched RadeonSI for this game on Ubuntu, but hopefully it will only be days before seeing the support merged to mainline. Many benchmarks tomorrow. 11 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

My first real hands-on experience with open source software was running Apache on FreeBSD webservers in the late 90s and early 2000s. Since then, I moved on to Samba, BIND, qmail, postfix, and anything and everything else that grabbed my attention. I currently support Windows, FreeBSD, Debian, and Ubuntu workstations and servers doing just about everything that you can possibly do with any or all of them. RAH said it best - » More about me Learn how you can contribute 3 off-the-shelf Linux computers compared Check out these feature-packed Linux computers from OEMs ZaReason, System76, and Dell. Posted 06 Jun 2017 Jim SalterFeed 9up 13 comments Image by :  opensource.com While the options for Linux computers from commercial vendors are still needles in the proverbial haystack of OEM Windows equipment out there, there are more and more options available to a consumer who wants a good, solid device that's ready-to-use with no messing around. Still, there are more Linux OEM computers than I could look at for one article—and the options tend to be different in Europe than they are in the United States, with providers like Entroware that don't ship to the latter at all. In this article, I look at offerings from three of the most well-known Linux OEMs on the western side of the pond: ZaReason, System76, and Dell. ZaReason Mediabox 6550 When I sent out a letter to several manufacturers, I asked specifically for Linux laptops, because that's what I'd planned on writing about. But whenever they'd ask which part out of the catalog I wanted, my response was always, "send me what you want Opensource.com readers to see." ZaReason CEO Cathy Malmrose took me at my word and didn't send me a laptop at all! The ZaReason Mediabox 6550 is a desktop-style PC in a low, cube-like, home theater PC (HTPC) case. Specifically, it's a CoolerMaster 130 Elite. The default build, at $500 with a Pentium G, onboard video, and a 500GB conventional hard drive, would make a good HTPC. The one I received was considerably more tricked out, with a 3.9GHz i3-7100, a GeForce GTX 1060, and a 100GB NVMe SSD—a pretty solid midrange gaming box, for a reasonable US $1,055. zareason-back.jpg The Mediabox has plenty of USB3 ports, a gigabit Ethernet interface, and even an 802.11ac Intel 8260 2x2 WiFi card, complete with antennas. zareason-front.jpg That's a 15" portable monitor on top of the Mediabox. The GTX 1060 and that elderly 22" Acer LED monitor you see sitting on top of the server next to it didn't really get along, unfortunately. zareason-top-cropped.jpg A fairly uninteresting peek down into the Mediabox's opened shell. This case makes for a pretty compact build, so there's really not much to see without disassembling the whole thing. The machine is quiet, fast, and does what it's supposed to. It boots in just a few seconds and automatically logs you into an Ubuntu Yakkety (16.10) desktop as a default user: user zareason, password zareason. This was the one real gripe I had about the machine. On the one hand, it's appealing not to have to click through the usual OEM install experience... but on the other, default logins of brandname:brandname are a really bad security gaffe since too many people won't change them. (It is, of course, trivial enough to create your own user account and delete the default one entirely.) This also means that you won't get optimized mirrors for your location when you unbox it; a vanilla install of Ubuntu from my house puts us.archive.ubuntu.com in the sources list, but this machine used archive.ubuntu.com instead. Following along the path of "convenient for the end user," all proprietary drivers for the hardware—both the NVidia proprietary binary and Intel's microcode driver for the CPU—were already installed and in use. On the one hand, that's not likely to make RMS happy. On the other hand, let's be honest—who buys a GTX 1060 and then runs nouveau drivers? The biggest strength of ZaReason's Mediabox is, paradoxically, the easiest thing to pick at: It's a box that a hobbyist could build out of stock parts. That really is a strength, though—it's pretty much an ideal build, consisting of the right parts competently assembled, that you didn't have to choose and buy individually and put together yourself... and that won't be impossible to work on due to proprietary parts nobody but the OEM ever made. If you need an HTPC or gaming machine, it's hard to go wrong here. Price as reviewed: US $1,055 Ubuntu Yakkety Yak (16.10 intermediate release) Intel i3-7100 CPU at 3.9 GHz 16GB DDR4 SDRAM GeForce GTX 1060 video 100GB NVMe SSD DVD-RW Realtek RTL8168 gigabit Ethernet Intel 8260 802.11ac WiFi System76 Oryx Pro System76's Oryx Pro laptop is not an airy, lightweight consumer device. It's an intimidating, portable battle station with an undeniable gravitas to go along with its all-aluminum-alloy, 6 lb. heft; it wants you to know it is a serious machine being used by a serious developer/admin/gamer/executive, and it gets that message across loud and clear. oryx-pro-top.jpg This is, without a doubt, one of the nicest looking laptops I've ever had the pleasure of playing with. oryx-pro-open.jpg There's no way to get across how bright and bold the keyboard backlighting on the Oryx Pro really is without a picture. Unfortunately, while there's probably a way of getting a decent-looking shot of an open laptop with a bright screen and keyboard backlight, I don't know how to! oryx-pro-left.jpg The left side of the Oryx Pro has a fan exhaust, an HDMI output, a USB3 port, and two mini-DisplayPort video outputs. oryx-pro-right.jpg Oryx Pro's right side features headphone/line/mic audio jacks, a Compact Flash reader, a MultiMedia Card (MMC) reader, two USB3-C (the new symmetrical USB interface) ports, another standard USB3, a Realtek 8168 gigabit Ethernet jack, and a Kensington security lock port. The benefits of Oryx Pro's no-compromises hefty build don't stop at its menacing good looks: This is without a doubt the most solid feeling laptop I've ever used. The screen hinges are very firm and tight and feel like they'll stay that way for a long time. There's zero flex in the chassis or under the keyboard as you pick the machine up, move it around, or type on it, no matter how enthusiastic you get. Finally, while 6 lbs is undeniably heavy, the Oryx Pro isn't as bulky as you might think—it's a full size 15.6" laptop, and no doubt about it, but it isn't one bit thicker than it needs to be to fit its full-size Ethernet jack on the side. The USB3 ports are spaced all the way around the laptop, so it's pretty easy to accommodate wherever you set up and whichever thing has the short cord (or the really long back sticking out). The touchpad and keyboard both feel really nice, and I certainly appreciate the full layout with a number pad on the right. The backlighting will accommodate pretty much anything you want it to do; you can change its color through white/red/blue/green/cyan, and turn its brightness up or down through four or five levels, by using the Fn key with clearly-marked controls on the number-pad. Finally, the Oryx Pro features an M.2 PCIe system drive with bays for not just one but two additional, optional 2.5" SATA drives if you need them. This is a pretty amazing feature if you need to do demos or move client data around in large quantities, and I'm not sure where except System76 you'd find it. Unlike the ZaReason Mediabox, the Oryx Pro boots into Canonical's standard "first login" setup for desktop Ubuntu—the OS is already installed, but no user accounts are set until you create your own and give it a password. This does mean you need to spend an extra 15 or 20 seconds before you can start playing... but it also means there's no default system account lurking and waiting for someone to potentially exploit it. Proprietary drivers for its CPU and GPU are pre-installed and operational. The Oryx Pro starts at US $1,399, and configuration as reviewed was US $1,763. If you want the thinnest, lightest thing you can find or the longest battery life (my Oryx Pro was good for about three hours of moderate use, fully charged), this isn't the machine for you. But if what you really want is a hard-core desktop machine that you can put in your lap wherever you go, it doesn't get any better than this. Price as reviewed: US $1,763 Ubuntu Yakkety Yak (16.10 intermediate release) Intel i7-7700HQ CPU 32GB DDR4 SDRAM GeForce GTX 1060 video 250GB NVMe SSD 15.6" 1080p display Full layout backlit keyboard with number pad Realtek RTL8168 gigabit Ethernet Intel 8260 802.11ac WiFi Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition Dell's XPS 13 Developer Edition gets a lot of press, but it's not Dell's first time to the rodeo—Dell was one of the first big manufacturers to dip its toes into the OEM Linux space all the way back in 2009, with the Mini 10 and Mini 10v line of Atom-powered netbooks (of which I owned several). Back then, the Linux options honestly weren't that great—I bought them eagerly to "vote with my wallet," but Job One was paving them clean and reinstalling stock Ubuntu (or, back then, Ubuntu Netbook Remix) to get rid of that "you bought a corporate thing with corporate crud on it" feel. I am pleased to say that Dell has come a long way since then. As great as the XPS 13 looks physically, it's matched on the inside by pretty amazing attention to free and open source detail from one of the world's largest corporate manufacturers. Mine had Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installed—a nice departure from the usual intermediate builds!—and while the full, proprietary Google Chrome browser was installed and available, the open source Chromium build was not only installed, but in pole position on the launcher. Similarly, Dell was careful not to install any proprietary hardware drivers on the XPS 13—while there are several alternate drivers provided by Dell in use, they're all marked "open source" in the Additional Drivers dialog, and Intel's proprietary microcode driver is available but not installed or running. Back to those physical features, though—the XPS 13 is pretty much the perfect size for anyone wanting a super-small, thin, light laptop they can still actually work with. Dell's nearly bezel-less display allows it to pack that 13" display into an actual device smaller than an 11.6" Chromebook—no small feat. At 2 lb. 14 oz., it's less than half the weight of the Oryx Pro, and the battery life is just plain crazy—somewhere well north of nine hours. I used mine over the course of an entire three-day weekend for an hour or two here or there—letting the laptop sleep, not power off, in between sessions—without ever needing to recharge. The single, device-wide hinge makes it feel much sturdier than most laptops its size, and the keyboard was also quite good. In many ways, the Oryx Pro and the XPS 13 are two sides of the same coin. The Oryx Pro aims for people who want a serious desktop computer they can take with them; the XPS 13 aims for people who want a seriously small, convenient laptop they can still do real work on. They both have an aluminum alloy chassis and extremely sturdy internals for a high-quality, no-flex feel. Although the XPS 13 is objectively light at less than 3 lb., it's surprisingly heavier than it looks due to that same solid construction. Finally, the Dell's i7-7500U isn't really a match for the i7-7700HQ in the Oryx Pro, but it's hard to argue with the extra five-plus hours of battery life you get in return! xps13-top.jpg Visually, the XPS 13 doesn't have the sheer gravitas of the Oryx Pro. The understated elegance of a simple slab of brushed aluminum goes a long way, though. xps13-left.jpg On the left, we see a headphone jack (take that, Apple!), a USB3 port, a USB Type-C Thunderbolt port, and the power jack. xps13-open.jpg I'm still terrible at getting a good color balance on a photo with a screen in it, but trust me, the XPS13's display is gorgeous. The diamond-deck texture you see is a "soft touch" coating on the carbon fiber composite the XPS 13 uses in place of plastic on the inside face of the laptop. Much like the Oryx, there's absolutely no annoying flex to be found here. xps13-right.jpg XPS 13's right side features an SD card reader, USB3 jack (though I wish they'd use the blue internals, instead of that near-microscopic "SS" screen print, to mark it!), and Kensington security slot. xps13-back.jpg There's nothing at all on the back of the XPS 13 but that big screen hinge, making it perfect for working in cramped spaces—like the seat of an airplane. My XPS 13 came with a QCA6174 802.11ac 2x2 WiFi adapter—and if you're wondering why Qualcomm and not Intel, the answer is that this is a Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) adapter. That doesn't mean too much right now, but it will become increasingly important over the next few years as higher-end smartphones, tablets, and routers all support the feature. In a nutshell, MU-MIMO won't do you any good unless your router and several of your devices support it; but networks that have at least several MU-MIMO-capable devices will operate much more reliably than those that don't. This particular XPS 13 also came with a 4K touchscreen display. This was unfortunate because Ubuntu—like Windows—just isn't ready for near-microscopic pixels. The desktop environment scales natively and easily to full resolution, and quite a few applications do too—but "quite a few" and "all" are two very different things. For applications that don't support HiDPI (high dots per inch) scaling (like Pinta, which I installed while using the laptop over a long weekend), the interface buttons are so small, it's hard to tap or click them at all, let alone read anything on them. It didn't take long to decide I'd had enough of 4K and just set the display to 1080p. This produced a beautiful and usable display... but it also exposed a corner-case bug in Intel's graphics driver. With the 4K display in 4K it was fine, and with a 1080p display at 1080p you'd be fine... but downscale the 4K display to 1080p, and you get occasional rapid "glitching" in full-screen browser windows. For most people, it's annoying but no big deal; for photosensitive epileptics, it might be enough to trigger a seizure. The silver lining to encountering this bug was seeing, once again, how far Dell has come as a Linux OEM. When I reported the bug, I honestly didn't expect much. But Dell's Linux support department immediately asked for video of the glitch happening and used it to file a private bug with Canonical upstream. From there, Dell and Canonical tracked it down to bugs filed already on Launchpad and upstream with Xorg at freedesktop.org. (The bug has since been addressed and is fixed in 16.10 and later, or in the hardware enablement [HWE] kernels for 16.04.) This was not only objectively good support, but some of the most Linux-friendly support I've ever received from any company. You can get into an i5-powered, non-touchscreen 1080p XPS 13 with 4GB of RAM starting at $850; the version I reviewed here came in at just under $2,000.

This 15" device looks very much like an XPS 15 and comes with either Ubuntu or RedHat, depending on the market, and with either an FHD or a touch UHD screen. Internally you get more​ memory, more storage, a beefy i7 HQ CPU and an NVidia GPU - which of course translates to poor battery life: I get around 3 hours between wall plugs. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Alessandro on 06 Jun 2017 Permalink What model is the potable monitor you used to test the Mediabox? reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Jim Salter on 06 Jun 2017 Permalink It's a "GAEMS M155" (that's not a typo). It's sold as a gaming gadget, not a system administration tool; but I bought it to (and use it to) connect to arbitrary normally-headless machines in server closets. It's powered from a single USB which can be plugged directly into a computer's USB port, and gets its video over HDMI. Works really well, very thin and lightweight. Basically, if you've ever wished you could just plug video IN into a laptop and use it as a monitor, this is that thing, except much lighter and cheaper than a laptop. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Seth Kenlon on 06 Jun 2017 Permalink I had a Gazelle from System76.

Glad to see Linux out there in the workforce. However, as with most reviews and tutorials on the Web. the focus is on Ubuntu as the OS; I always feel like a red-headed stepchild for continuing to use openSUSE (13.1/13.2 on the old Lexmark/Toshiba laptops and the LEAP 42.1 on my "newer" Dell). Since I blew Windows away on all 3 `tops and self-installed, would that also be a viable option for these units? I especially liked the ruggedness of the System 76,as I tend to move around the house/shop a lot. Thanks again! Cheers!! reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Jim Salter on 07 Jun 2017 Permalink Should be fine, on the System76 at least - I'd be a bit more nervous about the dell.

By Charlie Osborne for Between the Lines | June 7, 2017 -- 07:07 GMT (00:07 PDT) | Topic: Intel Intel Intel and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have announced a new collaboration designed to create a new, powerful data-handling and computing platform which leverages machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. On Tuesday, the tech giant and US agency said DARPA's program, dubbed the Hierarchical Identify Verify & Exploit (HIVE), has the potential to surpass current hardware used to handle Big Data by up to 1,000 times in performance-per-watt, and Intel's technological expertise has been chosen to push HIVE research and development further. Intel's Data Center Group (DCG), Platform Engineering Group (PEG) and Intel Labs will work on the hardware research for DARPA HIVE. The joint research program, which is estimated to take 4 and a half years, is worth over $100 million. In only a few years, over 90 percent of the data available today has been created. This notion of "Big Data" is not only valuable to businesses to analyze and detect patterns and tailor business models based on consumer behavior, but also to researchers who can plunder this data treasure trove for projects relating to everything from healthcare, security, or software development, among others. However, storing, indexing, and accessing this information takes power and time. HIVE, in particular, wants to improve graph analytics in relation to Big Data by leveraging ML and AI in order to construct and quickly process not only "one to one" or "one to many" relationships, but also more complex trees of indirect relationships, such as the changing purchase patterns of Amazon users, or iTunes sales ranks. See also: Intel's Compute Card: Will this tiny device power a new generation of mini PCs? "By mid-2021, the goal of HIVE is to provide a 16-node demonstration platform showcasing 1,000x performance-per-watt improvement over today's best-in-class hardware and software for graph analytics workloads," said Dhiraj Mallick, vice president of the Data Center Group and general manager of the Innovation Pathfinding and Architecture Group at Intel. "Intel's interest and focus in the area may lead to earlier commercial products featuring components of this pathfinding technology much sooner." Last week, the tech giant revealed plans to make the Thunderbolt 3 specification royalty-free from next year in a move expected to boost adoption of the connection standard. what's hot on zdnet OneLogin security chief reveals new details of data breach US spy chief reverses course, will not say how many Americans caught in NSA surveillance Hands-on with the new iPad Pro, Apple's AR platform Apple plants seeds with ARKit and HomePod Five biotech inventions the US is not ready...

Let's have a look at the details of these refreshed Polaris parts. Most MacBook Pro machines come with Intel IGPs, but higher-end 15" units come with AMD Radeon Radeon Pro 555 or Radeon Pro 560 graphics chips onboard. Both chips are likely based off the Polaris 21 chip inside the desktop Radeon HD 560. For reference, that chip has 1024 stream processors at a 1275 MHz boost clock. The Radeon Pro 555 packs 1.3 TFLOPS of peak compute power courtesy of 768 SPs packed into 12 compute units. Those figures would imply a boost clock of 850 MHz. The bigger Radeon Pro 560 has 1024 SPs in an array of 16 CUs, offering up a total of 1.9 TFLOPS, indicating that the boost clock is presumably set at 925 MHz. Both graphics options list 81 GB/s of memory bandwidth, which works out to 5 GT/s GDDR5 memory on a 128-bit-wide memory bus. The Radeon Pro 555 comes with 2 GB of its own memory, while the Radeon Pro 560 doubles that figure at 4 GB. Updated iMacs are available with three new AMD graphics chip options: the Radeon Pro 570, Radeon Pro 575, and Radeon Pro 580. All three appear to be built around the same Polaris 20 chip found in the desktop Radeon RX 570 and Radeon RX 580 cards. Memory bandwidth is set at 217 GB/s for the whole trio, a measure that works out to 6.8 GT/s GDDR5 on a 256-bit bus. For reference, the standard Radeon RX 570 packs 2048 SPs boosting to 1244 MHz and the Radeon RX 580 has 2304 at a 1340 MHz boost clock. The Radeon Pro 570 has been knocked down to 1792 SPs (in 28 CUs) offering up to 3.6 TFLOPs, which should mean a 1.0 GHz base clock according to a little napkin math. The Radeon Pro RX 575 delivers up to 4.5 TFLOPS from its 2048 SPs or 32 CUs, suggesting a 1100 MHz boost clock. Both those chips get 4 GB of RAM. Lastly, the Radeon Pro 580 has 2304 SPs (thus 36 CUs) cranking out up to 5.5 TFLOPS, indicating a 1.2 GHz boost clock. Much like its desktop counterpart, the Pro 580 has 8 GB of RAM on tap. The 768 SP configuration in the Radeon Pro 555 is not entirely novel. The same figure was found in the Radeon RX 455, though the 455 was built around older Bonaire silicon. Similarly, the 1792 SP layout in the Radeon Pro 575 has also been seen before in the Polaris 10 Radeon HD 470D sold exclusively in East Asian markets. All Radeon Pro 500-series chips appear to be Apple-exclusive, at least for now. Tags: Graphics Mac Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Apple's computers get Intel's latest chip, the Kaby Lake processors. Screenshot from Apple Apple unveiled their hardware and software future at their annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), bringing out upgraded computers, operating systems, and one new product, the HomePod. There's no new iPhone though. In its place? These 10 announcements that show us the refinements the US tech titan has in store for consumers in the near future. 1) MacBooks, iMacs refreshed Apple's popular laptop line gets a shot in the arm in the form of Intel's latest chips, Kaby Lake and support for twice the RAM. The MacBook, MacBook Pro, and the MacBook Air are now all available with the Kaby Lake chips. The 12-inch MacBook will also now be available with faster solid-state drives (SSD); the 13-inch Pro will now be offered in a Touch Bar-free version; and the 15-inch version will now carry discrete graphics as a standard feature. REFRESHED. Apple gives their laptops a boost this year. Screenshot from Apple The MacBook Air has also finally stepped onto 2017, shaking off some of the cobwebs it's collected since its 2015 upgrade. It's still the entry-level MacBook many have come to know but at least now it's available with a 1.8GHz Intel processor – a bump-up from its 1.6GHz days. Like the MacBook Air, the iMacs were due for an upgrade, having been last updated in 2015 as well. The new all-in-ones get the Kaby Lake treatment, along with a display that Apple calls "the best Mac display ever," and 2 Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, thus making them the first iMacs to use the port standard. The 21.5-inch model can carry up to 32GB of RAM while the 27-incher can carry up to 64GB. They will come with a variety of AMD Radeon Pro graphics cards to choose from with the entry-level 21.5-inch model carrying an Intel Iris Plus 640 GPU. US prices start at $1,299 for the MacBook and the Pro; $999 for the Air; $1,099 for the 21.5-inch iMac; and $1,799 for the 27-inch iMac. The iMacs are also now available in the US. 2) Indoor maps Apple Maps now features indoor mapping, a feature that maps out the inside of locations such as malls and airports. It's currently limited, however, to malls in select cities including Chicago, Hong Kong, New York, Boston, London, and Tokyo. Around thirty airports will be available in its launch window such as John F. Kennedy Airport and La Guardia in New York, and London Heathrow Airport. 3) "Do Not Disturb While Driving" iOS 11 feature You might have seen the navigation app Waze stop you from inputting a location while driving. Apple's taking the concept of anti-distracted driving functionalities to a new level as it blacks out your screen and block notifications when it detects that you're driving. It also sends automated responses to message senders, telling them that the user is currently driving. (READ: My favorite from WWDC 2017: an auto-reply feature while user drives) Users may set certain contacts as important so their messages bypass the blocking, and can also exit the mode should they want to. 4) The most powerful Apple computer ever? For the new iMac Pro, the specs speak for themselves: up to an 18-core Intel Xeon processor, a 27-inch 5K display, an AMD Radeon Vega GPU, up to 16GB of VRAM, up to 128 GB of ECC RAM (a type of RAM that detects and corrects some forms of data corruption), and up to 4TB of SSD storage. US prices start at $4,999 when it ships in December 2017. Apple called it their most powerful computer ever. 5) Apple gets serious with virtual reality, announces native support for HTC Vive and Steam VR Apple announced that their new graphics API, Metal 2, is VR-friendly and has been optimized to make programming virtual reality-based applications easier. With "Metal for VR" shipping with new macOS High Sierra, Apple and its computing devices now have official support for VR headset HTC Vive and the software behind the headset, SteamVR. VR development engines Unity and Unreal will now be natively supported as well. 6) Improvements to Camera and Photos apps Apple's new iOS 11 – now available to developers, while the public beta phase is expected later this year – introduces optical image stabilization for Portrait mode; "Loop" and "Bounce" effects similar to Instagram's video-looping Boomerang feature; and a "Long Exposure" feature for Live Photos that lets one animate a part of an image i.e. running water. One Intriguing tweak is iOS 11's new image file format, known as the High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) which claims to be able to encode images taken with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in a smaller file size. 7) Apple smart speaker HomePod to bank on high-quality audio Apple squeezes into the intensifying smart speaker wars with its HomePod. Its big sell: its supposedly amazing sound. It's equipped with a seven-speaker array of tweeters, an upward-facing subwoofer, and "spatial awareness" tech, which is supposed to optimize the sound depending on the space in which the speaker is placed in. (READ: Apple 'HomePod' speaker to take on Amazon, Google) Like Amazon Echo and Google Home, the Siri and Apple A8 chip-powered speaker will be able to answer voice queries, give reminders, and send iMessages. The speaker has a six-microphone array, which Apple claims is able to hear commands even from afar and amid high audio volume. 8) Siri gets a more natural voice In iOS 11, Apple says they've refined Siri's voice to be more natural, making the digital assistant more human-sounding through variances in intonation, pitch, emphasis and tempo. Apple's engineering head Craig Federighi illustrated this by saying how Siri will read out the weather forecast for a number of days. Instead of saying "sunny" in just one way, it will try to intonate each instance differently to replicate, more or less, how humans would speak. Apple says Siri's smarter now, able to translate English words and phrases into Chinese, French, German, Italian or Spanish on the fly, and makes use of machine learning to deliver personalized suggestions based on a person's usage of their device. 9) iPad Pro now has a 10.5-inch version The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is gone while the 12.9-inch version gets upgraded. Both 10.5- and 12.9-incher are equipped with a new A10X six-core CPU, which includes a 12-core GPU. They both support HDR video with a 120Hz refresh rate. The first generation iPad Pros' variable refresh rate reached a maximum of 60Hz. The higher refresh rate is crucial not just for displaying smooth motion but also for smoother Apple Pencil use. Apple's stylus, the Pencil, is also now the fastest digital pen in the world, with a response rate of 20 milliseconds (ms), beating out Microsoft Surface Pen's 21ms. The new Pro is also said to be 50% brighter than earlier models, and has a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 7-megapixel front camera. The 9.7-inch Pro, discontinued upon the announcement of the new models, also had a 12-megapixel rear shooter but only a 5-megapixel front camera. US prices start at $649 for the 10.5-incher and $799 for the 12.9-incher, and they will start shipping in the US next week. 10) WatchOS 4 arrives Along with MacOS High Sierra for the MacBooks and iMacs and iOS 11 for iPhones and iPads, Apple also unveiled its new OS for its wearables: WatchOS 4. It will have a new Siri watchface that uses machine learning to show you information it believes is most relevant to you, and for Disney fans, Toy Story watchfaces. WatchOS 4 also promises better integration with connected gym equipment such as near-field communication (NFC) linking and deeper integration. – Rappler.com Filed under:apple•apple keynote speech•high sierra•imac 2017•ios11•ipad pro 2017•macbook 2017•watchos 4•wwdc 2017 biggest announcements•wwdc announcements•wwdc 2017 HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Overall server market growth continues to slow down with most hyperscale service providers waiting until the second half of the year for deployment of Intel's new Skylake processors. High-end server sales continue to be a drag on overall market performance. The market has also been negatively affected by DRAM pricing issues. Worldwide server shipments increased 1.4% year over year to 2.21 million units in 1Q17. One customer accounted for more than 10% of the servers shipped in 1Q17. Volume server revenue declined by 3.4% to $9.5 billion, while midrange server revenue grew 16.5% to $1.3 billion. Demand for high-end systems experienced a year-over-year revenue decline of 29.0% to $1.0 billion. IDC expects continued long-term secular declines in high-end system revenue. "The server market continues to struggle to find growth," said Kuba Stolarski, research director, Computing Platforms at IDC. "As the market prepares for the switch to Intel's Skylake this year, we may be witnessing a shift in how workloads are deployed in the future, and what architectural choices will be made around modularity, operating environments, software, and cloud services. As indicated by this quarter's results, one large server customer appears to be betting on a major transition to cloud services, as it alone accounted for approximately a quarter of a million servers deployed in the first quarter." Overall Server Market Standings, by Vendor Group Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) retained the number 1 spot in the worldwide server market with 24.2% market share in 1Q17, as revenue decreased 15.8% year over year to $2.9 billion. HPE's share and year-over-year growth rate includes revenues from the H3C joint venture in China that began in May of 2016; as a result, the reported HPE/New H3C Group combines server revenue for both companies globally. Dell Inc maintained its number 2 position in the worldwide server market with 20.1% of vendor revenue for the quarter and 4.7% year-over-year growth to $2.4 billion. Cisco, IBM, and Lenovo were statistical tied* for the third market position. Cisco had 7.0% share, with revenue declining 3.0% year over year to $825 million. IBM had 6.3% share, with revenue declining 34.7% to $745 million. Lenovo had 6.2% share, with revenue declining 16.5% to $727 million. The ODM Direct group of vendors grew revenue by 41.8% to $1.2 billion. Dell Inc and HPE were statistically tied* for first place in overall unit share, with 21.0% and 20.8% of worldwide server shipments, respectively.

Demand for two-socket form factors continues to control a majority of unit shipments now and going forward as they are the sweet spot for density-optimized servers," said Lloyd Cohen, director of Worldwide Market Analysis, Computing Platforms at IDC. "Two-socket machines are attractive for datacenter deployment in terms of both power usage and cost per server. Their growth rate may slow down over the short term and, because they control a significant portion of the overall server market, the overall server market growth rate will be dampened worldwide." Top Server Market Findings On a geographic basis, Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) was the fastest growing region with 7.2% year-over-year growth, followed by Canada with 2.8%, and Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) with 0.9%. Within Asia/Pacific, China grew a modest 1.7%. the United States declined 2.3%, Japan declined 4.3%, Western Europe declined 14.3%, Latin America declined 14.6%, and Middle East and Africa declined 14.8%. Demand for x86 servers was flat (0.0%) in 1Q17 with $10.6 billion in revenues. Non-x86 servers declined 30.9% year over year to $1.3 billion. IDC's Server Taxonomy IDC's Server Taxonomy maps the eleven price bands within the server market into three price ranges: volume servers, midrange servers and high-end servers. The revenue data presented in this release is stated as vendor revenue for a server system. IDC presents data in vendor revenue to determine market share position. Vendor revenue represents those dollars recognized by multi-user system and server vendors for ISS (initial server shipment) and upgrade units sold through direct and indirect channels and includes the following embedded server components: Frame or cabinet and all cables, processors, memory, communications boards, operating system software, other bundled software and initial internal and external disk shipments. IDC's Quarterly Server Tracker is a quantitative tool for analyzing the global server market on a quarterly basis. The Tracker includes quarterly unit shipments and revenues (both vendor revenue and value of shipments), segmented by vendor, family, model, region, operating system, price band, CPU type, and architecture.

(AMD) Stock Should Be Takeover Bait Dana Blankenhorn InvestorPlace June 7, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has risen from the dead under CEO Lisa Su, but it remains a small fry within the semiconductor space. It’s supposed to compete directly against Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphics chips, but Nvidia is worth $85 billion in market capitalization, versus just $10.4 billion for AMD stock. It is supposed to be the most direct competitor to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in microprocessors, but Intel is worth nearly $170 billion. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Should Be Takeover BaitMore Source: Shutterstock AMD is outgunned no matter where it turns. It only has the financial capacity to place a few bets. And while the new chips it showed off at Computex in Taiwan were impressive, it left unanswered questions about follow-up. The last time I wrote about AMD stock, I called it “trader” bait. That’s because just as Advanced Micro can go from $2 to $13 on good news, it can also go back down from $13 to $10 on bad news. Those kinds of swings are a trader’s dream, and an investor’s nightmare. Now it’s time to talk about what kind of trader it is bait for. Someone Needs to Buy Advanced Micro Devices It is time for someone else to own AMD. 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $10 The much-hyped assault by Advanced Micro against Intel’s gaming chip castle was barely noticeable because AMD lacks the financial capacity to follow up. Its Radeon graphics technology might work well in clouds, and its Ryzen line might look good in game machines, but AMD lacks the cash to pursue the breakthrough. A buyer with imagination — and more important, a lot of cash — could. If Softbank Group Corp (OTCMKTS:SFTBF) could see $31 billion in value from ARM Holdings, allowing its microprocessor designs to be tweaked before manufacture and controlled by OEMs in distribution, how much is AMD worth? A Chinese buyer of AMD like Lenovo Group Ltd. (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) would gain intellectual property, and the engineers who created it, that could make a wholesale assault on Intel possible. A Korean buyer like Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) would get designs to fill its fabrication plants. An American buyer like Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) would get the ability to enter new markets. There are a lot of potential buyers out there. Moore’s Second Law What I have long called Moore’s Second Law — the fact that chip equipment costs rise exponentially with their complexity, even while complexity makes their processing cheaper — has forced the semiconductor industry to scale financially, beyond AMD’s capabilities. Only four companies now have the wherewithal to build their own chip plants, and even the “fab-less” chip companies, which only design their processors, require enormous amounts of capital to compete. NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) is getting bought by Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) in large part because its radio chips need Qualcomm’s financial scale to compete. That should also be true for microprocessors. AMD, while it can make headlines and sales, and deliver good designs to the market, lacks the financial muscle to make a profit. It made a little money in the June quarter of 2016, but it has only come close since, and that’s with the power of Ryzen and Radeon behind it. Let the Auction for AMD Stock Begin There are two ways this auction can start. Either AMD can let it be known that it is willing to talk about a buyout, or someone in private equity can take a sizable stake and start pounding the table for one. Should You Buy Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Word of an auction would deliver a good pop in the AMD stock price, even before a deal was done. This is especially true if some of the bidders are Chinese, with all the implications of losing intellectual property to China that entails. What investors should know is that this column is pure speculation. I have no evidence that AMD is for sale. Wait for news, or at least a reliable rumor from a big trading house, before you move. Wait for it, then pounce. Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

"He is very loyal to the President. He loves the law," Graham said on Fox News. "There is no way in hell that Jeff Sessions could preside over an investigation of a campaign that he was part of."  "If President Trump is listening tonight, Jeff Sessions had no alternative, Mr. President, as a lawyer. He had to get out of the way of the investigation because he was so close to your campaign. The American people would not tolerate somebody part of the campaign investigating the campaign. That was obvious to me." ADVERTISEMENT Graham's comments came amid reports that Sessions had offered recently to resign from the Justice Department after Trump became upset with him over his decision in March to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Tensions between the two men reportedly grew last month when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. While that announcement is said to have taken both Trump and Sessions by surprise, the president reportedly lashed out at the attorney general, blaming his recusal decision for Mueller's appointment. Sessions said in March that he would step away from the investigation after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose meetings with Russian Ambassadsor Sergey Kislyak while he was a high-profile campaign surrogate for Trump.   Tags Lindsey Graham Jeff Sessions   View the discussion thread.

At Computex, Gigabyte hosted an X299 OC gathering that brought together nearly half a dozen of the world’s top enthusiasts including the company’s own senior overclocker, HiCookie. Utilizing liquid helium at -250° Celsius, the team was able to push Intel’s Core i7-7740K CPU to 7,500MHz (multiplier of 75 and a bus speed of 100MHz) on a Gigabyte X299-SOC Champion motherboard. A 16GB kit of Corsair Vengeance LPX 4,333MHz memory was also used, as was a Corsair AX 1500i power supply. The same CPU (albeit clocked a little lower), board and PSU combo was also used with an AORUS GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Xtreme Edition 11G graphics card and G.Skill Trident-Z 3600C17 RAM to set new world records in 3DMark03, 3DMark06 and Aquamark benchmarks. With a second 1080 Ti, the group was also able to reach the global first place position in 3DMark06 with a score of 71,176. While this type of extreme overclocking is largely for bragging rights and doesn’t imply that you’ll achieve similar results, it’s interesting to see just how far modern silicon can be pushed in the hands of experts with non-practical cooling techniques. Overclocking at such a high level is an art form, really.

By Joe Osborne Apple   Breaking down which new iMac is right for you Shares At this year’s WWDC 2017, Apple made good on its promise that new iMac models would launch this year, but went even further with an iMac Pro, a device shrouded in rumor until now. With not one, but three different iMac models out there now, confusion is inevitable. While the “Pro” moniker might give away who that slick, space gray iMac is for, Apple tends to use that word liberally in distinguishing its various products. Case in point being the 12-inch MacBook and the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro. Plenty of regular consumers – including this editor once upon a time – bought MacBook Pro laptops for the stronger performance in a still thin-and-light package for not much more cash. So, let’s dispel the confusion surrounding whether, if you’re craving a new Apple all-in-one desktop for either work or play (or both), you should pick up a 2017 iMac this summer or wait it out for the iMac Pro this winter.  Price How much each version of the iMac will cost may be simple and powerful enough to steer your decision regardless of what each model is capable of. After all, the difference in their pricing is in the thousands. For starters, the 21.5-inch iMac for 2017 calls for $1,099 (£1,049, AU$1,599) to start, with options beyond that each increasing the price by 200 bucks in all currencies for additional processor clock speed as well as faster storage and discrete graphics down the line. The 27-inch version of the new iMac starts the conversation at a cool $1,799 (£1,749, AU$2,699), again with two additional options for stronger discrete graphics, more processor clock speed and more storage. However, while the jump between the starting model and the next is 200 bills in all currencies, the jump between that and the third option calls for 300 more. As for the 27-inch iMac Pro (the only available size), all we know so far is that it will start – yes, start – at $4,999 (about £3,870, AU$6,680). We’ll get into why that price discrepancy is key when discussing what’s included inside each new iMac model. But, before that, let’s discuss how they differ in look and feel. Design Frankly, the straight iMac and iMac Pro look awfully similar save for a key color choice: the iMac’s silver aluminum to the iMac Pro’s space gray aluminum. Naturally, the iMac Pro’s Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard come in the same, sweet space gray color that the all-in-one does, and Apple’s showing no signs of a straight iMac in the new color. For the sake of making their differences crystal clear, we’ll stack up the 27-inch iMac against the iMac Pro with the same dimensions. First off, both desktops look deceptively thin from their face, with their girth revealed when viewed from the side, a uniform bulge in each containing their various components. The 27-inch iMac measures 20.3 inches (51.6cm) tall and 25.6 inches (65.0cm) wide while weighing 20.8 pounds (9.44kg). The iMac Pro offers up identical dimensions, however weighs a smidge more at 21.5 pounds (9.7kg). As of this writing, we’re unsure why the iMac weighs nearly a pound more, but suspect it has something to do with the higher-core-count processors and advanced cooling system at play in that machine. Naturally, the 21.5-inch iMac is far smaller and lighter than either of these models, though still with a bulge in the back to house the various internals. As for connectivity, both straight iMac models offer four USB 3 ports, two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 3, an SDXC card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack and RJ-45 Gigabit Ethernet along with a Kengsinton lock slot. The iMac Pro, however, doubles the amount of Thunderbolt 3 ports and improves the Ethernet port to deliver up to 10Gbps connection. Hardware Now, here’s where the huge discrepancy in price begins to make sense. The 21.5-inch iMac starts with an FHD (1,920 x 1,080) display that can be upped to a 4K (4,096 x 2,304) panel rated for 500 nits of brightness and a P3 color gamut.  Inside, the device starts with a 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 (Kaby Lake) dual-core processor that can be upgraded to a quad-core i5 up to 3.4GHz or even an i7 clocked at 3.6GHz. Storage and memory start with a 1TB, 5,400 rpm spinning drive and 8GB of 2,133MHz RAM, respectively, and can jump to up to 32GB of 2,400MHz RAM and a 1TB Fusion Drive or an SSD as capacious as 1TB worth of space. Graphics on the 21.5-inch iMac start with Intel’s integrated Iris Plus 640 and can be configured with up to an AMD Radeon Pro 560 graphics chip with 4GB of video memory. The 27-inch iMac, meanwhile, comes out of the gate rocking a 5K (5,120 x 2,880) display rated for the same brightness and color gamut as the 4K panel found on the 21.5-inch version. This iMac forgoes dual-core CPUs entirely with a 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 to start, with options for Core i5 clocked at as fast as 3.8GHz or an Intel Core i7 at 4.2GHz. As for storage and memory, the 27-inch iMac starts with a 1TB Fusion Drive and 8GB of 2,400MHz memory, respectively. The ceiling for both of those parts is up to a 3TB Fusion Drive or a 2TB SSD and as much as 64GB of RAM. Graphics start with an AMD Radeon Pro 570 with 4GB of video RAM and max out at a Radeon Pro 580 with twice as much video memory. Finally, the iMac Pro comes housing the same display as the straight, 27-inch iMac and ditches the Fusion Drives altogether for 1TB to 4TB worth of SSD storage. The system starts with 32GB of 2,666MHz RAM with support for up to 128GB of the stuff. The silicon inside the machine is where things get interesting, with the iMac Pro housing anywhere from a 10-core to as much as an 18-core Intel Xeon processor coupled with either AMD’s Radeon Pro Vega 56 graphics chip with 8GB of video RAM or the Radeon Pro 64 with double the video memory. Which should you buy? Despite Apple’s use of Radeon Pro graphics within the new, silver iMacs, they’re still the Apple all-in-one that you want if it’s purpose is to be your (or your family’s) personal PC. That said, anything beyond the entry-level versions of each model would likely be overkill for the average computer user. Professionals that simply can’t wait until December would be best suited with one of the upgraded iMac models that offer 4K or 5K visuals and those Radeon Pro graphics. The iMac Pro, however, is intended for even a different class of professional. If you’re working in, say, 3D animation, then the iMac Pro is your bag (and hopefully your company is footing the bill). If you’re crazy enough to drop five grand on a desktop like this for the house, you better become an amateur animator, and fast – otherwise you’ll have wasted about $5,000. This time, the Pro version of the iMac is unequivocally for professionals, while the silver iMacs straddle the line between the two use cases. So, home iMac buyers: steer clear of the iMac Pro, and choose your silver iMac wisely based on your needs.

BUSINESS Gear Thursday: Apple iMac 5K Retina 2017 first look 8 Jun, 2017 9:02am 5 minutes to read × Apple's iMac 5K Retina desktop computer.

In mobile, the competition is fierce and new iPhones appear annually as result. The iPad range is also refreshed every year, with parts from the current iPhones. Laptops and desktop computers are a different story for Apple, which has copped flak for not offering the industry norm annual updates for its MacBooks, iMacs and Pro machines. To some degree this is due to Intel-based computers becoming powerful enough to cope with most software out there a few years back: even if your box is two to four years old, it'll work just fine in the vast majority of cases nowadays. However, there's a noisy market segment for Apple, the people who use computers for demanding tasks, and who can never have enough power. They're high value customers for Apple and its third-party ecosystem, as they buy not just computers but gear and software to cover their workflows - or gaming setups. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. That crowd has felt neglected the past few years, and cast side-eyes towards the Windows PC camp where computers have been updated with the latest processors and more importantly, heaps of memory, fast disks and powerful graphics cards. This year Apple obviously felt the heat from pro users and updated its entire range of laptops and desktops with higher performing components. I had the chance to dig into one of the new systems, a 27-inch iMac Retina 5K. This was equipped with a quad-core 3.4 gigaHertz intel "Kaby Lake" 7th-gen Core i5 7500 processor, 8GB of 2.4GHz DDR-4 system memory, and a 1 terabyte hybrid solid-state/electromagnetic hard drive. The box and the iMac design haven't changed for the past few years. In a sense that's good as everything's familiar to iMac upgraders, with only the addition of the USB-C port at the back being new. I'll leave it to you to decide, and the current iMac design is very nice, classic and functional, but I think Apple should've done something to enhance the looks of the computer, as it does with iPhones. Apple has changed the bundled small keyboard for the iMac though, which is now more compact and flat - I'd drop another $60 for the full-size Magic keyboard with a numeric keypad to go with the iMac. A Magic Mouse 2 is included, and you get a Magic TrackPad 2 for $90; buying both with the iMac costs $219.

That's the low-end 27-inch iMac, and it costs $2999 including GST. Comparing Windows apples with Apple pears is difficult as the value to users lies in the combination of software and device integration, and not just the hardware itself. However, the iMac comes with what's an expensive option for PCs: the great 5K Retina monitor built-in. This has 10-bit colour for the first time, a feature that was found on very pricey professional monitors only not so long ago. If you do photo and video work, 10-bit colour is great as it provides more natural gradations between hues.

Pro users would want to upgrade the system memory to at least 16GB which costs $340; going to the maximum 32GB sets you back $680, and adding a fast newly developed solid 512GB state drive is $510. The base system is decent value, but specking up the iMac Retina 5K 27-inch gets costly fast. I had time to run a few benchmarks on the iMac; first, Geekbench 4.0 reported that the Core i5 processor in the iMac scored 4845 in the single-core test, and 14098 in the multi-core one. This makes it faster than the quickest older 27-inch iMac with Intel Core i7 inside, by a decent margin. Maxon's Cinebench R15 graphics test is a bit old by now, but the 27-inch iMac with the upgraded AMD graphics card hit 105.8 frames per second in OpenGL which is quick, and an impressive 592 in the CPU test. To see how what the Radeon Pro 570 could handle, I set the iMac display to the highest possible 3200 by 1800 pixel (you can go higher with a third party utility) and the Unigine Valley benchmark to Ultra high quality and 8 times anti-aliasing. That was too much for the graphics card, which struggled to maintain over 15 frames per second. Dropping default to the default resolution made Unigine Valley run smoothly though. The new 1TB Fusion drive in the 27-inch iMac is snappy, hitting just below 1400 megabyte per second reads and 900MBps writes which is very good. For editing 4K video you'd probably want an SSD though, an expensive option as per above. It's a good thing that Apple has remembered its desktop audience and bumped up the performance on the iMacs substantially compared to the previous machines. The 27-inch 5K Retina iMac performs well, even at standard spec - and it does it quietly too, suggesting the new Intel chips rub cool. Next time though, don't wait so long between hardware refreshes, Apple.

The committee asked Comey to testify pursuant to its investigation of Russian election tampering and possible Trump campaign collusion. Related Ex-FBI Chief James Comey: Donald Trump Demanded In its statement, Kasowitz said: “The President is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the President was not under investigation in any Russian probe. The president feels completely and totally vindicated. He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda.” Trump was celebrating Infrastructure Week in Cincinnati on Wednesday when the FBI chief Trump sacked last month released his prepared remarks and TV news outlets began broadcasting the headlines to the world. After announcing he plans to spend $1 trillion to overhaul the country’s roads and bridges, boasting about pulling out of the “so-called Paris accord” and meeting with “Obamacare victims,” Trump boarded his plane to head back to Washington. During the flight, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump was reviewing the testimony, but she remarked eyebrow-raisingly about Comey’s timing. This is pretty rich, coming from a rep of the guy who this morning tried to upstage Comey’s testimony, and that of senior intel execs before the committee today, when he unveiled his pick to replace Comey in an early-morning tweet. Trump’s tweet and pick reportedly blindsided his own White House communications staff and senior staffers. During the period in which the White House scrambled to craft a response, Trump allies stepped in to fill the void: Trying to find something of substance in Comey’s opening statement like pic.twitter.com/igLC4JPREg — GOP (@GOP) June 7, 2017 Comey released the text of what will be his opening statement to the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. It’s a real page turner, and you can read it in its entirety here. Among revelations, Comey will say Trump called to invite him to dinner. Trump in May told NBC’s Lester Holt that Comey asked him for the dinner because Comey wanted to keep his job. In his remarks, Comey will say Trump began that dinner by asking him whether he wanted to stay on as FBI director. Comey will say the one-on-one setting and pretense that this was their first discussion about his post meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have him ask for his job and create some sort of patronage relationship, which Comey found concerning. During the dinner, Trump told him “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” “I didn’t move, speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence,” Comey will say in his opening remarks. Comey also will talk about a March 30 phone call in which Trump called him at the FBI and described the Russia investigation as “‘a cloud’ that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. According to Comey, Trump said on that call he had nothing to do with Russia, had “not been involved with hookers in Russia” and asked what could be done to “lift the cloud.” Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 21 21 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

And, although I do not think there are grounds for impeachment, the Russia issue is a distant second to Trump/Comey and Trump/NSA, DOJ, etc. Maybe it is not obstruction of justice in a strictly legal sense, but it sure as hell stinks on both sides of the aisle…and throughout America and the world. Reply Jim • on Jun 7, 2017 2:41 pm I hate how all these politicians and political groups think they’re comedians on twitter. I read the testimony and I think the president telling the FBI director on two occasions to stop the Flynn investigation is extremely suspicious. However, nothing Comey says tomorrow is going to lead to Trump leaving office. I’m hoping at the very least that it will be a domino effect and something he says can be backed up later by the Mueller investigation.

Trump’s own arrogance and hubris is going to lead to his downfall. He has absolutely no discipline and simply can’t shut up long enough to realize he’s burying himself. He will continue to self sabotage and end up like the Jack Nicholson character from “A Few Good Men” (just to give this a relevant Hollywood reference…).

Reply • on Jun 7, 2017 6:48 pm All the Verified Media Political Liberals on Twitter think this proves “obstruction of justice” but there is no way to make that stick in any court proceeding. The Dems will move to impeach Trump in January 2019 if they win control of the House but they can only get rid of him if they also control the Senate or if enough Republican Senators want to get rid of him. 18 months from now is a very long time. I can see the Dems winning the House and impeaching him only to have him survive the Senate Hearing the same way Clinton survived in 1998. If that happens his re-election will be assured he will win in 2020 by a healthy margin. Reply • on Jun 7, 2017 8:05 pm Yes, except Trump will resign well before 2019, because he will continue to get nothing done and these low poll numbers will only continue to drop as scandal after scandal dominates the news. He hates to lose and will look for an opportune time to step away, probably citing the need to “spend time with his family” and to return to oversee his businesses.

I will guarantee you that you’re living by, working with, and personally know people who voted for Donal Trump. I work in “Hollywood”, and I know that a ton of people at the studio voted for him, secretly. You see, some folks understand the violence behind Soro’s and his ilk. So, in the voting booth – the truth emerges. Millions voted for him in CA. I’m a native Californian, I’m a 7th generation Latina, I’m a lesbian, I’m a mother, and I’m ‘gay married’. And guess what, I voted for him. Why? Because I care about the world that our children are growing up in. That’s why. So Anton, shove that “dumb” comment where the sun don’t shine!

There are reports are that no law firm will take him as a client over Russiagate because they don’t believe he will take their advice and they don’t believe he will pay them. He lied about the weather and attendance at his inauguration. Who does that?

By Gordon Mah Ung Executive Editor, PCWorld | Jun 7, 2017 12:58 PM PT Credit: IDG/Gordon Mah Ung More like this Ryzen CPUs explained: Everything you need to know about AMD's disruptive... Ryzen rumors: Perception vs. reality with AMD's new CPU AMD teases Ryzen 5, Zen 2 plans as it begins shipping its first Ryzen 7 chips Video How a motherboard is made Sorry, Internet: AMD didn't officially "slash," "cut," or even nick prices of its Ryzen CPUs in anticipation of the company's Threadripper CPU, the company said. AMD sought to squash several news stories that have circulated over the last few days, saying AMD trimmed prices of its Ryzen chips. The company denied there were any across-the-board price cuts. "We have noted some speculative articles appearing commenting on AMD's pricing following Computex and would like to reiterate that Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 pricing remains unchanged," the company told PCWorld. Some stories cited the launch of the company's Threadripper as a reason for the supposed cuts. However, Threadripper is expected to be far more expensive than the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5, so there'd be no reason for AMD to make cuts in anticipation of that chip. AMD didn't have an explanation for the price cuts but suggested it could be an individual store's sale. "Any promotional deals or special pricing on Ryzen processors is partner/retailer driven within their business," an AMD official told PCWorld. A similar non-story occurred with Intel's CPUs, too. Shortly after AMD's Ryzen lineup hit the streets in March, several news outlets said Intel had begun "slashing" prices in reaction. Many of the stories, however, cited small price reductions at a retailer known for using CPUs as loss leaders. At that time, Intel officials told PCWorld there had been no price cuts announced and described any stories saying that as "inaccurate." The story behind the story: AMD and Intel are jockeying for consumers' hard-earned cash while trying also to impress investors, so perception can be as important as reality. AMD likely doesn't want the false news stories to create a perception that it's coming from a position of weakness.

(AWS), an Amazon.com company AMZN, -0.01% announced that AWS Greengrass, software which allows customers to run AWS compute, messaging, data caching, and sync capabilities on connected devices, is now available to all customers. With AWS Greengrass, devices can run AWS Lambda functions to perform tasks locally, keep device data in sync, and communicate with other devices while leveraging the full processing, analytics, and storage power of the AWS Cloud. More than a dozen AWS partners, including Annapurna, BSquare, Canonical, Digi International, Intel, Lenovo, Mongoose, Qualcomm Technologies, Raspberry Pi, Samsung, Technicolor and Wistron are integrating AWS Greengrass into their platforms so devices will come with AWS Greengrass built-in. To get started with AWS Greengrass, visit https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/. With the proliferation of IoT devices, enterprises are increasingly managing infrastructure that is not located in a data center, such as connected devices in factories, oil wells, agricultural fields, hospitals, cars, and various other venues. Because these devices often have limited processing power and memory, many rely heavily on AWS and the cloud for processing, analytics, and storage. However, there are circumstances when relying exclusively on the cloud isn’t optimal due to latency requirements or intermittent connectivity that make a round trip to the cloud unfeasible. In these situations, IoT devices must be able to perform some tasks locally. Programming and updating software functionality on IoT devices is challenging and complex. Relatively few developers have the expertise to update these embedded systems, and even fewer can do so without creating unwanted downtime. AWS Greengrass eliminates the complexity involved in programming and updating IoT devices by allowing customers to use AWS Lambda to run code locally on connected devices in the same way they do on the AWS Cloud. With AWS Greengrass, developers can add AWS Lambda functions to connected devices right from the AWS Management Console, and devices can execute the code locally, responding to events and taking actions in near real-time. AWS Greengrass also includes AWS IoT messaging and synching capabilities so devices can send messages to other devices without connecting back to the cloud. AWS Greengrass allows customers the flexibility to have devices rely on the cloud when it makes sense, perform tasks on their own when it makes sense, and talk to each other when it makes sense – all in a single, seamless environment. “Many of the world’s largest IoT implementations run on AWS, and customers across industries – from energy, to mining, to media and entertainment – have asked us whether we could extend AWS’s industry leading cloud capabilities to the edge,” said Dirk Didascalou, Vice President of IoT at AWS. “By embedding AWS Lambda and AWS IoT capabilities in connected devices, AWS Greengrass gives customers the flexibility to have devices act locally on the data they generate while using the AWS Cloud for management, analytics, and storage – all using a single, familiar AWS programming model. We are excited to make AWS Greengrass available to all AWS customers, and with AWS partners shipping AWS Greengrass-capable devices it is now incredibly easy to build and run IoT applications that seamlessly span devices on the edge and in the AWS Cloud.” The multinational power company Enel is the largest utility in Europe in terms of market capitalization and has the largest customer base among its European peers with over 65 million customers worldwide. "Connected devices improve all aspects of our daily lives, from the smart meters in our homes that help us save energy, to the black boxes in our cars that show us how we’re driving, to the stoplights with sensors that monitor traffic,” said Fabio Veronese, Head of Infrastructure and Technological Services at Enel. "Enel is building AWS Greengrass-enabled smart gateways for the home and industrial gateways for our power generation sites, where AWS Greengrass will allow us to process and act on large volumes of data with sub-millisecond latency." Finland-based Konecranes is a world-leading group of Lifting Businesses, serving a broad range of customers, including manufacturing and process industries, shipyards, ports, and terminals. “Konecranes is leading the way in industrial internet of things with over 15,000 connected cranes and thousands more on the way this year,” said Juha Pankakoski, Executive Vice President of Technologies at Konecranes. “We have already been using AWS IoT to build Truconnect, a digital crane platform, and the addition of AWS Greengrass will help us take the development to the edge. We see AWS Greengrass as the enabler for a new set of digital services, allowing us to program and deliver software to equipment in a secure manner and without risking operational safety. This supports well our aim to build the next generation of lifting as the leading technology company in our industry.” Pentair plc is a global company dedicated to building a safer, more sustainable world through industry- leading products, services, and solutions that help people make the best use of the resources they rely on most. "Some of Pentair’s aquaculture customers are located in remote geographies with unreliable internet connections, and industry regulations restrict which data points can leave their physical premises," said Phil Rolchigo, Vice President of Technology at Pentair. "AWS Greengrass will enable our devices to behave consistently no matter the level of connectivity in their operating environment, while allowing us to take advantage of the AWS Cloud for machine learning and big data analytics." Rio Tinto is a leading global mining group that focuses on finding, mining, and processing the Earth's mineral resources. "Rio Tinto operates mining equipment in some of the most extreme environments on earth, where connectivity can be unreliable and road conditions can cause production delays, equipment damage, and potentially put people at risk," said Brian Oldham, Vice President of Industrial and Operational Technology at Rio Tinto. “AWS Greengrass allows us to measure road roughness and process the data locally to make our haul trucks operate more safely and efficiently, regardless of network coverage. We saw results from equipment in the field only two weeks after deploying the service, and the potential value it can bring to our operations. We’re evaluating additional use cases for AWS Greengrass in other areas.” Stanley Black & Decker’s Digital Accelerator is the company’s innovation arm in charge of infusing digital capabilities across all products, process, and business models. "Stanley Black & Decker’s Digital Accelerator has selected AWS Greengrass as one of the standards for edge computing and edge analytics across our entire portfolio of products,” said Yasir Qureshi, Director, IoT Platform and Digital Architecture at Stanley Black & Decker. “AWS Greengrass improves the efficiency of our tools by eliminating the latency of transmitting the data to the cloud and instead processing breaking and maintenance data locally for improved jobsite productivity. Additionally, the single programming model between the AWS Cloud and local devices enables us to significantly shorten our development lifecycle and make our equipment smarter and faster." Ecosystem support for AWS Greengrass Canonical produces Ubuntu and offers commercial services for Ubuntu's users. “AWS Greengrass will enable more customers and developers to realize the benefit of processing and analyzing data at the edge,” said Mike Bell, Executive Vice President, IoT and Devices at Canonical. “By distributing and installing AWS Greengrass as a snap, the universal Linux packaging format, developers can reduce the time and complexity of building smart edge solutions across new and existing hardware. Using snaps, manufacturers will not only find it easier to build IoT devices, but to monetize smart developer solutions running on the AWS IoT platform.” Intel, the world leader in silicon innovation, develops technologies, products and initiatives to continually advance how people work and live. "Many IoT use cases demand a distributed computing architecture at the edge, close to where the data is generated,” said Jonathan Ballon, Vice President, Internet of Things Group at Intel. “AWS Greengrass running on Intel technology delivers a secure, intelligent edge that allows developers to easily create new applications from edge to cloud." The Raspberry Pi Foundation provides low-cost, high-performance computers that people use to learn, solve problems, and have fun. "Raspberry Pi is part of a movement of organizations and individuals that share a common goal: Empowering people to shape their world through digital technologies," said David Thompson, Director of Web Services at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. "AWS Greengrass extends the capabilities of the AWS Cloud to the Raspberry Pi, making it easier than ever for anyone to build the next great connected product." Qualcomm Technologies pioneered 3G and 4G – and is now leading the way to 5G and a new era of intelligent, connected devices, including automotive, computing, IoT, healthcare, and data center. "The next generation of IoT devices and gateways depends on high-performance edge capabilities tightly integrated with the cloud," said Jeffery Torrance, Vice President of Business Development at Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. "Developers and manufacturers can use AWS Greengrass to take greater advantage of the connectivity, compute, and security capabilities delivered by Qualcomm Technologies' system-on-chip platforms to build edge solutions that tap into the power of AWS IoT. Thanks to our strong work with AWS, prototyping and developing on Qualcomm Technologies' platforms using AWS Greengrass can start today."

Related White House Questions James Comey's Timing In Early Release Of Hearing Remarks Among revelations, Comey will say Trump called to invite him to their first dinner. Trump in May told NBC’s Lester Holt that Comey asked him for the dinner because Comey wanted to keep his job. In his remarks, Comey will say Trump began the dinner by asking him whether he wanted to stay on as FBI director. Comey will say the one-on-one setting and pretense that this was their first discussion about his post meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have him ask for his job and create some sort of patronage relationship, which Comey found concerning. During the dinner, Trump told him “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” “I didn’t move, speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence.” When Trump reiterated his expecting-loyalty remark later, Comey will say, “I replied, ‘You will always get honesty from me’,” to which Trump responded, “That’s what I want, honest loyalty.” “I paused and then said, ‘You will get that from me.’” In his opening remarks, Comey will say it is possible the two men understood that phrase differently but he “decided it wouldn’t be productive to push it further” because it “helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect.” Comey says in his remarks that, as was his practice for conversations with Trump, he wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately after and shared it with senior leadership at FBI. Comey also will talk about a March 30 phone call in which Trump called him at the FBI: He described the Russia investigation as “a cloud” that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to “lift the cloud.” I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him.”   Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 22 22 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Reply Comedy of Errors • on Jun 7, 2017 12:53 pm I was watching the season finale of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” and when the witness Jake brought in to save himself suddenly turned out to be on the criminal’s side and screwed him with a surprise testimony, I thought of Comey. I thought what if Comey comes out and delivers a testimony that basically exonerates Trump? If Trump fired Comey to make him the perfect corroborating witness, and convinced Comey somehow that he would be rewarded later for losing his job. I thought what would happen if Comey comes out and says, “Yes, he asked for loyalty, but we might have different interpretations of what that means and he may have been asking me for honesty.” Or if he came out and says, “Trump confided in me, and admitted that he did not have the ties to Russia that some thought he might have, including not frequenting Russian hookers.” Every liberal (and many conservatives) were waiting for Comey like he was some kind of smoking gun. Instead, he basically just told the world that Trump swore privately that he didn’t have ties to Russia and that Trump more or less requested honesty from the head of the FBI, but chose his words poorly when doing so. What. A. Farce. Reply X • on Jun 7, 2017 1:07 pm And then Trump fired Comey because he wouldn’t drop the Russia investigation. But that’s some nice fan fiction you got going there. Reply J • on Jun 7, 2017 1:08 pm You speak as if Trump has any shred of credibility left. His words in private mean squat. And all you have to do is look at the president, his actions, and his words.

Reply Bad_Ashe • on Jun 7, 2017 1:19 pm Wow. What a giant nothing sandwich. Some of the optics are unfavorable to the current administration, but this is a whole lot of vapor. Basically, Trump is personally innocent of collusion, knows it, and was ticked off that Comey wouldn’t come out and say it publicly. Trump fired him out of spite. Childish? Maybe…but it isn’t illegal or obstructionist, and it certainly isn’t the executive branch calling on the FBI to end an investigation. Reply milo • on Jun 7, 2017 1:38 pm The problem for Trump at this point isn’t that he’s guilty of collusion, it’s that his employees may or may not be, and it looks like he may have tried to cover it up. So potentially obstruction of justice. And that’s assuming he’s not guilty of collusion, all the facts aren’t out yet.

If you don’t understand that basic fact, then you should probably refrain from commenting. Reply • on Jun 7, 2017 4:19 pm Comey isn’t an employee of Trump. Comey’s loyalty, as the head of the FBI, was to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. That’s why we have three different branches of government, so no one person, in this case Trump, is above the law.

Here's what the new MacBook and MacBook Pro have to offer.  ( Apple ) Apple made a number of exciting announcements at WWDC 2017 and, as expected, the MacBook got some neat upgrades to spice things up. The 12-inch MacBook received a considerable spec bump, getting the latest Intel Kaby Lake (seventh generation) processors and a notable boost in performance, speed and battery life. The solid-state drive storage should translate to an up to 50 percent increase in performance. Apple MacBook Update Apple has also boosted the amount of RAM, now maxing out at 16 GB instead of the previous 8 GB. "With thin and light designs, powerful performance, amazing displays and all-day battery life, Mac notebooks deliver the world's best portable computing experience," Apple touts. "MacBook is our thinnest and lightest notebook for all-day, on-the-go computing." The company also says the keyboard of the new MacBook also received an upgrade to be more like the MacBook Pro, which means it should be more responsive. Otherwise, not much has changed. Apple is still pitching the 12-inch MacBook as a sleek and slim notebook with a Retina display, decent specs, and high portability, but it won't blow you out of the water. The meager webcam received no upgrades, which means it still offers only a 480p resolution. The new MacBook starts at $1,299 for the entry-level model with Core m3 and 256 GB of storage, and goes up to $1,949 for higher-end specs. Some might still find the MacBook a tad expensive for what it has to offer, especially considering that comparable Windows notebooks with similar specs are more affordable, but Apple has always had a loyal fan base. Those looking for a more powerful device with some extra oomph, however, should consider the beefier MacBook Pro, which also got neat upgrades. Apple MacBook Pro 2017 Update The refreshed 13-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, packs Intel Kaby Lake processors up to Core i7 3.5 GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.0 GHz, and the 15-inch model packs up to Core i7 3.1 GHz with up to 4.1 GHz with Turbo Boost. Apple also packed beefier discrete graphics with extra video memory for the 15-inch MacBook Pro, while the 13-inch model got a new $1,299 configuration in the United States. Otherwise, the MacBook Pro still sports the intriguing Touch Bar with Touch ID, a bright 500-nit Retina display, powerful performance, Thunderbolt 3, and more. Lastly, Apple also announced a slight upgrade for the 13-inch MacBook Air, which now features a 1.8 GHz processor. It's a truly minor change, however, moving up from 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz, but it's still a fifth-generation Intel processor (Broadwell) and not the newer seventh generation (Kaby Lake). That said, the change should translate to a slight speed bump, but that's about it. The new Apple MacBook refreshed models are already available through the company's store, with retail availability slated for June 7. Does any of these new MacBook models seem attractive enough to warrant a purchase, or are the upgrades not good enough? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

Unfortunately, it's not macOS vs. Windows vs. Linux Radeon performance figures due to lack of hardware, but this afternoon our focus shifts to the Intel graphics stack. Of the limited Apple hardware I have available, today's tests were done from an Intel Haswell Core i5 Mac Mini with i5-4278U CPU featuring Iris Graphics 5100, 8GB DDR3 memory, and 1TB HDD. The Mac Mini was running the up-to-date macOS 10.12.5 with Xcode 8.3.3. Ubuntu 17.04 was tested in its stock configuration (Linux 4.10 + Mesa 17.0.3) as well as with the Linux 4.12 Git kernel and Mesa 17.2-dev for the very latest open-source driver code. Lastly, Intel's Clear Linux was tested with Linux 4.11 and Mesa 17.2-dev as its stock configuration for this rolling-release platform. Each of the operating systems were cleanly installed and left at their default settings unless otherwise noted.

Mark Warner (D-VA) listens during a committee hearing titled "Disinformation: A Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence Campaigns" at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., March 30, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque - RTX33E3Y    Top Intel Dem: Wray Hiring An Attempt To Distract From Comey Testimony Henry Rodgers Political Reporter 1:52 PM 06/07/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner said Wednesday that the timing of President Donald Trump’s FBI director appointee is an attempt to “distract attention” from the Senate Intelligence Committee’s hearings on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump announced Wednesday morning on Twitter that he would be nominating Christopher Wray to be the new FBI Director. Former President George W. Bush previously appointed Wray as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division from 2003 to 2005, according to the Department of Justice. I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 7, 2017 “I don’t know Christopher Wray, I hear he’s a got a good reputation,” Warner told CBS. “Clearly this is an effort by the president to try to distract attention from our hearings today and our hearings tomorrow.” WATCH: Warner is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He said that Trump’s reported attempt to get former FBI director James Comey to drop his investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was alarming, but not the only problem. “We also have reports that he also asked the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and the head of the [National Security Agency] Admiral Rogers to also back off or try to downplay the FBI investigation into Mr. Trump and his affiliates,” Warner said. Rogers, Coats, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and current FBI Director Andrew McCabe are testifying before the Senate Intelligence panel Wednesday. Comey is scheduled to testify Thursday.

From Virginia senator Mark Warner who actually. After. The public hearing and if he came out. Microphones and spoke little about his observation so far with those intelligence chiefs are harboring and ABC's Alley broken Al you were there for that and you cover. Us senator Warner every single day. What did he have to say he seemed a little agitated. I would think very agitated Josh he was talking about how he was surprised and frustrated with the fact that the intelligence community officials who spoke today were unable to you. Characterized the conversations they've had with president trump. In this. Open session on TV in front of cameras. Because they said they believed it would be inappropriate interestingly and something that Warner and many of the other senators on the intelligence committee commented upon is that. There's nothing and those conversations necessarily what have been classified. And in fact Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates said. He doesn't think he has a legal basis for refusing. To go into DTL about the nature of those conversations whether president trop. Talk to any of the members of the intelligence committee about backing off of the Michael fling investigation. So. Warner just now in writing activists over there was expressing his frustration that they didn't really get any of these answers that he believes in many of the other senators believe. Should it be disclosed in front of the American public as you mentioned they're going to be going into closed session sits to be fascinating to see whether week. As the media had members of the public learn anymore. About what exactly was discussed between president tribe and the. Heads of the intelligence community. We must have heard the phrase I do not think it's appropriate. Dozens of times in relation to. Whether it's appropriate or not talk about conversation you have with the president of the united states of course Dan Coats appointed by president trump and that was something that Warner. Highlighted numerous times in that came up it Coates is hearing whether he would. Be able to holds. If someone higher than him. It accountable and with the question of is anybody. Above the law that was something I suspect thought there was interest in that Rosen Stein and on the cape we're talked about talked about at the end saying that. You know nobody's above the law. But then again we didn't really get any answers. At as to what those conversations were about. Whether these gentlemen were approach at all by the president to change. That there are their position to and the investigation involved in the investigation. And so that kind of explains why senator Warren from Warner felt the way he did. Yet and in terms of the nobody is above the line aspect. One of the of the things that the members mentioned in senator Warner talked about just now. Is the fact that some of the it. Deputy attorney general resins I was talking about he didn't want to. Get into it DTL about these conversations because he didn't want to encroach on the territory of special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation. Russian interference in the election. And both chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina the chairman of the Intel committee and senator Warner the ranking member about said. We haven't had conversations with Mueller about anything that's off limits for you guys to talk about in this hearings that they were basically citing. Reasons that. The senators are saying. Today knowledge did not really exist for. Kind of being mum on the Josh it was so interesting that the diet panelists today were very willing to say they have never felt pressured. By any member of the administration to back off or otherwise. Change all the direction of the nature of any of these investigations. But then once the question got too well what exactly did trump. Say eight. You may have not felt pressure. But that doesn't mean he didn't try to pressure. And they walked very much up to that line but did not go over it. So again a lot of unanswered questions senator Warner at the end of the hearing said I have a lot more questions leading this hearing as I did then I did when I. Locked and I think a lot of members of the media and the public art. Something I'm all always struck by winning here especially peace here in sisters. Really how divided these Republicans and Democrats are mean you have. If recent Republicans and are sticking to what it's accurate was about. Talking about fights grilling and on past statements and then you have the Democrats talking about. Former FBI director James cone talking about the rusher broke talking about what president trump did or did not do and most of all talking about. Reports in the press in that really seems to be likes some something it. These Republican senators really don't care for in the they didn't really want to comment on something that was in the Washington Post are different investigations. If different reports like that. It some point they will have to talk about this though correct. They will probably talk about it in closed session and the question becomes how much do you. The chairman of the the of this committee how much they disclosed to the public after words. In the past. Burton Warner have been very. Forthcoming in terms of what. They can and what they feel comfortable saying that they've learned in closed session and bringing it to the public so. Today don't necessarily comment on the details of what's been discussing these closed sessions but they will kind of walk up to that line maybe. Comment on what's been reported in in public and and use that as he waits to get into. What they can say based on what's already been. Out there in publications like the Washington Post. With ABC's reporting as well. But one thing's it was interesting on that point Josh was at the end. John McCain who is actually a former member of this and Intel committee but he was there asking questions today. He brought up the Washington Post report. And yes died. President tried pressured him or asked him to back up the play investigation. But what I'm constant state it really perked my ears up was he said. I'm not going to comment I'm conversations that I. Thought were private. And that is saint directing now management that some conversations did take place exactly so. They're a little bit of that kind of dancing around what they can say and what they couldn't say that was going on. And so I think what we're going to be doing today in the days to come this kind of person a lot of that Stevenson were dismayed at that hearing. Obviously again tomorrow you have. To four herb. It director. Connie coming out and you know he's not a public officially mark so will he feel less. Are tales and less. I'm. You know it will will he be a little more willing to disclose his conversations because he is not a member of the government work perhaps. Those intelligence chiefs really seem to respect the office that they serve. The conversation they've had with president trump or in private. We're not gonna come out and and talk about them in public with cameras on us maybe they'll do that in closed session. We'll hopefully find out more about that but let's talk a little bit about tomorrow because. That's going to be happening right here in the hearts and senate building this area will look very different than it does napkins will bit of a preview. Because it seems that even today that everyone's talking about. Well right this was supposed to be kind of the run up to it but I think I Philly we're already kind of in it. These next 48 hours it is going to be all wall to wall discussion about Jane's company and what exactly has conversations with president trump brought about. In terms of what we're gonna see here tomorrow right. You know you see a lot of gray on the lower right now I think this is going to be all filled week. At sea of humanity lots of media out here I was not it reporter during the Monica Lewinsky. Reporting but from what I understand. It's going resembled that level in stressed. This is the first time hearing publicly and possibly last time in a session like this from. The guy at the center of this entire firestorm so. The a man of interest is going to be huge the questions are going to be interacts and rapid fire. You wouldn't mention it economy has been. For appearing for this hearing for a long time. That this will be the first time that we hear or see him publicly. Yes decides on his porch besides on his porch and coming in and out of his house. One of the big things that everybody is going to be looking for and talking about is the existence and what is in these memos. That James commie reportedly wrote after every meeting he had with president tramp. So far this Intel committee has not gotten access to those memos but they have said that that might be something they want to do so. They're certainly going to be just add. Very intense level of interest in his memos what exactly they say. What you know it's gonna it's gonna bring us into the moment. Where Communist having these conversations with tramp to meet actually fascinating. And also what president trumped his said publicly. Director Komi told me three times that I wasn't under investigation I mean ghost tweets those words every interview every statement in regards to his firing after after combing will definitely be product tomorrow. Sylvia things will look a little different but what is fascinating about covering. The senate and the house which you do all the time is that. There are very few secret entrance ways or you know it if director call me walks down this hallway we will be there and we will definitely. Trying get some questions to him. For now we're gonna wrap here on ABC's Josh Haskell joined by. The fantastic Alley wrote in we'll have more coverage the rest of today of course the hearing now. Closed session. But hopefully we'll get some wrap up of back because it may be. Those intelligence chiefs will say some things that they didn't feel comfortable talking about in front of us. For now suit BBC for continuing coverage. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Because I didn’t expect the company to announce anything new and meaningful. I wasn’t wrong. Oh, some people thought it was great. If Apple announced a new apple (the kind that grows on trees), some people would swear it was the tastiest fruit ever, before it was even ripe and ready to eat. I’m not one of them. The one bit of news that caught my attention is that Apple has stopped neglecting the Mac. For several years now, Macs have been the red-haired stepchildren of Apple’s hardware line. The new iMac Pro — with its entry-level eight-core Intel Xeon processor; its AMD Radeon Vega graphics and up to 16GB of VRAM; its all-flash architecture; up to 4TB of SSD and up to 128GB of ECC memory built-in; plus 10GB Ethernet — should be not only the fastest Mac ever, but also the fastest PC to date. But, at a starting price of $4,999, it had better be! You definitely will want a few for your megayacht. For mere mortals, the new and improved MacBook and MacBook Pro models, with their Intel seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips, improved graphics, and faster storage, are much more attainable. Their prices — the MacBook Pro starts at $1,299 for the 13-inch model and $2,399 for the 15-inch model, and the MacBook starts at $1,299 — are still high, but within reason. The new 21.5- and 27-inch iMac models, which also include Kaby Lake processors, better displays, faster storage options, and advanced GPUs, are also interesting, and at a starting price of $1,299, I can see one of these on my desk. But beyond that, all I can say to WWDC is, “Eh.” And, even while it’s nice to see new Macs, Apple should have been delivering such improvements all along. Perhaps Apple is finally feeling some heat from Microsoft with its new Surface Pro lines? Yes, the new iPad Pro with its 10.5-inch screen is neat, but do you really want to lug around a tablet that big? I don’t. I remember when the iPad first showed up. They were everywhere. How many people do you see carrying them around now? Apple is positioning the iPad Pro as a rival to laptops. Aren’t we done with this stupid idea yet? If I need a laptop format, I don’t want a tablet and a separate keyboard. I want a laptop. Is that so hard to understand? Someone told me he was thrilled he could run three — whoa! three! — applications on the new iPad. Get a grip. I’ve been able to run scores of apps on my laptop for the last 20 years. The final hardware news is Apple’s answer to Amazon Echo and Google Home, the Apple HomePod. This one is too little, too late — and it’s not even shipping until December. Then there was the software. For developers, there’s the augmented reality (AR) ARKit. For this, I have three words: Facebook’s Camera Effects. I also have another thought for all AR fans: Remember Google Glass? AR is a neat idea that’s still in search of a market. High Sierra macOS features minor updates, but nothing all that interesting. Another Apple fan gushed at me about the new file system. (And here I thought only my fellow Linux geeks gushed over file systems.) He especially loved its disk encryption feature. To which I said, “Apple File Vault 2 has provided this since OS X 10.7, Lion. This is more hype than advance.” As for iOS, I shudder with every new release. That’s because every release brings Wi-Fi problems and forces more users to buy newer Apple hardware. Indeed, I sometimes think that’s the real point of Apple’s new iOS releases. With iOS 11, get ready to say goodbye to your iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPad 4. Maybe it’s just me, but I prefer vendors that don’t virtually brick my pricey hardware after five years. Of course, I’m used to desktops that have working life spans of over a decade. Thanks, Linux! Even Apple, in a press release lauding iOS 11 as a major update, could only boast about its “powerful multitasking features, the Files app and more ways to use Apple Pencil.” Oh, and AR — can’t forget about AR. I did mention something about hype, right?  Just to recap, running three apps at the same time is not “powerful multitasking.” The lack of an adjective modifying “the Files app” suggests we’re supposed to be impressed by its very existence. Well, here’s a news flash: On Android, ASUS File Manager has been doing everything Files will do since about 2013. As for Apple Pencil, even the graphic designers I know don’t use it. Oh, yeah, why do I keep forgetting about AR? Well, wake me up when people start using it. It’s nice to see new Macs, but otherwise Apple is just playing catch-up and trying to make old ideas new with a coat of Apple reality-distortion paint. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to nap on Apple matters until the company gets ready to release a new iPhone. I’ll want to be well rested when the wonderful Apple hype train gets on the tracks again. Related: Apple Mac Apple iOS MacOS Steven J.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Jef Cozza. Updated June 7, 2017 9:53AM SHARE ALSO SEE Hewlett-Packard Gaming Desktop Virtual Reality Laptop Notebook Technology News Tech giant HP has announced a major update to the Omen line of VR (virtual reality) and gaming devices with the launch of the Omen X Desktop and Omen X Compact Desktop. The new devices are updates to the Omen X VR Pack the company launched last year as a wearable machine that could provide fully rendered 3D virtual environments while letting the user walk around untethered from a desktop. While last year’s wearable model was designed for VR developers who wanted to use the hardware to test their designs, the new versions are aimed squarely at consumers. The entry-level Omen X Desktop starts at $1,569.99, and comes with a Kaby Lake version of an Intel i5 processor, along with 8 GB of RAM, a 128 SSD, and 1 TB HD, along with the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 as a graphics card. Designed for VR For another $1,030, you can upgrade to the top-end line, featuring the older, 6th-generation i7 processor, 32 GB of RAM, a 256 GB SDD and 2 TB HDD, and the AMD Radeon R9 Fury X Graphics card. Although HP said that the Omen family was designed exclusively with gamers in mind, the company is not being shy about the fact that it sees the devices as VR platforms. That is particularly true of the Omen X Compact Desktop. Although it has "desktop" in its name, it is also designed to be worn on a user’s back once removed from its docking station, providing the same ability to freely explore a virtual environment without having to be wired to a stationary desktop. The Omen X Compact is also lighter than last year’s developer version, and features a new, more efficient cooling system to help prevent both the processor and a user's back from overheating, according to the company. It should also help keep the fan noise down so it doesn't drown out the soundtrack of a user's favorite game. External GPU Dock The Compact will come with an Intel Core i7 processor, and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. It is expected to ship sometime next month for $2,499, although users who want to take advantage of its mobile abilities will need to kick in an additional $599.99 for the backpack accessory. HP also made a play to get in on the trend of external GPU docks with the Omen by HP Accelerator, also announced yesterday. An external dock allows users to connect an external graphics card to their notebooks for when they need the extra compute power, while allowing them to leave the GPU at home for greater mobility when they don'. The Accelerator dock connects via a Thunderbolt 3 connection and will work with any laptop that has the port. "You get the best of both worlds: An amazingly mobile notebook for everyday tasks, and high-end graphics processing power to play games when you dock," according to John Ludwig, gaming and VR product manager at HP.

Although it has "desktop" in its name, it is also designed to be worn on a user’s back once removed from its docking station, providing the same ability to freely explore a virtual environment without having to be wired to a stationary desktop. The Omen X Compact is also lighter than last year’s developer version, and features a new, more efficient cooling system to help prevent both the processor and a user's back from overheating, according to the company. It should also help keep the fan noise down so it doesn't drown out the soundtrack of a user's favorite game. External GPU Dock The Compact will come with an Intel Core i7 processor, and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. It is expected to ship sometime next month for $2,499, although users who want to take advantage of its mobile abilities will need to kick in an additional $599.99 for the backpack accessory. HP also made a play to get in on the trend of external GPU docks with the Omen by HP Accelerator, also announced yesterday. An external dock allows users to connect an external graphics card to their notebooks for when they need the extra compute power, while allowing them to leave the GPU at home for greater mobility when they don'. The Accelerator dock connects via a Thunderbolt 3 connection and will work with any laptop that has the port. "You get the best of both worlds: An amazingly mobile notebook for everyday tasks, and high-end graphics processing power to play games when you dock," according to John Ludwig, gaming and VR product manager at HP.

Apple updates iMac, MacBook lines; doubles down on performance by Winston Sih Posted Jun 7, 2017 12:14 pm EDT International Tech The new 27-inch iMac is seen in San Jose on June 5, 2017. CITYNEWS/Winston Sih Apple refreshed its line of Mac computers at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif., Monday, including the iMac desktop – a device the tech giant hasn’t updated in almost two years. Manufacturers typically renew computers at least yearly to stay relevant. iMac reimagined on the inside, not out Not much has changed on the exterior, but the first thing you do notice when powering on is the vibrancy of the display – boasting a beautiful 4K display and 5K display in the 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMacs, respectively. These displays are 43 per cent brighter than its predecessor at 500 nits with support for one billion colours. Essentially, you’re guaranteeing yourself a vivid picture with whatever you’re doing. The thin bezel of the new Apple iMac is seen in San Jose on June 5, 2017. CITYNEWS/Winston Sih   From a performance perspective, Apple has heavily invested in the Intel Kaby Lake seventh-generation Core i5 processor as standard, with an option to upgrade to Core i7. Measured against the previous-generation model, the new iMac will allow for three-times-faster gaming on the 21.5-inch model. iMac pushes the envelope in storage with the evolution of the Fusion Drive across the 27-inch line and on the high-end 21.5-inch 4K computer, adding higher-capacity memory. Fusion Drives allow users to access frequently used documents, photos, videos, on a flash drive, eliminating spinning disks of the traditional hard drive. It means fewer parts to break down. I’d like to see a move to this being standard on all desktops. Available ports on the 27-inch iMac, seen in San Jose on June 5, 2017. CITYNEWS/Winston Sih   Users will find plenty of connectivity on the 27-inch iMac, and unlike iPhone 7, there’s still a headphone jack, alongside four USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt 3 (a.k.a. USB-C for everyone else), a Gigabit Ethernet, and an SD card port. This allows for added displays, high-speed hard drive connectivity, and other third-party accessories. Among the updates from the conference include a peek at the next iteration of the Mac platform – macOS High Sierra – chock-a-block full of new toys for developers to create immersive experiences for users, like virtual reality. However, the upgrade won’t be available until the fall. MacBook Pro: Building on its success The previous generation of MacBook Pro made the laptop much thinner and lighter. Plus, the integration of a fluid and interactive Touch Bar and Touch ID fingerprint reader has been surprisingly useful — not just a gimmick — and the 2017 version builds on that. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, seen in San Jose on June 5, 2017. CITYNEWS/Winston Sih   The upgrades bring a routine processor and hard drive boost. Machines will see the same Intel Kaby Lake processor as its desktop counterparts, as well as faster solid-state drives, and the 15-inch MacBook Pro will have snappier graphics out of the gate. The notebook could benefit from an added USB 3.0 port for so many existing devices while still offering flexibility in the increasingly popular USB-C port. I also miss the SD card reader. Can there be a balance struck with ports, or lack thereof? The OLED-lit Touch Bar on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, seen in San Jose on June 5, 2017. CITYNEWS/Winston Sih   As for the OLED-lit Touch Bar that offers virtual buttons that react to the specific program you’re in, the technology continues to be unique in its class. I’d like to see exponential growth of adoption by third-party developers for it to be a real hit. But for the apps that currently utilize this, it’s fantastic. The Force Touch trackpad on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, seen in San Jose on June 5, 2017. CITYNEWS/Winston Sih   With the last MacBook Pro, I had some issues with the shallow-but-tactile butterfly keyboard sticking. Apple has made some improvements to address reported problems with switch keys. Other standard updates include increased speed and longer battery life. A larger Force Touch trackpad that reacts to the amount of pressure given to surface different actions remains. MacBook receives a minor—but needed—spec bump The new entry-level MacBook, seen in San Jose on June 5, 2017. CITYNEWS/Winston Sih   The entry-level MacBook remains one of Apple most popular laptops. It’s small in form and packs a punch as an ultraportable device, though it’s not as powerful as its sibling MacBook Pro. It gets the job done if you’re a parent just looking to surf the web and answer emails. The entry-level laptop will get a boost in processor gigahertz, albeit minor at 1.2GHz dual-core, but when you’re working with less than 1.5 GHz to start with, every bit counts — even when you simply have a handful of web browser windows open. In addition, the new solid-state drives are 50 per cent faster than its predecessor — rounding out a machine many students will no doubt adopt come September. Availability The new MacBook and MacBook Pro machines are available now. A pro version of the iMac—aptly named iMac Pro—was announced Monday, but will not be available for sale until December. The updated classic line is available today. Join the conversation Cancel reply Sign in to comment. You're logged in as . Edit Profile | Logout. Loading profile... Unexpected error. Please try again.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's What I Want to See From Intel Corporation's Coffee Lake This Fool explains what he hopes to see from Chipzilla's next enthusiast desktop computer chip, which is expected to launch in August. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 7, 2017 at 12:26PM In August, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to launch a new processor family called Coffee Lake-S for the enthusiast desktop computer market. The initial enthusiast-focused Coffee Lake-S parts will, per a recent leak, come in four- and six-core variants, up from the two- and four-core configurations of the current Kaby Lake-S processors. The Coffee Lake-S parts are also expected to be manufactured using the company's new 14nm++ manufacturing technology, which promises a roughly 10% performance improvement over its currently shipping 14nm+ technology.  Image source: Intel. In this column, I'd like to explain what I hope to see from this product.  Pushing ahead on per-core performance In going from the top Skylake-S part (Core i7-6700K) to the top Kaby Lake-S part (Core i7-7700K), Intel kept the basic processor architecture the same but used the improved manufacturing technology to increase the operating frequencies of the chip.  Intel's efforts bore fruit, as the table below illustrates:  Frequency (GHz) Core i7-6700K Core i7-7700K Base  4.0 4.2 1-core Turbo 4.2 4.5 2-core Turbo 4.0 4.4 3-core Turbo 4.0 4.4 4-core Turbo 4.0 4.4 Data source(s): Wikipedia. Now, it was relatively easy for Intel to convert the manufacturing technology gains into straightforward frequency increases because the 6700K and 7700K are based on the same architecture and have the same number of cores.  With the top Coffee Lake-S part -- likely the direct successor to the Core i7-7700K in terms of product positioning -- Intel will will be increasing the processor core count by 50%. At the same time, Intel isn't expected to increase the rated thermal design power of that hex-core chip (so power draw shouldn't, in theory, go up much) and a 10% improvement in manufacturing technology performance isn't going to completely offset a large core count increase. So, I expect that when all six cores on the upcoming Coffee Lake-S parts are loaded, they will run at less than the 4.4 GHz that all the cores on the 7700K do when they're being used.  However, I think that the gains from 14nm++ should allow Intel to increase the frequencies at which the Coffee Lake-S processor cores run at when between one and four cores is utilized. This allows Intel to have its cake and eat it, too, so to speak.  What can Intel realistically achieve? If Intel wants to build some really impressive products for the enthusiast market, then a straight 10% increase in one- to four-core frequencies over the 7700K chip would probably do it. However, given the very high frequencies that the 7700K already operates at, 10% might be tough to achieve. If Intel can deliver at least a 5% frequency boost over the 7700K when one- to four-cores are being used, I'd consider that a worthy achievement. Then, if when all six cores are loaded up, Intel can achieve frequencies of around 4GHz (a reasonable reduction from the 4.4GHz all-core turbo on the 7700K), the chip would also be an attractive choice for users interested in high performance in scenarios that can use a lot of cores.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Mike Rogers, the director of NSA, largely declined to discuss details about their interactions with Trump when pressed on the matter during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. According to news reports published last month, Trump asked both Coats and Rogers to rebut stories that Trump was under investigation as part of the Russia probe. Both Coats and Rogers reportedly felt uncomfortable with the requests from Trump. But when asked about those interactions on Wednesday, both declined to discuss their specific conversations with Trump while stating that they have never felt pressure from the White House.

And to the best of my collection … I do not recall ever feeling pressured to do so,” Rogers told Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate panel. “Did the president … ask you in any way, shape or form to back off or downplay the Russia investigation?” Warner asked. Rogers said that he would not discuss specifics of conversations he had with Trump, but added: “I stand by the comment I just made, sir.” Coats, a former Indiana senator who was appointed by Trump, also denied ever being pressured to downplay the Russia investigation or any other. On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that Coats told associates on March 22 that Trump asked him to intervene with former FBI Director James Comey to push back against the Russia investigation. “In my time of service … I have never been pressured, I have never felt pressure, to intervene or interfere in any way, with shaping intelligence in a political way or in relationship to an ongoing investigation,” Coats testified Wednesday.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Warner on Trump: 'We have no smoking gun' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warner on Trump: 'We have no smoking gun' 00:34 Story highlights Ranking Senate Intel Democrat Mark Warner said it's "more than a little bit curious" that Trump named a new FBI director a day before fired director James Comey testifies before Congress Warner also says the "pattern" emerging around the Russia investigation "raises a huge amount of questions" Washington (CNN)The top Democratic member of the Senate intelligence committee said Wednesday that the timing of President Donald Trump's announcement of a new FBI director -- the day before James Comey is set to testify before Congress -- is "more than a little bit curious." "I think it is more than a little bit curious that the president chose this morning as the time to announce his new FBI head," Sen. Mark Warner told host Chris Cuomo in an interview on "New Day." Trump to nominate Christopher Wray as FBI director "There will be a time and place to review him," Warner continued. "But it seems to me that this is an effort to try to take people's attention off what is going to be the main event, at least for the next two days -- the leaders of our intelligence community and the FBI director." Trump tweeted Wednesday morning he would nominate Christopher Wray to replace Comey as FBI director. Warner also spoke more broadly about his committee's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and probes into possible collusion with the Trump campaign. He expressed mixed feelings about Republicans' willingness to cooperate. Read More "I think what you are seeing from some of my Republican colleagues, we're committed to getting to the truth, following the facts, but I think you are seeing some Republicans, particularly House members, try to throw up other stories," Warner said. The Virginia Democrat emphasized the troubling "pattern" he sees in the Russia probe and discussed news reports that Trump sought to pressure senior intelligence officials related to the investigation. "We've had reports as recently as yesterday that maybe even more than once, the President tried to intervene with Director Coats to ask him to either downplay or dismiss the FBI investigation into contacts between Trump officials (and Russia)," Warner said. He was referencing a report from The Washington Post late Tuesday that Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats had been pressured by Trump to intervene with Comey. "If we have evidence that the President of the United States intervened in an investigation, and asked Coats and (National Security Agency Director Michael) Rogers to back off, and then we have Director Comey tomorrow describing the conversations he had with the President, and the fact that he felt uncomfortable ... that's just unacceptable," Warner said. Coats, however, denied to the Senate intelligence committee Wednesday morning that he ever "felt pressured to intervene in the Russia investigation in any way."

After just a day of using it, I’m not going to opine on its performance — especially since the 2016 MacBook I have to compare it to is a 2016 core m7. The big question a lot of people are asking is whether the little MacBook is finally over that power hump that’s kept users from switching over to it. I sadly cannot answer that for you, but my hunch is that the basic calculus isn’t going to change. If you need speed, get a MacBook Pro or a Windows PC or maybe even a MacBook Air. If you can live with a single USB-C port (and all the dongles that entails), and don’t need a ton of power, stay tuned for a full review. There’s still just one lonely USB-C port In the meantime, I can tell you a little about the keyboard. Beyond the processor, it’s the only other thing Apple’s changed. The keys have a slightly updated butterfly mechanism compared to last year’s model — they’re more similar to the keys on the MacBook Pro now. That doesn’t mean that they have a ton more key travel, though, because they feel about the same to me. I think I prefer the newer keyboard; it’s a little less clacky and the keys feel a little softer as you press down, but there’s still a satisfying click when you hit them. The finish is a little more matte, and Apple added the proper symbols above the Control and Option keys. That’s a lot of words for a keyboard that, like the processors, isn’t likely to change the basic equation for most people. It’s slightly better than before. I like it, but then I am also a fan of the keyboard on last year’s MacBook (and many people are not). No Intel. Bad Intel. Bad. One other thing, since you’re here: I need to talk to you a little bit about Intel’s processor naming conventions, because they are unnecessarily confusing. The chips in these MacBooks are part of a new family of processors from Intel called Kaby Lake, which are iteratively better than their predecessor processors, called Skylake. And when Intel made the switch over, it changed how it named things. What you need to know is that the Core i5 and Core i7 options on the skinny little MacBooks are not the more powerful Core i5 and i7 processors you might be thinking of. They’re less powerful than the processors you can get on the MacBook Pro models. In some ways, this makes sense: these new Kaby Lake chips are able to turbo up to some pretty impressive speeds. But in most ways, this is just annoying dissembling from Intel that everybody else is forced to play along with because Intel gets to name its things whatever it chooses. The secret to distinguishing these chips, as Jake Kastrenakes wrote last September, is to look for the full product code for the processors. If it’s a “Y” series instead of a “U,” it’s the lighter-power version. For the record, here are the exact processor models shipping on these MacBooks: Intel® Core™ i7-7Y75 Processor (5W, 1.4GHz CPU base, 3.6GHz CPU max single core turbo) Intel® Core™ i5-7Y54 Processor (5W, 1.3GHz CPU base, 3.2GHz CPU max single core turbo) Intel® Core™ m3-7Y32 Processor (5W, 1.2GHz CPU base, 3.0GHz CPU max single core turbo) And here’s how Apple describes these processor options when you go to buy them: Enjoy great performance from seventh-generation Intel Core processors. Choose the speed and processor you want for your MacBook. This MacBook model includes the dual-core Intel Core i5 at 1.3GHz with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.2GHz. For faster performance, choose the optional dual-core Intel Core i7 processor for 1.4GHz of processing power and Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.6GHz. Why did Intel do all this with the names? When Jake asked last year, this was the answer: “We have also made significant performance improvements” to the Core m line “such that both form factor and performance lines were blurring,” Intel’s Scott Massey [wrote] in an email to The Verge.

Except in this case, that's wrong. G.Skill sent us a line informing us that professional overclocker (what a job, eh?) Toppc achieved a stunning 5.5 GT/s memory transfer rate using an Intel Core i7-7740K CPU astride an unspecified X299 motherboard. The new record is verified by HWBot and is a 500 MT/s improvement over Toppc's 5 GT/s record from last year. The memory used by the Taiwanese talent was obviously G.Skill's own, and the company confirmed that the modules in question were assembled using Samsung DRAM ICs. There's no real surprises to be found here; Intel promised that the Core i7-7740K would offer the highest gaming performance possible and as we've come to understand lately, memory performance can be a big part of that. Achieving that insanely high clock rate required insane cooling—in this case, liquid nitrogen. The achieved result isn't extremely useful in practice, because to hit that high number Toppc had to disable all but one core of the Kaby Lake-X CPU. That isn't unusual for these world-record overclocking attempts, though. The point isn't to create a usable overclock, it's simply to reach the highest number possible. Clock rates like this won't be coming to mere mortals like you or me anytime soon. You can get pretty close, though. The company announced limited availability of 4800 MT/s kits at Computex. We reckon that ought to offer some pretty solid performance in DayZ. Tags: Memory Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

All these four are somewhat intertwined - either one would benefit the others, or it would make it almost impossible for them to exist. They go hand in hand, which would explain why so many companies are dug in deep on all four fronts. The development of the self-driving technology appears to be the most complex of the bunch, and what we've seen so far only comes to confirm that. A cavalcade of car, technology, and software companies are currently involved one way or another, with some of the biggest names in each of these industries holding the front pages. What's the end game? Sure, self-driving cars would make the roads a safer place, but it can't be just that. And it's not. It's actually a fight for survival of the most primordial kind. Any carmaker that won't have self-driving-capable vehicles once the lawmakers finally come to an agreement and give the technology the green light would instantly be vaporized. At least that's what Intel believes based on the Strategy Analytics study published just the other week. The paper also predicts that "autonomous technology will enable a Passenger Economy worth $7 trillion in 2050." That represents the indirect savings for consumers and business users alike, deriving from the free time obtained by not having to drive anymore as well as increased productivity and cost savings. Self-driving tech will have a big influence on a range of industries, with the automotive one being just one of them. Public transport will also suffer a massive hit as personal cars become more efficient commuters, and more comfortable as well. Intel's view of the future sees an increase in overall traffic, but a decrease in the consumers' commuting time - 250 million hours a year, to be exact. This is time that could be filled by a bombardment of information and entertainment, with the mandatory chunks of advertising mixed in. Nobody really knows the impact autonomous cars will have, but everybody seems to agree it's going to be great. It will likely be a generation or two before people would be willing to give up on driving completely, but considering how absorbed we are by our smartphones already, it's hard to imagine we'd give up on the opportunity of spending even more time with our beloved device.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers are all set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, one day before the highly-anticipated Comey appearance. But Wednesday’s testimony figures to be quite interesting in its own right. On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that Coats was asked by President Donald Trump to see if he could persuade Comey into backing off an investigation of former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn. And Rosenstein continues to face questions over his role in Comey’s firing, having written a memo recommending Comey’s dismissal. Reports indicate that he knew Trump was going to fire Comey prior to his writing the memo. All of this amounts to what should be a compelling day of testimony on Capital Hill involving four crucial government figures. Watch above, via PBS.

May Production Levels Intel's overall production levels remain strong across the fabs at Intel, according to BlueFin's Steve Mullane. In a research report, the analyst stated that May's production estimate levels rose 1 to 2 percent compared to April's "strong start." In fact, Intel's production levels for the June quarter are tracking 100 basis points above forecasts and are higher by 6 percent sequentially. Intel's 14nm technology node remains the key growth driver with Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X ramping, the analyst suggested. Meanwhile, the key material suppliers aren't seeing any solid forecast ramps for the 10nm nodes but are "holding on for a possible ramp schedule" in the fourth quarter. PC Shipping Update PC shipments for the second quarter are on pace to fall in the 62 to 63 million unit range, which is two million units below the analyst previously expected. For the full year, total PC shipments are expected to be lower by 3 to 4 percent from 2016's level and total 263 million to 265 million units, a view that's closer to Intel's projections of a mid-single digit decline rate for the year.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo By Paul Lienert | DETROIT DETROIT Delphi Automotive PLC will partner with Paris-based Transdev Group, a public transport service controlled by the French government, to develop an automated on-demand shuttle service in Europe, the companies said on Wednesday. In a joint statement, Delphi and Transdev said they will test driverless vehicles in Normandy and outside Paris, in advance of building a commercial service, starting in 2019, that could be deployed in other markets, including North America. It would be the first such commercial application on public roads of fully automated vehicles, they said. The Delphi-Transdev partnership will provide "a clear path to commercializing automated mobility on demand," said Glen De Vos, Delphi's chief technology officer, in a media briefing. Delphi is contributing a self-driving system that it has been developing with Israeli mapping and vision expert Mobileye NV, which is being acquired by U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp. Transdev will manage the project and will provide ticketing, dispatch, routing and remote control-command services, the companies' statement said. French automaker Renault SA will supply the venture with Zoe electric minicars, according to Yann Leriche, Transdev's chief performance officer. The test phase will start later this year with two Zoe minicars in Rouen in Normandy and a shuttle bus in the Paris suburb of Saclay, Leriche told the media briefing. Initially, the vehicles will have "safety" drivers on board, but the plan is to move quickly next year to tests of fully driverless vehicles that are remotely controlled and monitored by human operators, he added. Delphi has been building its expertise and capability in self-driving vehicles through partnerships, investments and acquisitions. Several of its affiliates will participate in the project with Transdev, including Ottomatika (vehicle control software), Control-Tec (real-time data analytics) and Movimento (over-the-air software updates). Transdev, a mobility services provider, operates public and private transport services in 19 countries. The company is controlled by Caisse des Depots, an investment arm of the French government. Veolia Environnement SA, the French waste management company, holds a 30-percent stake. The Delphi-Transdev partnership is the latest in a growing web of global alliances aimed at putting self-driving vehicles on the road over the next four years. In May, German automaker BMW AG announced that Delphi will join it in a self-driving partnership that includes Intel and Mobileye.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech News / HP breathes new life into its OMEN gaming line-up HP breathes new life into its OMEN gaming line-up Damien Cox 1 day ago Featured Tech News, Gaming PC HP’s push into the gaming market continues as the company has begun rolling out a new line of OMEN systems, including desktops, notebooks and an upcoming portable VR system. Interestingly, the OMEN X VR Backpack meant to launch this month seems to have also had a rework and a slight delay as a result. The OMEN X Compact Desktop takes what we knew of the original Backpack concept that debuted in 2016 and fixes one of the biggest limitations presented by portable VR systems. Not only has the chassis been updated to keep in line with the rest of the redesigned products, but it now comes with a dock as well as plug and play functionality, moving it from the exclusivity of VR into a standard working desktop. The Compact Desktop will boast a 7th generation Kaby Lake Intel Core i7 CPU with a factory-overclocked NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 making sure it is a go-to system for high-resolution and VR gaming. The OMEN X Compact Desktop will be available in August starting at £2,499, with the possibility of a standalone backpack release in Europe in the future. The OMEN laptops have been refreshed with HP releasing the OMEN 15 and OMEN 17. Both will contain a 7th generation Intel Quad Core CPU, built for multitasking on the go as well as options up to a GTX 1060 for the OMEN 15 and a GTX 1070 for the larger OMEN 17. While we are unsure of the availability in Europe, North America also get a choice of AMD GPUs, with up to a Radeon RX 550 or 580 for the OMEN 15 and OMEN 17 respectively. All variants will come with a 4K/60Hz refresh display option but it might be wiser to go for the 1080p/120Hz option instead for anyone playing competitive games. The 120Hz display comes with Nvidia’s G-Sync technology, meanwhile there is a 1080p/60Hz FreeSync option as well. Both laptops will be available in June starting at £899 for the OMEN 15 and £999 for the OMEN 17. HP has also redesigned its line of desktops to offer a lot of hardware combinations including the latest of AMD’s Ryzen or Intel’s 7th generation i5/i7 CPUs. It includes dual functionality with up to two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Tis in SLI or AMD Radeon™ RX 580s in Crossfire. The over-engineering doesn’t stop there, also offering optional PCIe SSD or an SSD+HDD combination for more storage space. The OMEN Tower is available in June starting at £999. HP has been thorough with their OMEN redesign, making sure to try and expand their reach in the gaming market. Other products on the way include the OMEN Accelerator external graphics enclosure as well as a line of gaming monitors and peripherals arriving between June and August. More details about these will be coming at a later time. KitGuru Says: There’s a lot of things going on at HP that it can be difficult to focus on just one aspect but I have to say that their push on VR is particularly interesting to me.

The refreshed lineup includes new 15- and 17-inch Omen laptops, an external GPU dock, a completely overhauled Omen desktop, a second iteration of its Omen X Compact backpack PC for VR gaming. Omen Laptops The Omen 15 and 17 laptops replace their understated faux carbon-fiber chassis with an edgier design that HP describes as “fighter jet and spacecraft-inspired”. They definitely have more ‘gamer’ flair with their hard edges, four red LEDs and the blood-red Voodoo logo on the lid. Their keyboards have been tuned for gaming in both the layout, with highlighted WASD keys, full sized arrow keys and independent macro keys on the 17-inch model, as well as the ability to better accept input from simultaneous unrelated keypresses with 26-key rollover and anti-ghosting. In terms of specs, both the Omen 15 and 17 will feature 7th generation Intel Core i7 processors. The base 15-inch model starts at $999 with an AMD Radeon RX 550 GPU and can be configured with up to an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU. HP says the latter configuration has been designed following Nvidia’s Max-Q principles which will supposedly let that GTX 1060 achieve peak graphics performance, within a small profile while keeping a lid on thermals and noise. Meanwhile, the larger Omen 17 starts at $1,099 with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 and can be configured with up to a GTX 1070. Display options come in 4K or 120Hz 1080p options with NVIDIA G-Sync. If users opt for the Radeon GPU, they can get a 60Hz 1080P panel with AMD FreeSync too. Both laptops have a single-access bottom panel that lifts off the underside of the chassis and gives users access to the HDD, SSD, and RAM so they can expand and upgrade down the line. In terms of ports, HP offers 3 USB Type-A and one USB Type-C with optional Thunderbolt 3 as expected. There is also an SD Card Reader, HDMI 2.0 port, mini DisplayPort, and RJ-45 for Ethernet. Both laptops will be available starting June 28 at HP.com and Best Buy. Omen Accelerator HP is also getting into the external GPU game with its own enclosure, powered by a 500-watt PSU and capable of holding a single graphics card as well as a hard drive. It also includes several additional ports, including four USB 3.0 and a single USB-C, and connects to a laptop over Thunderbolt 3. Graphics cards options include Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1060 or 1070, or AMD’s Radeon RX 580, while storage options include up to 1TB hard drives and a 256GB SSD. Besides the latest Omen range, the Accelerator is certified to work with the company’s Spectre 13, Spectre x360 13, Spectre x360 15, EliteBook x360 1030 G2, and Envy 27 All-in-One and Envy Curved All-in-One. In theory, other laptops that support external graphics over Thunderbolt 3 should work too but there’s no guarantee from HP. The device is priced at $299.99 and won’t ship until August. Omen Desktops The Omen Desktop is also getting a more gamer-inspired redesign, tool free expansion and two hot swappable hard drive slots on the front. It offers twice the number of fans compared to last year's version, a 15 percent larger case, and more than 50 percent greater air flow. The Omen Desktop starts at $899 featuring a GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card and a choice between AMD Ryzen and Intel Core options. This machine is meant to be a really scalable option for gamers who don't feel like building their own machine, and as such there are plenty of configuration options available. A fully souped up model can cost up to $3,000, packing dual GTX 1080 Tis or dual Radeon RX 580s. Ports include two USB 3.0 Type A and two USB 3.0 Type C in the front, as well as four USB 3.0 Type A and two USB 2.0 Type A, plus HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2, and three audio outputs in the back. In addition to a traditional gaming desktop, HP also refreshed the Omen X Compact Desktop, which is meant to be used as a backpack PC for VR gaming. This time around, however, the Omen X Compact Desktop can be used both for VR gaming and regular computing thanks to its docking station. HP improved on last year’s model with better heat distribution, noise levels and including more ports. Specs include a Core i7 processor, an 8GB GTX 1080 GPU, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB PCIe SSD, and the included dock for $2,499. The backpack accessory alone is $599 and it comes with two pairs of 73Whr batteries, which together with the desktop’s own battery can give you two hours of untethered VR gaming. The backpack has padded, adjustable straps, an angled base positioned to move the heat from the machine away from your body, and a lower support structure to distribute weight evenly. In terms of ports the Omen X Compact has four USB Type-A ports, one Thunderbolt port, one HDMI port, one mini Display port, an audio combo jack, and one 12V Vive power-out port. In addition the dock also holds five USB Type-A ports, one USB Type-C port, an Ethernet port, an HDMI port, and a Display port. Other stuff HP is also launching a 25-inch display with AMD’s FreeSync, 1080p resolution, and two USB 3.0 ports for $279.99. A more expensive 27-inch model with a QHD display, those same two USB ports, and Nvidia’s G-Sync wills et you back $799.99. HP says response time is as low as 1 millisecond on both. The 27-inch model goes on sale this week, and the 25-inch variant will be available at the end of the month. Lastly, HP is also launching a gaming mouse, a mechanical keyboard and a headset. The’ll all be available starting June 8. The Omen keyboard has Cherry MX Red switches, backlighting, and N-key Rollover for anti-ghosting. The Omen Mouse 600 has adjustable weights and mechanical switches rated for up to 50 million clicks, and the new Omen Headset 800 features thicker earcups versus last year’s model, boosted acoustic performance and a custom-tuned audio profile for clear speech. The keyboard will retail for $130, the mouse for $60, and the headset for $80.

Last week Gigabyte hosted an X299 OC gathering which broke numerous launch day world records on the latest Intel X299 platform. With overclockers from around the world, led by the Senior GIGABYTE overclocker HiCookie, this team of 5 gathered at the GIGABYTE OC Lab. Sofos, GIGABYTE’s veteran overclocker and Team AU’s: Dinos22, Youngpro, and SniperOZ worked throughout Computex to produce four new 3DMark world records and a global first. In order to push past the 7.5GHz barrier, the team of overclockers employed liquid helium to drop temperatures to a mind numbingly low -250° Celsius. GIGABYTE now dominates the world record in 3DMark03, 3DMark06, and Aquamark. The 3DMark06 world record was broken not once but twice over the past week, using different hardware configurations, subsequently making one of those scores a global first. Each of the 3DMark records were broken using the latest GIGABYTE X299 AORUS motherboards, AORUS graphics cards and G.Skill memory. From these scores its obvious to see that the GIGABYTE X299 AORUS Motherboards excel in pushing the limits of performance. With their commitment to overclocking, GIGABYTE has continued to develop motherboards that can satisfy the needs of overclockers, gamers, and enthusiasts alike.  Rate this story Rating: 1 ...

Impressive, I do wonder what they had to do with the processor and motherboard to get 7.5 Ghz stable enough for a valid benchmark run too. Will be interesting to see what the normal overclocking capabilities are of the x299, guessing reviews are upcoming of both that and the i9 processors once you can procure some of them what with Intel and sending review samples. brutlern Master Guru Posts: 285 Joined: 2011-02-09 #5439957 Posted on: 06/07/2017 10:15 AM Someone pls explain why they benchmark with old software like 3DMark03, 3DMark06, and Aquamark? I understand they want to compare it with previous results, but isn't it about time to upgrade already? You know, 11 years overdue? fry178 Master Guru Posts: 445 Joined: 2012-04-30 #5439966 Posted on: 06/07/2017 11:01 AM sorry, but anything beyond air/water cooling is irrelevant for 99.9% of all customers (and "real life" use). no mentioning on how many cores either. so far, asus/asrock/msi offer more/better components in the same price bracket, with asrock having one of the best power/vrm quality, and gigabyte willing to cut corners on components after the first batch of reviews are out (at least for the gpus), some LN2 (or similar cooling) is not going to change my mind... show me records when running water/air and its a different story. 4UJER84URF84 Newbie Posts: 7 Joined: 2017-01-05 #5439970 Posted on: 06/07/2017 11:11 AM If amd or intel could develop low heat cpu's then you could put a freezer unit on and get some good results, Using liquid nitrogen must be fun but dangerous too, These tests show how much more power cpu's have if only they could be cooler. RzrTrek Maha Guru Posts: 866 Joined: 2012-04-16 #5439975 Posted on: 06/07/2017 11:57 AM I do find these record breaking speeds to be of interest, but as fry178 mentioned, 99,9% of us will never come anywhere close to those kind of data crunching numbers with a full core count on regular cooling.

All of those are single threaded, and very CPU bound nowadays. buhehe Member Guru Posts: 84 Joined: 2016-07-25 #5440014 Posted on: 06/07/2017 02:29 PM Quote: Originally Posted by fry178 gigabyte willing to cut corners on components after the first batch of reviews are out (at least for the gpus). got a source?

Think about it: this motherboard was designed to handle 18 overclockable cores (well... actually 16 cores... but that's still a lot). That is no ordinary task, and certainly not one that Gigabyte can go cheap on. I imagine the VRM phasing is insanely high and the socket is designed with great durability. If they tested with something like a "measly" 8-core i9, reaching an overclock this high is no surprise. slyphnier Master Guru Posts: 326 Joined: 2009-11-30 #5440057 Posted on: 06/07/2017 04:10 PM Quote: Originally Posted by fry178 sorry, but anything beyond air/water cooling is irrelevant for 99.9% of all customers (and "real life" use). no mentioning on how many cores either. so far, asus/asrock/msi offer more/better components in the same price bracket, with asrock having one of the best power/vrm quality, and gigabyte willing to cut corners on components after the first batch of reviews are out (at least for the gpus), some LN2 (or similar cooling) is not going to change my mind... show me records when running water/air and its a different story. mind to show some fact that asus/asrock/msi using better components for their mobos compared to gigabyte? imo mobo nowdays using same parts, solid chockes/caps i never use asrock, but one thing for sure more VRM (ie 12phase) is not always mean better than lower vrm (ie. 8phase), and i dont think what asrock use in their board better than what asus used what important is in design layout and also electrical design that can improve overall performance regarding the OC record, while almost all people wont use LN2 for their own system but getting high record and stable during the test is sort to prove their mobo performance which also can mean "quality" in their board so on air/water system the result should be also good if the cooling work great, as the limitation is not on the mobo but rather on the cooling system, i believe that what gigabyte intend to with their OC promotion Zeblote Newbie Posts: 15 Joined: 2015-03-16 #5440059 Posted on: 06/07/2017 04:15 PM But who cares? Until there's a closed loop liquid helium cooler I can put in my pc and run 24/7, this is completely useless. We've already seen it with the ryzen chips that it means nothing for normal overclocking.

Summary MICRON TECH is currently 40.8% above its 200-period moving average and is in an upward trend. Volatility is high as compared to the average volatility over the last 10 periods. Our volume indicators reflect moderate flows of volume into MU.O (mildly bullish). Our trend forecasting oscillators are currently bullish on MU.O and have had this outlook for the last 8 periods. Our momentum oscillator is currently indicating that MU.O is currently in an overbought condition. Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 84.4122. This is an overbought reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses below 80 The last signal was a buy 11 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 73.16. This is where it usually tops. The RSI usually forms tops and bottoms before the underlying security. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 42 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 102.This is an overbought reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses below 100. The last signal was a buy 12 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 7 period(s) ago.   computer, heffx, highlights, Hiroshima, Micron, MU, NASDAQ, Ram, US Micron Technology, Inc.

By Tuan Nguyen We attempt to put together the new iMac Pro for less. Comments Shares Near the end of the company's World Wide Developer's Conference yesterday, Apple announced a new desktop PC. No, not a new Mac Pro like many were hoping for, but a new all-in-one iMac... Pro. Here are the specs: 27-inch 5K display with 500 nits brightness and P3 color 8-Core Intel Xeon CPU, configurable up to 18-Core 32GB of 2666MHz DDR4 ECC RAM, configurable up to 128GB 1TB PCIe SSD, configurable up to 4TB SSD AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56 GPU with 8GB of HBM2, configurable to Vega 64, 16GB Front 1080p FaceTime HD camera Built-in stereo speakers, with 4 microphones, 3.5mm headphone jack 10GbE Ethernet Four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports Four USB 3.0 ports 802.11ac wireless with Bluetooth 4.2 SDXC card slot with UHS-II As far as specifications go, the iMac Pro is a pretty beefy PC, and in all the right places. It's got one heck of a CPU, and a yet to be announced AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56. Apparently from the iMac Pro specs page, AMD is going to announce a Pro Vega 64 as well. We reckon that these GPUs will be based on AMD's Vega Frontier edition, and not the consumer version of Vega that is supposed to be announced sometime in August. Apple says that the $5000 base price for the new iMac Pro is a good deal, comparing its new computer to similar systems, specifically HP, which Apple said would have costed you $7000 for a similar system. Could it work for gaming? Probably. Would it be the best gaming PC that Apple has ever released? Yes. Based on the CPU and GPU alone, the new iMac Pro would be a fantastic gaming PC. But the old adage is that Apple computers are overpriced for what they are and that if you DIY, you can get an equivalent system for cheap. So let's try it! We went to our friends at PCPartPicker and built a system that attempted to match the new baseline iMac Pro feature for feature, to see how much we would actually save: PCPartPicker part list: CPU: Intel - Xeon E5-2620 V4 2.1GHz 8-Core Processor ($408.99) CPU Cooler: NZXT - Kraken X62 Liquid CPU Cooler ($158.99) Motherboard: Asus - X99-E-10G WS SSI CEB LGA2011-3 Motherboard ($649.00) Memory: Crucial - 32GB (1 x 32GB) Registered DDR4-2133 Memory ($253.81) Storage: Samsung - 960 EVO 1TB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive ($479.99) Video Card: Zotac - GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB Founders Edition ($678.99) Case: Silverstone - TJ04B-EW ATX Mid Tower Case ($151.90) Power Supply: SeaSonic - PRIME Titanium 1000W 80+ Titanium Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply ($242.89) Operating System: Microsoft - Windows 7 Professional ($134.99) Monitor: LG - UltraFine 5K Display 60Hz Monitor ($1299.95) Other: ASUS Model ThunderboltEX 3 Expansion Card ($69.99) Keyboard: Apple - MB110LL/B Wired Standard Keyboard ($49.00) Mouse: Apple - MB829LL/A Bluetooth Wireless Laser Mouse ($79.99) Speakers: Logitech - Z130 5W 2ch Speakers ($18.99) Card reader: Kingston - Digital MobileLite G4 USB 3.0 card reader ($9.24) Total: $4686.71 What we end up with is an awesome PC that would give our high-end build competition. We also have a system that's a productivity powerhouse as well. Our build has Wi-Fi, 10-gigabit Ethernet ports, USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, and even Apple's own keyboard and mouse—although not the cooler space gray versions. Unfortunately, we only saved $313 by building it ourselves and that's only after sending in $25 worth of mail-in rebates. If you can build the exact same specs as the new iMac Pro, let us know in the comments. Specs aside, we're not going to get the svelte design of Apple's new iMac Pro, and its admittedly good manufacturing build and design. But you go into DIY knowing this from the get-go. What you do get in return though is the ability to expand internally, which the iMac Pro doesn't offer.  If you use NZXT's new BLD system, you actually end up paying NZXT more to build a machine than the $313 you would be giving to Apple to build the iMac Pro. This is also in-line with what system builders will charge, and in many cases you'll end up paying even more for higher-end boutique builders. So if we're comparing builders, Apple's actually a deal! Of course, $1,300 of our price tag is wrapped up in the 5K monitor. It's an understandable cost for Apple's build, especially when you consider the all-in-one design, but you can save a considerable amount of money—and still have a kick-ass gaming monitor—by building separately. For pros editing 4K video, the 5K display makes sense. This is the demographic the iMac Pro is targeting. For the average enthusiast though, a cheaper 4K display will suffice. While Apple may have charged a big premium for its computers years ago, it looks like this is no longer the case today. If you're in the market to spend this kind of money on gaming though, you'd obviously be better off with our extreme gaming PC build guide than an iMac Pro.

DFI’s Ali171 and Ali173 boards, which provide 12V and 15-36V power supplies, respectively, build on Intel’s latest Apollo Lake Atom, Celeron, and Pentium system-on-chips. The 170 x 170mm Ali17x boards, which otherwise appear to be identical, follow earlier DFI Mini-ITX models such as the Bay Trail Atom E3800 based BT160. Like that board, the Ali17x would appear to qualify as a “thin” Mini-ITX board, although the company does not use the term. Ali173, front and back (click images to enlarge) The Ali17x supports Ubuntu 15.10 and Fedora 24, both of which ship with Intel graphics drivers, as well as Yocto Project Linux and Windows 10. It joins other thin Apollo Lake mini-ITX boards including Aaeon’s EMB-APL, Adlink’s AmITX-AL-I, Advantech’s AIMB-217, Congatec’s Conga-IA5, and Kontron’s mITX-APL. The Ali17x supports Intel’s quad-core, 1.6GHz/2GHz Atom E3950, 1.6GHz/1.8GHz Atom E3940, and 1.1GHz/2.5GHz Pentium N4200 Apollo Lake models. (DFI erroneously lists the latter as a Celeron.) The board is also available with the dual-core 1.3GHz/1.8GHz Atom E3930 and 1.1/2.4GHz Celeron N3350. The SoCs offer Intel HD Graphics GT Series graphics, and support OpenGL 5.0, DirectX 12, and OpenCL 2.1. Ali173 (left) and Ali171/Ali173 block diagram (click images to enlarge) The Ali17x supports up to 16GB DDR3L (1867MHz) via dual channels, and offers a SATA 3.0 connection and dual GbE ports with a choice of Intel I210AT or I211AT controllers. Other coastline ports include 4x USB 3.0, an audio out jack (Realtek ALC262-VC2-GR), and HDMI and VGA ports, both of which can be swapped otu for DisplayPort++. Triple display support is enabled with the help of LVDS interface, which can be exchanged for an optional eDP. The eDP port matches DP++ for the highest 4096 x 2160 @ 60Hz resolution. Ali173 detail view (click image to enlarge) Internal connections include five USB 2.0 interfaces, analog and S/PDIF interfaces, 8-bit DIO, LPC, SMBus, and panel connectors. There are also 4x RS-232 and 2x RS-232/422/485 interfaces with optional extension modules that use the LPC connection to deliver 4x RS-232 or 4x RS-485 real-world DB-9 ports (see diagram below). Serial expansion options for Ali171/Ali173 (click image to enlarge) Other expansion technologies include a full-sized mini-PCIe slot, an M.2 slot with SATA 3.0 support, and a PCIe Gen 2 interface. The board is further equipped with a watchdog, system fan connectors, an RTC with battery, and 7-year CPU lifecycle support. Options include a SIM card slot and a TPM security chip. Both the Ali171 and wide-range power Ali173 are available in 0 to 60°C and -40 to 85°C models.   Further information The Ali171 and wide-range power Ali173 Mini-ITX boards are listed as “coming soon.” More information may be found at DFI’s AL171/AL173 product page.   Related posts: Thin, tough Mini-ITX board runs Linux on Apollo Lake Apollo Lake thin Mini-ITX board focuses on security Fanless, thin Mini-ITX board taps quad-core Apollo Lake… Aaeon shows its first Apollo Lake COM 3.5-inch Apollo Lake SBC hands you a sixpack of USB 3.0 Mini Apollo Lake module takes the heat — and the cold Tiny COM features Apollo Lake and soldered RAM Pico-ITX Apollo Lake SBC gives you expansion options Apollo Lake 3.5-inch SBC doubles down on security Rugged Qseven module runs Linux on Apollo Lake (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Related Samantha Bee: 'Fox & Friends' Serves Trump Daily Breakfast of "Scrambled Islamophobia" Former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony of his various meetings with President Donald Trump began Wednesday with his “pre-xplosion of Thursday morning’s prepared remarks to the Senate Intel Committee. “Tomorrow, bars in the capitol are opening early and offering drink specials like the Covfefe Cocktails…People are calling Comey’s testimony Washington’s Super Bowl. Animal Planet is even airing the Puppy Comey Testimony.” Colbert began to read Comey’s seven pages of remarks, full of juicy details, because Comey wrote a memo after each of  his interactions with Trump. “Dear Diary: I need to write down my thoughts immediately, because that guy is so normal,” the late-night host joked. Comey, Colbert told his viewers, said he first met with Trump on January 6, to let him know about some “salacious intelligence” –“pee pee tape” Colbert translated – explaining he agreed to the meeting alone in order to “minimize potential embarrassment to the President-Elect.” “Remember this was back when we thought it was possible for him to feel embarrassment,” Colbert reminded. At one of their meetings, Colbert noted, Comey says Trump had told him he “had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia.” Comey also described a dinner he had with Trump just after his inauguration, in which he was surprised to discover the two of them were dining alone. That’s when Comey says Trump told him “I expect loyalty” from the director of the FBI.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR AR/VR Weekly: Apple enters the fray Jason Wilson@jason_wilson June 7, 2017 6:47 PM Above: Apple VR demo Image Credit: Dean Takahashi About time, Apple. Welcome to 2015. This week at its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote, Apple finally jumped into the augmented and virtual reality world. ARKit is Apple’s tool for making AR applications, and it was the first of several announcements that show that the iPhone company is ready to take the next step into a larger world. AR and VR could be a market that has more than 1 billion users and $60 billion in global revenues by 2021, tech adviser Digi-Capital estimates. And in a guest post for us, DC founder Tim Merel says that Apple “took the mobile AR war to the next level” with this announcement. And Merel’s not the only one bullish on Apple and AR. “With more than 130 million active iPhones in the U.S. alone and far less hardware/software fragmentation than Android, Apple’s move into AR stands to make it the largest player in the space virtually overnight. It will mint millions of new consumers for AR developers, all of whom have been shown the promise of the medium by Apple itself and are ready to see more,” says Randy Nelson of research firm Sensor Tower. “At the same time, the qualities that have made iOS the preferred platform for app developers will undoubtedly carry over to AR, so I believe Apple will make iOS the most attractive target platform possible for AR developers and content creators.” And on the VR side, Valve says it’s bringing SteamVR to Macs. You’ll be able to play VR games on an HTC Vive or an Oculus Rift — though you may need an external graphics chip solution that Apple also announced (because, let’s face it, Macs just can’t cut VR without a little help, and Apple loves selling you accessories). All of this has made game devs excited to see what comes from this new foray from the Mac maker. I’m not so excited about VR coming to the Mac. I want to see something better than a slap-dash cobbling together of a Mac and an external video chip. Why do that when I can buy a VR-ready PC for less than $1,000 — or just hook up a headset to my powerful gaming rig? Yeah, my Air can keep being an email and Hearthstone machine. But AR and iOS? That’s a dream team. For AR/VR coverage, send news tips to Dean Takahashi and Jeff Grubb (for those that cross over into PC gaming). Please send guest post submissions to Rowan Kaiser.

This week, we’ve finally found out what he’s doing next. The New York Times cites three sources familiar with the matter in saying that that Luckey has once again started up a new company. Instead of VR, though, this startup is working on surveillance technology targeted for use at countries between borders and military crossings. The unrevealed company has not yet been given a public name. (via UploadVR) What Virtual Reality Means For Marketers When new technology is introduced, businesses are never quite sure how to react. In 2008, marketing agencies were inundated with app requests from clients claiming ‘we want to be on the App store.’ Wanting to be first but not quite sure what they wanted, or why. Other businesses wondered the same thing, and today many still do. If it doesn’t serve a business need, it’s not on the radar.

That’s exactly why the United States military invests so much time and resources into equipping soldiers with state-of-the-art technology designed to keep them informed and updated when deployed in dangerous scenarios. (via VR Scout) Apple’s WWDC, Distilled Shortly after Apple CEO Tim Cook walked on stage yesterday, he made a proclamation. “This is going to be the best and biggest WWDC ever!” It’s hard to know if it will actually be the best WWDC ever, but he’s probably right about it being the biggest.

Earlier in 2006, it had raised $20 million in a round led by Sandstone Capital. In 2009, Frontline Strategy, a Singapore-based PE firm, bought a 2.44% stake in Tejas through a secondary transaction. Samena Capital invested in the company last year. Tejas is an optical and data networking products company with customers in over 60 countries. It designs, develops and sells high-performance and cost-competitive products to telecommunications service providers, internet service providers, utility companies, defence companies and government entities. Its products find application in building high-speed communication networks that carry voice, data and video traffic from fixed line, mobile and broadband networks over optical fibre. As of 30 April, Tejas Networks has filed 333 patent applications, with 203 filings in India, 89 filings in the US and 6 filings in Europe, out of which 56 patents have been granted. The company follows an asset-light strategy by outsourcing most of its manufacturing to reputed electronics manufacturing services companies. The strategy allows it to scale up production without requiring a corresponding increase in capital expenditure towards building its own manufacturing operations. For the financial year 2016-17, Tejas Networks reported a revenue of Rs865.3 crore, up from Rs625.5 crore in the previous financial year. It reported a profit of Rs53.2 crore in 2016-17, compared to a profit of Rs27.4 crore the previous year. Axis Capital Ltd, Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt. Ltd, Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd and Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd are managing the Tejas IPO. Earlier this week, Mint had reported that several companies, including Tejas Networks, are gearing up to launch their IPOs in June. These include private equity firm ChrysCapital-backed pharma company Eris Lifesciences, depository services firm CDSL Ltd and small finance bank Au Small Finance Bank Ltd. Collectively, these four firms are looking to raise over Rs5,000 crore through their initial share sales. So far this year, eight companies have raised Rs6,335.83 crore through IPOs, while last year 26 companies raised Rs26,493.84 crore through this route.

Aides have warned the president that ousting his longtime political ally and top law enforcement official would only add to the controversies mounting around his administration in the wake of his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey last month. But despite the pressure, one source noted that Trump does not always stick to the advice of his aides and associates. ADVERTISEMENT   "That's the advice he's been given. But he might not listen to that advice," the source told Reuters. Sessions reportedly recently offered to resign, telling the president that he needed the freedom to perform his job, though Trump ultimately did not accept the offer.  Trump is said to be upset by Sessions' decision in March to recuse himself from all matters regarding the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into Russian election meddling and possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The president is also said to blame Sessions for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's decision last month to appoint a special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation. While the appointment took both Trump and Sessions by surprise, the president has pointed the finger at Sessions' recusal.   Tags Jeff Sessions   View the discussion thread.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) AP Wednesday, June 07, 2017 05:31PM WASHINGTON, DC -- Fired FBI Director James Comey will testify under oath Thursday that President Donald Trump repeatedly pressed him for his "loyalty" and directly pushed him to "lift the cloud" of investigation shadowing his White House by declaring publicly the president was not the target of the probe into his campaign's Russia ties. Comey's detailed and vivid recollections of his one-on-one conversations with Trump were revealed in seven pages of prepared testimony released Wednesday, the day before his much-anticipated appearance before the Senate intelligence committee. FULL TEXT: Senate Intel Committee releases former FBI Director Comey's prepared testimony His remarks paint a picture of an FBI director so disconcerted by his interactions with the president that he began keeping written memos of their private discussions. He'll tell lawmakers he believed the president was trying to create a "patronage relationship" with him and describe in detail an Oval Office meeting in which Trump urged him not to investigate ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russian officials. But the ex-FBI director also will validate Trump's assertion that he was not personally a target of the federal counterintelligence investigation into possible campaign collusion with Russia. Comey says he did offer the president that "assurance," but resisted Trump's appeals to make that information public. .@TheNewParkway theater in #Oakland will host viewing party for #ComeyTestimony Thursday AM. #SenateIntelHearing #TrumpRussiaInvestigation— Lilian Kim (@liliankim7) June 8, 2017 "The FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change," Comey says in the prepared remarks. RELATED: 10 questions James Comey is likely to face Trump's personal lawyer said Trump was cheered by the testimony. "The president is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any Russian probe," attorney Mark Kasowitz said in a statement. "The president feels completely and totally vindicated. He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda." Comey has not spoken publicly since he was abruptly fired by Trump on May 9. His dismissal, four years into a 10-year term, fueled claims Trump's ultimate aim was to quash the investigation and obstruct justice, potentially a federal crime or an impeachable offense. Some legal experts said Comey's account could bolster such a case. Ryan Goodman, a professor at New York University School of Law, said Trump's efforts to protect Flynn provide "strong evidence" of obstruction of justice. However, Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said that while Trump's dealings with Comey were inappropriate, "We do not indict people for being boorish or clueless." RELATED: White House looks for ways to undermine James Comey's credibility Comey's statement came hours after two top intelligence officials told lawmakers they never felt "pressured" to do anything inappropriate by the president. But Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Adm. Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, angered members of the Senate intelligence committee by staunchly refusing to answer questions about conversations they had with Trump. The ex-FBI director's testimony recounts his conversations with the apparent precision of a veteran lawman. Comey notes he had nine one-on-one interactions with Trump over a four-month stretch, compared to two private conversations with President Barack Obama between September 2013 and the end of 2016. He also says he did not keep written memos of his interactions with Obama. The first meeting with Trump after the inauguration occurred on Jan. 27, during a private dinner at the White House that Comey came to view as an attempt by the president to "create some sort of patronage relationship." According to Comey, Trump asked if he wanted to remain as FBI director and declared: "I need loyalty. I expect loyalty." Comey says he replied that he could offer his honesty, and that when Trump said he wanted "honest loyalty," Comey paused and said, "You will get that from me." Related: Comey, Russia will take lead during FISA hearing Comey also describes at length a Feb. 14 meeting in the Oval Office in which he believed Trump asked him to back off an investigation into Flynn. "He then said, 'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go,'" Comey says, according to the prepared remarks. He said he believed the president was talking only about Flynn, not about the broader Russia probe. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she was unsure if the president read Comey's testimony after its release. Asked whether the president stood by earlier assertions that he had neither sought Comey's loyalty nor asked for the Flynn investigation to be dropped, she said: "I can't imagine the president not standing by his own statement." Earlier Wednesday, Trump announced that he planned to nominate Christopher Wray, a former Justice Department official, as Comey's successor. Trump allies have raised questions about Comey's credibility ahead of his testimony, noting that the FBI had to correct some of his remarks from his last appearance on Capitol Hill. They've also questioned why Comey did not raise his concerns about Trump publicly or resign. Comey's prepared testimony does not full answer that question, though he does say he asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to help prevent him having any direct communication with the president in the future. Trump has repeatedly cast the Russia investigation as a "hoax" and denied having any improper ties to Moscow. According to Comey, Trump was acutely aware of the political toll of the investigation, complaining that the probe had left a "cloud" that was "impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country." In a phone call on March 30, Comey says the president asked him what could be done to "lift the cloud." He says Trump also volunteered that "he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia" - referencing an unverified intelligence dossier detailing compromising information Moscow had allegedly collected on Trump. The White House initially said Trump fired Comey on the recommendation of the Justice Department, citing as justification a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that criticized Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But Trump later said he was thinking of "this Russia thing" when he fired Comey and would have dismissed him without the Justice Department's input.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | June 7, 2017 -- 22:44 GMT (15:44 PDT) | Topic: Innovation During a recent test in California the UTM platform ensured that the Project Wing aircraft could fly clear of other aircraft. Project Wing Project Wing, the drone project run Alphabet's innovation lab X, hit a new milestone this week, successfully testing a drone traffic management platform that could help drone operators navigate crowded air space. The tests, as explained in a Medium blog post, were part of a set of nationwide trials organized by NASA and the FAA to determine how to manage the thousands of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) expected to fill the skies within a few years. Project Wing tested its UTM (UAS Air Traffic Management) platform, which is still in development, at an FAA test site run by the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP). During the testing, one drone operator flew three Project Wing aircraft, using them to perform package pickup and delivery missions. Simultaneously and in the same area, other pilots operated two Intel Aero Ready to Fly Drones, as well as a DJI Inspire, to conduct automated search and rescue missions. Project Wing's UTM (UAS Air Traffic Management) platform. Project Wing The test showed that the UTM platform could automatically manage the flightpaths of all the drones involved, and that it could plan new routes for each when conflicts arose. "This is an important step that paves the way to a future where many UAS operators can fly safely together," Project Wing's James Burgess wrote in the blog post. "It also makes it possible for a single operator -- a person or organization -- to fly multiple aircraft simultaneously." So far, Project Wing has focused on developing three core elements of the platform: real-time route planning for drones in the same area, sending notifications to operators of any unexpected changes to the aircraft of route and sending notifications regarding no-fly zones and safety-sensitive areas. According to the FAA, there were 42,000 commercial drones in the US at the end of 2016. By 2021, the agency says, commercial UAS fleets could range from 442,000 to as many as 1.62 million. It's hard to predict just how big the US commercial drone market will be in the coming years, in large part because of pending regulations. The FAA isused its first rules for commercial drone use one year ago, but more rules are needed to allow for UAS deliveries. As the FAA and other agencies continue to study drone usage, the US Congress is also beginning to weigh in on the matter.

Now, as a sea of data is sucked in to all kinds of devices in all sorts of places, there is an increasing need to merge IT and OT in order to collect, store and analyze information in the most cost-efficient manner possible -- all in real time. The network edge increasingly is where the action is, as these worlds come together. Enterprises now use edge computing to create "smart" buildings and cities, more efficient factory floors and unique retail customer experiences. It's a huge opportunity for vendors like IBM, Cisco, GE and HPE. [ Further reading: The best home water leak detectors ]  "We're on the front lines powering the intelligent edge as your enterprise stretches from deeply connected digital workplaces to intelligently monitored operations to transformative experiences for your customers," said HPE CEO Meg Whitman in a keynote address at the company's Discover conference in Las Vegas this week.  "We're getting more and more data at the edge so that data doesn't have to travel back and forth to the data center or to the cloud and the reality is that often data has to be captured and analyzed at the edge, reducing latency," Whitman said. At last year's Discover, HPE introduced what it called the first converged systems for IoT. The Edgeline EL1000 and EL4000 systems are based on Intel's Xeon processors and offer built-in computing, storage and data-capture, essentially taking data-center power to the edge of the network in hardware that can be mounted on all sort of things, in factory floors, rail cars or even wind mills. Now, HPE is launching an Edgeline Services Platform (ESP), a software foundation layer on which the company and its partners can build and plug in apps for acquiring and managing data from a variety of different sources. The idea is that by adding analytics -- and when appropriate, cloud services -- companies can get insights and facilitate action to improve customer experiences as well as their own bottom line. ESP is an open platform: It can run on Intel's Xeon, Linux or Windows, incorporates the PXI modular electronic instrumentation platform standard, and HPE is publishing specs for it. "We are embracing OT," said Tom Bradicich, HPE's general manager for servers, converged edge and IoT systems. "When we get to the edge, out of the data center, we see a whole new world that's quite popular and very large but it's not IT," Bradicich said. "The reason we bring them together is because customers want us to. There are different edges but the most popular edge is IoT because that's achieved celebrity status."  Along with the introduction of the new platform, HPE is coining a term for what it calls a new product category: software-defined OT. Edgeline systems incorporate HPE's iLO firmware, allowing them to be controlled from the data center or even from remote devices using HPE management software. Along with the Edgeline Services Platform, HPE this week introduced the Edgeline Data Aggregation App, which plugs into the platform and can ingest data from Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), which are essentially OT devices. HPE also announced the Edgeline Address Translation App, which converges tasks related to network address translation, from a larger network -- on a factory floor for example -- to subset networks such as specific manufacturing lines. Essentially, HPE is allowing enterprises to do away with separate proprietary routers and switches, replacing those devices with hardware and software integrated into the Edgeline platform.   Bradicich uses the smartphone as a metaphor. Nowadays, you don't need a camera, flashlight, or music player if you carry a phone -- all those functions have been integrated via processor technology or software into one device, he notes. HPE is pricing the new software, available now, in several ways: separately (on customer demand), bundled in an Edgeline appliance, or with a Services agreement.

(Photos by European Pressphoto Agency and Reuters) LeBron James may not be the richest athlete alive, but he moved one spot closer to catching Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo when he overtook Barcelona striker Lionel Messi for the No. 2 spot on Forbes’s annual list, which was released Wednesday. “James’ salary jumped $8 million this year and his off-court income is up slightly to $55 million,” the magazine said, noting he traded old sponsorship deals with Samsung and Tencent for more lucrative ones with Intel and Verizon. “Other sponsors include Nike, Coca-Cola, Beats by Dre and Kia Motor,” Forbes added, and, “his business empire is growing through his production company, SpringHill Entertainment. He is also part of an investment group in the fast-growing Blaze Pizza chain with 17 franchises in Chicago and South Florida.” In total, James earned $86.2 million, just about $5 million shy of Ronaldo’s earnings of $93 million, of which $58 million came from salary and bonuses. This obviously leaves the door open for the Cleveland Cavaliers star to one day top the list, however, that will very much depend on the next NBA collective bargaining agreement and whether television broadcast deals continue to rise in a volatile market. Messi, meanwhile, dropped a spot this year earning a paltry (yeah, right) $80 million, $53 million of which came from salary and bonuses. Tennis legend Roger Federer and his $64 million earnings came in fourth place on the list, and Kevin Durant and his $60.6 million came in fifth, just like last year. Here is how the top 20 shook out. 1. Cristiano Ronaldo, soccer, $93 million, $58 million from salary/bonuses 2. LeBron James, basketball, $86.2 million, $31.2 million from salary/bonuses 3.

Follow her on Twitter @sfsooz. I've wanted to replace my 11-inch MacBook Air (mid-2011) for a while now. But the need became a little more urgent since I packed up my desk at Macworld and had to give back ... well, all the newer laptops. Luckily, the timing was fortunate, with WWDC just around the corner. I had my fingers crossed the MacBook Air would get a processor update, hopefully to a Kaby Lake chipset, even though I was afraid it wouldn't. And indeed, it wasn't to be. Instead I think we saw the death of the MacBook Air—at the hands of iOS 11 and its new features for the iPad. Why I'm into the Air Even though I've spent plenty of time with all the newest MacBooks and MacBook Pros, I keep coming back to my trusty MacBook Air. Sure, the screen isn't Retina, but I still love this laptop because I've tried and failed to get used to the low-travel keys on the post-2016 laptops. Not needing a dock or dongle to connect USB devices is nice, too, and the later MacBook Air models have decent battery life. OK, it's true, the MacBook Air did get the briefest of mentions onstage at WWDC, because Apple bumped the MacBook Air's processor speeds a little bit. It now starts with a 1.8GHz Core i5 processor, up from 1.6GHz, and upgradeable to a 2.2GHz Core i7. But those are still fifth-gen Intel chips, the Broadwell series, first introduced in 2015 and two generations back from the Kaby Lake chips. And it just seems like a shame to pay $1,000 and up for such old technology, even though it'd be a huge improvement from the mid-2011 Sandy Bridge laptop I'm using right now. Enter iOS 11 Still, as the presentation moved on, I had a new surge of hope. With iOS 11, I might be able to avoid upgrading this laptop for a little bit longer. See, when I gave back my work-issued MacBook Pro, the iPad Pro I'd been using at home went back too. This was, to put it mildly, a great concern for my iPad-loving 5-year-old son, so not 12 hours later I was at the Apple Store picking up a 128GB iPad—the new affordable one, because, after all, he's 5. I've tried to use it for work, with some success, although the multitasking features in iOS 10 still feel awkward. (But I do love being able to use any Bluetooth keyboard I want.) iOS 11 should help a lot, if not remove the friction entirely. First of all, Files. Integrating Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive is huge, and I give Apple a lot of credit in recognizing we don't all live in iCloud all of the time. The Dock looks great too, and dropping files onto app icons to open them is more natural than having to use the Share button and Open With feature. The Spaces feature in the new app switcher is another Mac-like feature we desperately needed in iOS. Sometimes I find myself jumping between three apps, for example, and in iOS 11, I could keep two of them locked together in one space, and jump easily between that pairing and the third app running full screen. As a dedicated MacBook Air fan, I'm already very comfortable using Spaces in macOS to keep my windows organized, so I'm excited that multitasking in iOS 11 will make better sense. Drag and Drop will be a game-changer too, and I'm pleased that it supports so many things (files, photos, text, URLs). Even just dragging text instead of copying and pasting it is intriguing—maybe iOS 11 will get users imagining a touchscreen Mac in a whole new way. A happy ending? Confession: I'm still not totally sure what to do. My MacBook Air is getting slow, and its battery barely made it through streaming the keynote. I could settle for a refurbished MacBook Air to save a few bucks, stretch for a 13-inch MacBook Pro with the keyboard I dislike, or even take a closer look at the newly refreshed iMacs. But first I'm going to take some time with iOS 11 and see if the answer to my dilemma is an iPad, not a Mac.

I'd be curious to see if I could install Zedge, and install Ringtones from it only on iOS 11. You also are still barred from installing apps that Apple doesn't approve of. I don't like Apple blocking what I can and can't see as an adult. There's a really easy ways they could block kids from seeing some apps, but they block me from having access to apps that support free speech. Hence, this isn't a replacement for a computer, it is still a little too locked down. Yes, I can use the sites in Safari, but then you don't get notifications or alike. Not as easy as an app with an API to the site. 0 23 hours ago Reply DannyJJK It's always going to be locked down to an extent, what you want is Android 0 13 hours ago Reply bobbob1016 True.

For me, key travel might be 312341234th reason for not buying a computer. 0 23 hours ago Reply eahinrichsen It doesn't seem weird to me that people would be picky about the primary means of interacting with a device. 0 19 hours ago Reply Moodyz Since car analogies are so popular, here's one; Keyboards are sort of like steering wheels in cars. People who're a bit more enthusiastic about their driving like a nicely weighted steering wheel with lots of feedback. Others who prefer a softer, more relaxed ride would prefer more a numb steering that doesn't transmit every undulation on the road. For me, keyboard key travel and overall "feel" easily ranks in my top 5 most important considerations when buying a laptop. Was up to number 3 in my list of reasons not to bother with the TouchBar MBPs when they were announced last year, with the primary reason being the **** poor price/performance ratio and the other being the lack of connectivity. 0 19 hours ago Reply fredfromus Nice read, I'm working with a MacBook Pro and an iPad on a daily basis. I'm moving as many things as I can from the MacBook to the iPad. I'm looking forward to my new iPad and iOS 11 for what they will bring in improvements. Keep these types of articles coming as I like to hear how others face and adjust to this transition to more mobile devices. 0 22 hours ago Reply doctrsnoop replacing MBA battery is really easy. costs less than 40 dollars and good as new. check ifixit for visuals but it's basically unscrew the bottom with pentalobe screwdriver(included with most battery replacement kits) pull out the old , reinsert new, replace cover. Can replace the SSD same way, can get more capacity/speed and reinstalling macOS will speed things up too. 0 22 hours ago Reply n8ter#AC An iPad Pro 10.5" with 128GB Storage, Apple Pencil and Keyboard Accessory is about the same price as a MacBook Air with 128GB Storage, 8GB RAM, a Better CPU, and better battery life. Replacing batteries don't matter. Batteries wear down in all mobile devices... iPads included. That is a complete non-factor. I'll take the MacBook Air any day over the iPad, personally. I remember getting an iPad and returning it within a day to get a MBA, because it seemed totally worthless to me. Then I returned the MBA after 2 days, just kept my Windows Laptop, and got an iMac because I didn't have a desktop. I didn't see any huge benefits over a MBA over my Windows Laptop, but since Continuity and Hand-Off were a thing, and I had an iPhone (but no desktop), I got the iMac. So yea... Even the fact that it was way cheaper than a MBA (at that time), and less than half the price of the iMac... I still couldn't be bothered with it. The guy in the Apple Store told me he uses his iPad like a PC. My Response: "I'm not even sure how such a thing could be possible." And I'm still not, because for the type of stuff I do on a PC, you cannot use an iPad. I found that out, very quickly. The types of people who can replace a PC with an iPad can probably save a lot of money by simply getting an 11" ChromeBook instead... 0 20 hours ago Reply jmush I'd like to coin ADDP. Apple Device Decision Paralysis. We've reached a point where deciding between a new Mac and iPad Pro is really difficult and it leaves me with no idea on how to move forward, so I don't buy anything. I think there are a lot of us in this boat where we have aging Macs and are unsure about where we should be spending our money. Having an iPhone, Mac, and iPad was an easy justification before the iPad was still a clear accessory device and priced as one ($499). An iPad Pro with a Smart Keyboard is $800 at the lowest. You are now approaching PC/Mac pricing territory. Add a Pencil and you are at $900 to start. This pricing implies that Apple doesn't think users will be buying iPad Pro's AND a Mac. The 9.7 2017 iPad is now the 'accessory iPad' for Mac/PC users at $329.. So here I am with a 2010 iMac and an iPad Air 2, and I'm wondering what my next purchase will be. Should I buy an iPad Pro and just ride my Mac out until it dies? I don't think I'm ready for an iOS-only life. But dropping $1200-$1500 on a new Mac feels weird in 2017 when iOS has come so far. I'm stuck. ADDP guys. ADDP. 0 20 hours ago Reply _incanter_ How did you manage to connect DropBox, OneDrive and Google Drive to FIles?

Last week we reported that a slew of world records had been broken by Intel's latest and greatest Core-X series processors. Earlier today I heard from Gigabyte boasting about numerous new OC records. However, when I checked its headline benchmark boast of pushing an Intel Core i7-7740K to 7,500MHz had already been trumped by Der8auer (who achieved 7,562.25MHz on Liquid Helium) using an Asus motherboard… Now G.Skill has pinged me an email with another impressive new record, this time, of course, for memory speed world records. The performance PC memory and gaming peripherals maker has claimed a DDR4 RAM speed world record. As verified by HWBot, Taiwan's Toppc has pushed a G.Skill memory module to DDR4 5,500MHz. Last year at Computex Toppc broke the DDR4 5,000MHz barrier using G.Skill memory and an MSI Z170I Gaming Pro AC motherboard. This year he returned to the G.Skill sponsored world record stage at Computex to top 5,500Mhz. Of course hardware is upgraded this year. Toppc made the most of new tech delivered by the combination of an MSI X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC motherboard, and an Intel Core i7-7740X Kaby Lake-X processor. Supplementary tech details shared by G.Skill are that the Trident Z DDR4 memory modules that broke these speed records used Samsung 8Gb ICs. If you didn't guess already, Liquid Nitrogen came into play for keeping things running cool under extreme conditions. G.Skill fully expects the current records to topple shortly due to the "amazing overclocking potential" of the newly released hardware.

The revised hardware was accompanied by the announcement of macOS “High Sierra,” the next version of Apple’s desktop operating system set to launch later this year. Apple unveiled the new products at its WWDC developers event earlier in the week. It has since detailed them with official pages on its website and posts in its newsroom. 2017 iMac Range Apple said the updated iMac range is supposed to set the “gold standard” for desktop computers. After being criticized for appearing to neglect its most powerful products, Apple has debuted a comprehensive set of upgrades for the entire line-up. The company is intending to reclaim its favor with professional audiences. The iMac now comes with Intel’s latest seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors. Specifications will vary by model, but you can expect clock speeds of up to 4.2GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz. The processor is accompanied by a brand-new Radeon Pro graphics card from AMD’s recently launched RX 500-series. According to Apple, graphics performance on the new iMacs is up to three times greater than the outgoing models. [Image by Apple] Further changes to the internals include a 50 percent faster solid state drive and the inclusion of a Thunderbolt 3 port. This allows the transfer of power, data and monitor connections using a single cable. Apple is one of the main adopters of the Thunderbolt standard as opposed to standard USB-C, though it should be noted that Thunderbolt 3 uses the USB-C connector. While it’s not so widespread, Thunderbolt is a capable connection with fittingly high performance. Although the new components are significant, Apple hasn’t been content to stop at what’s inside. It has also upgraded the most visible element of the iMac, its large and vibrant display. The company said it is now better than ever with brightness up by 43 percent and the available color palette expanded to include 1 billion distinct shades. macOS High Sierra The new hardware is designed to work best with macOS High Sierra, Apple’s upcoming macOS update which will be released later this year. As with the new Macs themselves, High Sierra focuses primarily on the internals. There are a few surface-level tweaks and minor features added throughout but most of the development has been under-the-hood. Apple is launching a new robust file system, imaginatively called Apple File System. It will gradually replace HFS on new Mac PCs. Apple said it’s a faster and safer way to store files, offering “instantaneous” basic storage operations and safeguards against common causes of data loss. These include protections against unexpected power loss incidents, keeping your files secure if you’re stuck during a blackout. Apple has also added virtual reality support. For the first time, developers will be able to use the Mac to create and view virtual reality content. Later this year, Valve will bring its SteamVR VR gaming platform to the Mac, letting players experience virtual worlds without having to use Windows. This milestone launch of Mac-based virtual reality goes hand-in-hand with the graphical performance improvements of the new iMacs. [Image by Apple] High Sierra comes with some more immediate changes too. Siri is more advanced and has an “expressive” voice, Safari includes a built-in autoplaying ad blocker and search in Mail is faster and more relevant. Spotlight search can show you details of flights you’re tracking and iCloud now lets you share files to collaborate with others. These improvements are relatively basic as Apple has clearly dedicated its time to creating the big architectural leaps that High Sierra is introducing. The smaller tweaks to the interface will help to make Mac easier and more convenient to use every day and are likely to be welcomed by users. Apple said it has concentrated on the internals of the OS this year so it can “push the Mac forward” in the future. [Image by Apple] “macOS High Sierra delivers important forward-looking technologies and new opportunities for developers wanting to tap into the power of machine learning and create immersive VR content on the Mac,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “The core technology innovations in macOS High Sierra, combined with our advances in hardware, will continue to push the Mac forward in exciting new ways.” The new iMac models are available to pre-order now and will start shipping next week. Pricing varies by configuration and region. Apple has also launched a new set of MacBook laptops if you’re more interested in purchasing a mobile-first device. macOS High Sierra is available now as a developer preview to members of the Apple Developer Program. A public beta will launch later this month before the update is released to existing devices in the fall. It will support all Mac desktops and laptops currently running last year’s Sierra release.

You can watch it live on CSPAN and also set up alerts for when it airs. Comey will be responding to questions from the 19 member Intel committee - 10 Republicans side and 9 Democrats. FBI Director James Comey testifies before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on "Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 3, 2017. Reuters Included in this committee are California Senator Kamala Harris, a young and upcoming Senator from Arkansas Tom Cotton seen as a strong 2020 candidate and Marco Rubio who fought in the Presidential primaries against Trump. “I am hopeful that he (Comey) will clarify for the American people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media,” Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said on the Comey hearing. The hearing begins 10 am EST but all news networks and CSPAN will be live from at least 30 minutes before the hearing begins. The 10 am hearing is public and the next one at 1pm is behind closed doors. Big question - which senator will leak details of the closed door hearing? That's the hottest news beat on Thursday evening. Trump fired Comey on the evening of May 9, via an email and letter sent to the FBI. Comey was away in the US West Coast when he saw the news on telly and thought it was a joke. Soon after, the Washington Post and New York Times scooped devastating stories that said Trump revealed top secret information with the Russians in the White House and that Trump asked Comey to drop the Russia probe - a charge could amount to obstruction of justice, if proven. The Thursday session will start with a customary set of opening remarks as always followed by a question-and-answer session with members of the Senate panel. Totally at ease in the spotlight, Comey has testified in Congress twice earlier this year and both times, he delivered Page One headlines provoking Trump to call him a “showboat”. Comey has refuted Trump’s claims in public more than once. Most recently, he said on record that Trump’s claims of Obama wiretapping Trump Tower are false, he has also confirmed that the FBI was indeed investigating Russia’s links to the Trump campaign - in effect refuting Trump’s claims that Russia is fake news. #Comey#Comeyhearing#Comeymemo#Russia#Trump Published Date: Jun 08, 2017 12:06 am | Updated Date: Jun 08, 2017 12:06 am Also See The James Comey testimony is sensational, the showdown is still on at 10 am Thursday James Comey testimony: Will great journalism, that scooped FBI chief's memos, bring down Donald Trump?

In the remarks, Comey revealed Trump requested his "loyalty" on multiple occasions. Trump, according to the remarks, also told Comey he hoped he could let go of the controversy surrounding former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. BREAKING: Senate Intel Committee releases former FBI Director Comey's prepared testimony. https://t.co/8UupHPDBNs (1/2) pic.twitter.com/jMYrLQcTfa — ABC News (@ABC) June 7, 2017 "A few moments later, the President said, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,'" Comey said of a one-on-one Jan. 27 dinner in the White House’s Green Room, during which Trump asked him if he wanted to stay on as head of the FBI. "I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner." Comey's last contact with Trump, according to the prepared statement, occurred on the morning of April 11: On the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I "get out" that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that "the cloud" was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel. He said he would do that and added, "Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know." I did not reply or ask him what he meant by "that thing." I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended.  Comey also clarified that his practice of keeping written records of one-on-one conversations with Trump was not the norm. "This had not been my practice in the past," Comey said. "I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone) – once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions." In just four months, Trump and Comey had nine one-on-one conversations, including six over the phone.

Case in point: today’s Senate Intel hearing, where she repeatedly interrupted Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as he attempted to answer her question about why special counsel Robert Mueller cannot be fired. Committee Chairman Richard Burr eventually got so fed up with her inability to keep her mouth closed that he suspended her from speaking. Oof.

The motherboard manufacturer's in-house overclocker HiCookie and his five-person team spent the hours of the show rocketing an Intel Core i7-7740K past 7.5 GHz and setting four new 3DMark records. The team used liquid helium at -220° C, a Corsair AX 1500i power supply, and one of the Gigabyte's own X299-SOC Champion motherboards to set the records. The 7.5 GHz CPU clock speed record was achieved using a Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 4333 MT/s memory kit, while the 3DMark records were set using G.Skill's Trident Z 3600C17 memory modules and a pair of Gigabyte Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards. The CPU clock speed record is the headline news, but the team also set records of 356,678 points in 3DMark03, 737,222 in Aquamark, 71,928 in 3DMark06 with one GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, and 71,176 in 3DMark06 with two GTX 1080 Ti cards.

(AMD) Stock Is Heading to $15 Richard Saintvilus InvestorPlace June 7, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Should Be Takeover BaitMore InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Shares of semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) skyrocketed as much as 8% on Tuesday on twice their average volume, reaching a session high of $12.24. The run in AMD stock was riven by a combination of factors, including winning chip placement in Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) new line of iMac Pros. View photos Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)More Source: Shutterstock But if you’re thinking about locking in those gains in AMD stock, think again. Although there has been fear that chip rivals Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) would chip away at Advanced Micro’s recovery, those fears now seem overstated. With gains coming in from its major revenue segments, AMD stock now has a direct line towards my year-end target of $15 per share, delivering 25% returns. Beyond the upcoming launch its Naples chip in the second quarter, AMD now has two strong catalysts to keep the shares soaring. Reasons to Love Advanced Micro Devices Now Apple’s refreshed 21.5- and 27-inch iMacs — which Apple promises is the “most powerful Mac ever made” — are set to ship in December and will start at $4,999. (That’s not a typo.) 8 No-Brainer Retirement Stocks to Buy Apple also referred the new iMac’s graphics as the “most advanced graphics ever in a Mac.” That’s a nice plug for Advanced Micro, whose Radeon Vega graphics chips will power the PCs. This could potentially increase AMD’s desktop volumes by 60%. Advanced Micro Devices is making moves suggesting it no longer want to play second fiddle to neither Intel or Nvidia. However, AMD has also become popular in a few emerging areas, such as cryptocurrencies like bitcoin — which has seen its value rise 200% this year and surged more than 8% on Tuesday, nearing $3,000. View photos “We are seeing solid demand for our Polaris-based offerings in the gaming and newly resurgent cryptocurrency mining markets based on the strong performance we are delivering,” an AMD spokesperson told CNBC on Tuesday. “The gaming market remains our priority.” Miners for cryptocurrencies use graphic cards from companies like AMD to mine virtual coins that can be sold or saved. And it now seems that Advanced Micro, which is seeing increased demand for its graphic cards, has begun to enjoy the cryptocurrency-related gains that rival Nvidia has already enjoyed. That’s to say nothing about the company’s computing and graphics segment, which now accounts for more than 60% of revenues, and grew almost 30% year-over-year last quarter. While AMD did disappoint investors by issuing weak Q2 guidance, fundamentally, the company is operating on its stated objectives.     And with Advanced Micro enjoying higher average selling prices in both the Client segment and GPUs, AMD is poised to not only beat its Q2 guidance, but could raise its forecast for the third quarter and rest of the year. After all, strength in Apple’s iMacs and cryptocurrencies have not yet been factored in its forecasts. Bottom Line for AMD Stock Looking ahead, not only is the company projected to swing to a 7-cent profit this year, but earnings are projected to accelerate next year by 328% to 30 cents per share. Go Long Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock With Confidence And while investors were spooked by conservative Q2 guidance, that’s been a part of the management’s strategy: setting expectations to over-deliver. All told, there is still plenty to like about AMD stock, even at fairly lofty valuations. Aside from the recent launch its Naples chip, Advanced Micro will also launch its two other Zen-based chips, which should sustain the recent strength in average selling prices. As such, my crystal ball maintains that AMD will regain $15 per share, yielding 25% returns from current levels. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. Related More From InvestorPlace Wednesday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc.

Kamala Harris Questions Rod Rosenstein (MSNBC: June 7, 2017)    Burr Suspends Kamala Harris During Senate Intel Hearing [VIDEO] Amber Athey 1:01 PM 06/07/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) brutally suspended Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) from speaking during the Senate Intel hearing when she refused to let assistant attorney general Rod Rosenstein answer any questions. Rosenstein was trying to explain why special counsel Robert Mueller cannot be fired by the president when Harris cut him off. “Sir, if I may, the greater assurance is not that you and I believe in Mueller’s integrity…it is that you would put in writing an indication based on your authority as the acting attorney general that he was full independence,” she said. Rosenstein looked annoyed during her entire question, and started to respond, “He has the full independence as authorized by those regulations,” before Harris stopped him again. Burr wasn’t interested in allowing Harris to continue to interrupt the witnesses and cut off her speaking time so Rosenstein could finish his response. “The senator will suspend. The chair is going to exercise his right to allow the witness to answer the question,” Burr said to eye rolls from Harris. “The committee is on notice to provide the witnesses the courtesy, which has not been extended all the way across, extend the courtesy for questions to get answered.” “Mr. Chairman, respectfully, I would like to point out that this witness…” Harris started yet again. “Mr. Rosenstein, will you … the senator will suspend. Mr. Rosenstein, would you like to fully answer the question?” Burr offered. WATCH: Rosenstein looked relieved to finally have speaking time, and responded, “the truth is, I have a lot of experience with these issues and I could speak for a very long time about it.” Follow Amber on Twitter Tags: Kamala Harris, Richard Burr Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Trending Popular Emailed James Comey’s Prepared Remarks Ahead Of His Testimony Thursday WaPo Takes Anonymous Sourcing To A Whole New Level In Latest Obstruction Story EXCLUSIVE: Obama Never Warned State Election Officials Of Russian Election ‘Hacking’ Watch Jon Ossoff Lose The Entire Special Election Debate In Less Than Four Minutes [VIDEO] The Internet Is Losing It Over a Passage From Hillary Clinton’s Book Evoking Slavery Imagery Top Intel Community Officials Deny That Trump Pressured Them On Russia Probe Watch Jon Ossoff Lose The Entire Special Election Debate In Less Than Four Minutes [VIDEO] NY Times Rewrites History Calling The 1967 War ‘Accidental’ Comey Never Kept Detailed Memos On Conversations He Had With Barack Obama Obama, The President Who Said He Had A ‘Pen And Phone,’ Warns Of Appeal Of Authoritarianism New Documents Reveal How Obama’s Middle East Peace Negotiations Collapsed SMACKDOWN: FNC’s Sean Hannity Cracks On MSNBC’s Joe And Mika Piers Morgan Slams London Mayor On Terrorism, ‘Where Are They?’ [VIDEO] Comey Told Trump He Was Not Under Investigation Dershowitz: Trump Could Have Just Pardoned Flynn [VIDEO] Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Emails and Notifications Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

The venture would be the first driverless, on-demand mobility service on public roads in Europe, the companies said in a joint statement. It "will help accelerate the development of commercially viable automated vehicle solutions," Glen De Vos, Delphi senior vice president and chief technology officer, said in a press statement. Delphi brings to the pact a self-driving driving platform that it has been developing with Israeli tech firm Mobileye (MBLY). Mobileye, a global leader in driver assistance cameras and sensors, is being acquired by U.S. chipmaker Intel (INTC). Transdev, a public transport service provider, will contribute its vehicle-routing software, as well as ticketing and dispatch services. The pilot program will start later this year with two minicars in Normandy and one shuttle bus in a suburb of Paris. French automaker Renault will supply Zoe electric minicars for the venture, Reuters reported. The service will initially have "safety" drivers on board but will move quickly to fully driverless operation, remotely controlled by human operators, the companies said. Passengers will be able to plan trip routes and times via phone apps. Delphi's latest partnership builds on a growing network of self-driving alliances among automakers, other auto-related companies and technology giants. Mobileye, Intel and Delphi are working with BMW (BMWYY) on an autonomous vehicle, while Delphi and Mobileye are working on turnkey autonomous systems. Alphabet (GOOGL) autonomous unit Waymo has an alliance with ride-sharing service Lyft, which also has a separate venture with investor General Motors (GM). Alphabet's Waymo is testing its systems with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) Pacifica minivans. Nvidia (NVDA), which supplies chips to Tesla (TSLA) and others, has partnered with Baidu (BIDU). Delphi recently announced plans to sell off its powertrain operations as it focuses on autonomous driving and other next-generation auto technology. Shares of Delphi rose as high as 90.05 but closed down 0.7% at 88.20 on the stock market today.

Heinrich sparks tense exchange with FBI, intel chiefs By Michael Coleman / Journal Washington Bureau Wednesday, June 7th, 2017 at 11:02am .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... Sen. Martin Heinrich In a preview of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s highly anticipated hearing with former FBI Director James Comey on Thursday, Sen. Martin Heinrich today sparked a tense exchange with two of the nation’s top intelligence and law enforcement chiefs about conversations they’d had with Comey and President Donald Trump about ongoing Russia investigations. Meanwhile, Comey’s written statement for tomorrow’s hearing is here. Advertisement Continue reading Today, Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat who sits on the committee, asked Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe if Comey had told him Trump asked for his loyalty. Heinrich then asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats if Trump had asked him to help blunt investigations into his campaign’s relationship with Russia. Both McCabe and Coats refused to answer Heinrich’s questions, leading to testy exchanges. Heinrich’s questioning generated lots of chatter on social media, with CNN contributor Rebecca Berg tweeting that the typically low-key Heinrich is the Intel Committte’s “stealth bomber.” Here’s video of the exchange. And here’s a blow-by-blow transcript of how it went down starting with Heinrich questioning Acting FBI Director McCabe. Heinrich: Did Director Comey ever share details of his conversations with the president with you, and in particular, did Director Comey say the president had asked for his loyalty? McCabe: I’m not going to comment on those conversations. Heinrich: Why not? McCabe: I’m not in a position to talk about conversations that Director Comey may or may not have had with the president. Heinrich: I’m not asking that – I’m asking about conversations you had with Director Comey. Advertisement Continue reading McCabe: Those matter also begin to fall within the scope of issues being investigated by the special counsel and it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment on those today. Heinrich: So, you’re not invoking executive privilege, and obviously, it’s not classified. This is the oversight committee. Why would it not be appropriate for you to share that conversation with us? McCabe: I think I’ll let Director Comey speak for himself tomorrow before this committee. Heinrich: We certainly look forward to that, but I think your unwillingness to share that conversation is an issue. Then Heinrich turned his attention to Coats, a former senator from Indiana. Heinrich: You’ve said it would be inappropriate to answer a simple question about whether the president asked for your assistance in blunting the Russia investigation. I don’t care how you felt, I’m not asking if you felt pressured, I’m simply asking did that conversation occur? Coats: It do believe it is appropriate for me to discuss that in an executive (private not public) session. Heinrich: You do realize – and obviously this is not releasing any classified information – but you do realize how simple it would simply be to say ‘no that never happened.’ Why is it inappropriate Director Coats? Coats: I think conversations between the president and myself are for the most part … Heinrich: You seem to apply that standard selectively. Coats:  No, I’m not applying it selectively. I do not share with the general public conversation I had with the president or many of my colleagues within the administration that I believe should not be shared. Heinrich: I think your unwillingness to answer a very basic question speaks volumes. Coats: It’s not a matter of unwillingness.. Heinrich: It is a matter of unwillingness. Coats: It’s a matter of how I share it and with whom I share it to. When there are ongoing investigations I think it’s in appropriate. Heinrich: You don’t think the American people deserve the answer to that question? Coats: I think the investigations will determine that.   Contact the writer.

Project Wing has now reemerged after taking part in FAA and NASA testing to demonstrate its air traffic control system. Nintendo Switch The Project Wing team showed off its UAS Air Traffic Management (UTM) platform for simultaneously controlling the complex flight paths of multiple drones. Hosted at Virginia Tech, the site of previous Chipotle trials, three Wing aircraft interacted with two Intel drones and a DJI Inspire. The Project Wing drones were picking up and delivering packages, while the other aircraft were conducting search and rescue missions. The UTM platform was able to “automatically manage the flight paths of all these different types of UAS, planning new, clear routes for each aircraft if and when conflicts arise.” This is in stark contrast to operators having to manually steer away from obstacles. The team at Project Wing is focusing its system on: Real-time route planning for UAS that are flying in the same area Notifications to alert operators of any unexpected changes in the aircraft or route during flight Airspace notifications that allow operators to avoid FAA no-fly zones and safety-sensitive areas (for example: forest fires). An airspace restriction that we simulated as part of our testing is shown below. Google Maps, Earth, and Street View are leveraged to create a detailed understanding of the world, while Google Cloud is used to build a control system that can handle the scale while being fast and reliable. Wing is continuing to refine the UTM platform to navigate more complex environments and support more concurrent flights. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Read More , and another slew of brand new Apple products. This year’s WWDC was big for Siri, iPhone owners, and anyone considering the purchase of a new Mac anytime soon. WWDC 2017 was anything but boring, with brand new flagship products and long-overdue updates being announced and demonstrated by Tim Cook, live on stage in San Jose, California. Overwhelmed by it all? You don’t need to be. Here are all of the important announcements from Apple’s 2017 keynote. HomePod The last time Apple produced a speaker, it didn’t go so well. Cupertino is giving it another crack with HomePod, an Amazon Echo-like assistant that includes seven beam-forming tweeters and a custom-made woofer. According to Apple, the speaker scans the space around it to optimize audio. It does this using the same A8 chip Apple used to power iPhones and iPads a few years ago. The addition of AirPlay 2 heralds a new era for Apple’s wireless casting technology, allowing users to manage multiple speakers in different rooms. Advertisement But what’s a connected home speaker without a digital assistant? Siri makes a predictable appearance, allowing you to control music playback with your voice, and ask the usual questions about the weather, your sports team, and personal schedule. Apple seems to be betting big on users buying multiple speakers for around the house, but the HomePod isn’t yet ready to go on sale. HomePod will cost $349 on home turf and goes on sale in December in the U.S., UK, and Australia. Other territories will have to wait until 2018 to get their hands on the HomePod. iOS 11 This year’s iOS announcement was rather a big one. iOS 11 is set to bring hundreds of tweaks and changes, though much of the work takes place under the hood. Expect even more features to be revealed in September at Apple’s iPhone event when we finally see the new hardware. Some of the more obvious changes include a quick-access app drawer for iMessage apps 12 Cool Things You Can Do With iMessage Apps for iOS 12 Cool Things You Can Do With iMessage Apps for iOS You can do a lot more than simply send text, voice, picture, and video messages with iMessage. Read More , and Apple Pay integration How To Use Apple Pay To Buy Things With Your iPhone How To Use Apple Pay To Buy Things With Your iPhone Your iPhone may some day be the only device you need to purchase products and services, but first you need to start using Apple Pay. Read More right in the Messages app. Money received via Apple Pay is added to your wallet. You can then spend this freely anywhere Apple Pay is accepted, deposit it into your bank account, or send it on to other contacts. One of the most exciting changes concerns Control Center, Apple’s quick settings adjustment menu which is accessed by swiping upwards from the bottom of your screen. The new Control Center is completely customizable, with all of your oft-used functions on a single screen. Siri has a new natural-sounding voice, context-aware responses that use criteria like location and calendar appointments, and real-time sentence translation. This is just the tip of the iceberg, as there are further updates to Maps, iPad-specific enhancements, and more. Check back with us for the full list changes to iOS 11 and macOS before its Q3 launch. MacOS 10.13 High Sierra High Sierra is the name of Apple’s next desktop operating system, continuing the California-centric naming convention. There aren’t many outward-facing changes to macOS 10.13 that are immediately noticeable outside of an overhauled Safari. Apple’s browser is getting tighter privacy controls, ditching autoplaying videos, and further enhancements to performance and power efficiency. Photos is also seeing some much-needed improvements with a reworked sidebar, better organization tools, expanded editing tools like curves and color isolation The Best Free & Paid Image Editors for Mac OS X The Best Free & Paid Image Editors for Mac OS X We thought it was about time we compiled a list of our favourite raster image editors for Mac OS X. Read More , an expanded Memories feature, and better face detection. Many of Siri’s changes, like improved elocution, are also included in the macOS implementation too. We’ll also see the usual iterative changes to longstanding features, like a smarter Spotlight search Search More Efficiently In Mac OS X With Our Top Spotlight Tips Search More Efficiently In Mac OS X With Our Top Spotlight Tips Spotlight has been a killer Mac feature for years, with Cupertino regularly schooling Redmond in the art of desktop search.

We’ll take a look at the full list of High Sierra changes soon, before it launches sometime in Q3 2017. WatchOS 4 Apple has been gradually improving its wearable Apple Watch Series 2 Review Apple Watch Series 2 Review It's Apple's busiest time of year. Not only have we had a brand new iPhone, iOS 10 and macOS Sierra; the Apple Watch has had an update too. Read More over the last few years. WatchOS 4 moves things forward with a few new features, starting with the fancy-looking Siri watch face. The new face displays information that’s personal to you. By monitoring how you use your devices, Apple is using machine-learning to predict what you’ll want to see when you look at your watch. This may include traffic information, the weather, sports results, your schedule, and anything else Apple can harvest to make your life a little easier. There are also a few other new faces including a kaleidoscope effect controllable via the digital crown, and new Toy Story watch faces including Buzz, Woody, and Jessie. There are also more personal Activity notifications, improvements to the Workout app, and a better-looking Music implementation. As ever the update will be free, arriving sometime in Q3 alongside iOS 11 and macOS 10.13. A New iMac Pro & Other Updates Apple’s long overdue hardware refresh Why You Shouldn't Buy a Desktop Mac Right Now Why You Shouldn't Buy a Desktop Mac Right Now The Mac isn’t going anywhere any time soon. Read More  has finally started rolling out, with the arrival of a brand new iMac Pro. The machine features a brooding space grey finish with matching keyboard and mouse, and features the most powerful hardware ever seen in an Apple computer. Power-users can grab the new machine in 8, 10, or 18 core Intel Xeon varieties, with speeds of up to 4.5GHz achievable using Intel’s Turbo Boost technology. A Radeon Pro Vega graphics card with up to 16GB of VRAM, and a maximum RAM capacity of 128GB goes some way toward justifying the $4,999 starting price. For the rest of us, Apple has also updated its regular iMac line with Intel’s new Kaby Lake CPU architecture, brand new graphics chips across the range, and a 43 percent brighter display. The MacBook and MacBook Pro ranges will also see Kaby Lake processors and faster SSDs. Introducing the 10.5 inch iPad Pro Instead of updating the 9.7 inch iPad Pro Powerful Things, Small Packages: iPad Pro 9.7" Review Powerful Things, Small Packages: iPad Pro 9.7" Review For some people, a 12.9" screen is the main draw of Apple's first iPad Pro.

Battery life is still rated for 10 hours, with quoted 30% and 40% improvements over the previous model to processor and graphics speeds respectively. Apple is heavily pushing the iPad Pro as an alternative to cheap Windows laptops Regular iPad or iPad Pro? How to Pick the Right Apple Tablet Regular iPad or iPad Pro? How to Pick the Right Apple Tablet The iPad Air is no more, leaving only the regular iPad and two Pro models. So which should you buy? Read More , with tablet-specific improvements to its mobile OS included in iOS 11. And Everything Else Expect more details to emerge about the upcoming iOS and macOS updates as the beta programs go live, and we finally get our hands on Apple’s hard work. Remember — this is just the announcement stage, and despite a few hardware announcements WWDC is traditionally all about software, developers, and the ecosystem as a whole; rather than individual devices. We’ll have to wait until late September to know more about Apple’s planned release schedules, though you can usually rely on iOS launching first alongside a brand new iPhone at the end of September, with macOS launching roughly a month later. Hardware like the HomePod and new iMac Pro won’t be with us until December, and even then expect demand to push order fulfilment deep into 2018. Which of Apple’s announcements at this year’s WWDC keynote excite you the most? Will you be buying a HomePod?

It has proved so unpopular and outraged so many that so far 1,219 (as per wearestillin.com) states, cities, businesses, and institutes of higher education have promised to abide by the provisions of the accord on their own. The participants “represent 120-million Americans and contribute $6.2 trillion to the US economy.” Among the widely recognized companies that support this move are Apple, eBay, Google, Intel, and Microsoft. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte has often been compared to Trump, and in many ways their behavior and attitudes mirror each other’s, but at least Duterte has seen fit to finally sign the Paris Accord, despite threatening last year to repudiate the Philippines’ commitment to support it. (He claimed that the country needs to further industrialize and that checks on carbon dioxide emissions would stymie economic growth.) The Philippines has vowed as its contribution to the Paris Agreement to bring its carbon emissions down by 70 percent by 2030, with carbon dioxide reductions to be made in the sectors of energy, forestry, industry, transport, and waste. However, the implementation of national development targets and mitigation initiatives is contingent on many factors, including funding, external assistance, and the buildup of capacity, capability, and technology transfers to support adaptation, mitigation, and other risk management measures. The question is, are we doing enough, fast enough? The Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands, is one of twenty countries most vulnerable to climate change. Climate trends including an increase in the global average temperature and a rise in sea level will have a significant impact on certain geographical areas such as coastal areas, which may experience flooding, changes in water temperature and acidity, and so on, impacting marine life and habitat. The devastation wrought by the storm surges of Super Typhoon “Haiyan” (“Yolanda”) is only one of the many manifestations of this phenomenon and a harbinger of things to come, should the world fail in its efforts to stem global warming. Climactic effects including an increase in extreme local weather events, such as hurricanes, monsoons, typhoons, torrential rain, or longer dry periods and more frequent heat waves, are likely to be evident very quickly in the sectors of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. The consequent negative consequences on farming are damage to crops, forestry stands, orchards, buildings and equipment, floods, loss of harvests, erosion, and human casualties. There will be a corresponding increase in the cost of food, forage, and biofuel crops as well as timber. Rising sea levels will cause flooding, forcing relocation of inhabitants and causing swamping of agricultural lands. On the fisheries side, warmer waters contributed to the death of a quarter of the world’s coral reefs in the past few decades. Coral reefs are habitats of many kinds of fish and marine organisms, and many of these have died as a result of warmed waters. Warming can also cause changes in the length of the season, and may impact mating habits of fish and other marine creatures. Seawater is becoming more acidic due to carbon dioxide dissolving in the oceans. This has impact on coral reefs, other marine habitats, and on marine life in general. In developing countries such as the Philippines, where a significant number of the population derive their livelihood or food from farming and fishing and its related activities, there are anticipated to be heavy negative effects due to climate change over the medium- and long-term.  Our commitment to the Paris Accord is a step in the right direction, but the urgency of the threats from climate change, in view of our country’s vulnerability, cannot be overemphasized. There are many ways that Filipinos can help the effort as individuals and communities. For one, industrialization can still be ramped up, but with the responsible use of clean energy sources, particularly solar. Tree-planting movements popular during the 1970s should be brought back and efforts redoubled. To ensure food security, people should plant vegetables and fruit trees rather than ornamentals. On this issue, Trump may have made the wrong decision, but some Americans are acting to save their country as best they can. We are more fortunate in that Duterte has seen the wisdom of partnering with the rest of the world to stem the threat of climate change. But the important work is still ahead of us, and we are running out of time. ***  Dr. Ortuoste is a California-based writer.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Editorials Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Editorials Thu, Jun 08, 2017 - Page 8　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp US’ Paris exit holds benefits for Taiwan By Huang Tien-lin 黃天麟 On Thursday last week US President Donald Trump announced that the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement. The decision has sparked ire in the international community and drawn criticism from many Americans. Before the announcement, many leading US companies — including Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Google and Tesla — had urged the Trump administration to stay in the agreement. Why did Trump insist on quitting the Paris agreement, despite opposition from major US corporations whose support he needs to bring manufacturing back to the US? There must be reasons to make him believe upsetting them is worth it. In his speech announcing the withdrawal, Trump said that the agreement, although beneficial to many countries, is not good for the US and its workers. He said the accord allows China increased carbon emissions in the next 13 years — that is, by 2030, China has to reduce its carbon emissions to 60 to 65 percent of its 2005 emissions, but because its economy is growing rapidly, it can in fact increase its emissions — but requires the US to significantly reduce its carbon emissions, although it provides 30 percent of the agreement’s funding. Despite China’s attempts to assume global leadership, when it comes to making international agreements, it always demands to be treated as a developing country to obtain better terms. For example, China joined the WTO in 2000 as a developing country and therefore avoided all the international obligations of developed economies. It has taken the same approach to issues such as trade liberalization and globalization. As an authoritarian country with a state capitalist economy, China has managed to enjoy all the benefits of globalization while continuing to practice blatant protectionism. In the Paris agreement, China has also tried to pass the main responsibility of reducing carbon emissions to the US by claiming that its carbon emissions per capita are far below those of other developing countries, despite having the highest carbon emissions in the world. The US’ decision to back out of the Paris agreement has implications for Taiwan. First, it is clear that Trump views China as the US’ primary economic and military competitor and threat, and he is clearly unhappy about China benefiting from US concessions in the Paris agreement. Second, Trump, who deeply believes in his own campaign slogan to “make America great again,” will place even more emphasis on Taiwan’s importance to US national security. In addition, only a strong US will be able to protect Taiwan. Third, if Taiwan can improve its economic ties with the US, the Trump administration will also place more emphasis on the nation’s economic stability. Fourth, Taiwan also has a serious problem with its high carbon emissions. The US’ decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement will lighten the pressure on Taiwan to reduce its carbon emissions, which will be helpful to the nation’s plan to phase out nuclear power by 2025. Some have said that the US’ decision provides an opportunity for China to become the new leader in the fight against climate change. To that, the White House simply responded: “Fine.” The aim of this article is not to analyze whether Trump made the right decision to quit the agreement — that will be left to other experts to investigate and discuss — but at the very least, the decision is not necessarily bad news for Taiwan. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 877 times.

Stock Don’t sell Qualcomm on irrational fears regarding its mobile chip business, antitrust woes, and the NXP deal not closing. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jun 7, 2017 at 12:20PM Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) 10% decline since the beginning of the year was disappointing, especially when compared to the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index's gain of more than 20% during the same period. Many investors have since turned bearish on the stock, due to the seemingly endless barrage of bad news and weak growth forecasts for the year. There are certainly reasons to sell Qualcomm after its lackluster performance, but I believe that investors shouldn't do so based on the following three bear cases. Image source: Qualcomm. 1. The headwinds facing its mobile chip business Qualcomm's mobile chip business, which generates most of its revenue, has been ceding market share to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from OEMs like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, and Huawei. The bears claim that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the bears often ignore two key facts. First, Qualcomm's top-tier Snapdragon SoCs are still considered the industry standard for mobile chipsets. That's why flagship devices like Samsung's Galaxy S8 and Sony's Xperia XZ Premium both use its high-end Snapdragon 835 processor. Samsung's Galaxy S8. Image source: Samsung. Second, Qualcomm is expanding its Snapdragon lineup to adjacent markets -- including drones, connected cars, action cameras, wearables, Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets, and data centers. These variant Snapdragon chipsets should gradually diversify Qualcomm's chipmaking business away from smartphones over the next few years. 2. Its ugly battles with regulators and other tech companies Many recent headlines about Qualcomm focus on its ongoing battles with antitrust regulators and major tech companies across the world. These parties allege that Qualcomm leverages its portfolio of wireless patents to squeeze out high royalty fees from OEMs while forcing smaller chipmakers out of the mobile market. Qualcomm was already fined in China, and it agreed to lower its royalty fees for Chinese OEMs; and South Korea, where it's currently appealing the fine. It also faces similar probes in the U.S., Taiwan, and Europe. Intel and Samsung recently sided with the FTC in the U.S., while Apple sued Qualcomm in the U.S. and China over unpaid rebates from their exclusive partnership. The bears claim that this growing mess will cut deeply into Qualcomm's bottom line, since the high-margin patent licensing business generates the lion's share of its profits. Re-negotiations of the fees could certainly crimp Qualcomm's near-term earnings growth, but it's unlikely to cripple the entire business since the chipmaker still legally owns these SEPs (standard essential patents). Qualcomm can also still use cost-cutting strategies and buybacks to offset any major bottom line declines. 3. Fear of the NXP deal not closing Qualcomm's solution to both these problems is to buy Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) for $47 billion. This megamerger will make Qualcomm the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world and diversify its chipmaking business into the personal security, industrial, and consumer electronics markets -- thus reducing Qualcomm's overall exposure to the mobile market. NXP's BlueBox platform for driverless cars. Image source: NXP. The NXP purchase would also bolster Qualcomm's patent portfolio with patents for automotive chips, NFC (near-field communications) technologies used for mobile payments, and wireless charging technologies. This would enable Qualcomm to collect more royalties from mobile devices, and counter the argument that its method of collecting royalties on the price of an entire device (as opposed to just the 3G/4G components) is unfair. It would also give it plenty of legal leverage in its ongoing licensing battles against regulators and other tech companies. The bears warn that the NXP deal could be blocked due to those probes and lawsuits. However, the deal was already approved in the U.S. and will likely be approved in Europe by June 9. The only market where it faces resistance is China, where the MOFCOM (Ministry of Finance and Commerce) might demand certain divestitures before approving the deal. However, there's no indication that MOFCOM plans to kill the deal -- so it would be silly to sell Qualcomm on concerns that the NXP deal won't close. The key takeaways Qualcomm still faces plenty of near-term headwinds, but the stock's low valuation and high dividend should limit its downside potential. The stock trades at 20 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 26 for semiconductor companies. Its 3.7% dividend yield is much higher than the S&P 500's average yield of 2%. As an investor, Qualcomm has tested my patience many times before. But to sell the stock on negative news without regard for the NXP deal, its low valuation, and its dividend would be foolish. So for now, the best move for Qualcomm investors is to simply sit tight and wait for the NXP deal to close. Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

(CMG) Stock View All Posts Technology momentum has been unstoppable in 2017. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of those stocks that have left almost no attractive points of entry from the long side. If you waited for a dip to buy MU stock, you likely missed most of the move. Source: Mike Deal via Flickr When momentum stocks rally this fast, they perpetually appear at the verge of a dip. This causes most investors to wait for that dip, but it rarely comes. That’s why I use options to trade the likes of Micron stock. There, I can virtually eliminate the need to be surgical with my timing. Case in point? I shared a trade on MU a few weeks ago that has already delivered profits. Thing is, it’s a trade I have repeated several times, always with a safety net. All of my trades on MIcron, regardless of timing, had a margin of error larger than 10%! I don’t like to chase price targets, but I do like to sell risk against what others fear. This allows me to generate income out of thin air — as long as my homework is solid. Fundamentally, MU stock isn’t cheap. Its price-to-earnings ratio is three times that of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). And unlike Intel, Micron doesn’t pay dividends. So although Micron is setting up bullishly, it’s not a slam dunk. Click to Enlarge Technically speaking, it’s hard to discern much from rising wedges as steep as the ones Micron stock is scrawling out. But we can say that it’s vulnerable to dips. My bullish trades would have to have room for error. This eliminates buying shares at face value, where I have no buffer. Today, I’ll show you an options trade that will allow you to effectively join the bullish herd, but from a position of relative safety. I’ll do that by identifying reliable support levels against which I can sell risk for income. How to Trade MU Stock My thesis: Although Micron has come too far too fast, its gains are not without merit. The future prospects for the sector are rosy given the evolution of our world. So timing aside, Micron shares are a buy for the long-term. Any bearish price pattern argument is only valid for the short term, and therein lies the opportunity: I sell risk against the extreme bearish scenario that is not likely to come. The bet: Sell the MU Oct $24 put and collect 55 cents per contract to open. Here I have an 80% theoretical chance of success, but if price falls below my strike, I will suffer losses below $23.5. Selling options outright is risky, so it’s not suitable for all investors. For more risk-averse traders, use bull spreads where risk is more limited. Furthermore, Micron reports earnings in a couple of weeks, and the reaction to those can sometimes be huge. If I sell naked puts on MU stock, I could buy 6/30 $24 sacrifice puts to temporarily guard against the crash scenario. Learn how to generate income from options here.

View All Posts Shares of semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) skyrocketed as much as 8% on Tuesday on twice their average volume, reaching a session high of $12.24. The run in AMD stock was riven by a combination of factors, including winning chip placement in Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) new line of iMac Pros. Source: Shutterstock But if you’re thinking about locking in those gains in AMD stock, think again. Although there has been fear that chip rivals Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) would chip away at Advanced Micro’s recovery, those fears now seem overstated. With gains coming in from its major revenue segments, AMD stock now has a direct line towards my year-end target of $15 per share, delivering 25% returns. Beyond the upcoming launch its Naples chip in the second quarter, AMD now has two strong catalysts to keep the shares soaring. Reasons to Love Advanced Micro Devices Now Apple’s refreshed 21.5- and 27-inch iMacs — which Apple promises is the “most powerful Mac ever made” — are set to ship in December and will start at $4,999. (That’s not a typo.) Apple also referred the new iMac’s graphics as the “most advanced graphics ever in a Mac.” That’s a nice plug for Advanced Micro, whose Radeon Vega graphics chips will power the PCs. This could potentially increase AMD’s desktop volumes by 60%. Advanced Micro Devices is making moves suggesting it no longer want to play second fiddle to neither Intel or Nvidia. However, AMD has also become popular in a few emerging areas, such as cryptocurrencies like bitcoin — which has seen its value rise 200% this year and surged more than 8% on Tuesday, nearing $3,000. “We are seeing solid demand for our Polaris-based offerings in the gaming and newly resurgent cryptocurrency mining markets based on the strong performance we are delivering,” an AMD spokesperson told CNBC on Tuesday. “The gaming market remains our priority.” Miners for cryptocurrencies use graphic cards from companies like AMD to mine virtual coins that can be sold or saved. And it now seems that Advanced Micro, which is seeing increased demand for its graphic cards, has begun to enjoy the cryptocurrency-related gains that rival Nvidia has already enjoyed. That’s to say nothing about the company’s computing and graphics segment, which now accounts for more than 60% of revenues, and grew almost 30% year-over-year last quarter. While AMD did disappoint investors by issuing weak Q2 guidance, fundamentally, the company is operating on its stated objectives.

The company is preparing a new workstation-class version of the all-in-one PC aimed squarely at professional users. It's a response to previous criticism of its "pro" devices. Apple has historically attracted professional users in the photography, video and programming industries as some of its most devoted customers. Over the past couple of years, this has changed though, owing to Apple's apparent abandonment of its most high-end products. The devices that have appeared, such as the MacBook Pro, have failed to resonate with professional audiences. Branding aside, many former fans have suggested Apple has lost sight of what its most demanding users require. In most cases, this isn't a "Touch Bar" secondary display but an SD card slot and several USB ports. iMac Pro 2017 Apple At its WWDC developers conference this week, Apple followed through on previous statements that it's still committed to supporting its professional customers. It unveiled the new iMac Pro, a device which it hopes will convince sceptical consumers that it still knows how to build performance hardware. The 27-inch all-in-one features a 5K display and processors from Intel's Xeon range of server and workstation chips. There'll be options available with up to 18 cores and 22 teraflops of raw graphics power. iMac Pro 2017 Apple This graphical prowess will come from a Radeon Pro Vega GPU, one of AMD's next-generation graphics cards yet to be formally announced. After floundering in the high-end market for years, Apple is returning in a big way, creating a true workstation system for the most hardcore of users. The new iMac Pro has the same basic chassis as the current iMac range. Apple has had to dramatically improve its thermal efficiency and cooling abilities to fit the powerful internals. It has an 80 percent greater cooling capacity and an entirely new architecture for heat distribution. According to Apple, the changes are a "huge step forward" for pro users. iMac Pro 2017 Apple "We’re thrilled to give developers and customers a sneak peek at iMac Pro. This will be our fastest and most powerful Mac ever, which brings workstation-class computing to iMac for the first time," said John Ternus, Apple’s vice president of Hardware Engineering. "We reengineered the whole system and designed an entirely new thermal architecture to pack extraordinary performance into the elegant, quiet iMac enclosure our customers love — iMac Pro is a huge step forward and there’s never been anything like it." Unusually for Apple, the new iMac Pro won't be available until December. Since the company typically puts products on sale mere weeks after they're announced, the Pro's early unveiling implies Apple is trying to appease its disheartened professional customers. If nothing else, Apple is clearly showing that it's now listening to its users, finally building the hardware they've been requesting for years. The company also confirmed a new Mac Pro desktop PC is on the way. It's still early in development and won't appear until next year. In April, the company made the highly irregular move of inviting members of the press to its campus to effectively concede defeat. Apple acknowledged it made missteps with the design of the current Mac Pro which resulted in costly restrictions on the processing power available. It's now returning to the drawing board to build an all-new product, one that should be worthy of its "Pro" name.

Initially, the vehicles will have "safety" drivers on board, but the plan is to move quickly next year to tests of fully driverless vehicles that are remotely controlled and monitored by human operators, he added. Delphi has been building its expertise and capability in self-driving vehicles through partnerships, investments and acquisitions. Several of its affiliates will participate in the project with Transdev, including Ottomatika (vehicle control software), Control-Tec (real-time data analytics) and Movimento (over-the-air software updates). Transdev, a mobility services provider, operates public and private transport services in 19 countries. The company is controlled by Caisse des Depots, an investment arm of the French government. Veolia Environnement SA , the French waste management company, holds a 30-percent stake. sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget The Delphi-Transdev partnership is the latest in a growing web of global alliances aimed at putting self-driving vehicles on the road over the next four years.

Mark WarnerMark WarnerIntelligence Committee Dem to call Comey firing ‘utterly shocking’ The key players to watch at Comey’s hearing today 49 questions for James Comey MORE (D-Va.) said Wednesday that the timing of President Trump’s new FBI director appointment — one day before former FBI Director James Comey is set to publicly testify — is an attempt to “distract attention” from the hearings. "Clearly this is an effort by the president to try to distract attention from our hearings today and our hearings tomorrow,” Warner said on “CBS This Morning.”  ADVERTISEMENT Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said they need to learn why Trump is "trying to back down this investigation.” The Democratic senator pointed to Watergate as a historical lesson of when presidents attempt to thwart or influence an investigation. “If there’s one thing we’ve learned since Watergate, it's not the right role for the president to intervene in an ongoing investigation, particularly when that investigation involves potentially the president and his affiliates," Warner added. The Virginia lawmaker cited the president's attempt to get Comey to "let" go of his investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn as well as other reported activities surrounding the investigation. “Not only do we have reports that the president attempted to intervene with FBI Director James Comey and ask him to back off the investigation of Gen. Flynn, which would be totally inappropriate."

Coats, Rogers, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe are expected to testify before the Senate Intelligence panel on Wednesday, a day before Comey is set to testify publicly. Trump fired Comey from his top investigation post last month amid his agency's ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump announced Wednesday morning he will nominate Christopher Wray to serve as the new FBI director, Comey's successor. "I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI," Trump tweeted. Tags Mark Warner Dan Coats   View the discussion thread.

This is the first attack orchestrated by ISIS in the Islamic Republic, SITE Intel Group reported. It wasn't initially clear if the death count, reported by state broadcaster IRIB, included the attackers. In a rare and stunning move, ISIS released video from inside the parliament building while the attack was under way.  The video, circulated online, shows a gunman and a bloody, lifeless body of a man lying on the ground next to a desk. A voice on the video praises God and says in Arabic: "Do you think we will leave? We will remain, God willing." Another voice repeats the same words. The two appeared to be parroting a slogan used by IS spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, who was killed in Syria last year. The parliament assault ended Wednesday morning with all four attackers there being killed. One of the terrorists blew himself up inside the parliament building, where a session had been in progress, according to a statement carried by Iran state TV. It quoted lawmaker Elias Hazrati as saying the attackers were armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles. An Associated Press reporter saw several police snipers on the rooftops of buildings around parliament. Shops in the area were shuttered, and gunfire could be heard. Witnesses said the attackers were shooting from the fourth floor of the parliament building down at people in the streets below. "I was passing by one of the streets. I thought that children were playing with fireworks, but I realized people are hiding and lying down on the streets," Ebrahim Ghanimi, who was around the parliament building when the assailants stormed in, told The Associated Press. "With the help of a taxi driver, I reached a nearby alley."

Alienware has had their own solution, customized for their own systems, while companies like Intel, AMD, and Razer teamed up to create the XConnect platform last year. We’re finally seeing more OEMs opting for this approach, and HP’s new Omen Accelerator extends it from graphics into other performance areas as well. Unlike other GPU accelerators we’ve seen, the new Omen Accelerator will include a 2.5-inch dock for an SSD and gigabit Ethernet support, with an integrated 500W PSU to support the entire affair. HP has stated that the dock will support GPUs that can draw up to 300W (that likely refers to sustained power draw). It echoes some of the configurations we expected a year ago when AMD’s XConnect first debuted. Four USB ports and a USB-C port are also provided at the rear of the chassis, as shown in the image below: Base price for the Omen Accelerator is $300. While that’s still fairly expensive in the grand scheme of things, it’s lower than what we’ve seen from previous docks from other companies, and it may not be a crazy add if you can afford a high-end laptop from the Omen line in the first place. According to PCWorld, the Omen Accelerator is officially specced to work with the HP Spectre 13, Spectre x360 13, Spectre x360 15, EliteBook x360 1030 G2, Envy 27 All-in-One, and Envy Curved All-in-One. In theory, it should work with any system with Thunderbolt 3, though the degree of support may depend on whether the system’s UEFI has been updated to play nice with external GPUs. Supported GPUs include anything up to the RX 580 from AMD and the GTX 1060 or 1070 from Nvidia. We’d recommend against trying to shove higher-end GPUs into any enclosure that doesn’t officially support them, even if the math seems to work for the power supply. That said, it could be that HP is being cautious, or there could be cooling issues separate from power supply requirements. External enclosures like this should continue to work well even as new GPU generations become available. Much as CPU coolers specified for 125W – 140W can continue to cool multiple CPU generations, PCIe eGPU enclosures specced at 300W should be suitable for multiple GPU generations as well. That may make the purchase easier to swallow for customers — it’s easier to justify an investment like this if you see it as a product with a 5-10 year life expectancy, rather than a per-laptop purchase. With Thunderbolt 3 picking up steam and PCIe 4.0 expected to maintain backwards compatibility with the PCIe 3.0 specification, there should be little worry about these enclosures falling off the roadmap in the medium-to-long term.

In a joint statement, Delphi and Transdev said they will test driverless vehicles in Normandy and outside Paris, in advance of building a commercial service, starting in 2019, that could be deployed in other markets, including North America. It would be the first such commercial application on public roads of fully automated vehicles, they said.

Initially, the vehicles will have "safety" drivers on board, but the plan is to move quickly next year to tests of fully driverless vehicles that are remotely controlled and monitored by human operators, he added. Delphi has been building its expertise and capability in self-driving vehicles through partnerships, investments and acquisitions. Several of its affiliates will participate in the project with Transdev, including Ottomatika (vehicle control software), Control-Tec (real-time data analytics) and Movimento (over-the-air software updates). Transdev, a mobility services provider, operates public and private transport services in 19 countries. The company is controlled by Caisse des Depots, an investment arm of the French government. Veolia Environnement SA , the French waste management company, holds a 30-percent stake. The Delphi-Transdev partnership is the latest in a growing web of global alliances aimed at putting self-driving vehicles on the road over the next four years. In May, German automaker BMW AG announced that Delphi will join it in a self-driving partnership that includes Intel and Mobileye.

The company is looking to raise Rs 450 crore by issuing fresh equity capital through the IPO. The issue will also comprise secondary share sale worth Rs 326 crore. The Tejas IPO plans to cash in on the surge in demand for data services and need to fill the infrastructure gap in the country. “India has little fibre optic connectivity, as telecom providers have traditionally focused on voice rather than data services. However, the amount of traffic on data networks has increased greatly over the past eight or nine months. And, we see a huge opportunity to extend our networks across India," said Sanjay Nayak, managing director and chief executive officer, Tejas Networks. The optical fibre cables market in India is expected to grow at 13% annually till 2021, due to high smartphone penetration and digitisation across platforms. The price band for the offering is fixed at Rs 250-257 per share. The company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) for FY17 stood at Rs 165 crore and net revenue was Rs 865 crore. Axis Capital, Citigroup, Edelweiss and Nomura are the investment banks handling the IPO. US-based Ciena Corporation, Bharti Airtel, Aircel and Bharat Sanchar Nigam are among Tejas’ top clients. Tejas is also one of the companies to provide infrastructure for BharatNet, the government-led initiative that will connect 250,000 villages through broadband. “Outsourcing our manufacturing process while focussing on research and sales has greatly benefitted and helps us to maintain a capital high and asset-light model,” said Nayak. On 5G readiness, Nayak said since their hardware consists of programmable chips, the equipment can support everything from 2G to 5G.Other companies vying for optic fibre markets include Ericsson, Nokia and Huawei.  Read More On Tejas Networks | Ipo | India | Tejas Ipo | Sanjay Nayak | Companies | News PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Cover from Natural Calamities.

The company is looking to raise Rs 450 crore by issuing fresh equity capital through the IPO. The issue will also comprise secondary share sale worth Rs 326 crore. The Tejas IPO plans to cash in on the surge in demand for data services and need to fill the infrastructure gap in the country. “India has little fibre optic connectivity, as telecom providers have traditionally focused on voice rather than data services. However, the amount of traffic on data networks has increased greatly over the past eight or nine months. And, we see a huge opportunity to extend our networks across India," said Sanjay Nayak, managing director and chief executive officer, Tejas Networks. The optical fibre cables market in India is expected to grow at 13% annually till 2021, due to high smartphone penetration and digitisation across platforms. The price band for the offering is fixed at Rs 250-257 per share.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Apple had plenty to offer at the 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). These include mild improvements to the MacBook Pro. Though most of the changes were already expected, one other variant got a slight nudge as well – the MacBook Air. As mentioned in a previous post, the MacBook Pro 2017 hardly carried any surprises outside speculations dished out by analysts and critics. The most notable change was the chipset with the 2017 editions now sporting Intel Kaby Lake SoCs. It may not be much, but it somehow addresses the backlash against the 2016 model. With attention on the HomePod, iOS 11 and other popular Apple devices, most failed to take notice of the MacBook Air. In the official press release, an update to the 13-inch MacBook Air was also revealed, though it was not that striking. The lightweight Apple laptop variant got a 1.8 GHz processor bump, hardly something to cheer about but nevertheless a welcome change.  So what's the big deal with the processor jump for the MacBook Air? As most know, this Apple variant would become the alternative for cash-strapped users. Tech Crunch points out that Apple did introduce a thinner MacBook Pro, though it was still an expensive choice. The reason for that selling point is obviously because the Pro variants have features not present in the MacBook Air line. This means no Retina display, improved storage or even RAM bumps. Seeing that the MacBook Air is still selling well, the Cupertino company may not yet be ready to pull the plug to appease cost-conscious folks. It still comes in handy for folks who prefer to work on a macOS-run device, not to mention something that would be easy to carry. Looking ahead, the MacBook Air may be walking a thin line as far as its future is concerned.  Speaking of the MacBook Pro 2017 variants, the 13-inch version is sold at a curious price of US$1,299 (AU$1,719). Initially, it seemed like a bargain, an ideal option over the 12-inch variant. Factoring in the MacBook Air, it may be possible that Apple is slowly trying to woo customers since the price drop left many befuddled.  There is a chance that Apple may have offered the price decrease for some other reason like a promotional offer. Looking at the future of the MacBook Air, it could be a way of breaking in buyers before the next MacBook refresh is made.

In a joint statement, Delphi and Transdev said they will test driverless vehicles in Normandy and outside Paris, in advance of building a commercial service, starting in 2019, that could be deployed in other markets, including North America. It would be the first such commercial application on public roads of fully automated vehicles, they said. The Delphi-Transdev partnership will provide "a clear path to commercializing automated mobility on demand," said Glen De Vos, Delphi's chief technology officer, in a media briefing. Delphi is contributing a self-driving system that it has been developing with Israeli mapping and vision expert Mobileye NV <MBLY.N>, which is being acquired by U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp <INTC.O>. Transdev will manage the project and will provide ticketing, dispatch, routing and remote control-command services, the companies' statement said. French automaker Renault SA <RENA.PA> will supply the venture with Zoe electric minicars, according to Yann Leriche, Transdev's chief performance officer. The test phase will start later this year with two Zoe minicars in Rouen in Normandy and a shuttle bus in the Paris suburb of Saclay, Leriche told the media briefing. Initially, the vehicles will have "safety" drivers on board, but the plan is to move quickly next year to tests of fully driverless vehicles that are remotely controlled and monitored by human operators, he added. Delphi has been building its expertise and capability in self-driving vehicles through partnerships, investments and acquisitions. Several of its affiliates will participate in the project with Transdev, including Ottomatika (vehicle control software), Control-Tec (real-time data analytics) and Movimento (over-the-air software updates). Transdev, a mobility services provider, operates public and private transport services in 19 countries. The company is controlled by Caisse des Depots, an investment arm of the French government. Veolia Environnement SA <VIE.PA>, the French waste management company, holds a 30-percent stake. The Delphi-Transdev partnership is the latest in a growing web of global alliances aimed at putting self-driving vehicles on the road over the next four years. In May, German automaker BMW AG <BMWG.DE> announced that Delphi will join it in a self-driving partnership that includes Intel and Mobileye.

The previous MacBook used sixth-generation Skylake processors. You'll see a speed boost, but how much of a boost remains to be seen. Macworld plans on doing a full review for the new laptop soon. Apple also said during the WWDC keynote that all of its laptops now have solid-state drives that feature a 50 percent speed improvement. Models and prices Apple offers two standard configuration and each model can be customized, which can drive up the price.

News provided by Wind River 07 Jun, 2017, 06:03 ET Share this article DETROIT, June 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Wind River®, a subsidiary of Intel® Corporation and a leader in delivering software for the Internet of Things (IoT), has engaged with the Transportation Research Center (TRC), The Ohio State University (OSU), and the City of Dublin to advance smart, connected, and autonomous technologies. The planned collaboration—focused around the Columbus region in central Ohio—aims to accelerate learning in the automotive community. The group looks to develop strategies and technologies that safely and securely increase the pace, quality, development, testing, and deployment of self-driving and other connected vehicle technologies. "The Central Ohio region is an emerging hub for smart city and smart vehicle technologies, and our unique ensemble approach—uniting minds from academia, the public sector, and the tech industry—can set a standard for how communities can innovate mobility and use the learnings to impact vehicle development and deployment best practices," said Marques McCammon, general manager of Connected Vehicle Solutions at Wind River. "To realize autonomous driving for the masses, a variety of players must come together with an aligned understanding." Next-gen autonomous cars will communicate with the world around them.

"Software is core to today's automobile, and the automobile is a central part of our communities, so it is essential to be highly inclusive and collaborative when undertaking autonomous research. This makes a city like Dublin—which embraces technology and is already one of the most connected smart cities in the U.S.—such a natural partner," adds McCammon. The group is planning to test emerging technologies to discover how a symbiotic relationship between vehicles and infrastructure can improve the lives of community residents. In addition to the self-driving cars themselves, the group plans to test technologies such as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, connected vehicle cockpit software, smart sensing and mapping, and the associated data collection. With Ohio State students, researchers, and faculty to play a key role, the collaboration is also intended to further develop the next generation of expert automotive minds. The key objective for the project's initial phase includes joint development and testing of autonomous vehicles or "rolling laboratories." Applying its expertise from the aerospace and defense, industrial, and automotive industries, Wind River plans to spearhead the project development and contribute its proven software for safety-critical systems. TRC is the largest independent proving ground and vehicle testing organization in the Americas. It is home to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Vehicle Research and Test Center and acts as a one-stop research and development source for the entire auto industry. With expertise in areas such as crash, emissions, and durability testing, TRC can lead the validation process for the collaboration's vehicles and be the hub for build and rigorous testing on its 4,500 acres of road courses and 7.5-mile high-speed oval. Dublin, which has created high-speed connectivity for its businesses through more than 125 miles of underground fiber optics, is one of the end points for the 33 Smart Corridor —35 miles of highway between Dublin and East Liberty (northwest of Columbus), where the Ohio Department of Transportation is equipping high-capacity fiber-optic cable to link researchers with data from sensors along the road. The 33 Smart Corridor is primed to safely test technologies that can transform the way people and products are transported in Ohio and around the globe. The OSU Center for Automotive Research (CAR) team can provide hands-on support, leveraging its experience in autonomous vehicle research. OSU CAR focuses on energy, safety, and the environment, with an aim to improve sustainable mobility. With a concentration on preparing the next generation of automotive leaders, CAR emphasizes systems engineering, advanced and unique experimental facilities, collaboration on advanced product development projects with industry, and a balance of government and privately sponsored research. In the planned collaboration, CAR faculty and students would be instrumental in the algorithm development and integration of the collaboration's test vehicles. In addition to supplying leadership for the overall program, Wind River can provide its expertise which has served the aerospace, industrial and defense applications for more than three decades. The Wind River portfolio of automotive products, Wind River Helix™ Chassis, includes technologies addressing infotainment, telematics, and digital cluster systems; safety-oriented systems such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems; and cloud-based development tools and enhancements for the applications. "From Mars rovers to trains, cars, and commercial and military aircraft, Wind River's core business is developing and delivering mission-critical software. In exposing Ohio State and its students to this type of software and the processes that support the development of mission-critical applications, we hope their innovations can find a faster path to production," said McCammon. Additional Quotes: Transportation Research Center "The first autonomous vehicle will be on the highway before the last driver vehicle comes off. So, really, part of the challenge is how do you mix the two. We can mix the two, on purpose in a safe and controlled environment here," said Mark-Tami Hotta, TRC CEO and president. "Smart mobility, with connected vehicles and enhanced infrastructures, offers greater accessibility and mobility options, reduced road congestion, and more efficient use of natural resources." The Ohio State University "The Ohio State University has a long history of automotive research, and we welcome the chance to contribute to a project that could affect real change in the way the auto industry and governments address autonomous driving," said Giorgio Rizzoni, director of the Center for Automotive Research, Ohio State University. "By having our students get mentored by industry experts using state-of-the-art technologies in real-life scenarios, they are gaining priceless experience that can propel them forward on their future path." The City of Dublin "The City of Dublin embraces innovation for the welfare of our residents. We consider ourselves a start-up, and our product is city. Our work can be a benchmark for the nation in the area of intelligent research to improve safety and increase mobility, as well as address environmental challenges via more efficient transportation," said Doug McCollough, chief information officer, City of Dublin.

Comey has a long and trusted relationship with the man now in charge of running that investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller, and is likely to avoid disclosing anything that might influence that probe, the sources said.  “Jim has enormous respect for Mueller, and I expect that that respect is reciprocated,” an associate of Comey’s told The Hill. “Jim will be incredibly focused on avoiding interfering with Mueller’s interests or inquiries in any way.” ADVERTISEMENT The two former directors have reportedly spoken to hammer out the contours of Comey’s testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, anticipating that lawmakers will be keenly interested in both the evidence of possible collusion between President Trump’s campaign and Russia and the circumstances of Comey’s abrupt dismissal last month. Mueller has reportedly given Comey the green light to speak to the committee, and according to Chairman Richard BurrRichard BurrThe key players to watch at Comey’s hearing today Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey account rocks DC | Anticipation mounts for hearing | Intel chiefs dodge Trump questions | Trump names FBI pick Intel officials say they didn’t feel WH pressure MORE (R-N.C.), Comey told him that the “special counsel has not fenced him off in any way, shape or form on the items he intends to talk about.” Comey’s interactions with Trump and his firing are at the crux of arguments that Trump may have sought to stifle the FBI’s investigation. One important interaction is a February meeting during which Trump reportedly asked Comey to “let go” of the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. How circumspect Comey is during his testimony could provide clues about the strength of the case Mueller is building, former officials say. While the consensus is that Comey will say little about the primary investigation into collusion with Russia, his testimony on his interactions with Trump could potentially provide some insight into a rumored obstruction of justice probe. “[Comey] is going to be mindful of what Bob Mueller’s task is now and he’s not going to do anything to undermine it or damage it,” said Ron Hosko, a former assistant director at the bureau who worked under both men. “If we see him giving the sense that he’s unbounded in what he has a willingness to say, that may be an indicator that Mueller doesn’t see an obstruction case there.” The working relationship between Mueller and Comey can be traced back at least to 2003, when Mueller was at the helm of the FBI and Comey became deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft. The two worked elbow-to-elbow in the early and uncertain days of the post-9/11 war on terror. Then, in 2004, Mueller backed up Comey in a dramatic standoff with the George W. Bush White House that almost ended in both men’s resignation — but cemented their reputations. The White House was attempting to renew a controversial surveillance program Comey and Mueller believed was illegal. In a now-famous scene, Comey raced to the bedside of an infirm Ashcroft to prevent White House officials from getting him to sign off on reauthorizing the program. When he arrived at the intensive care unit, Comey called Mueller and asked that he not let the Secret Service remove him from Ashcroft’s side “under any circumstances.” Mueller ordered Ashcroft’s FBI detail to prevent the Secret Service from removing Comey, keeping White House officials from being alone with the sick attorney general. White House chief of staff Andrew Card and counsel Alberto Gonzales backed off that night — but the battle wasn’t over. In a private meeting with the president the morning after the showdown at the hospital, Bush reportedly tried to convince Comey to allow him to shoulder the responsibility for the reauthorization of the program. After Mueller and Comey made clear they would resign over the issue, Bush told Mueller that the Justice Department should do whatever was necessary to put the program on legal footing. The incident is often cited as evidence of Comey’s fierce willingness to speak truth to power — but the critical role played by Mueller is often overlooked. “I knew that no one cared about losing a deputy attorney general,” Comey told the Washingtonian years later, during a subsequent stint in the private sector. “But no president could weather losing an FBI director.” The Comey-Mueller relationship runs far deeper than the dramatic events of that night, associates say. “I think the hospital incident should be taken as not just an experience they had together but a reflection of the degree of trust and expectations of integrity each had in the other,” the Comey associate told The Hill. “Those expectations would have been developed over the course of many matters.” When the incident finally came to light — during a theatrical public account on Capitol Hill in 2007 — Comey gave a deeply personal avowal of the relationship to rapt lawmakers. Mueller, he said, “was very supportive to me personally. “He’s one of the finest people I’ve ever met and was a great help to me when I felt a tremendous amount of pressure and felt a bit alone at the Department of Justice.” Former officials are swift to argue that the personal relationship won’t influence Comey’s testimony. “Over a decade ago, they were in the trenches together and probably saw themselves in the same foxhole together, certainly in that encounter,” Hosko said. But, he said, “Do I think that personal loyalty is such that it would color what Jim Comey is about to testify to, to make his case stronger or less strong? I think these guys are both rule-of-law, straight-arrow boy scouts in their own ways.” Former federal prosecutor Bob Ray said Comey’s testimony on his own dismissal probably won’t have that much impact on any potential obstruction of justice case. Mueller already has the most important piece of evidence he needs, he said — the contemporaneous memos that Comey reportedly kept following his encounters with Trump. “I think he has all that he needs, which is why he’s not making any effort to step in the way of Comey testifying,” said Ray, who was head of the Office of the Independent Counsel during the Whitewater investigation of Bill and Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonThe sexist way we pile on Hillary Clinton and stifle women in democracy What to watch for in Comey’s testimony Exclusive: GOP lawmaker talked stocks with colleagues MORE. “I wouldn’t say that the testimony is mere icing on the cake, but the memos are more important than the testimony from an investigative standpoint.” Mark Zaid, an attorney who specializes in national security, echoed that assessment, arguing that the impact from Thursday’s hearing was likely to be strictly political. “The takeaway for anyone would be Mueller is not concerned from a legal standpoint what Comey might say,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if people come away disappointed in the lack of how salacious his testimony might be.” Tags Hillary Clinton Richard Burr   View the discussion thread.

Comey has said it will be the only public testimony he will give on recent events, according to the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard BurrRichard BurrThe key players to watch at Comey’s hearing today Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey account rocks DC | Anticipation mounts for hearing | Intel chiefs dodge Trump questions | Trump names FBI pick Intel officials say they didn’t feel WH pressure MORE (R-N.C.).

Jim Manley, who was a long-serving aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry ReidHarry ReidIt's time for Comey to put up or shut up THE MEMO: Washington braces for Comey impact Ensuring New Mexicans have the resources to succeed MORE (D-Nev.), said he could not remember such public attention being paid to a congressional appearance since Anita Hill testified during Clarence Thomas’s confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court more than 25 years ago. Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment; Thomas denied it and was confirmed. Manley noted, however: “Things have radically changed since then, with the proliferation of cable TV as well as Twitter coverage and things like that. From a media perspective, this is going to be wildly different.” There will also be an avid audience for any response that Trump offers to Comey. During Tuesday’s White House media briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer demurred when asked whether the president would watch the testimony. Spicer said only that Trump “has a full day on Thursday.” Trump, meanwhile, said, “I wish him luck” when asked about Comey’s appearance. The president is set to give a speech during the latter part of the Comey hearing, opening the possibility that he could be watching — and tweeting — in the opening hour. Trump’s Twitter use has once again been the subject of controversy since the weekend. He has used the social media platform to criticize the mayor of London, his own Justice Department and the Gulf nation of Qatar.  Washington Post reporter Robert Costa tweeted on Tuesday that he had been “told by two WH sources that Pres. Trump does not plan to put down Twitter on Thursday. May live tweet if he feels the need to respond.”  The over-arching question on Thursday’s testimony is whether Comey will outline conduct on Trump’s part that comes close to obstruction of justice.  On Tuesday, ABC News reported — citing “a source familiar with Comey’s thinking” — that he would not make such an allegation himself.  But the source told the news organization that Comey “is not going to Congress to make accusations about the president’s intent, instead he’s there to share his concerns.” Those concerns are believed to focus on two encounters with Trump. At a dinner on Jan. 27, Trump is alleged to have pressed Comey at least twice to pledge his “loyalty” to him. Comey is said to have responded only by promising his honesty. The White House disputes that account. Comey is also believed to have kept a memo detailing a subsequent meeting with Trump on Feb. 14, the day after national security adviser Michael Flynn had been fired for giving misleading accounts of his communications with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. On that occasion, Comey’s memo is said to outline how Trump asked him to drop the FBI investigation into Flynn’s links with Russia. The president reportedly told Comey, “I hope you can let this go” and described Flynn as a “good guy.” Trump was asked at a news conference in mid-May whether he “at any time” urged Comey to “close or to back down” from the investigation. “No. No. Next question,” he responded. Yet another issue will be whether Comey will push back against Trump’s statement — made in the letter announcing his firing — that the FBI director had told the president on three occasions that he was not himself the target of federal investigation. In the weeks since that letter was released, friends of Comey have suggested that statement from Trump is untrue. Republicans are trying to walk a fine line as Comey’s testimony looms. They have displayed little appetite for a vigorous defense of the president — presumably because they are worried about the director delivering new bombshells.  At the same time, some in the party are questioning why the more damning details of Comey’s encounters with Trump have only come to light since his firing. While still in his position, Comey testified on Capitol Hill on May 3 and made no mention of any presidential effort to thwart his investigation. Asked on that occasion by Sen. Mazie HironoMazie HironoTwitter mocks GOP for using movie gif to dismiss Comey statement THE MEMO: Washington braces for Comey impact Overnight Energy: Senate committee approves controversial Interior nominee MORE (D-Hawaii) whether the attorney general or Department of Justice officials had ever acted to stop an FBI investigation, Comey replied: “Not in my experience. Because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that — without an appropriate purpose.” On Monday, the Republican National Committee’s rapid response unit sent reporters an email detailing a number of interviews and comments in which this point was raised. Republican strategist Ford O’Connell suggested Democrats could be overestimating the effects of Comey’s testimony. “There is only one question that matters for the president, and that is, ‘Is James Comey going to say he obstructed justice?’ ” he said. “According to ABC News, he is not going to do that.” But with all eyes in Washington on the hearing on Thursday, the stakes could hardly be higher.  The Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage, primarily focused on Donald TrumpDonald TrumpWhat to watch for in Comey’s testimony Exclusive: GOP lawmaker talked stocks with colleagues How Trump will spend day while Comey testifies MORE’s presidency.

MyBroadband journalist Jamie McKane walked in one April morning, sat down, and said: “I’m going to buy this cryptocurrency Ethereum.” We had no idea what he was talking about, but it sounded cool, so we said we were in. After checking out various sites under instruction from Jamie, a few of us registered with Luno for Bitcoin, Poloniex for trading, and MyEtherWallet for Ether storage. What happened in the weeks that followed our Ethereum purchase got us all on the cryptocurrency hype train – with Ethereum and Bitcoin reaching all-time highs. Lets get us a rig As we had not invested our entire life savings in Ethereum, we decided to pool some money together and purchase a mining rig instead of buying more of the digital currency. While profit projections and calculations comparing investment vs the purchasing of a rig were on the to-do list, we ended up buying it because: Someone said something about the “means of production” and quoted The Wolf of Wall Street. It would be cool to have a mining rig – we are all tech nerds at heart. If the mining failed, we could build sweet gaming PCs with the graphics cards. We ended up buying a rig from Bitmart, which features six AMD Radeon RX 580 4GB GPUs. The rig also features a 60GB SSD, 4GB of RAM, a motherboard with enough PCIe slots for the cards – attached via risers – and a basic Intel processor. The rig came with Windows 10 and Claymore. Our set-up sees us connecting to an Ethermine.org mining pool, which pays us 1 Ethereum at a time to our wallet when earned. Our rig’s reported hashrate to the mining pool is around 170MH/s, while our average effective rate sits at around the 160MH/s mark. We’ve had the rig a week now, and the projection for our monthly earnings is sitting at around 3.2 to 3.3 Ethereum. At the time of writing, this worked out to $850 per month. With the rig costing us just over R40,000, we should have it paid off before the end of the year. Proof of Stake and the Ice Age Before you get giddy with excitement from seeing the rig and go out and buy your own, there are a few things to take note of. Cryptocurrencies and the blockchains they are based on are quite complex, and it is a good idea to do some research before getting involved. There is also work being done on Ethereum, which may move it from a “proof of work” to a “proof of stake” set-up. If this happens, it will result in an exponential rise in block difficulty that will make blocks virtually impossible to solve. There is also the “difficulty bomb” built into Ethereum, which makes mining a block increasingly difficult over time. CoinDesk reported that starting from block 200,000, mining would become “progressively more difficult”. “So much so, that by the end of 2016, an Ice Age would occur, meaning a point when the network freezes up.” This did not happen, however, as Ethereum is continued to be worked on with the aim of improving it. You must also take the cost of electricity into account when running your rig. Again: do research before you buy any tech equipment, particularly something that costs your entire pay cheque. Many options to choose from While our rig continues to mine away, there are many other ways you can get involved in cryptocurrencies without a big capital outlay. You can build your own rig – if you can get your hands on graphics cards – or buy a less-powerful, cheaper pre-built device from a retailer. Investing your cash through an exchange is also an option, and there are many coins to choose – from giants like Bitcoin, to lesser-known options like Stellar. As with any investment, don’t throw all your eggs into one basket and make sure you know enough to make an informed decision. This is an opinion piece.

Packing beefy hardware and batteries into a backpack allows for players to play VR games and experiences without having to worry about tripping over cables. There’s a big problem with VR backpacks though; they make for terrible desktop machines because nobody really wants to plug a mouse, keyboard and monitor into a backpack on their desks. HP wants to change that. Their newly redesigned Compact Omen Desktop is a home computer first, and a VR backpack second. The delightfully designed diminutive desktop packs in some desirable hardware: Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake mobile quad-core Core i7, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, a factory-overclocked GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, and a 1TB PCIe SSD. That should be more than sufficient for most people’s gaming needs. The Omen X Compact Desktop itself houses four USB Type A ports and one USB 3.1 Type C/Thunderbolt 3 port, a combo audio jack, HDMI 2.0, mini DisplayPort, and a Vive power-out port for HMD. There’s a hot-swappable dock for the mini desktop that adds another five regular USB ports, one more USB Type C, an HDMI 2.0 port, Displayport and an Ethernet port. What makes it special though, is that with the addition of an optional backpack harness which includes four batteries, a charging dock and a somewhat shorter cable for HTC’s Vive, the Omen X Compact Desktop becomes an untethered VR machine. Read  Half-Life 2: VR wants you to replay the classic shooter more intimately The batteries are also hot swappable, and two of them nets an hour of play. If the included charger is able to charge the remaining batteries within that time, you’re all set for dropping off into a VR world forever. The unit also docks and undocks seamlessly, going from a desktop to VR machine with ease. As you might imagine, this all becomes quite expensive. The Compact Desktop itself costs $2,499, which is over R32000 in a simple direct conversion. The backpack accessory is another $599 (R7700), which puts this set up out of the reach of just about everybody. Still, it’s a nice idea that acknowledges that VR is more of an occasional venture – and that PC’s are used for other things.

John Malloy and James Johnstone 06 June 2017 Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   0 Comments Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to be a key driver of success in both developed and frontier markets, according to John Malloy and James Johnstone, co-managers of the RWC emerging and frontier markets funds. Below the duo, who joined RWC Partners in 2015 and now manages over $2.5bn for clients, have identified five companies in emerging markets which are utilising AI who are taking full advantage of this trend. AllianzGI unveils global artificial intelligence fund Related articles 'Why Trump's healthcare reforms won't impact our 5% dividend yield' Meet the Adviser Champions: Embark Group's Phil Smith Industry Voice: Three years of Modi - what next for India? Rowan Dartington's Stephens: The day after the General Election Six financial policies from the election manifestos so far Alibaba Leveraging its vast amount of sophisticated, transaction-oriented consumer data, we believe Alibaba will be an ultimate beneficiary of AI development. AI allows the company to provide a more personalised experience for its customers; it can rapidly identify clusters and patterns in the information - such as similarities between customers, past purchasing behavior, credit checks and other common threads. Millions of transactions can be analyzed every day to target offers down to a single customer. With the strongest database, as well as the largest (by far) cloud in China, Alibaba is gaining an upper hand among peers in the forthcoming AI competitive landscape. S&W to launch artificial intelligence fund for former Pictet managers Trading at 23x 2018 earnings, Alibaba's current valuation recognizes only its core e-commerce business, in our view. We believe Alibaba's strategic investment in cloud and AI could add an additional 20% upside (or roughly $60bn) to its current market cap. Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest and only fully-independent semiconductor foundry. Unlike leading competitors Intel and Samsung Electronics, Taiwan Semiconductor does not have both in-house products and technologies which compete with the chips designed by customers such as nVidia and Apple. Additionally, the firm has leap-frogged ahead of Intel in terms of technology leadership, offering the smallest cut die-sizes, by starting to tapeout 7nm projects for production in 2018. A nanometer (nm) is one-millionth of a millimeter: for perspective, a human hair is about 75,000nm. We model Taiwan Semiconductor continuing to compound earnings growth at 14%, ascribing some 30% upside to the shares over the next 12-18 months. Hynix The other core area in chip capability and high performance computing is memory, including high-bandwidth memory. Hynix, with its pure-play memory focus, is our chosen portfolio holding for this theme, and is on track to achieve record levels of profits this year. Artificial intelligence, winning Clouds and fate of the unicorns: Key tech themes for 2017 Given the prohibitive costs of advance-node memory production, the industry has undergone a massive shakeout culminating in just three players from as many as 10 just a decade ago. As such, we are seeing unprecedented supply discipline (expressed in the strong contract and spot prices of DRAM) as well as shallower peak-to-trough cyclical volatility, which should help Hynix's trading multiples re-rate back to the upper end of its historical range. While we continue to monitor the often intense ongoing debate on whether memory supply discipline can be sustainable, we view this memory super-cycle as one that will last into 2018. We see an additional upside of more than 30% for the shares.  12  Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   Topics Specialist RWC Partners artificial intelligence Technology electronics thematic investment thematic investing internet Alibaba Group Taiwan Semiconductor Hynix Win Semi Hikvision More news Meet the Adviser Champions: Embark Group's Phil Smith Our video series continues Wealth managers 08 June 2017 Industry Voice: Three years of Modi - what next for India?

Read More NEW DELHI: At Apple WWDC 2017 we witnessed the unveiling of new iPad Pro models alongside the refreshed versions of the MacBook Pro and the iMac. Now, the new devices are listed on the company's India website along with prices. iPad Pro 12.9-inch, 10.5-inch India price To start with the new iPad Pro models, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be available in Silver, Space Gray, Gold and Rose Gold colour versions. The Wi-Fi only variants with 64GB, 256GB and 512GB storage will cost Rs 52,900, Rs 60,900 and Rs 76,900 respectively. The Wi-Fi + Cellular model with same storage space versions cost Rs 63,900, Rs 71,900 and Rs 87,900 respectively. View As Photolist » iOS 11: 10 'biggest' features iPhones and iPads will get 111 iOS 11: 10 'biggest' features iPhones and iPads will get It's one of the most exciting days of the year for Apple fans – the opening day of WWDC 2017, and the keynote speech during which the latest OS updates and new hardware are revealed. As expected there was lots of attention on Apple’s latest macOS, watchOS and tvOS, plus a new iPad Pro and more. But it’s the major iPhone software update we’re really excited about – yup, it’s time for iOS 11. To save you trawling the interwebs to find out just what delights are coming to your phone and iPad in the next major upgrade, we’ve listed the best bits of iOS 11 right here… ​Smarter Siri Siri has slowly been improving as it gets more and more use and learns as it goes. iOS 11 will see a major bump in the brain department for the artificially intelligent assistant. Siri will now learn more about you from your habits and iPhone uses, allowing it to offer deeper understanding. It will also offer a better integration across your devices, always learning based on what you’re doing across iOS, watchOS, tvOS and iCloud. The voice has been improved and is now more human, with an ability to add different tones for the same word, for example. Contextual learning means Siri can see you looking up Iceland in a browser then when you open News it’ll offer Iceland-related stories. It even works for your keyboard and will offer foreign Iceland related words ready for you. Smart. ​Apple Music upgrade Another year, another Apple Music revamp. Now Apple has added in the ability to see what your friends are listening to so you can find new songs. The upgrade also lets other apps access the smarts of Music. That means Shazam could find a song and automatically add it to you library, for example. Pay pals with Apple Pay You can now make payments directly to other Apple Pay users thanks to peer-to-peer payment support in iOS 11. This allows you to send money to mates easily, helping you to split bills, pay for drinks, chip into groups and more all with a few phone taps. This all works within the Messages app, so you can simply send or request money. This then hits that person’s Apple Pay Cash Card to be moved about to a bank, to others or to pay for items. This all works with Touch ID for authentication, and can be even be done on the Apple Watch. Maps made safer and smarter Apple Maps has been upgraded to offer better navigation in the car and more depth on foot. Users can now zoom in on shopping centres and airports to see inside, and even move about floors – ideal for timing your walk to your gate before a flight. Don’t expect this to appear outside of the US for a while though. Navigation has added speed limits and lane guidance for easier driving. When using Apple Car mode you can have notifications hidden and the phone will even auto-reply to people who are trying to contact you, to let them know you’re driving. On top of that there’s an emergency mode that lets people push through that layer to contact you if they really need to. HomeKit AirPlay 2 upgrade The speaker category of HomeKit is finally getting love in the form of an AirPlay 2 update that lets users set up a multi-room system right there in iOS. That means you can play music on certain speakers in the home right from within Apple Music. You can even use the Apple TV as a speaker, and control music from there using Siri. New App Store It’s been a long time coming, but Apple has at last revamped the App Store. You now get a Today section on launch so you can see what’s new for that day. Sections have been added for Games and Apps too. This allows you to find content easier, but also lets creators add in-app purchases right there. Reviews and star ratings are also more clearly laid out now, so you can find the best app to do what you need. Control Center Apple has upgraded its Control Centre for iOS 11 to make everything even easier to use. Now all your Control Center icons are found right there on one page. This makes it super-simple, but thanks to 3D Touch you can also tap into icons for more in-depth controls. There are even icon animations and interactions right there with digital sliders for volume, for example. Camera and Photos Apple has changed up file types to save you space. That means more room on your device, but also smaller files for easier and cheaper sharing. Videos are no longer in H.264 but are now stored as HEVC files. Photos, that were JPEGs, are now stored as HEIF. All this means photos are videos are half the size they previously were while offering the same level of quality. On top of all that they can be easily shared and are compatible with other devices, says Apple. Apple Files This app pulls in all your files and even works with third-party apps like Dropbox or Google Drive, so you have everything all in one place. Of course this works across your Apple devices via iCloud too. Augmented reality Apple has added augmented reality smarts to its iOS 11 operating system that will allow developers to create amazing, world-warping experiences. Apple demoed a 3D video on a table that showed a battle with flying ships, exploding buildings and more, all while looked at through an iPad. This was impressive, and is from Peter Jackson’s dedicated studio, suggesting this could be the start of a whole new wave of entertainment. The iPad Pro 12.9-inch model will come in Silver, Space Gray and Gold colours. It's Wi-Fi only 64GB, 256GB and 512GB models will cost Rs 65,900, Rs 73,900 and Rs 89,900 respectively. The Wi-Fi + Cellular one's with same storage versions will cost Rs 76,900, Rs 84,900 and Rs 100,900. The Wi-Fi + Cellular 512GB model is also the first iPad in India to cross the Rs 1 lakh mark. MacBook Pro with Intel 7th-Gen 'Kaby Lake' processor India price The refreshed 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar model now has a 128GB SSD storage and is listed at Rs 109,900 (base model). The refreshed 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch ID is listed at Rs 1,54,900 (base model), while the new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch ID base model starts at Rs 2,05,900, which is the same price at which it was launched last year. Apple rejigs iCloud storage plans amidst WWDC 2017 conference Apple has made the price for its iCloud monthly plans more competitive and one of the cheapest in the cloud storage market. MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook India price Mentioned briefly during the WWDC 2017 keynote, Apple's MacBook Air too gots a bump with same processors, but more clock speed. The refreshed MacBook Air is listed in the Indian website at Rs 80,900 with 128GB SSD. Also, the 12-inch MacBook has been modernized with Intel 'Kaby Lake' processors and faster SSD storage. The device in India starts at Rs 109,900. WWDC 2017: Apple launches iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, watchOS 4 and more The new versions bring both fresh features as well as updates user experiences. iMac price in India Lastly, the refreshed Apple iMac comes with 43% brighter displays and Intel 'Kaby Lake' processor. The 21.5-inch model with Retina display is listed at Rs 1,07,900 (base model). The larger 27.5-inch Retina iMac starts at Rs 1,48,900 while the 21.5-inch non-retina iMac with refreshed specifications is listed for Rs 90,900 (base model). The new iMac models with Retina display also comes configured with Fusion Drive storage tech, which would cost the user more.

NZXT's BLD program is intended to make it easier for newcomers to join in the PC gaming fun. NZXT says it has put together a PC game performance database based on "over 10 million counted and analyzed gaming hours," perhaps recorded using user installations of its CAM PC monitoring utility. Prosepective buyers can enter the names of up to three games they intend to play from NZXT's list of 18 popular titles, along with a choice between $1500, $2000, and $2500 budgets, and the tool will provide benchmark data for a PC that can be built with the specified budget. The user can customize the system somewhat and click the buy button. NZXT says a system will be custom-built and shipped out within 48 hours. A sample build at the $1500 price point includes an Intel i5-7500 CPU mounted to a Gigabyte B250 motherboard, an MSI GeForce GTX 1060 with 6 GB of onboard memory, 8 GB of 2666 GT/s G.Skill Ripjaws memory, a 275 GB Crucial MX300 SSD, and a 1 TB WD hard drive. Stepping up all the way to the $2500 tier nets a build with an Intel Core i7-7700K CPU atop an Asus Maximus IX Hero motherboard, an EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 FTW ACX 3.0 graphics card, 32 GB of G.Skill Trident Z RGB DDR4 memory, and a 525 GB Crucial MX300 SSD. NZXT support staff indicates that all builds include a Cryorig H7 CPU cooler, and that NZXT-built options will be included in the future. All of the available configurations at this point in the program use Intel CPus and Nvidia GeForces, though NZXT's support department did say AMD CPUs and graphics cards may be offered in the future. It should go without saying that all systems come in NZXT enclosures. The listed prices include a $350 line item for labor and shipping costs. Windows 10 Home comes pre-installed, and there's an upgrade option available for Windows 10 Pro. A monitor and peripherals are not included. NZXT backs up the BLD PCs with a two-year warranty.

On Thursday,  former FBI director James Comey will get asked by someone on the Senate Intel Committee whether he really did, as Trump said in his letter sacking Comey and again to NBC’s Lester Holt, assure Trump three times the president was not under investigation. Comey’s testimony is expected to clock a TV audience rivaling that of the Watergate hearings, size-wise. Related 'Daily Show' Slams Megyn Kelly's Morph From Fox News So, how is Trump distracting us? With Infrastructure Week! Which Noah likened to counterprogramming Shark Week with Barnacle Week. And though the ceremony at which Trump signed a document  after announcing his proposed changes to the country’s air traffic control system was befitting a bill signing, the document was just a memo to Congress outlining his proposal. “He just wrote a to-do list and signed it?!” Noah marveled. “He really is a TV president!…He loves the performance of doing things, but a lot of the time, nothing is actually being done. Essentially, Donald Trump wants to be president, but he doesn’t want to do president,” Noah said. Which, funny enough, is just what Seth Meyers forecast back during the campaign when he offered Trump the chance to play POTUS as star of a new NBC primetime series,  Chicago President, so he could play at being POTUS without actually having to do the hard work.   Filed Under: TV Breaking News Late Night TV Politics Donald Trump Infrastructure Week James Comey Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 14 14 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Related Apple set to unveil Siri-powered speaker as California conference kicks off Apple's HomePod speaker will 'reinvent music' Apple made a host of new software and hardware announcements at its annual WWDC. While essentially a developer conference, it gives customers a sneak peek at upcoming products and software features — all of which will also be available in India towards the end of 2017 and early 2018. Hitesh Raj Bhagat & Karan Bajaj take you through the major announcements HomePod This is Apple’s new connected home speaker with a focus on audio quality. It’s powered by Apple’s A8 processor that enables all sorts of software audio wizardry. Inside the small enclosure, HomePod hides a 4-inch long-throw woofer, seven tweeters (each with their own amplifier), and six microphones. A prototype of Apple's new HomePod is displayed during the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). (Image: AFP) HomePod is spatially aware, which means that it maps the room in which it is placed to optimise the audio output. Using Siri, you can play music and ask questions regarding news, weather, traffic, ask it to read your messages, set reminder/alarms/timers and so on. If you have two HomePod speakers, they will automatically work in tandem with each other. Priced at US$ 349, the HomePod is expected to launch sometime December this year, so we expect it to reach India early 2018. iMac Pro The biggest surprise from the event was the new iMac Pro that will come in a darker Space Grey as compared to the typical silver. It challenges the perception that you can’t fit a super-powerful, workstation-class computer into an all-in-one design. It’s also built to cater to the needs of power-hungry folks who have been complaining of lack of upgrades to the Mac Pro line. It has a 27-inch 5k display and is the first iMac to offer 10Gb Ethernet and 4 Thunderbolt ports. Craig Federighi, Senior Vice President Software Engineering speaks under a projection image of an iMac computer. (Image: Reuters) This means you can connect two additional 5k displays and 2 RAID storage drives simultaneously. In addition, the iMac Pro comes with Vesa mount option for those who want to mount it to a wall. You can get it with a choice of 8, 10 or 18 core Intel Xeon processor, up to 128GB RAM and up to 4TB SSD storage. Moreover, it will come with the workstation-class Radeon Vega GPU with up to 16GB dedicated memory. Other features include a 1080p FaceTime camera, UHS-II SDXC card slot, stereo speakers, four microphones, 4 x USB 3.0 ports, WiFi ac and Bluetooth 4.2. iMac Pro will be available from December onwards and will be priced at US$ 5,000 for the base variant (8-core, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Radeon Vega GPU with 8GB memory). The box includes a new Magic Keyboard with numeric keypad and Magic Mouse 2 — both of which are in a matching Space Grey colour. iOS 11 — A BIG UPDATE WITH NEW FEATURES ACROSS THE BOARD new features added to iPhones, iPod Touch and iPads — some that are mentioned up front and some that you will find out for yourself. For starters, there’s a big push for augmented reality (AR) and the ARKit for developers will help them build new experiences in time for the full release of iOS 11. Siri will sound a lot better (both male and female voices) because the voice will be more natural and expressive. There’s a ton of machine learning that goes into something so small. There’ll be new camera features, a new image file format (smaller size), updates to Apple Maps (with maps for airports and shopping malls around the world) and AirPlay 2 (with support for multi room audio). Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller speaks during the opening keynote address. (Image: AFP) A new feature called Do Not Disturb While Driving is quite interesting. iPhone will automatically detect if you are moving in a car and switch off all notifications (and distractions). If you’re in a car but not driving, you can tell it so and it will open up all features. Someone who texts you will get an auto-response mentioning that you’re driving. In case someone is trying to reach you urgently, they only need to reply ‘urgent’ and the phone will let it through! And iPads get a host of exclusive features too. There’s a new customisable dock (quite like OS X) that lets you quickly switch between apps or start side-by-side apps (split view). There’s a new Files app that shows you all your files, whether they’re stored on the device storage or your choice of cloud provider. There’s many new features in the Notes app and support for drag-and-drop across the system. This update will make the iPad line a lot more powerful for someone who wants to use it as a computer replacement. iOS 11 will be a free update later this year on all iPhone (5s and later), all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, iPad 5th generation, iPad mini 2 and later and iPod Touch 6th gen. If you have a paid developer account, you can download the developer beta right away. A free public beta will be available for all users later this month. Revamped App Store The new app store will make it easier for you to discover new apps and games. The new Today tab will showcase the apps better with larger images and videos. Other tabs include apps, games, updates (shows you what’s changed in the latest update) and search (shows details of in-app purchases). WatchOS 4 This new update for Apple Watch gives Siri new capabilities and enhances the fitness features. There’s a new Siri watch face that updates with information from your favourite apps and shows you relevant information at different times of day. This could include activity, alarms, Breathe, Calendar, Maps, Reminders and news snippets from the Apple News app. Other new watch faces include a Kaleidoscope and faces with characters from Toy Story (Woodie, Jessie, Buzz Lightyear). As for fitness, it includes auto-sets for pool workouts and new motion and heart rate algorithms for High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) workouts. WatchOS 4 will be a free update for all Apple Watches that are paired with iPhone 5s (or later) that have been upgraded to iOS 11. New Apple iPad Pro Apple has announced the new iPad Pro in two display variants — 10.5-inch (2,224 x 1668 pixels) and 12.9-inch (2,732 x 2048 pixels). This is step up from the conventional 9.7-inch screen because of slimmer bezels. Apple says that the width this new screen offers is enough for a full-size on-screen keyboard that should be more comfortable to type on. Having said that, there will also be new keyboard covers and covers with built in storage for the Apple Pencil. The Pencil stays the same as before. Both devices have slim bezels, 600 nits brightness, HDR video support and 120Hz refresh rate. Both variants come with a new hexa core A10X fusion chip, M10 coprocessor and storage has been bumped up as well. The base variant gets 64GB storage, midrange is 256GB and the top-end gets a massive 512GB. The camera is the same as on the iPhone 7: a 12MP camera with f1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization while the front gets a 7MP camera with f2.2 aperture. Other common features include TouchID fingerprint scanner, four speakers that auto-adjust, dual microphones, optional LTE, WiFi and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. As is usual for iPads, these will also deliver up to 10 hours of battery life. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is priced at US$ 649 onwards while the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is US$799 onwards. Mac OSX High Sierra The latest version of Apple’s desktop operating system includes a new file system, high efficiency video coding (HEVC) and support for virtual reality content creation (powered by the new hardware upgrades). The new file system is simply called Apple File System (APFS) but don’t be worried – it is fully compatible with the previous HFS system but offers numerous advantages such as faster data transfers, native encryption and protection of data in case of power failure or system crashes. The Annual Hardware Refresh In line with the yearly hardware refresh, Apple has updated the MacBook and iMac line-up with the latest 7 th generation Intel Core processors. The iMac also gets improved displays, support for VR, up to 64GB RAM, up to 2TB Fusion drives and new AMD Radeon Pro GPUs. Prices for the new iMac start at US$ 1,100. For the MacBooks, the main upgrade is the new processor along with faster solid state memory drives. Prices for the MacBook starts at US$ 1,299 while the MacBook with TouchBar starts at US$ 1,799. We expect the upgraded variants to launch in India very soon. Want stories like this in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly ET Panache newsletter. You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter.

Toggle navigation Archive Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters × Are you ready for … Comeymas? Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Are you ready for … Comeymas? Ed MorrisseyPosted at 7:21 pm on June 6, 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Ringling Brothers may have retired its three-ring show, but believe me, the circus will come to town in Washington DC on Thursday … even if there won’t be much of a show. Everyone is ramping up for perhaps the most anticipated Congressional testimony since Anita Hill in the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearing, or maybe even Oliver North’s appearance during the investigation into the Iran-Contra scandal. Former FBI director James Comey will testify in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on the ongoing probes into Russian interference in the 2016 election — and the extent to which Donald Trump made him feel “uncomfortable.” This afternoon’s ABC News report on the leak from Comey’s camp may have taken some of the wind out of the sails, but beforehand, CNN’s Chris Cillizza called it “Washington’s Super Bowl.” The Redskins have been unavailable for comment on that point for the last twenty-six years: Washington politics has often been described as sports for people who weren’t all that good at sports. If that’s true, then Thursday’s congressional testimony by fired FBI Director James Comey is this town’s Super Bowl. … The big three broadcast networks — ABC, CBS and NBC — announced they would be carrying the Comey hearing live, an unheard-of move for something so traditionally mundane as a congressional hearing. Not only will Comey testify then but he’ll have no shackles — at least from senators — on what he can say. And his words will be heard by, basically, anyone who turns on a TV for any part of the day on Thursday. The story Comey presumably has to tell is a humdinger, based on all of the amazing reporting in and around this White House and Comey’s relationship with Trump. It’s not just the broadcast networks that will carry the show live. Salem Radio Network, part of our parent company Salem Communications, plans to cover the hearing gavel-to-gavel as well, beginning at 10 am ET. SRN News’ Senate correspondent Linda Kenyon will anchor the broadcast, which will pre-empt our regular schedule, and SRN White House correspondent Greg Clugston will contribute to the commentary. But will this be a game-changer, or will this be the equivalent of a “Fitzmas” moment? Intel committee chair Richard Burr told reporters that he expects Comey to be pretty darned frank, and will only be “constrained” when it comes to classified information: Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, said that he doesn’t expect former FBI Director James Comey‘s testimony to be “fenced off” or “constrained” when he appears before the committee Thursday. “He can’t talk about anything that’s classified in an open session,” Burr told reporters Monday, “but I haven’t gotten any indication that he is constrained in any way, shape or form as a public citizen.” … “It’s about Russia’s involvement in our 2016 election which is the investigation,” Burr said. “And that does lead into the possibility of collusion by either campaign, but it also gets into questions that have been raised publicly about conversations that may or may not have taken place. He’ll have an opportunity to clear that all up.” One easily-anticipated element of the circus may not actually materialize, however. The White House would normally be expected to put together a rapid-response team to counter any statements made by Comey, in the style of a campaign working a debate. According to NBC, however, Trump’s team says there is “zero” chance of happening, and any questions will be routed to outside counsel instead: As Washington gears up for one of its biggest political events in years — former FBI director James Comey appearing publicly on Capitol Hill — it’s not a stretch to imagine the White House scrambling behind the scenes to set up a crisis-management system to contain fallout from any damaging testimony Thursday. Instead, multiple people familiar with the planning describe to a different reality: early talk of a “war room” has petered out significantly. One source close to the White House describes it flatly: “There’s no war room. Zero.” Another administration source says it simply “never took off.” What was originally intended to be an in-house command post has instead shifted outside the administration. The president’s aides are expected to shunt all Comey-related questions on Thursday to outside counsel Marc Kasowitz. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer signaled this move last week, when he explicitly referred Russia-related inquiries to the president’s longtime lawyer. That’s a political risk, if Comey offers any seriously damaging testimony, but the ABC report pretty much limits that risk, and perhaps the White House knew already that Comey doesn’t have anything that damaging on the president. Kasowitz could decide to set up his own comms operation, but he’d have to be careful about putting explanations on the record — especially if Trump has his Twitter app handy during the hearing. One would think that a president might have more pressing matters to attend on a Thursday midmorning, and that an attorney would warn a client not to make any public statements at all, but … Trump’s not exactly known for taking advice, either: Top lawyers with at least four major law firms rebuffed White House overtures to represent President Trump in the Russia investigations, in part over concerns that the president would be unwilling to listen to their advice, according to five sources familiar with discussions about the matter. … But a consistent theme, the sources said, was the concern about whether the president would accept the advice of his lawyers and refrain from public statements and tweets that have consistently undercut his position. “The concerns were, ‘The guy won’t pay and he won’t listen,’” said one lawyer close to the White House who is familiar with some of the discussions between the firms and the administration, as well as deliberations within the firms themselves. We’ll know Thursday whether Kasowitz can keep his client under control. But when the circus comes to town, the man who sees himself as the ringmaster will be loathe to concede the center ring, especially to an employee he fired. Over/under on Trump tweets during Comey testimony: A dozen. I'm told by two WH sources that Pres. Trump does not plan to put down Twitter on Thursday. May live tweet if he feels the need to respond. — Robert Costa (@costareports) June 6, 2017 Tags: Donald Trump james comey Richard Burr Russia Senate Intelligence Committee testimony Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Related Stories Video: Obama warns against following certain unnamed populist opportunists in Montreal speech Allahpundit Jun 07, 2017 10:01 PM “I am convinced that the future does not belong to strongmen.” Melania Trump moving to the White House next week John Sexton Jun 07, 2017 9:21 PM “…expected to finally make their official move to Washington on June 14” Trending on Townhall Media Six Things You Can Expect From Today's Comey Hearing Redstate 'I know a rat when I see one': Rocker Courtney Love Cobain TORCHES 'fraud' Linda Sarsour Twitchy "World's Worst" Firearms Instructor Stripped Of Credentials Bearingarms Stop Lying To Us Townhall Recent Stories Change: DoJ no longer sharing lawsuit payouts with activist groups Ed Morrissey Jun 07, 2017 8:41 PM Shakedowns suspended?

Business Cybersecurity Detection Disasters Government Infrastructure Public Safety Public health Regional Sci-Tech Surveillance Terrorism Transportation Water Big dataExtracting useful insights from a flood of data is hard to do Published 7 June 2017 Share | A mantra of these data-rife times is that within the vast and growing volumes of diverse data types, such as sensor feeds, economic indicators, and scientific and environmental measurements, are dots of significance that can tell important stories, if only those dots could be identified and connected in authentically meaningful ways. Getting good at that exercise of data synthesis and interpretation ought to open new, quicker routes to identifying threats, tracking disease outbreaks, and otherwise answering questions and solving problems that previously were intractable. A mantra of these data-rife times is that within the vast and growing volumes of diverse data types, such as sensor feeds, economic indicators, and scientific and environmental measurements, are dots of significance that can tell important stories, if only those dots could be identified and connected in authentically meaningful ways. Getting good at that exercise of data synthesis and interpretation ought to open new, quicker routes to identifying threats, tracking disease outbreaks, and otherwise answering questions and solving problems that previously were intractable. Now for a reality check. “Today’s hardware is ill-suited to handle such data challenges, and these challenges are only going to get harder as the amount of data continues to grow exponentially,” said Trung Tran, a program manager in DARPA’s Microsystems Technology Office (MTO). To take on that technology shortfall, MTO last summer unveiled its Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program, which has now signed on five performers to carry out HIVE’s mandate: to develop a powerful new data-handling and computing platform specialized for analyzing and interpreting huge amounts of data with unprecedented deftness. “It will be a privilege to work with this innovative team of performers to develop a new category of server processors specifically designed to handle the data workloads of today and tomorrow,” said Tran, who is overseeing HIVE. DARPA says that the quintet of performers includes a mix of large commercial electronics firms, a national laboratory, a university, and a veteran defense-industry company: Intel Corporation (Santa Clara, California), Qualcomm Intelligent Solutions (San Diego, California), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Richland, Washington), Georgia Tech (Atlanta, Georgia), and Northrop Grumman (Falls Church, Virginia). “The HIVE program is an exemplary prototype for how to engage the U.S. commercial industry, leverage their design expertise, and enhance U.S. competitiveness, while also enhancing national security,” said William Chappell, director of MTO. “By forming a team with members in both the commercial and defense sectors, we hope to forge new R&D pathways that can deliver unprecedented levels of hardware specialization. That can be a boost for commercial players but also can advance our military electronics supply to make sure the national defense infrastructure is empowered with the best capabilities in the world.” Central to HIVE is the creation of a “graph analytics processor,” which incorporates the power of graphical representations of relationships in a network more efficiently than traditional data formats and processing techniques. Examples of these relationships among data elements and categories include person-to-person interactions as well as seemingly disparate links between, say, geography and changes in doctor visit trends or social media and regional strife. In combination with emerging machine learning and other artificial intelligence techniques that can categorize raw data elements, and by updating the elements in the graph as new data becomes available, a powerful graph analytics processor could discern otherwise hidden causal relationships and stories among the data elements in the graph representations. If HIVE is successful, it could deliver a graph analytics processor that achieves a thousand-fold improvement in processing efficiency over today’s best processors, enabling the real-time identification of strategically important relationships as they unfold in the field rather than relying on after-the-fact analyses in data centers. “This should empower data scientists to make associations previously thought impractical due to the amount of processing required,” said Tran. These could include the ability to spot, for example, early signs of an Ebola outbreak, the first digital missives of a cyberattack, or even the plans to carry out such an attack before it happens. The words in the program’s name, Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit, indicate a sequence that begins with the multi-layer graphical representations of data. This opens the way for graph analytic processing to identify relationships between data within and perhaps between the layers. A key next step is the applications of verification filters and tests that can distinguish between relationships that have causal connections from meaningless correlations among the data. “Taken together, these elements should allow us to exploit the enormous amount of data being generated today, to make better decisions about if, when, and how to act in furtherance of the public good and national security,” Tran said.

Dhruba Sen, a Town Meeting member from Precinct 10, took out nomination papers last month to run for office. Sen is one of more than a dozen people trying to secure a place on the ballot for the mayor’s race in Framingham’s upcoming city election. Sen also took out papers last month to run for an at-large seat on the new City Council. While he opposed the push to make Framingham a city, Sen said he hopes to continue his involvement in local government when the new city administration takes office in January. “Becoming a mayor, it gives me not only a privilege, but also I have lots of leverage in implementing the vision that I have,” he said. Sen, a software consultant, said his professional experience includes working for numerous public and private entities, including General Electric, IBM, Intel, Thomson Reuters, the U.S. Department of Defense, the City of Dallas and the state of New Jersey. When Sen moved to the community 30 years ago, Framingham was home to cutting edge computer companies, but the Rte. 128 belt has lost its reputation as the “Silicon Valley of the East,” Sen said. With expertise in big data, analytics, predictive modeling and cyber security, Sen said he hopes to use his background to help transform Framingham into one of the world’s top five “smart cities,” drawing high-tech companies and promoting innovation in transportation, public safety and other areas. A member of MetroWest Showing Up For Racial Justice, and lead organizer of Welcoming Framingham — a local chapter of the immigration advocacy group Welcoming America — Sen said he also plans to promote equality and protect the rights of immigrants if elected mayor. “I want to make sure that Framingham is a welcoming city,” he said. Former state Rep. John Stefanini, Town Meeting members Jim Rizoli and Yvonne Spicer, and residents Priscila Sousa, Joshua Horrigan, Scott Liftman, Tom Tierney, Roger Antos, Mark Tilden and Benjaman Neves-Grigg have also pulled papers to enter the mayor’s race. The candidates face a July 3 deadline to collect 500 signatures in order to appear on the ballot. The winner will serve a four-year term as Framingham’s first mayor. The Nov. 7 city election will also feature contests for City Council and School Committee. Voters must register by Sept. 6 to participate in the preliminary election, scheduled for Sept. 26.

News & Analysis Greengrass Embeds Amazon in IoT AWS runs on GHz-class embedded processors Rick Merritt 6/8/2017 01:01 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN FRANCISCO – Amazon Web Services can now run on a gateway or even a high-end node for the Internet of Things. Greengrass is a Linux runtime from the Web giant, aiming to extend its reach deeper into the IoT. The code aims to help businesses speed AWS-based IoT deployments. It uses Amazon’s familiar online tools to create programs that run on users’ local IoT networks, accessing and analyzing data from local IoT nodes. Since it's part of the AWS family, users can integrate with Amazon’s cloud services as needed. “There’s value in processing data at the source,” such as quick response and a known security model using AWS authentication and encryption, said Dirk Didascalou, vice president of AWS IoT at an event here. A Greengrass node also can synch a variety of other nodes when connectivity is intermittent, he added. The Web giant is perhaps the largest of more than 20 companies working on IoT software platforms for edge networks. It’s a hot area for a growing number of companies seeking their way into the Internet of Things such as Stanley Black & Decker. The tool maker selected AWS IoT as its preferred cloud services platform two years ago. It evaluated about eight edge-network IoT platforms 18 months ago and selected one from startup ClearBlade (Austin). More recently it added Greengrass, and it expects to continue evaluating the growing set of offerings. A 40-person central software team at Stanley Black & Decker sets software standards and develops code for business units trying to add digital services to their products. It helped create connected battery packs, vacuum cleaners and DIY apps among other projects to date. The fact that Greengrass requires a GHz processor with 128 Mbytes of memory and must be programmed, for now, in Python are not barriers, said Hamid Montazeri, director of software engineering for the tool maker. Such chips are becoming increasingly cheap and Stanley Black & Decker already has staff using Python in AWS, he said. Amazon attracted many partners for Greengrass given its clout in cloud computing. Intel, Qualcomm and Samsung are among chip makers that have ported Greengrass to their embedded processors. Set-top box maker Technicolor will start shipping gateways that support Greengrass to one customer later this year. Nokia has a gateway it says will support the code, too. Intel used Greengrass to bring up in two weeks an IoT use case for a mining company. Qualcomm showed a smart video camera from ThunderSoft using its Snapdragon 410E, supporting Greengrass. Samsung said its Artik 530 and 710 IoT modules support Greengrass. The chip makers typically are agnostic, supporting multiple IoT cloud services. Qualcomm, for example, also supports cloud services for Google’s Android Things as well as Verizon’s IoT initiative. Technicolor said it hopes Greengrass helps it address new vertical markets beyond the smart home. Separately, the set-top maker is already planning to integrate Amazon’s Alexa voice services in its products to help consumers set them up without the help of a technician.

Professor Winfried Hensinger reveals why it’s so important to be practical with research and how the design will work. Quantum computers have been proven in theory— now it’s time to get building. That’s the idea behind the University of Sussex’s efforts to lay out a blueprint to create a machine.  By taking advantage of quantum states, these computers will be many orders of magnitude more powerful than existing binary machines when solving certain problems. However, such a general-purpose quantum computer has yet to be built. Winfried Hensinger, professor of quantum technologies at the university, hopes to change that, revealing a blueprint that could be created using existing components, offering a practical approach to an academic problem.  We spoke to Hensinger to find out why it’s time to get practical with quantum computing and when to expect the first machine.  Why is a blueprint a breakthrough?  Quantum computing has primarily been in the field of academic research, where people look at certain effects or prove a principle. The reason people have not really been doing the engineering is it’s very difficult to build a quantum computer.  Rather than ask if it’s possible or exploring other effects or doing another proof-of-principle experiment, we’re trying to ask the question “how would you go about actually constructing a device?” We want to understand all the components: things such as energy consumption, what would be the required error rate, and what would be the technical details if we were to build a device? How does the design work? A key part of this design is that it’s fully modular. The size depends on the processing power you want. So certain problems would need a fairly small machine, while other problems would require a large machine. A normal computer has a single processor, but it isn’t capable of doing many things. For bigger tasks, you have a supercomputer where you have lots of processors working in parallel. But you wouldn’t have someone building one huge processor for that… at the manufacturing capabilities or facilities where Intel makes processors, the size of what machines can process is limited. This also applies to a quantum computer. You have a quantum computing core, but you can only manufacture that so large. You’re going to be limited by the largest wafer size a machine can process. So for us, in order to build a quantum computer that is applicable for any problem, you definitely need to make it in a modular design, meaning you can choose the number of modules according to your needs.  There have been modular designs for quantum computers, but they used photonic interconnects — optical fibre technology. We invented a new way to connect modules and that is by electric fields… this is one of the ways our approach is much simpler than any previous architectures.  Could people take these blueprints and build their own computer? The idea is to share this to advance the technology faster and bring in quantum computers sooner. We will build a prototype and a large-scale machine, but we want others to do that too.  How long will it take to build? It’s not like we can just have a single company and construct a device in a year — this is a huge project. We’re going to need help, especially building machines that can attack this full range of problems — it may be a bigger machine, filling a house. You can imagine we need a lot of talented engineers to build it.  At the University of Sussex, we’re constructing a small prototype device that will have two modules and fill a room but not a building — so it’ll be a fairly small prototype. At the same time, we’re going to look for partners to build a large-scale machine.

Leonid Bershidsky Vladimir Putin might be interested in the potential for greater control that Ethereum creates. Photo: AFP Russian President Vladimir Putin and his economic team have long been under the impression that, to wean the country off its oil dependence, they needed a major leap in some specific area of technology that wasn’t yet dominated by Western, Chinese or Japanese tech giants. Their latest hopes are being pegged to the Ethereum blockchain platform. At last week’s St Petersburg Economic Forum, Putin talked to Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum. Buterin’s family emigrated from Russia to Canada when he was 6. There, the math whiz got interested in Bitcoin while still in his teens. A $100,000 fellowship from Peter Thiel’s foundation launched him on the Ethereum project. Though Buterin’s platform does host the ether currency, which has risen in value to more than $260 from $8 so far this year, it’s far more ambitious than that. Buterin thinks of his project as the safe medium for all sorts of transactions that can be validated through a distributed system, the way Bitcoin transactions are. This includes bets, option deals, insurance contracts, the government registration of property rights and copyright—pretty much any kind of deal that requires validation or that can be automatically executed when certain conditions become right. Ethereum provides a universal blockchain upon which various projects can be built. Russia has brilliant engineering brains, and it could try to bring back talented Russians like Buterin and those who work in Silicon Valley. But it’s not easy to find the “blue ocean” areas not infested with international sharks like Apple, Google and Alibaba. In the past decade, technological bets placed by Russian leaders have suffered from being overly audacious or too far behind the competition. In 2007, Putin thought it would be nanotechnology. In typical style, he set up a giant state company to develop the tech and put former Kremlin chief of staff Anatoly Chubais, reputed to be one of the country’s best managers, at its helm. It didn’t work. Rosnano, as the company was called, struggled to find relevant projects to invest in, and the ones in which it did invest haven’t delivered the kind of breakthrough that could have propelled the Russian economy forward. Last year, Rosnano posted a steep revenue drop and a loss of 17.4 billion rubles ($307 million). During Dmitri Medvedev’s interim presidency, the Kremlin attempted a different tack, diving in with the sharks. It made a feeble attempt to create a Silicon Valley clone near Moscow in partnership with global tech companies and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Oligarchs and state companies were forced to invest. Though the Skolkovo project still exists, and so do its ambitious plans, it hasn’t delivered, either, because it attracted more attention from Russian law enforcement than from actual innovators and private investors. The search for a promising moonshot resumed when Putin became president again. Last year, he hit on Elon Musk’s hyperloop idea as something Russia could put into practice. Russia’s expanse, after all, calls for a hyperloop-style solution. At the 2016 St. Petersburg Economic Forum, Putin promised support to a company called Hyperloop One, and indeed, Kremlin-linked investors soon arrived for the start-up. Then the project ran into trouble amid bitter recriminations between co-founder Shervin Pishevar and former chief technology officer Brogan BamBrogan. The company still exists and proposes projects in a number of countries but Russia doesn’t appear to be a priority for the US firm despite the Russian investment. Lately, Ethereum has become the arena for a boom in capital-raising through the sale of digital tokens which can be used within a certain application, such as the Gnosis prediction market, which raised $12 million in 15 minutes in that way. Though large global companies got there first—the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, formed to promote the technology in various business environments, includes UBS, JP Morgan, Microsoft, Intel and other giants—Russia has a chance to be ahead of others. Like other central banks, the Russian one is testing blockchain technology: Last year, a consortium of large Russian banks it formed for the purpose processed the first transactions through the Etherium platform. With Putin’s support, the central bank can more aggressively move the country’s financial sector to the blockchain. Buterin has also offered his platform to Russia’s vast government sector, stressing its anti-corruption potential: The system is inherently transparent. I’m not sure the Putin elite is excited about this aspect of the blockchain, but Putin himself might be interested in the potential for greater control that it creates. The brief meeting between Putin and Buterin last week might open exciting prospects for the latter. His country of birth is the most impressive field for controlled experiments any techie could dream of; in Putin’s system, decisions can be made fast, and mistakes can be forgiven in the name of Russia’s great leap forward. I doubt Putin will ever have the courage to give 23-year-old Buterin a free hand to redesign Russia’s financial system or massive bureaucracy. Powerful interests will lobby against it, too. But, stuck in the 20th century both politically and economically, Russia does need a leap to remain relevant. A giant blockchain experiment might be another wrong turn—but, more likely, it would give the country a powerful modernizing impulse. Bloomberg Leonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Routine commercial use of small drones got a green light from the Obama administration June 21, 2016, after years of struggling to write regulations that would both protect public safety and unleash the economic potential and societal benefits of the new technology. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) DAYTON, Ohio (WDTN) – Fire departments in the Miami Valley are now taking to the skies to save lives.  They are the latest to catch on to the growing popularity of drones. Dayton Fire Department and Sinclair Community College Fire Academy are the first in the Miami Valley to get drones.  The flying devices are a big part of their training and emergency response team. “I do think drone will change the way people approach a lot of the aspects of Public Safety,” Sinclair Community College Fire Academy Coordinator Kip Smith said. In January, both DFD and Sinclair were able to get their drone program off the ground. “One of the really nice things about a drone is you can fly A drone in close proximity to an incident and do a complete 360 around the building or around an bad accident or trapped response end it gives the incident commander a whole new perspective on what he or she is dealing with,” Smith said. The Dayton FD pilot program used drones during hazmat training in May.  The flying device hovered around during a simulation training for a de-railed train leak.  The drones being an extra set of eyes in the sky looking out for their crew. “A lot less exposure to the firefighters and a lot more information and a lot more Intel before they went out there. A lot faster response,” smith said. Drones are being used for rope training, according to Smith, and help with search and recovery efforts as well as battling blazes. “You go out and fly over something and look for heat signatures, so from a firefighting standpoint it can show you hotspots in the structure after a fire,” Smith said. “There’s a lot of sophistication in the use of drones.  Obviously it’s not limited to public safety, but public safety certainly has picked up on the uses that are out there.” The drone used by the Dayton Fire Department cost two thousand dollars and was paid for with monies in the hazmat team budget.  The firefighters are required to undergo training and certification to fly drones.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | June 7, 2017 -- 19:51 GMT (12:51 PDT) | Topic: Internet of Things Amazon Web Services on Wednesday announced the general availability of Greengrass, its internet of things service that allows customers to run AWS compute, messaging, data caching, and sync capabilities on connected devices. Launched in limited preview at the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas late last year, Greengrass allows customers to program and update IoT devices with AWS Lambda. Developers can add Lambda functions to connected devices from the AWS Management Console, and the code can be executed locally. Devices can also send messages to other devices without connecting back to the cloud. Greengrass is available now in Amazon's US East (Northern Virginia) and US West (Oregon) regions. It will be available in other regions including APAC, Frankfurt and Sydney in the coming weeks. AWS also announced more than a dozen partners integrating AWS Greengrass into their platforms for devices that come with AWS Greengrass built-in. The partners include Annapurna, BSquare, Canonical, Digi International, Intel, Lenovo, Mongoose, Qualcomm Technologies, Raspberry Pi, Samsung, Technicolor and Wistron. At a San Francisco event showcasing Greengrass partners and customers, Intel announced the availability of an IoT enterprise development kit, Greengrass-compatible gateways and a Greengrass-enabled joint reference architecture. Qualcomm, meanwhile, announced a DragonBoard 410c development kit that supports Greengrass. special feature Harnessing IoT in the Enterprise The tech revolution is spreading to every corner of the earth with the Internet of Things, and it's enabling data analytics and automation in ways never before imagined in business.

Ensuring that thousands of them flying through the same airspace don’t crash into each other, though? That’s a bit harder. Fortunately for the future of drones, Alphabet’s X laboratory has been developing its own solution. Recommended for You First Quantum-Secured Blockchain Technology Tested in Moscow The Desktop of the Future Is Coming Experts Predict When Artificial Intelligence Will Exceed Human Performance Google Sprinkles AI on Its Spreadsheets to Automate Away Some Office Work Secret Algorithms Threaten the Rule of Law The vision of a sky filled with autonomous aircraft isn’t as ridiculous as it once seemed. Amazon has already made genuine deliveries using its quadcopters in the U.K., and a startup called Zipline has shown that its winged drones are able to deliver medical supplies to remote health-care centers in Rwanda. Add the prospect of surveying and infrastructure inspection aircraft to the mix, and it’s more believable than ever that drones could take off in great numbers before too long. But the big hitch preventing the sky from filling with drones is making sure it happens in an orderly fashion. Because many of them will fly at relatively low altitudes inside the small footprints of cities, the chances of a collision will become rather high as numbers increase. In fact, a lack of drone traffic control is often cited as one of the biggest barriers facing the adoption of aerial delivery. But Alphabet’s Project Wing, the part of the company’s moonshot laboratory known as X that's working on drone delivery, has been working with NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration to develop new systems that could allow the unmanned aircraft to avoid colliding with each as they zip through the air. We’ve previously reported on NASA’s experiments to build similar kinds of systems, but on Tuesday Alphabet’s researchers tested its new technology at Virginia Tech’s FAA-approved drone test site. The experiment used six drones in total. Three belonged to Project Wing, picking up and dropping off packages as though they were making real deliveries. Meanwhile two drones from Intel and a third from Virginia Tech carried out simulated search and rescue missions. Each aircraft was piloted by its respective owner, wirelessly sharing flight path information with Project Wing’s "unmanned aircraft systems Air Traffic Management" software—UTM for short—as it went. The system constantly analyzes where the drones are heading, notices when collisions might occur, plans new routes, and then updates their flight paths accordingly without the pilot having to take action (though it does provide operators with notifications along the way to let them know what’s happening). The same system would also in theory allow the FAA to dynamically add no-fly zones so that drones could avoid, say, an area where there was a fire. The good news: the six drones didn’t collide. The bad news: there were only six of them. But the Project Wing team says that it plans to “support more simultaneous flights and navigate environments of greater complexity” in the future. Even so, don’t expect such systems to immediately usher in widespread delivery drones. The FAA doesn’t expect to finalize its collision-avoidance standards until at least 2019.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Callum Borchers By Callum Borchers June 7 at 3:58 PM Follow @callumborchers Nearly a month after firing previous director James Comey, President Trump announced that former assistant attorney general Christopher Wray is his pick for the next FBI director. The move comes a day before Comey is set to testify in Congress. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) News of Christopher Wray's nomination to be the next FBI director seemed destined to be buried. And it was. President Trump announced his selection of Wray on Twitter on Wednesday morning, roughly two hours before intelligence chiefs were scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee and one day before a blockbuster session featuring former FBI director James B. Comey. I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 7, 2017 Trump, who fired Comey on May 9, initially expressed a sense of urgency to fill the post. The president said May 13 that he “could make a fast decision,” possibly before the start of a foreign trip just six days later. Instead, the selection process dragged out, as several candidates withdrew from consideration. Perhaps because of the odd timing of the Wray announcement — and an apparent lack of coordination, too — all of Washington was caught off-guard by the news. The Washington Post's Abby Phillip noted that the White House was slow to issue the customary statement hailing the president's nominee. 1 hour after Trump tweeted, still not a word from the White House about his FBI pick. Not a great way to defend your guy... — Abby D. Phillip (@abbydphillip) June 7, 2017 We have now entered hour #2 in which the WH still hasn't said anything about Trump's pick for FBI director. https://t.co/J4BQFaksKy — Abby D. Phillip (@abbydphillip) June 7, 2017 Three more hours passed before the White House finally got around to touting Wray as an “impeccably qualified individual” and a “fierce guardian of the law,” in a statement. Five hours after Trump tweeted it, the White House announces intent to nominate Chris Wray as FBI director. pic.twitter.com/kLHw952hn9 — Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) June 7, 2017 Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis) also didn't get a heads up and wasn't prepared to remark on Wray at his weekly press briefing. “I don't know the guy,” Ryan said. Ryan didn't get a heads up either on Wray--> pic.twitter.com/sig5GCCWiZ — Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) June 7, 2017 Trump also failed to notify top Democrats, an omission that seems unlikely to foster good will. Ranking Judiciary Feinstein and ranking Intel Warner *NOT* given a heads up on Wray nomination - per @LACaldwellDC @kasie — Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) June 7, 2017 Many of Trump's own staffers did not know about the Wray selection, either. "Most of us learned about it from the tweet," a WH official tells me of the Wray pick and Trump's morning social media announcement. — Ali Vitali (@alivitali) June 7, 2017 On the tarmac in Cincinnati where he delivered a speech Wednesday afternoon, Trump said that Wray is “going to be great” in response to a shouted question from a reporter. When asked if he’s happy with his new FBI Director pick, Christopher Wray, Pres. Trump says: “Yeah. He’s gonna be great.” pic.twitter.com/7NeloYueFq — ABC News (@ABC) June 7, 2017 But Trump did not mention Wray even once during his address. His agenda called for a focus on infrastructure projects (it's “infrastructure week,” remember?), yet he managed to slip in shots at “obstructionist” Democrats and praise for Saudi Arabia. The unveiling of Wray calls to mind the similarly disorganized rollout of Trump's original travel ban in January. Then, too, congressional leaders were kept in the dark about the president's plan, and the White House lacked a coherent messaging strategy.

For much of the last two years, the group has been collaborating with the Fund on how the business community can work towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, UN's roadmap to promote inclusive economic growth, social justice and environmental protection. This group of businesses committed to sustainability has accomplished a number of goals since it was formed in 2015, including establishing a set of pioneering public-private partnerships in areas such as food security, education, and employment for women and youth. The group has served as an important link between the business sector and SDG Fund partners to raise awareness about the SDGs, participate in research on public-private partnerships and promote best practices. Under our ongoing strategy, the group will intensify its work on advancing and advocating for greater inclusion linked to the goals and helping us widen our private-sector approach. Advocacy and outreach The PSAG continues to play a vital role in informing the SDG Fund on how businesses can better work with partners at the UN, particularly how they can improve people's living standards and make investments that will create more jobs. It's also become clear that companies are slowly embracing and adopting the Sustainable Development Goals in their strategies -- working on projects that align with their core business and interest and adhere to a larger framework In fact, the SDG Fund has engaged new private sector partners to generate a number of key initiatives, including the Food Africa Project in Nigeria, an innovative partnership between private enterprise, UN and government agencies, and renowned chefs that aims to alleviate poverty through food security. At the SDG Fund, it is clear that companies are eager to think more expansively on their role in development, and business of all sizes are demonstrating that they can effectively incorporate SDGs as a part of their strategic planning. There are a few signs that we are on track, especially as members of the Private Sector Advisory Group continue to provide valuable perspective about building new partnerships to eradicate poverty, achieve food security and improve nutrition, water access and sanitation. Since joining the group, many companies have successfully incorporated the SDGs into their work and sustainability reports. For example, Nutresa and Sahara Groupnow report annual results and sustainability activities using SDG goals and indicators. More than half of the members are engaging with the SDG Fund to create public-private partnerships and working to design and co-create programs in the field. Equally encouraging is that new companies, like Intel have joined the group. It is probably worth noting that a business as usual approach is no longer possible. Thankfully, the number of businesses interested in joining forces on the SDGs has been encouraging. Companies like Ebro Foods have used the power of social media to raise awareness about a new initiative that brings together philanthropists, governments and academics. Other milestones include the engagement of UN Goodwill Ambassadors - the Roca Brothers. The master chef brothers have committed to bringing attention to the SDGs and using their expertise to advocate for enhanced food security and access to nutritious food. They are working with local partners to provide guidance on how to improve food industry and agricultural practices to protect the environment and create jobs. In 2017, working with our public and private sector partners we have witnessed how companies have continued to deepen their knowledge of the SDGs, asking key questions and exploring how their organizations can contribute to the global development agenda. This has come to mean everything from devising innovative partnership agreements to investing in large-scale infrastructure or improving agriculture inputs. In fact, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery building on this group's experience, some countries have drawn lessons from our success and began replicating the model and creating national versions of the group. For example, Nigeria, recently launched a Private Sector Advisory Group. The private sector has come together to advise the government to share ideas across industry sectors and regions with the aim of creating a connective platform for more impactful and local-driven models and solutions to achieve the SDGs. Projects in the pipeline We believe there is a lot to do in the next 13 years, we know from our series of reports, there must also be more robust public-private collaboration across the UN to achieve SDGs start taking shape. We heard and we listed to companies as reflected in our "Business and the United Nations: How business can contribute to the SDGs," which provided case studies and best practice advice for companies eager to engage in the SDGs. A second report, "Universality and the SDGs: A Business Perspective," put out this year was based on input from more than 100 companies during interactive workshops in Africa, Latin America, Europe and the United States. Looking forward, the SDG Fund is committed to bringing public and private institutions together to achieve development results. Our private sector strategy has two objectives: to involve businesses in all of our 22 field programs and expand the reach of our global business advisory partners. We are also preparing a new report, taking a deep dive into how businesses can contribute to peace outlined as part of SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions). As in much of our work, this will be a collaborative effort with the University of Pennsylvania Law School and McDermott Will & Emery LLP to analyze the links between inclusive growth, partnerships and peace. As champions for promoting the SDGs, we also believe that policy, direction and action will be instrumental for setting the stage for SDG integration. We look forward to working with the private sector and continuing to explore ways to create an ongoing mechanism to boost cooperation and development through the SDGs in all industries. © Inter Press Service (2017) — All Rights ReservedOriginal source: Inter Press Service Where next?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars CLOUD AWS launches Greengrass IoT service out of preview Blair Hanley Frank@belril June 7, 2017 11:17 AM Above: Amazon Web Services (AWS). Image Credit: Thomas Cloer/Flickr Amazon Web Services dove deeper into providing services for the Internet of Things today with the official launch of its Greengrass service. The new offering helps customers handle processing of data on edge devices and communication from those devices to the AWS cloud. Greengrass lets customers write functions that can be deployed on compatible devices and run in response to triggers from local hardware or the AWS cloud. Using those functions, it’s possible to handle data processing without a network connection, which is key for IoT devices. Greengrass also handles secure connections between embedded hardware and Amazon’s cloud, so it’s possible for customers to pass data back and forth. The service, which AWS announced at its re:Invent conference in Las Vegas last year, helps the cloud provider compete on a key battlefield. All of the major cloud providers have some set of IoT services to help enterprises take advantage of connected devices. However, AWS is one of the first among its cohort to provide generally available first-party services for edge processing, which could be a key benefit for attracting customers and hardware partners. In particular, Greengrass has beaten Microsoft’s Azure IoT Edge service to general availability, which gives the company an advantage, according to Dima Tokar, the cofounder and CTO of MachNation. “For prospective customers evaluating cloud platforms, the general availability of Greengrass will give AWS temporary advantage over Azure, as it provides a production-ready set of capabilities for edge devices,” he said in an email. “For hardware vendors evaluating cloud platforms, Amazon shipping Greengrass means vendors can take a generally available product from a leading cloud vendor and begin integrating it into their hardware.” One of the other key benefits of Greengrass is that the functions users run on their edge devices are built using AWS Lambda, the company’s “serverless” processing service. In theory, it’s possible for developers to write one Lambda function that will run both in Amazon’s cloud and on edge devices. There are three laws that AWS thinks about when building edge computing capabilities, according to Dirk Didascalou, the cloud provider’s vice president of IoT. It’s not possible to transfer data faster than the laws of physics allow, and sending data over a network isn’t fast enough for some applications. The laws of the land can require certain security or privacy practices that make cloud or IoT use more difficult, and the laws of economics can make it harder to send large volumes of data from edge devices to the cloud in a cost-effective manner. AWS Greengrass is aimed at addressing those problems. As part of the launch, Intel announced a new IoT Dev Kit and Greengrass compatible gateways to help hardware manufacturers and enterprises adopt the new services. Qualcomm also said that its DragonBoard 410c development kit now supports Greengrass, and showed customer hardware that integrated with the new service. Starting Tuesday, the Greengrass cloud service will be generally available out of AWS’ Northern Virginia and Oregon data centers. The service will be made available from the cloud provider’s Frankfurt and Sydney regions in the coming weeks, Didascalou said. Greengrass-capable devices can be deployed worldwide. Updated at 12:35 Pacific Time with comments from Dima Tokar.  Correction June 7, 2017: We initially said the DragonBoard 410c was new. It is not. The DragonBoard 410c was released in March 2015. We have updated the article accordingly.

2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Humaniq has launched an office in Silicon Valley, CA. Humaniq Opens New US Office in Silicon Valley (PRNewsfoto/Humaniq) Humaniq https://humaniq.co/, the Ethereum-based blockchain banking app offering financial inclusion solutions for the unbanked, just opened a new office space in San Francisco, following a successful pre-seed funding campaign that reached nearly 12,000 participants and surpassed $5.2 Million.      (Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/520901/Humaniq_SiliconValleyHQ.jpg )      (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/494007/Humaniq_Logo.jpg ) This development will intensify the capacity of Humaniq to accelerate its global social impact by working alongside leading organizations and influencers in San Francisco. Additionally, the move will capacitate world-class technologists in finding solutions to fundamental global issues facing humanity. "Humaniq's new US HQ in Silicon Valley allows us to be a piece of the powerful technological puzzle that has produced success after success in numerous areas of Industry 4.0.," said Humaniq CEO, Dinis Guarda. "With a footprint in California, Humaniq will be able to share its vision of empowering the unbanked using technology while enlisting unparalleled genius from the vibrant and successful business community." The office, which opened on May 3, will house a small research and business development team including Senior Advisor Lene Schulze, a thought leader, business developer, and strategist. Lene has worked around the world but been based in San Francisco for the past 13 years where she has advised and accelerated numerous startups' growth through platforms such as SCALEit.us and Nordic Innovation House. She has assisted many large corporations in the digital transformation and other innovation processes through innovation centers she has established for Monitor Deloitte Nordic, 42 Associates and the Danish government in Silicon Valley. The office will also have the support of Humaniq senior Advisors: veteran technology expert and investor Patrick Chung and the director of Groupe INSEEC San Francisco Ron Morris, an expert in education and innovation who has been developing relationships with industry and academic thought leaders in Europe and the US for over a decade. "I am excited to welcome and introduce a truly purpose-driven startup, Humaniq to San Francisco" said Lene Schulze, Senior advisor at Humaniq. "There are significant developments in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space happening right here in Silicon Valley that Humaniq will have to stay connected to and not least there are many potential partners who could be crucial in reaching the grand goal of helping 1 billion unbanked". Headquartered in Luxembourg, with offices in London, Humaniq aims to tap into innovation around the world. Home to globally recognized technology corporations such as Facebook, Apple, Adobe Systems, eBay, Tesla Motors, Intel, and Netflix, the San Francisco Bay Area was a clear choice. San Francisco, in particular, is an ideal home for transformational business start ups with tremendous potential for social impact, making it the perfect ecosystem for Humaniq's US headquarters. "Given the breadth and might of American brands, products, and proficiency, the U.S. was the clear option as we pursued a home for our first office outside of Europe," said Alex Fork, Founder of Humaniq. "This development gives us an opportunity to be a part of a world-class environment that caters to entrepreneurs and small businesses, and welcomes our mission of social impact and banking the unbanked." This expansion into the U.S. with a new office signals the continued momentum behind Humaniq as an organization and as a movement in developing banking 4.0 as well as using blockchain for social good. It will also allow Humaniq to demonstrate the potential uses of its technologies, and the significant opportunities of doing so for startups, foundations, and a wide variety of businesses in the Bay Area ecosystem. Our base is global, national and now regional, which allows our entire organization to benefit from our new presence in San Francisco," said Humaniq Executive Chairman, Dmitry Kaminskiy. "We have a powerful startup undergoing natural development and we look forward to watching Humaniq grow in size and impact. About Humaniq: Humaniq is an Ethereum-based blockchain banking app building the next generation model for financial inclusion services. Launched in 2016, Humaniq aims to provide mobile finance to the 2 billion unbanked population through its mobile app that uses biometric authentication to replace traditional methods of ID and security. Humaniq's open source stack and API will be available for startups and other businesses to build services on its core technology, making it easy to adapt their service and plug it into Humaniq's network to reach a huge, untapped audience.

(IBM) Leads the Silicon Race IBM stock may be slow to respond, but it also has a healthy dividend By Greg Gambone, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jun 7, 2017, 11:50 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Facebook Inc (FB) to Pull WhatsApp Off IBM Cloud Servers International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Leads the Silicon Race Recent Posts: Facebook Inc (FB) to Pull WhatsApp Off IBM Cloud Servers International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Leads the Silicon Race Are Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Visa Inc (V) in Trouble With Apple Pay Lawsuit? View All Posts International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) announced Monday that its research department has successfully developed the world’s first ever 5-nanometer chip. What does that mean, though? TechRadar.com describes it like this: “In case you’re wondering how small that is in real terms, a nanometer is one billionth of a meter. A single blood cell is 7,000 nanometres wide.” Source: Connie Zhou/IBM So, for the non-geeks, we’re talking about the tiniest microscopic chip ever — “a 5-nanometer device is just a few atoms thick.” What’s more, this development has made it possible for IBM to jam more than 30 billion transistors onto a single piece of silicon the size of your fingernail. If you’re unfamiliar with the inner workings of electronic circuitry, transistors are essentially on-of switches. The announcement was made at the 2017 Symposia on VLSI Technology and Circuits conference in Kyoto, where IBM presented its groundbreaking wafer and explained that it can deliver performance enhancements of more than 40% alongside a 75% reduction in power usage. IBM said: “Let that sink in while reading this article on a mobile device with 10 percent power left: 5nm chips would give you hours, not minutes, before needing to recharge. A future 5nm-chip-powered mobile device will last days longer than what’s in your hand right now.” Developers went on to explain in excruciating detail the methodology used to create IBM’s 5nm chips, and how significantly it differs from the current 10nm processes. If you really want to know, head over to IBM’s announcement post on the company’s THINK Blog. Unfortunately, it’s a bit too comprehensive for me and my eyes started to glaze over as I read about nodes and FinFET transistors and silicon nanosheets. What I was able to take away from IBM’s announcement post is that its 5nm chips are expected to be available within the next three-to-five years. What’s the Big Deal With a 5nm Chip? The development of the 5nm chip is monumental for the future of technology, as it opens the door for even more advanced applications that would not have been possible otherwise using today’s leading 10nm silicon. Essentially, the processes used to develop those 10nm chips has reached its maximum capacity. According to Forbes, Mukesh Khare, the VP of semiconductor technology research at IBM explained that, “Geometrically, FinFETs cannot scale anymore.” So, basically, they’re already as small as they can get. Even if they were able to further shrink the current chips to 5nm, “the denser transistors on that architecture doesn’t boost performance because the closer fins don’t provide more current flow.” With a legitimate working 5nm chip, IBM has just positioned itself at the front of the pack. Competitors such as Samsung Electronic (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) currently produce only 10nm chips holding approximately 10-15 million transistors. The new IBM chip is half the size and contains more than twice as many transistors. For specific segments of the technology industry such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, machine deep learning and autonomous vehicles, the ability to incorporate chips that consume 75% less power while performing 40% better will be extremely advantageous and serve to further increase the speed of developments in those fields. Simply put, these new IBM chips should open the door to countless advancements in an array of major tech fields.

Google Maps image from CNN. During a test drive near Ford's Michigan headquarters, the team noticed something strange with its self-driving cars. Each car shifted slightly at the same point in the lane "as if they were avoiding a pothole," says Jim McBride, Ford's senior technical leader for autonomous cars. The problem wasn't the cars -- it was the map. The team had just updated its 3D map of the test route, which helps guide self-driving cars. But a minor glitch caused one pixel on the map to have the wrong data value. It told the car a spot in the ground was raised 10 inches, when it was perfectly level. "The new map looked perfect to the human eye," McBride says. But not to the eye of a self-driving car. "A single incorrect pixel," he says, was enough to throw off the cars. The power of that tiny mapping glitch, which happened a few years ago, highlights the newfound importance of a product many consumers likely take for granted. For much of the last decade, digital maps have helped people pull up basic directions while walking and driving. But tech and auto companies are investing in a new generation of maps for a much more demanding audience: self-driving cars. These maps, often referred to as HD maps, go far beyond basic turn-by-turn directions. Some incorporate continuously updating data on lane markings, street signs, traffic signals, potholes and even the height of a curb -- all down to the centimeter. The maps help the car place itself in the world with a greater degree of accuracy, augmenting the sensors in the vehicle. As an example, McBride says maps can guide cars when the lane markings are covered by snow or a truck is blocking the car's view of a traffic signal. It can also free up car sensors to focus on detecting objects not included on the map, like pedestrians. Maps may not get as much attention as videos of self-driving cars on the road, or the LIDAR laser sensors at the heart of a blockbuster lawsuit between Uber and Google. But they are a key piece of the puzzle under the hood. Maps could help ensure safer deployment of self-driving cars in the next years. And they may just have the potential to create a new billion-dollar industry. "If you have an autonomous car, then the map is not going to be an optional feature," says John Ristevski, former VP of Here, a mapping business once owned by Nokia that offers HD maps. "It's going to be a core component of the vehicle that will produce ongoing revenue." Unlike traditional navigation systems sold by companies like TomTom, HD maps may need to be updated as much as daily for certain regions. For example, a busy city street that goes through construction and pedestrian areas might need more frequent data than a long, uninterrupted freeway. Ristevski says that opens up the possibility of a subscription model that could one day bring in "billions" for mapping companies. The race to build up this next generation of maps is only getting more crowded. Google, Uber, Ford and others are each working to collect data for HD maps with sensors in their autonomous cars. At Waymo, Google's self-driving car division, staffers parse out the data collected to identify objects like driveways and fire hydrants. The cars then "automatically send reports back to our mapping team whenever they detect changes" like construction, according to the company. But this approach is difficult even for companies with a strong bench of technical talent. "If you thought creating regular maps for Google was hard, creating self-driving maps is much, much harder," says Brian McClendon, Uber's former VP of maps who previously worked on Google Maps. "The amount of data involved is huge. The precision required is very hard as well." A number of automakers, including General Motors and Volkswagen, have opted to lean more on third-party services to get their maps off the ground. Mobileye, a self-driving car firm recently acquired by Intel for $15 billion, inked agreements in April with Volkswagen, BMW and Nissan for a mapping product. The goal is to pool together mapping data from car manufacturers "to generate as much scale as possible," says Dan Galves, Mobileye's chief communications officer. "You can spend the money, hire the people -- assuming you can hire the right guys -- but that will take years. That happens too late for this race," says James Wu, a veteran of the mapping teams at Google and Apple. His startup, DeepMap, announced $32 million in funding last month that will provide a "full-stack mapping service" to companies. Other mapping startups like Civil Maps, backed by Ford, and Mapbox are also working with automakers. Carmera, another startup, came out of stealth mode this week with $6.4 million in funding and plans to crowdsource "real-time" data for maps. That includes offering "pedestrian analytics" and a "real-time event feed" for construction and road closures. Google remains the obvious frontrunner. The company has deep pockets and a longer history investing in self-driving cars and mapping products like Street View and Google Earth. Lars Rasmussen, co-creator of Google Maps, remembers Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin telling his team years ago that they'd "have to spend billions of dollars" on maps "and it's worth it." "I think one of the reasons that [maps] excited Larry was that he had this idea of self-driving cars," says Rasmussen, who left Google for Facebook in 2010. Google may have won the first online mapping battle (sorry Apple), but the HD maps market is still in its early days. The winner -- or winners -- is far from the finish line. If you believe self-driving cars will eventually operate everywhere, then every city and street will need to be mapped out in granular detail. To put that in context, Uber's self-driving car team is currently mapping just one city, according to its website: Toronto. "It's a green field," says Sravan Puttagunta, founder and CEO of CivilMaps. "No company has established a majority market share, and even the ones that have a couple cities are spending billions maintaining those maps." As the race heats up, there is a lingering question in the industry about how useful these costly maps will be down the road. Some argue the cars will eventually get smart enough, with deep learning technology, not to need to rely on extensive maps. "In the short term, I can see where it's vital, but that long term may not even be 10 years," says Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst with Kelley Blue Book. The "conundrum," she says, is just as comprehensive maps hit the market, car companies "don't need them anymore." The team at Ford is "looking at the possibility" of developing algorithms for the car that don't require a prior map, according to McBride. But he's skeptical of ditching maps entirely. "You'd still save the data that you took the first time you drove there," McBride says, "and use it for the second, third and tenth time to make it better."

While a lot of recent news has focussed on CPU-related overclocks, today we got word that a new world record had been set for DDR4 frequency, with a G.Skill kit breaking past the 5500MHz barrier. This record was achieved by Taiwanese professional overclocker ‘Toppc’, using a new G.Skill Trident-Z DDR4 memory kit with Samsung-made 8Gb ICs. The overclock was dialled in on an MSI X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC motherboard using one of Intel’s new X-series CPUs. This news follows on from Computex 2016, when Toppc previously set the record for highest DDR4 memory speeds, using G.Skill memory and an MSI Z170I motherboard to break the 5GHz barrier. Now one year later, he has managed to push that even further to 5.5GHz with the help of liquid nitrogen for cooling. As Tequila Huang, VP of G.Skill puts it, this new record shows “amazing overclocking potential” for newly released hardware and this could just be the beginning. Over the course of the year, more professional overclockers will be stepping up to the plate to achieve records. KitGuru Says: Record-breaking overclocks like this are a good look at what hardware is capable of when pushed to the absolute limits. It’ll be a few years before this sort of memory frequency is possible for consumers though.

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffTop Democrat: Comey statement 'certainly evidence of interference or obstruction' Schiff: I'm the spouse in a 'bad marriage' with Trump Second Dem joins effort to impeach Trump MORE (Calif.), the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting one of the multiple probes into Russia’s election meddling and possible ties to the Trump campaign. “The hearings this week are going to be very important to understand what role the president played in the effort to derail any part of the Russia investigation, as has been alleged,” he added, referring to a pair of Senate Intelligence Committee hearings happening this week. “But I don’t want to leap to any conclusions about what we’ll ultimately find or what the consequences should be. ADVERTISEMENT “We’re still very early in the investigative process.” Rep. Linda Sánchez (Calif.), vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said Schiff’s view reflects the “overwhelming sentiment” among the Democrats. “A majority of the Caucus is of the belief that we ought to allow the investigation to continue to its logical conclusion before making any determination,” she told reporters in the Capitol. The comments come just hours before Rep. Al GreenAl GreenLiberal group MoveOn calls for Trump to be impeached Second Dem joins effort to impeach Trump Top Dems reject impeachment push MORE (D-Texas) is set to announce that he’s drafting articles of impeachment related to Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey. Comey was leading the administration’s investigation into the Russia affair and had reportedly rebuffed entreaties by the president to drop elements of the probe — a refusal that led to his firing. Comey is scheduled to testify before the Senate Intel Committee on Thursday. Green contends the Comey firing represents an impeachment-worthy case of obstruction of justice. “Obstruction of justice by the President is the problem,” he said Tuesday night in a statement. “Impeachment by Congress is the solution.” It’s unclear if other Democrats will support Green’s effort. Green declined to comment Wednesday morning, and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), another vocal supporter of working to impeach Trump, also deflected questions. “I have not even thought about it,” Waters told The Hill. Green’s impeachment articles, marking the first step in the official process of removing a sitting president, have almost no chance of moving through a House chamber controlled by Republicans allied with Trump. But the maneuver is sure to energize the Democrats’ liberal base, where the appetite for impeachment has grown with each new revelation in the Russia probe.  Democratic leaders, however, are concerned that the aggressive impeachment push might politicize the Russia-Trump investigations to an extent that Republicans will abandon the process altogether. They suspect that revelations unearthed by the ongoing investigations will be damning enough, without an aggressive push for impeachment.  Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, called Green’s impeachment effort “premature,” arguing that his constituents want Democrats to fight for bread-and-butter economic issues in lieu of an impeachment effort that has no legs. “They don’t see calls for an impeachment that’s not going to happen anytime soon to be in the service of making their lives better,” he said. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.), former ranking member of the House Intel Committee, delivered a similar message. “In order to take the politics out of it — for the benefit of the country — we need to make sure we get the facts and the elements of what we have to prove,” he said. “And we’re not there yet.”  Tags Adam Schiff Al Green   View the discussion thread.

In what has been dubbed Super Thursday, testimony will arrive from former FBI director James Comey on Russian interference in the 2016 election, the U.K. general election will take place and the EU central bank will hand down its decision on monetary policy. In the meantime, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.02%, S&P 500 futures have inched 0.06% higher and Nasdaq-100 futures have edged 0.07% higher. On the options front, volume leaped back into action on Tuesday, with roughly 16.5 million calls and 12.9 million puts crossing the tape. On the CBOE, calls remained front and center, with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio arriving at 0.59. The 10-day moving average, meanwhile, held at 0.61. Diving into Tuesday’s options activity, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is currently in the midst of its annual WWDC, but the stock has barely moved despite product refreshes including new iMac and iMac Pro lineups. Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) saw heavy call option volume on news that it’s GPUs are lacking supply heading into new product launches this month. Finally, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and other banking issues are being pressured by falling long-term interest rates. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Back in Apple’s heyday, the annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) was an even looked forward to by both consumers and investors. New product launches and fresh ideas mingled with refreshes of popular product lines. That was then. Now, the biggest thing to come out of this year’s WWDC is an updated line of iMacs and iMac Pros that, honestly, brings Apple’s computers up to date with current PC models (i.e., iMacs are finally getting access to Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i7 processors — chips PCs have had for years). Apple has essentially gone nowhere this week during the conference, but that hasn’t stopped AAPL options traders from speculating. On Tuesday, more than 1 million contracts changed hands, with calls snapping up a hefty 72% of the day’s take. What’s more, AAPL options traders appear to be holding out for that “one more thing”, as the June 9 put/call open interest ratio is currently perched at 0.65, with calls on the verge of doubling puts in this weekly series that is focused heavily on the WWDC. The conference is still taking place, so there is still time, but the offerings from Apple so far could leave bulls in the lurch. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) While the WWDC hasn’t done much for AAPL, it has given a boost to AMD. Advanced Micro Device’s Radeon Pro series is making its way into the new iMac Pros, scoring a coup for the semiconductor maker. Additionally, just as AMD is scheduled to release its new GPU line at the end of the month, reports are emerging that supplies of existing GPUs are lacking, hinting at strong demand for AMD.

In fact, AMBA stock is off by more than 10% so far in Wednesday’s trade. Our Luke Lango, in his preview of the quarter, acknowledged the risk but called the stock a good long-term play because of the promise its chips — which first powered the GoPro Inc (NASDAQ:GPRO) camera — could be a key ingredient in the next decade’s autonomous transportation revolution. They think the chips will go into self-driving cars. Everyone in tech is betting on autonomy. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is said to be doing it. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) already has. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has gotten rich on it. Uber stands accused of stealing it. Ambarella could be the next boom’s arms merchant. The argument is that you buy the dip on the hype, wait until either the field takes off, and profit! This veteran tech reporter has a different story to tell about AMBA stock. Come with me, then, into the cave of riches known as Moore’s Law. The Cave of Moore’s Law Moore’s Law — the idea that the chip density can double (and prices can halve) every year or two — has been the driving force of technology for 50 years. It may be the only thing the 2017 stock market believes in, given that the five most-valuable companies in the world — Apple, Google, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) — all use it to power their clouds. But Moore’s Law isn’t just a story of wealth. It’s also a story of wealth’s destruction. Because chips get better every year, PCs rot like fruit on a warehouse floor. Their value declines rapidly with time. Companies that make chips, even mighty Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), have to race ever-faster just to keep up. Then there is Moore’s “Second Law”: As chips become more complex, their production becomes more capital-intensive. Only three of the hundreds of companies that emerged from the PC revolution are still with us — Apple and Microsoft are the other two. Most of the diamonds in Moore’s cave are glass. Interesting in that they’re made of the same thing — silicon. Hardware Becomes Software Ambarella chips “see.” They process incoming light or other waves into digital information, then translate that information into inputs a drone can use to avoid obstacles, or a car can use to drive itself. They are a vital ingredient in self-driving cars, which must process all kinds of incoming data, on all kinds of frequencies, to replicate what you do every day when you decide to make that left turn into incoming traffic.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Judge Andrew Napolitano said the choice of Christopher Wray to be the next FBI director exposes a "little bit of a rift" between the Department of Justice and the White House. The Fox News analyst said Wray, a former DOJ official in the George W. Bush administration, brings "impeccable credentials." However, Judge Napolitano told "Fox & Friends" that the choice also surfaces some discord between President Donald Trump and his attorney general. "This also indicates to me a little bit of a rift between the Justice Department and the White House because this is not somebody that was interviewed by Jeff Sessions or Rod Rosenstein," Napolitano said. "Meaning all the people that the attorney general and the deputy attorney general interviewed on a Saturday and a Sunday at the president's instructions, (Wray) was not on that list. "The president decided to make the decision on his own, irrespective of what his team at the Justice Department advised," Napolitano told Fox News. Napolitano also called "irrelevant" the fact that Wray defended New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie over the Bridge-gate incident that ended in conviction for two of Christie's top aides. "There's a drawback here that I'm sure Democrats will exploit, that is Bridge-gate," Napolitano said. "A lot of people felt he did a great job there. But that is going to open up. That in my view is irrelevant to his qualifications to be director of the FBI. But you can certainly expect it." Other early reactions to the nomination of Wray on social media have been mostly positive: “I don’t know Christopher Wray. I hear he has a good reputation." -- Va.

In all, seven new Macs were announced, even the lowly Macbook Air received a modest bump. Shortly after the keynote I was loaned a review unit of the updated 27-inch iMac. The first thing you'll notice on this iMac is the screen. The display is just incredible. I use the previous generation 27-inch 5K iMac at work, the late 2015 model, and it's a gorgeous machine, probably the best computer I've ever owned. Certainly the best monitor. I do a lot of video and photo editing on that iMac, staring at the screen for hours every day, and I know its display well.

More videos Apple drops its latest gear The computer giant unveils an enormous assortment of new products. So I was surprised at how much better the screen is on this new iMac. It's brighter for sure, 43 per cent brighter in fact, but it's the colour reproduction that is so impressive. The late 2015 iMac was the first Apple computer to use wide gamut P3 colour, vastly superior to the sRGB found in most monitors. That expanded colour gamut produced a pretty astounding 24 million colours, setting the benchmark for these types of displays. This new 27-inch iMac features "10 bit dithering" which, if I understand it correctly, changes the individual shading within each pixel — and between pixels — to expand the perceived colours on display. To be honest, 10 bit dithering was explained to me by three different engineers these last few days, and I'm still not entirely sure how it works. But I can say the monitor now supports over a billion colours, and it looks bloody amazing. Related Content Apple's Macs in need of a non-'Pro' shake-up All the cool new features coming to your iPhone Powering the displays are high-end chips from the Radeon Pro 500 family. These chips give the iMac up to 1.5 times better performance and, as noted in the keynote on Monday, are the first Apple computers capable of powering high-end VR headsets like the HTC Vive, or Oculus. More important to professional creatives that make up much of Apple's core audience, the Radeon Pro 500 GPUs offer acceleration for a number of applications including Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Photoshop. Of course Apple's own apps Final Cut Pro, Motion and Logic are already tuned for performance on these new Macs. Advertisement The new iMacs use Intel's 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors. The main benefits of Kaby Lake will be felt in the laptop line up, but the iMacs received speed bumps over the previous generation. You can also double the memory on the 27-inch iMac, this new model supports up to 64GB of RAM. The SSDs have received a speed boost too, bringing them up to the performance of the latest MacBook Pros, with write speeds of 3Gbps. You'll feel that in copying files, and video editors will love the faster transfer speeds. If your budget doesn't allow for an SSD, even the SSD elements of the Fusion drive are upgraded to 3Gbps. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The new 27-inch iMac. Photo: Peter Wells For the record, my review had a full 500GB SSD, 16GB of RAM, and the high-end Radeon Pro 560 video card. Testing out the iMac I could immediately notice the improvements these new internals brought. While I could edit some 4K video on my current iMac, not all 4K video is the same. Footage coming from the new Panasonic GH5, at 4:2:2 10-bit, would grind Final Cut Pro to a halt. The only way to tackle it was by editing proxy footage. The new iMac not only handles full 4:2:2 10-bit 4K footage, it can edit multiple layers of 4K without breaking a sweat. Similarly, browsing a full Photos library was a much smoother, snappier experience. Apple isn't pitching this machine at gamers, and the Mac still can't compete with the range of games available on Windows machines, but I thought it would be worth testing the gaming capabilities of this new iMac. I fired up Steam and installed Max Payne 3, the most graphically intensive game in my library. As a casual gamer, the results were impressive. Max Payne 3 played in 1080p without any jittering or lag, with all those funky real time bullet effects rendering beautifully. More impressive are games built to support Apple's Metal, which accelerates graphic performance on the hardware. I played F1 2016, optimised with Metal, and the lighting, speed and smoothness of graphics were something I've never experienced on a Mac. Again, I'm sure a PC box with the latest Nvidia GeForce 1080ti graphics card would be better for hardcore gamers, but this is the first Mac to compete with modern consoles like the Xbox One or PS4 in gaming quality. Overall, performance was noticeably better in almost every app I tried, from Photoshop to Final Cut Pro. This new iMac was much faster than the iMac back on my desk at work, and noticeably better than the Microsoft Surface I was testing a few weeks back. In a strange twist, the new iMac has just two USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Apple has decided to keep the four legacy USB A ports on their latest desktop, here USB C with Thunderbolt 3 replaces the older Thunderbolt 2 ports. That means any of your legacy USB drives or accessories will continue to work without a dreaded dongle, but you'll still have access to high speed Thunderbolt 3 accessories, like this Thunderbolt 3 RAID. Thunderbolt 3 can also power external displays, so you can plug in either one 5K monitor, or two 4k monitors, in case the built-in 5K monitor just doesn't give you enough pixels. Rounding out the ports are ethernet, an SD Card reader, and a headphone jack. Sadly, this stunning new iMac will be staying in San Jose as I make my way back to Sydney. My first task back in the office will be writing up the business case on why I need to upgrade my 2015 iMac. The new 27-inch iMacs start at $2549. The iMac I tested was $3499.

I can find peoples benchmark results but not proper comparison, looks like Corsair is faster. P.S. If you want NVMe for cheap, Intel 600p 256GB is less than 100USD for people outside EU on Amazon UK, no taxes and shipping for such small item is low, . Also Amazon UK has sale if you fill 30GBP giftcard you get 5GBP extra. Intel 600p 128Gb is almost twice cheaper but its as slow as SATA, but has maybe better reads.

The new platforms are for high-end workstations and designed to support up to four graphics cards though the 60 PCIe lanes from the CPU, over a dozen of storage devices and up to eight DIMMs. To a large degree, ASRock’s motherboards reflect overall positioning of the AMD X399 “ThreadRipper” platform as a premium high-end desktop play, and what to generally expect from makers of mainboards here. ASRock plans to offer two motherboards for AMD’s ThreadRipper CPUs: the X399 Professional Gaming and the X399 Taichi. The mainboards are based on the same PCB (and the same AMD X399 chipset/socket), but have a slightly different feature set. The ThreadRipper motherboards that ASRock demonstrated at Computex featured an eight-phase digital CPU VRM, which is the feasible limit given the physical space available, but we have no idea the capabilities of the power delivery as of yet. ThreadRipper is meant to be a high performance, high power processor, so undoubtedly the motherboard vendors have built their boards to match. When it comes to the socket itself, it has 4094 pins and is very large (not surprising given its origin). We've seen the socket referred to as SP3r2 and TR4, although the official word from AMD is that it is the 'X399 platform'. It will be interesting to see whether any motherboard maker manages to design a Mini-ITX mainboard for the ThreadRipper, but we will see. As we understand it, one of the problems with the socket, apart from the dimensions, is its cost to manufacturers that is prohibitively high at this time. Both of the X399 motherboards from ASRock have eight DDR4 memory slots, but the manufacturer does not disclose speeds, ECC support and other details (although given previous discussions, we expect at least ECC and DDR4-2400). In fact, it does not even reveal the maximum amount of memory supported by the CPU. Though even if the company does know, it's almost certain that AMD wants to hold all of these cards close to their chest for future product announcements. The X399 Professional Gaming physically has four PCIe 3.0 x16 slots (electrically set at two x16 and two x8) that can support up to four-way AMD CrossFireX or NVIDIA SLI multi-GPU configurations, as well as PCIe SSDs. In addition, there is a PCIe 3.0 x1 slot. As for storage options, ASRock has most configurations covered: the motherboard carries eight SATA ports, a U.2 connector, as well as three M.2 slots. To ensure that there is enough power for the latter, there is a 6-pin PCIe power connector right near the SATA ports. As for network connectivity, the motherboard features a 10 GbE port using Aquantia's AQC solution, two GbE headers (enabled by Intel controllers), as well as a 2x2 802.11 Wi-Fi module with Bluetooth. As for USB, there are 10 USB 3.0 ports in addition to two USB 3.1 ports (Type-A and Type-C) on the back panel. Finally, the X399 Professional Gaming has a 7.1 audio sub-system enhanced using Creative Labs’ SoundBlaster software. ASRock's X399 Professional Gaming and X399 Taichi for AMD ThreadRipper CPUs   X399 Professional Gaming X399 Taichi CPU Support AMD ThreadRipper CPUs in LGA4094 form-factor Graphics 4 × PCIe 3.0 x16 (2 × x16, 2 × x8) 4-way AMD CrossFireX and NVIDIA SLI supported Chipset AMD X399 Memory Eight DDR4 DIMM slots Ethernet 1 × 10 GbE Aquantia AQtion AQC107 2 × Intel GbE controllers 2 × Intel GbE controllers Storage 8 × SATA 6 Gbps 3 × M.2 (PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA) 1 × U.2 (PCIe 3.0 x4) Audio Realtek ALC1220 (?) 7.1 channel audio with Creative Labs SoundBlaster Cinema 3 enhancements Realtek ALC1220 (?) 7.1 channel audio with ASRock Purity Sound 4 USB 8 × USB 3.0 Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 (Gen 2) Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 (Gen 2) Type-C Other I/O Dual band 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.x, PS/2 Form-Factor ATX MSRP Expensive Less Expensive It is worth nothing that we expect the X399 chipset to be as capable as the AM4 X370 platform, which means that some of the features on the motherboard are likely to have shared resources, meaning having one enabled will disable some others. AMD has engineered the CPU to have 60 PCIe lanes for storage and graphics, which will nominally mean most configurations will allow three GPUs (totalling 48 lanes) and three M.2 slots (totalling 12 lanes) although the 10GbE controller will require some lanes as well as the other Ethernet and perhaps a USB port controller or two. Until we see the chipset diagram, it will be hard to tell at this point. The ASRock X399 Professional Gaming and the X399 Taichi will be available later this year when AMD releases its ThreadRipper CPUs. It goes without saying that the motherboards are not going to be cheap: they are not designed for general consumers and their server origin will have a direct impact on pricing.

Reply Gothmoth - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link i wonder more why only 2 boards from asrock. with intel it seems they make a complete new board for every single feature they enable..... Reply Chaitanya - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link Thats because this platform is scheduled to be released in August, while Intel Core-X is releasing coming few weeks. We will see more boards from all manufacturers closer to launch. Right now these boards were just shown off to press to let people should expect from new platform. Reply Vatharian - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link Because Intel's platform is evolving one, and is generally known among engineers. They are familiar with Intel's design standards and with every generation, they just read updates. Now, this platform is something totally new, that came out of the blue. This means new design from scratch, high cost and many iterations, while ironing kinks and going back and forth with AMD. They even decided to use same PCB, which is very good decision in this case. Demand for platform is a big unknown - as soon as it starts flying off the shelves, next iterations of the boards, with different feature set will start to show, basically as soon as these new designs we see now will pay for themselves. Reply CajunArson - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link Considering the crap-quality ethernet controllers that often get shoved onto these boards, I'd be loudly advertising Intel Gig-E hardware too as a sign that this board should be taken seriously. Reply Vatharian - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link Why it would be otherwise? Has AMD actually made even single component that's actually on the board, as it is shipped? Also, fun fact: I have both AM3 motherboard that uses Intel's Pentium S478 cooler, and Intel's Socket 771 motherboard, that has mounting (and a cooler) from AMD, in this case from S939. Reply prisonerX - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link Do you mean like the chipset? Pretty minor, I know. Reply Krysto - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link "Funny" is not the right word. The right word is probably "antitrusty". Intel is likely using illegal shenanigans again to hurt AMD in every way it can. In this case, maybe get Asrock not to make so many motherboards, and put its logos on the ones it has. Reply HomeworldFound - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link This is why AMD isn't that popular, it's fans are all conspiracy theorists. Reply Hurr Durr - Thursday, June 08, 2017 - link "Conspiracy theorist" is a pathetic canard introduced by media when it has absolutely nothing to say.

By Seth Fiegerman NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- During a test drive near Ford's Michigan headquarters, the team noticed something strange with its self-driving cars. Each car shifted slightly at the same point in the lane "as if they were avoiding a pothole," says Jim McBride, Ford's senior technical leader for autonomous cars. The problem wasn't the cars -- it was the map. The team had just updated its 3D map of the test route, which helps guide self-driving cars. But a minor glitch caused one pixel on the map to have the wrong data value. It told the car a spot in the ground was raised 10 inches, when it was perfectly level. "The new map looked perfect to the human eye," McBride says. But not to the eye of a self-driving car. "A single incorrect pixel," he says, was enough to throw off the cars. The power of that tiny mapping glitch, which happened a few years ago, highlights the newfound importance of a product many consumers likely take for granted. For much of the last decade, digital maps have helped people pull up basic directions while walking and driving. But tech and auto companies are investing in a new generation of maps for a much more demanding audience: self-driving cars. These maps, often referred to as HD maps, go far beyond basic turn-by-turn directions. Some incorporate continuously updating data on lane markings, street signs, traffic signals, potholes and even the height of a curb -- all down to the centimeter. The maps help the car place itself in the world with a greater degree of accuracy, augmenting the sensors in the vehicle. As an example, McBride says maps can guide cars when the lane markings are covered by snow or a truck is blocking the car's view of a traffic signal. It can also free up car sensors to focus on detecting objects not included on the map, like pedestrians. Maps may not get as much attention as videos of self-driving cars on the road, or the LIDAR laser sensors at the heart of a blockbuster lawsuit between Uber and Google. But they are a key piece of the puzzle under the hood. Maps could help ensure safer deployment of self-driving cars in the next years. And they may just have the potential to create a new billion-dollar industry. "If you have an autonomous car, then the map is not going to be an optional feature," says John Ristevski, former VP of Here, a mapping business once owned by Nokia that offers HD maps. "It's going to be a core component of the vehicle that will produce ongoing revenue." Unlike traditional navigation systems sold by companies like TomTom, HD maps may need to be updated as much as daily for certain regions. For example, a busy city street that goes through construction and pedestrian areas might need more frequent data than a long, uninterrupted freeway. Ristevski says that opens up the possibility of a subscription model that could one day bring in "billions" for mapping companies. The race to build up this next generation of maps is only getting more crowded. Google, Uber, Ford and others are each working to collect data for HD maps with sensors in their autonomous cars. At Waymo, Google's self-driving car division, staffers parse out the data collected to identify objects like driveways and fire hydrants. The cars then "automatically send reports back to our mapping team whenever they detect changes" like construction, according to the company. But this approach is difficult even for companies with a strong bench of technical talent. "If you thought creating regular maps for Google was hard, creating self-driving maps is much, much harder," says Brian McClendon, Uber's former VP of maps who previously worked on Google Maps. "The amount of data involved is huge. The precision required is very hard as well." A number of automakers, including General Motors and Volkswagen, have opted to lean more on third-party services to get their maps off the ground. Mobileye, a self-driving car firm recently acquired by Intel for $15 billion, inked agreements in April with Volkswagen, BMW and Nissan for a mapping product. The goal is to pool together mapping data from car manufacturers "to generate as much scale as possible," says Dan Galves, Mobileye's chief communications officer. "You can spend the money, hire the people -- assuming you can hire the right guys -- but that will take years. That happens too late for this race," says James Wu, a veteran of the mapping teams at Google and Apple. His startup, DeepMap, announced $32 million in funding last month that will provide a "full-stack mapping service" to companies. Other mapping startups like Civil Maps, backed by Ford, and Mapbox are also working with automakers. Carmera, another startup, came out of stealth mode this week with $6.4 million in funding and plans to crowdsource "real-time" data for maps. That includes offering "pedestrian analytics" and a "real-time event feed" for construction and road closures. Google remains the obvious frontrunner. The company has deep pockets and a longer history investing in self-driving cars and mapping products like Street View and Google Earth. Lars Rasmussen, co-creator of Google Maps, remembers Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin telling his team years ago that they'd "have to spend billions of dollars" on maps "and it's worth it." "I think one of the reasons that [maps] excited Larry was that he had this idea of self-driving cars," says Rasmussen, who left Google for Facebook in 2010. Google may have won the first online mapping battle (sorry Apple), but the HD maps market is still in its early days. The winner -- or winners -- is far from the finish line. If you believe self-driving cars will eventually operate everywhere, then every city and street will need to be mapped out in granular detail. To put that in context, Uber's self-driving car team is currently mapping just one city, according to its website: Toronto. "It's a green field," says Sravan Puttagunta, founder and CEO of CivilMaps. "No company has established a majority market share, and even the ones that have a couple cities are spending billions maintaining those maps." As the race heats up, there is a lingering question in the industry about how useful these costly maps will be down the road. Some argue the cars will eventually get smart enough, with deep learning technology, not to need to rely on extensive maps. "In the short term, I can see where it's vital, but that long term may not even be 10 years," says Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst with Kelley Blue Book. The "conundrum," she says, is just as comprehensive maps hit the market, car companies "don't need them anymore." The team at Ford is "looking at the possibility" of developing algorithms for the car that don't require a prior map, according to McBride. But he's skeptical of ditching maps entirely. "You'd still save the data that you took the first time you drove there," McBride says, "and use it for the second, third and tenth time to make it better."
