No longer is our economy a physical one, but one of connected networks and systems where cybercriminals have put us on the defensive. This new second economy has put us in a world where more than money is at stake and where private and public sectors are fighting against time and working to justify trust. » View the Intel Security FOCUS 16 press kit Cybercriminals are forcing cybersecurity companies to redraft the rules of engagement for defending the civilized world; to effectively counteract them, we have to abandon old security playbooks to become more unpredictable and collaborative and make cyber defense a priority, said Chris Young, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Security Group. Our strategic charter is simple, yet disruptive: integrate, automate and orchestrate the threat defense lifecycle to drive better security outcomes  ultimately reducing more risk, faster and with fewer resources. Built upon the industrys largest open ecosystem leveraging a proven integration program, Intel Securitys unified defense architecture is enabled by four protection systems  Dynamic Endpoint, Pervasive Data Protection, Data Center and Cloud Defense, and Intelligent Security Operations  that are intelligently integrated to multiply effectiveness. Dynamic Endpoint  Isolated solutions can be effective against individual assaults, but there are too many examples where isolated solutions cant keep up with the wide range of sophisticated, emerging threats. Tactical security firefighting needs to be replaced with integrated, dynamic security defenses designed to outsmart attackers. Intel Securitys Dynamic Endpoint solution uses advanced protection, shared intelligence and unified workflows on a single management console to unify endpoint protection, detection and correction to guard against todays most pervasive threats. This solution, delivered in McAfee® Endpoint Security 10.5 and McAfee® Active Response 2.0 software, includes capabilities like: Patient Zero Protection  Dynamic Application Containment improves protection against patient zero and ransomware threats and isolates the rest of the network from infection by monitoring and intercepting post-malicious process actions based on file reputation. Advanced, Persistent Threat Protection with Containment and Machine Learning  Intel Security is the first and only vendor to offer machine learning based malware classification using both static pre-execution analysis and dynamic post-execution analysis from the cloud that is designed to help detect zero-day malware in near real time, tracing behavior when deemed suspicious and remediating without relying on traditional signatures. Enhanced Protection with Integrated Web and Endpoint Protection  Only Intel Security seamlessly integrates a connection between its endpoint client and web gateway technology to enable quick-to-deploy, pervasive protection both on and off the corporate network that is designed to prevent zero-day malware from reaching the endpoint. Real-Time Advanced Threats Protection  McAfee Active Response 2.0 software uses the cloud to accelerate investigations by dynamically tracing process behavior and allowing administrators to access threat context in real time during an investigation.  Quickly hunt and respond using single click correction and then automate responses to address future attacks. Pervasive Data Protection  The rise of software as a service (SaaS) applications and a highly mobile workforce has created the need to securely enable cloud-driven business. Organizations are looking for a unified solution that extends security outside the traditional perimeter covering on and off-network users and cloud services. Intel Securitys approach to pervasive data protection is to unify SaaS security across web protection, cloud access security broker, data loss prevention and encryption to provide the industrys broadest solution across endpoints, networks and cloud-based services all centrally managed.  With a foundation in unified management, along with common rulesets, policies and encryption, Intel Security will help organizations maximize business efficiency and employee productivity. Organizations are empowered to make sensitive data readily available to the people who need it, while minimizing the risk of data leakage and misuse by unauthorized personnel. Components of the integrated solution include: Increased Productivity with Centralized Data Protection  McAfee® DLP for Mobile Email 10.0 software introduces unified policies and incident management for both endpoint and network DLP. It also offers end-user empowerment tools such as end-user manual classification, and end-user initiated DLP scanning and self-remediation. Not only do these capabilities help strengthen the corporate security culture, it also alleviates administrative burden. Ubiquitous Web Security  McAfee Web Gateway Cloud Service is designed to enable security teams to gain the same benefits of advanced threat protection as on-premises web gateway appliances but without the cost of hardware or the resources used to maintain it. With 3x the data centers of our previous web SaaS solution, better performance and improved uptime our new cloud service has never been more ready for the enterprise. Cloud Application Governance  McAfee Cloud Data Protection, available as a beta, features cloud access security broker (CASB)) technology, to provide an integrated view of risky endpoint and cloud events, including the ability to perform a real-time endpoint health check, ensuring only trusted devices are able to access sensitive information. Data Center and Cloud Defense  Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud computing, which introduces unique security requirements that many legacy security solutions cannot address.  Consequently, many struggle with weak and inconsistent cloud security controls, slow resolution of security issues and inefficient compute and staffing resource utilization. Intel Security cloud security products are designed to protect data centers with industry-leading security that detects advanced targeted attacks and manages security efficiently across physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures. Intel Securitys Data Center and Cloud Defense solution combines server security, network security and threat intelligence sharing to enable a single view of security across data center environments. This solution, delivered through McAfee® Server Security Suite 4.5 and McAfee Virtual Network Security Platform (vNSP) 8.3, includes capabilities like: Cloud Security Visibility  Cloud workload discovery provides deep visibility across public and private clouds for virtual machines, associated workloads, networks and storage, enabling organizations to establish a strong and consistent security posture. Threat Intelligence Sharing and Unification  Unification of perimeter and virtual machine protection thwarts advanced targeted attacks while ensuring efficient resource utilization within highly virtualized server environments to allow organizations to detect more threats, faster and with fewer resources. Once a threat has been detected, this knowledge is shared across the data center and corrective actions can be taken. Integration and Orchestration  Tight integration across McAfee Management for Optimized Virtual Environments Anti-Virus (MOVE AV), McAfee Virtual Network Security Platform (vNSP), McAfee® Advanced Threat Defense, and McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange along with virtualization platforms like VMWare NSX and OpenStack enable orchestration of security efficiently and more easily. Intelligent Security Operations  Organizations looking for rapid response and remediation need a closed loop threat defense lifecycle framework that makes it easy to integrate, monitor and orchestrate security solutions. New Intel Security capabilities integrate with the above solutions and Security Innovation Alliance partners to enhance and unify visibility, investigation workflows and reporting. Flexible Advanced Malware Detection  Expanded options include a new cloud-based machine learning-driven malware analysis service, McAfee Cloud Threat Detection, as well as a virtual McAfee Advanced Threat Defense appliance that makes the most of an improved user experience, more Windows OS coverage, and a significant throughput rate increase. Improved Visibility and Investigation  McAfee Enterprise Security Manager introduces a new HTML 5-based interface with an intuitive, analyst-centric user experience and simpler, faster search results to expedite threat management and incident response. Expanded Strategy and Incident Response Services  New consulting, deployment, assessment and incident response services enable long-term maturation of an organizations approach to risk and threat management and improve ROI. Retainer and on-demand based managed security and emergency response augment in-house expertise. OpenDXL Initiative The industry has long needed a way to make different technologies work better together, and we paved the way with the most highly adopted technology across major players with the McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL). To accelerate that, today Intel Security announced its intent to open the McAfee Data Exchange Layer to the industry as a concrete means of disrupting the cyberattackers advantage. Through an open source strategy and the beta release of a new software development kit (SDK) for DXL, white hats (both organizations and technology providers) will gain the ability to attach to a shared real-time communication fabric and exchange security intelligence as well as orchestrate actions for the shortest possible execution of the threat defense lifecycle. DXL provides a standardized application framework to integrate technologies from different vendors with each other and with in-house developed applications. The OpenDXL initiative will expand access and capabilities of the DXL SDK and the management and community infrastructure that will support it, enabling developers within ISVs, enterprises, colleges and even competitors to gain the many real-time integration and operational benefits of the Data Exchange Layer.

The McAfee brand is to be resurrected after the company was acquired by Intel five years ago in a $7.7bn deal  and later rebranded as Intel Security only to be spun off in 2017 as an independent company in partnership with investment firm TPG, with Intel retaining a 49% stake.   Young, general manager of Intel Security for the past two years, will be chief of the new firm and will retain his current leadership team. “When we become an independent company, we are going to accelerate a lot of what we are doing today, but one of the main differences is that we will be 100% focused on cyber security as a company at the company level,” he told Computer Weekly at Intel Security’s annual Focus conference in Las Vegas. “And that puts us in a bit of a different position. While all technology companies need to be part of the cyber security fight, there is real value in those that are dedicated to cyber security as a problem set that we are trying to solve, which will allow us to innovate in different ways.” Young said that although the company was already bringing to market a number of new technologies and systems, to be announced at Focus 2016, once it was independent, there would be a strong emphasis on growth and keeping pace with what was going on in the cyber security industry. “From my perspective, the cyber security space is the most dynamic part of the overall IT landscape, so as much as IT and technology is changing, cyber security is changing that much faster and so those of us who play in this industry have to grow and innovate very quickly,” he said. “So I view our future as McAfee as an accelerator of what we are currently doing.” Young said the company’s new tagline was “together is power” and that one of the main differentiators for the newly independent McAfee would be the fundamental thesis that business must organise and unite customers’ threat defence architecture, which goes beyond integration. Real orchestrated systems In 2016, said Young, the company was delivering a number of “automated use case-driven workflows”, but the organisation’s future vision was to drive “real orchestrated systems”. “The journey from integrated capabilities to automated use case-driven workflows to orchestrated systems is how I think of the evolution of our business and of where our industry needs to go,” he said, “because the past of this industry, and even our own portfolio, has been a lot of point products that are knitted together in customer environments, but without the real integration, automation and orchestration that is required to be resilient enough to deal with the changing nature of the threats that we see.” Everything the company announced at Focus 2016 was aimed at enabling it to build towards that orchestrated future, he said, but that did not mean customers would have to use McAfee products and systems from end to end. “This week, we will be making a number of partner announcements, as well as new products and system announcements, and that we are opening up the McAfee data exchange layer [DXL] to make it available to everyone in the industry to do threat intelligence sharing in real time between and among the different point products in their infrastructure,” said Young. “Opening up DXL is a massive announcement for us and shows we are aiming to integrate multiple capabilities in our customers’ environments.” DXL provides a standardised application framework to integrate technologies from different suppliers with each other and with applications developed in-house. According to Intel Security, DXL is the most highly adopted technology among major players as a way of enabling different technologies to work together better. To accelerate that, Intel Security is opening DXL to the industry as a “concrete means” of disrupting the cyber attackers’ advantage. Open source strategy Through an open source strategy and the beta release of a new software development kit (SDK) for DXL, the company said white hat organisations and technology providers “will gain the ability to attach to a shared real-time communication fabric and exchange security intelligence as well as orchestrate actions for the shortest possible execution of the threat defence lifecycle”. The theme for Focus is the “second economy”, which refers to the virtual economy based on the provision of services through machine-to-machine communication and interaction through connected networks and systems with no human involvement. “The second economy is more trust-related and, as we move from a physical to a virtual economy, the trust factor and our ability to deliver a real cyber security capability will be more important because we are moving into a world where computing is a pervasive element of how we live our lives,” said Young. For this reason, it was important to have a security model for the emerging, virtual and trust-based second economy, which would otherwise struggle to grow, he said. “Cyber criminals are forcing cyber security companies to redraft the rules of engagement for defending the civilised world,” said Young. “To effectively counteract them, we have to abandon old security playbooks to become more unpredictable and collaborative and make cyber defence a priority. “Our strategic charter is simple, yet disruptive: integrate, automate and orchestrate the threat defence lifecycle to drive better security outcomes – ultimately reducing more risk, faster and with fewer resources.” Sharing threat information The importance of sharing threat information was a key theme in Young’s keynote presentation at the RSA Conference 2016, when he highlighted his company’s participation in the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), a cross-industry initiative set up to foster the sharing of information about cyber security threats. “We are still actively working with the CTA and we are driving towards a future that is going to be truly ground-breaking for industry,” he said, adding that more announcements about that were the pipeline. According to Young, the new company will continue its dedication to threat intelligence sharing, not only through the CTA, but also by opening up DXL. “That is a contribution we are making in our technological fabric for cyber security that is going to enable organisations to do real-time threat intelligence-sharing between the different security control points in their infrastructure,” he said. “As we build on open DXL with the industry and our partners, it is going to open up a whole new set of use cases for how our different products and systems communicate with each other and share.” Read more about Intel Security Intel to raise $3.1bn by spinning off security business. UK social media habits are a corporate security risk, warns Intel Security. Security industry needs to do more, says Intel Security head Chris Young. Another key theme of Young’s RSA Conference keynote was the value of automation in freeing up human resources to take care of the more challenging security threats and strategic approaches to data defence. “Our strategy is built around the ‘thread defence lifecycle’ – protect, detect and correct,” he said. “Those are the three phases of a closed-loop set of actions when an organisation is under attack, but historically the tools, processes and approaches were disconnected across that lifecycle, and so we are giving customers the ability to prosecute that lifecycle in a fully automated way to get the full value of this approach.” Young said that in the company’s dynamic endpoint system, for example, it was adding to protection through something called dynamic application containment, which restricted access to resources to any new file that was not known good or known bad. “The problem is that if you automatically block something that is not malicious, then you risk upsetting people in the business by disrupting their work,” he said. “But at the same time, you do not want to expose yourself to a zero day attack by allowing something that is unknown to have unfettered access to resources on a device. So dynamic application containment allows you to restrict resources on the machine, so you do not allow a full-blown zero day attack without disrupting the business.” Machine-learning capability Young said the company was also going much broader and deeper on detection by adding machine-learning capability through a new capability called “real protect”, which has both on-device and in-cloud machine-learning capabilities. “This enables organisations to do both pre- and post-execution analysis of files that land on these devices, opening up a whole new set of detection capabilities by doing static code analysis and behavioural analysis, which are both important for a comprehensive look at zero day and similarly difficult-to-find attacks,” he said. The company has also integrated McAfee active response, which enables organisations to conduct cloud-based trace detection and analysis. This means that if something gets through that is later found to be malicious, organisations can go back to identify where the threat landed in the environment. “All of this is now being delivered in a common system that runs across all endpoints and is managed all in one place with our e-policy orchestrator,” said Young. “This is a great example of how we are automating to get the full closed-loop threat defence lifecycle capability in one system, which otherwise would require organisations to work across four or five different systems.” Another area of focus for the company is securing the internet of things (IoT), but Young said it was important to think about which industry vertical was involved. “You need to consider whether you are looking at IoT for the home or whether you are looking at it in the context of manufacturing or healthcare,” he said. “It is important to start with where you are in the domain, which enables you to understand what type of attacks you need to worry about and which attack vectors are important.” IoT is technology transition Young said the IoT was about connecting devices and experience, and bringing computer-generated experiences into the physical universe. That is what the IoT really represented: a technology transition, he said. It was not a market, but a movement, an evolution. “And, depending on which industry you are in, that will have different implications for security and what you are looking to protect,” he said. “To determine that, you have to consider the risks of connected devices and connected experiences in a particular environment.” The IoT botnet attack on domain name system (DNS) services supplier Dyn in October 2016 demonstrated that even if an organisation has no internet-connected devices in its environment, it may still be the victim of an attack that exploits those connected devices. “Clearly, we all have an interest in ensuring that the cyber security model contemplates the power of billions of connected devices and what that could mean in other, non-connected environments,” said Young. Although Young said there was still a lot of work to do in this regard, he believed technological controls could be found. “We work very closely with partners in manufacturing environments and healthcare, all of whom are working very diligently to implement cyber security for their connected devices and the data that they generate,” he said. The connected home One of the areas that Intel Security’s consumer-focused business was tackling was around the connected home, said Young. He pointed out that the company was planning some announcements on this subject at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January 2017.   “This shows we are moving from being a provider of security mainly for PCs and computing devices to one that is going to provide capability to protect customers more broadly with all the different devices and connections they have got in their home environment,” he said. “That kind of capability is going to be important, not only to protect against inbound attacks, but also in the long term against outbound attacks [such as the one against Dyn].” Despite his conviction that technological controls could be brought to bear, Young acknowledged that, like everything to do with security, all stakeholders had a role to play, ranging from silicon producers to device manufacturers to IoT service providers and users. “But even if device manufacturers step up and do more, you are always going to have cyber attackers who find a way to use the infrastructure we are connecting to their advantage, and that is where the pure-play cyber security companies have a role to play,” he said. “If you want to make any device, any software or any cloud application usable, it will be attackable. That is just always going to be true.” Confirming that the new company’s strong financial backing from TPG would allow its leadership to start thinking about mergers and acquisitions, Young said the company believed in its vision of integrate, automate and orchestrate. “As we evolve our business, we are going to look at how we build, who we partner with, and what gaps we have in achieving the strategy and the mission we have set for ourselves, and we will look at where mergers and acquisitions can play in the set of opportunities that we’ve got,” he said.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Intel Security Outlines Strategy for Protecting New Digital Economy Intel Security Enhances Unified Defense Architecture to Safeguard Against Threats to Trust, Time and Money NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Intel Security to strengthen threat defense lifecycle through integration, automation and orchestration. Unified architecture is enabled by four key integrated systems: Dynamic Endpoint, Pervasive Data Protection, Data Center and Cloud Defense, and Intelligent Security Operations. Across unified architecture, Intel Security announces 10 new products that feature organically developed capabilities including machine learning-based malware classification and cloud-based advanced threat detection service as well as cloud access security broker (CASB). New Open McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL) marks the next phase of Intel Security’s renewed commitment to help the industry accelerate the threat defense lifecycle. LAS VEGAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–FOCUS 16 — Today Intel Security announced an enhanced unified defense architecture designed to empower organizations to more effectively protect today’s new digital economy of trust, time and money. No longer is our economy a physical one, but one of connected networks and systems where cybercriminals have put us on the defensive. This new second economy has put us in a world where more than money is at stake and where private and public sectors are fighting against time and working to justify trust. “Cybercriminals are forcing cybersecurity companies to redraft the rules of engagement for defending the civilized world; to effectively counteract them, we have to abandon old security playbooks to become more unpredictable and collaborative and make cyber defense a priority,” said Chris Young, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Security Group. “Our strategic charter is simple, yet disruptive: integrate, automate and orchestrate the threat defense lifecycle to drive better security outcomes – ultimately reducing more risk, faster and with fewer resources.” Built upon the industry’s largest open ecosystem leveraging a proven integration program, Intel Security’s unified defense architecture is enabled by four protection systems – Dynamic Endpoint, Pervasive Data Protection, Data Center and Cloud Defense, and Intelligent Security Operations – that are intelligently integrated to multiply effectiveness. Dynamic Endpoint – Isolated solutions can be effective against individual assaults, but there are too many examples where isolated solutions can’t keep up with the wide range of sophisticated, emerging threats. Tactical security firefighting needs to be replaced with integrated, dynamic security defenses designed to outsmart attackers. Intel Security’s Dynamic Endpoint solution uses advanced protection, shared intelligence and unified workflows on a single management console to unify endpoint protection, detection and correction to guard against today’s most pervasive threats. This solution, delivered in McAfee® Endpoint Security 10.5 and McAfee® Active Response 2.0 software, includes capabilities like: Patient Zero Protection – Dynamic Application Containment improves protection against patient zero and ransomware threats and isolates the rest of the network from infection by monitoring and intercepting post-malicious process actions based on file reputation. Advanced, Persistent Threat Protection with Containment and Machine Learning – Intel Security is the first and only vendor to offer machine learning based malware classification using both static pre-execution analysis and dynamic post-execution analysis from the cloud that is designed to help detect zero-day malware in near real time, tracing behavior when deemed suspicious and remediating without relying on traditional signatures. Enhanced Protection with Integrated Web and Endpoint Protection – Only Intel Security seamlessly integrates a connection between its endpoint client and web gateway technology to enable quick-to-deploy, pervasive protection both on and off the corporate network that is designed to prevent zero-day malware from reaching the endpoint. Real-Time Advanced Threats Protection – McAfee Active Response 2.0 software uses the cloud to accelerate investigations by dynamically tracing process behavior and allowing administrators to access threat context in real time during an investigation. Quickly hunt and respond using single click correction and then automate responses to address future attacks. Pervasive Data Protection – The rise of software as a service (SaaS) applications and a highly mobile workforce has created the need to securely enable cloud-driven business. Organizations are looking for a unified solution that extends security outside the traditional perimeter covering on and off-network users and cloud services. Intel Security’s approach to pervasive data protection is to unify SaaS security across web protection, cloud access security broker, data loss prevention and encryption to provide the industry’s broadest solution across endpoints, networks and cloud-based services all centrally managed. With a foundation in unified management, along with common rulesets, policies and encryption, Intel Security will help organizations maximize business efficiency and employee productivity. Organizations are empowered to make sensitive data readily available to the people who need it, while minimizing the risk of data leakage and misuse by unauthorized personnel.

Join the Conversation To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Story from Intel offers Jedi mentors, funding to invite youth into STEM dialogue Brian Sodoma, for Intel 1:32 p.m. MST October 27, 2016 This story is provided and presented by our advertiser The CSO program exposes young adults and youth to the STEM working world while also giving them a voice in government, professional and academic environments. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) With his mom working as a science teacher and his father as an engineer, Dhruv Iyer caught the science bug at a young age. The ambitious Hamilton High School senior is currently planning his next life steps to study computer science and entrepreneurship at a university next year. From there, he hopes to explore STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) career and business opportunities. “I want to explore the world and make a difference in it,” Iyer said. The 17 year-old Chandler resident is also a committed community builder, especially when it comes to advocating for STEM opportunities for his peers. Last year, Hamilton students elected him the junior class Chief Science Officer (CSO). Started in the 2015-16 school year, the Intel-sponsored CSO program exposes young adults and youth to the STEM working world while also giving them a voice in government, professional and academic environments. The Intel-sponsored program is relatively new, starting in Arizona during the 2015-16 school year, but it’s now making a big splash locally and beyond. “I never had been involved in student government and it was an opportunity to do something new through something I loved. … I have a passion for connecting students, industry and government to support science and engineering,” Iyer said. How the program works The CSO program involves sixth through 12th grade peer-elected officers from Valley schools. In its first year, the CSO effort saw participation from 78 schools and 138 officers. Its second year grew to 110 schools and 220 officers. After being elected by their peers, CSOs attend a fall summit to learn networking, blogging, strategic planning and other business skills, explained Jeremy Babendure, a CSO program organizer and executive director of the Arizona SciTech Festival. Students are also paired with “Jedi Mentors” from Intel and other local technology companies to offer support with community building at schools and insights into STEM careers. “As key drivers of innovation, STEM disciplines are critical in the complex and competitive knowledge economy. Intel works to encourage student participation in STEM disciplines. It’s important they have mentors throughout their academic careers that help link STEM activities to real-world work experiences,” said Intel Arizona’s Director of Public Affairs Carlos Contreras. After the summit, students report back to their schools to use their skills to connect with peers interested in STEM. Iyer started a STEM newsletter at his school and also encouraged science clubs to work together to create fairs and other STEM-related events. With the help of his Jedi mentor, he hopes to host a rocket launch at Hamilton this school year. A White House trip to discuss science, technology and policy with congressional leaders was the highlight of last year’s CSO experience, Iyer said. More recently, in October, he and other CSOs also met with local leaders at the state capitol to discuss STEM jobs, education and policy. These once in a lifetime experiences for teens and pre-teens, Babendure added, are critical to the CSO vision, which seeks to engage the voice of youth in the increasing dialogue about STEM careers and needed job skills. “You often find, in all these different business meetings, conversations about where the future workforce should be and you never see kids at the table,” Babendure noted. “This is an opportunity to position them as liaisons, elected by their peers, who represent their schools.” The future Now in its second year, the CSO effort is gaining national momentum. About a dozen regions around the country have expressed an interest in initiating the program in their area. Iyer is committed to setting the foundation at his school for future CSOs, and he loves to see how some of his early efforts in talking to political leaders are paying off so quickly. The experience has taught him a lifelong lesson. “I learned that anybody can get involved and make a change,” he said. “I never thought that I, as a high school student, could make a difference in my community or my school. But I now know the only thing stopping you from making a change … is your own inhibitions. … Anybody can advocate for their situation.” To learn more about how Intel supports community STEM initiatives, click here. 419 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2eAqeYT Intel Intel's pro bono legal clinic helps Arizonans battling financial hardships Nov 14, 2016 More Stories from Intel Camp gives Chandler junior high girls a fresh look at STEM opportunities Sponsor story Intel-sponsored program shows Latinas STEM career possibilities Sponsor story Foundation connects at-risk youth to STEM possibilities Sponsor story Intel supports seniors with online safety, computer basics, more Sponsor story

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 11:27AM Per a report from well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities (via MacRumors), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is planning to launch new MacBook Pro systems during the second half of 2017. These new systems, the analyst says, could support up to 32 gigabytes of system memory -- an increase from the 16 gigabytes that the recently released models have. Image source: Apple.  Kuo says that this memory increase "depends on whether or not [MacBook processor supplier] Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) ships Cannonlake CPU on time in 2017, which features 15-25% less power consumption of LPDDR 4, versus the existing LPDDR 3." The analyst further goes on to explain that "If Cannonlake doesn't enter mass production as expected, the new models launched in 2H17 will adopt Coffee Lake, which continues to adopt LPDDR 3, and maximum DRAM support will remain unchanged at 16GB." Here's why this analysis is so confusing.  Why don't the new MacBook Pro computers support 32 gigabytes of memory?  The current 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro systems use Intel's sixth-generation Core processors, also widely referred to by their internal code name, Skylake.  The fact that these chips only support the older, less-efficient LPDDR3 memory type is widely believed to be the reason that Apple doesn't offer 32 gigabytes of memory in these new systems (since that much LPDDR3 would draw too much power, forcing Apple to lower its advertised battery life targets).  The idea behind this analysis seems to be that once Intel's high-performance processors begin to offer support for the newer, more-efficient LPDDR4 memory standard, Apple will be able to increase the amount of memory that it can offer in these systems without sacrificing battery life.  That's straightforward enough; what's so confusing, then?  Code name confusion The only thing that doesn't quite make sense with Kuo's analysis is that Coffee Lake is merely the code-name for the high-performance notebook chips based on the Cannon Lake architecture (a fact first published right here at The Motley Fool). A likely explanation for why Intel doesn't just call this product family Cannon Lake (rather than Coffee Lake) is that instead of being manufactured on Intel's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, these processors will be built on an enhanced version of Intel's 14-nanometer technology. In other words, Coffee Lake is fundamentally a Cannon Lake chip; if Cannon Lake supports LPDDR4 (and it is extremely likely that it does), then so will Coffee Lake.  Kuo's analysis is sound with a simple change An argument that makes more sense is the following: If Intel can get Coffee Lake into Apple's hands soon enough, then MacBook Pro systems launched in the second half of 2017 will gain support for LPDDR4, paving the way for configurations with 32 gigabytes of memory.  If Intel can't get Coffee Lake out in that time frame, Apple must use Intel's Kaby Lake processor family to hit a second-half 2017 release schedule. Kaby Lake uses the same fundamental chip architecture as Skylake (though the implementation of that architecture has been reworked to take advantage of an enhanced 14-nanometer process), and therefore doesn't support LPDDR4 memory.  Bummer for MacBook Pro power users Unfortunately for potential MacBook Pro buyers eager to get their ahold of MacBook Pro computers with 32 gigabytes of memory, the latest Intel roadmap leaks show that Coffee Lake isn't due out until the second quarter of 2018. This means that, barring a pull-in of Coffee Lake's development schedule (unlikely given Intel's track record), Apple has two choices: Refresh the MacBook Pro in the second half of 2017 with Kaby Lake processors with memory support topping out at 16 gigabytes; or Hold off on refreshing the MacBook Pro until the first half of 2018 to be able to use the newer, superior Coffee Lake processors, which could make 32 gigabyte system configurations a reality.  If Kuo is correct that new MacBook Pro computers are coming in the second half of 2017, then consumers shouldn't expect those computers to be configurable with 32 gigabytes of memory.

Officially Ditches This Intel Corporation Technology in the 15-inch MacBook Pro Apple didn't choose to use Intel's graphics-heavy processors inside its new 15-inch MacBook Pro, but it's not a big deal. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 12:00PM With the launch of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) fourth-generation Core processors came the birth of the company's Iris Pro graphics technology. In a nutshell, Intel created two versions of its H-series laptop processors (aimed at larger, higher-performance laptops): ones with relatively weak on-board graphics, referred to as Intel HD graphics -- and ones with much higher performance graphics, known as Iris Pro. Image source: Apple. The business rationale behind the Iris Pro models was simple to understand: Intel wanted personal computer makers to, instead of paying a graphics-processor vendor for a low-end stand-alone graphics processor, put those extra dollars toward an Intel processor with a roughly comparable integrated graphics processor. It's not hard to see that capturing that dollar content would lift the average selling prices of Intel's processors, ultimately boosting Intel's revenue and gross profit. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) used versions of Intel's fourth-generation Core processors with Iris Pro inside the 15-inch MacBook Pro computers it launched between 2013 and 2015 (but still offered potential buyers the option to choose stand-alone graphics as well). The Mac maker also utilized fifth-generation Core processors with Iris Pro inside the 21.5-inch iMac desktop computers launched in 2015. However, with its latest 15-inch MacBook Pro computers, Apple passed on newer Core i7 processors with Iris Pro; instead, it opted for variants with vanilla Intel HD graphics, and now includes stand-alone graphics processors in all new 15-inch MacBook Pro systems. Although prior leaks showing Intel's future notebook processor plans indicated that Iris Pro was a goner, Apple's processor choice inside of the 15-inch MacBook Pro makes it official. What does this mean for Intel? Although it may seem that this is somewhat bad news for Intel, particularly as the chipmaker likely charged Apple (and the small group of other companies that used the technology) a premium for these parts over what it charges for chips with vanilla HD graphics, over the long term it's not that bad. It could even be a positive development. For one thing, even though Iris Pro appears to have run its course, Intel is still selling Iris-based processors. Iris technology is fundamentally the same as Iris Pro, except it is used in lower-power processors: Iris Pro was found on 45-watt chips, and Iris is used in Intel's premium 15-watt and 28-watt chips. Iris is a much more sensible product, because the kinds of laptops that use 15-watt or 28-watt chips tend not to have the power and space budgets to accommodate a worthwhile stand-alone graphics processor. In contrast, if a system can support a 45-watt processor, it's likely to have the power and space budgets to include a discrete graphics processor as well. Indeed, Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pro computers use Intel processors with Iris graphics, and the technology seems to be picking up steam with other personal computer makers (such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), VAIO, Dell, and Lenovo Group (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY). So, Intel should still be able to improve its notebook processor mix as it improves the value proposition of its Iris graphics offerings. For Intel's efforts here to succeed, though, customers need to believe that by picking laptops with Iris technology, they will be able to enjoy modern games at reasonable performance and quality settings. That will have to come from a combination of Intel delivering good performance with its Iris technology, and Intel effectively marketing the technology to customers. Intel's mix opportunity beyond graphics It's also important to note that, beginning in the second quarter of 2018, Intel's replacement for the quad-core notebook processors with Iris Pro graphics will be a hex-core processor with vanilla Intel HD graphics. If Intel can command a premium for the six-core part relative to the quad-core part, as it did with the quad-core chips with Iris Pro relative to the quad-core parts with standard Intel HD graphics, then the chipmaker still has an opportunity to sell a richer mix of products. Gaming laptops could be prime candidates for higher-priced, higher-core count processors. And, to be blunt, far more customers (especially in the gaming-laptop and mobile-workstation markets) are likely to be willing to pay extra for more processor cores than to pay extra for more integrated graphics performance. Over the next couple of years, I suspect the removal of Iris Pro from its lineup, coupled with increased focus on Iris graphics for low-power chips and higher CPU core counts for higher-power chips, could help Intel sell a richer notebook processor mix than it does today. Why increasing product mix is important The personal-computer market is generally believed to be in decline, and there's little that Intel can do to change those broader trends. What Intel can do is try to deliver more value with its processors, so that when people do go to purchase personal computers, they have incentive to buy machines with more powerful (and more expensive) Intel processors. More cores is a nice selling point. Intel may even want to consider revamping its branding efforts to make sure customers are aware of which laptops with Core i7 processors pack four cores and which ones have six (though this is a topic for another day). A richer product mix can certainly help to offset unit declines. For example, over the last three quarters combined, Intel says that although its laptop processor unit shipments dropped 1%, average selling prices here went up 2% -- ultimately leading to slight revenue growth. In desktop processors, Intel saw a similar trend, though one not quite as good: Volumes dropped 5%, but the resulting revenue drop was somewhat offset by a 2% increase in average selling prices. The more that Intel can do to sell a richer mix of products in the face of unit-volume shipments which range from flat to slightly down, the better of a shot the company has to keep its PC-related revenues stable over time.

If you’ve been waiting ever-so patiently to upgrade your ultrabook, now is a better time than ever to start shopping for the best value ultrabook in 2017! As Intel’s latest 7th-generation Core processors begin to roll out to the masses, the new processors offer upwards of 15% more power while cutting their battery usage in half, meaning you can tear through reports at work or games online for hours at a time without worrying about finding a plug in between. Other factors that make these ultrabooks better than the rest for the value is their increased hard drive space (no less than 128GB SSD), their faster RAM (1866MHz LPDDR3 or above), and at least 8 hours of battery life on a single charge. All those factors considered, we’ve come to the conclusion that the best rated value ultrabook is the refreshed 2017 Dell XPS 13. This is a laptop that continues to dominate the ultrabook space with precision engineering and a level of quality unlike anything else, often surpassing even Apple both in beauty and power combined. Best Value Ultrabook 2017   Dell XPS 13 HP Spectre x360 13t Acer Aspire S 13 Rank #1 - Editor's Choice/ Best Value Ultrabook #2 Pick #3 Pick Amazon Rating N/A N/A Screen Size 13.3" 13.3" 13.3" Display 1920 x 1080 1920 x 1080 1920 x 1080 Battery Life Up to 12hrs Up to 15hrs Up to 11hrs Touchscreen CPU 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-7200U 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-7200U 2.3GHz Intel Core i5-6200U RAM 8GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 Storage 128GB SSD 256GB SSD 256GB SSD Weight 2.7 pounds 2.85 pounds 2.87 pounds Price $999.99 $1049.99 $669.99 Buy Now Buy Now Buy Now How We Choose the Best Value Ultrabook When we talk about the ultrabook category, the idea of value is definitely a fleeting one. All that said, in this space it’s all about getting the most bang for the bucks you do end up spending, so what does all that mean? Well, first you should understand what is an ultrabook? Next, it’s important to know that our top two choices in the category include the absolute latest in Intel’s processor lineup: the 7th-gen “Kaby Lake” CPUs. The company says users can expect about a 12-14% boost in power from these chips over their Skylake-based predecessors, all while saving around 10% more battery to power them throughout the day. Next there’s RAM, which should be at least 8GB of LPDDR3 or above, while the hard drive has to be at minimum a 128GB SSD (all three models include a 256GB upgrade option as well). Last there’s the screen, which needs to be at least 1920 x 1080 resolution to ensure you have as much real estate as possible to get all the productivity you need out of your best value ultrabook. Why You Should Buy the Best Value Ultrabook As is the case with any technology, the world of ultrabooks is a rapidly evolving beast that never stays in one place for any longer than it has to. There have been a number of significant upgrades that have hit ultrabooks in 2016, namely the upgraded hard drives and the newer processors. Not only that, RAM capacities and speeds have also gone up quite a bit, so if you’ve been waiting for over two years to upgrade there’s never going to be a better time to jump on that train than now. #1 Pick  Dell XPS 13/Editor’s Choice The Dell XPS 13 is the king that continues to reign supreme over all ultrabook contenders Price: $999.99 | Features: 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, 12-hr battery life, 13.3″ full-HD screen WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Kaby Lake brings the Dell XPS line of ultrabooks into the future.  As though it should come as any kind of surprise, once again the Dell XPS 13 tops our list of the best value ultrabooks of 2017. With their recent upgrade to the all new line of 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors, the latest XPS ultrabooks are faster and more power efficient than ever, a real feat considering how long they lasted on a single charge before. The model we’ve featured comes with a 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM clocked to 1866MHz, and a 128GB SSD. Technically there is a cheaper option that starts at $799 with only 4GB of RAM and an i3-7100 clocked to 2.1GHz, though we recommend the $999 version if you plan on doing any serious work in the near future while using the best value ultrabook of 2017! View on Dell  #2 Pick  HP Spectre x360 13t If this were a contest of pure sex appeal alone, the HP Spectre x360 would be way out in front of the pack Price: $1049.99  | Features: 2-in-1 hinge, 1920 x 1080 13.3″ touchscreen display, 15hr battery life WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The HP Spectre x360 wins on almost pure sex appeal alone. Value aside, it’s hard to look at the new line of HP Spectre x360 ultrabooks and not want one to show off to all your friends just for the sake of having the sexiest looking laptop at the coffee shop. HP was never one to release any laptops or ultrabooks that I found particularly attractive, but none of that really seemed to matter as soon as I laid eyes on this downright gorgeous piece of ultra-mobile kit. With sleek, svelte lines and a nearly bezel-less 13.3″ touchscreen display, this 2-in-1 has the power and the brains to make itself a must-have on any tech geek’s Christmas list. Read More: Best Ultrabooks In true HP fashion you actually get a decent set of specs for not a lot of cash, too. The included i7-7200U is the same as what we found on the Dell, and although the HD Graphics 620 chip may not be much to write home about, it’s still plenty for the average user and will still handle 4K video output with some help from the Kaby Lake upgrade. View on HP #3 Pick  Acer Aspire S 13 Despite its older processor, the Aspire S 13 offers serious value all around Price: $669.99  | Features: 0.57″ thick, 8GB LPDDR3 SDRAM, 13.3″ FHD screen WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Acer Aspire S 13 is perfect for anyone who likes their ultrabooks thin, light, and cheap.  Last up we come to the true “value” pick of the bunch, the Acer Aspire S 13. The Aspire line of ultrabooks are a go-to choice for thousands of road warriors who need an upgrade in this category, and the S model is no different. At just $669 this is far and away the cheapest option here, but that discounted price comes at a compromise. The Acer Aspire S 13 unfortunately only includes last year’s 2.3GHz Skylake-based Intel Core i5-6200U processor, but fret not, because it more than makes up for what it lacks there with its stunningly razor-thin profile of just 0.57 inches. It’s also feather-light at 2.87lbs, and still manages to include all our minimum requirements on the side like a 256GB SSD, 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM, and 11 hours of battery life. If you need a fast, light, and ultra-portable ultrabook that can take a beating and look great doing it, it’s pretty obvious what is the best value ultrabook for you! View on Amazon Most Important Features Weight In true ultrabook fashion, all the choices we’ve listed here weigh in on the scales at less than 3lbs each, with the Dell XPS 13 taking the title at a mere 2.7lbs. Don’t worry though, the HP Spectre x360 follows closely behind at 2.85lbs, while the Acer Aspire S 13 tips the scales as the “heaviest” at 2.87lbs. Battery life Ultrabooks are made to go wherever you need them to, and last at least 8 hours on a single charge thanks to Intel’s pre-mandated requirements that every laptop must meet if it wants the honor of calling itself “ultra”. Display As anyone who’s owned a laptop sporting anything less than 1920 x 1080 resolution can attest; getting work done on a low-res screen can be a frustrating, hair-thinning experience for even the most seasoned road warriors among us. With a full-HD display you have more room for more windows at a time, making it simple to keep multiple programs running simultaneously side-by-side. Price And last but certainly not least, there’s the price of your next value ultrabook. On a purely pound-for-dollar basis, the Aspire S 13 is obviously the clear winner, but we’d also suggest giving both the XPS 13 and Spectre a second look in case you aren’t satisfied with the price. Both models have multiple budget configurations available, which at least in the case of the XPS, can bring the price all the way down to a cool $799 out the door. Mistakes or Things to Avoid Don’t buy more than you need: The first rule in value shopping is to always buy exactly what you need, and don’t spend a dime on an extra spec more. All three models included on this list have multiple configurations that can change the price of the unit wildly, anywhere from $799 up to $2500 in some situations, so be sure you custom-tailor your next ultrabook to fit right in the range of specs-to-price that first you best. Don’t get one for gaming: As great as these ultrabooks are for getting work done quickly and efficiently, they’re going to slog hard if you try and do any serious gaming on them. Because most of their cost is put on the processor and battery, the GPU is generally the first spec to take the biggest hit when it comes to cutting down on costs.   What Else You Should Think About Now that you know everything you need to about the best value ultrabook for 2017, what else do you need to know about the world of ultrabooks and everything they have to offer? If you’re still not sure whether or not you want to splurge on an ultrabook or if a Chromebook might do the job just as well for a fraction of the cost, you should check out our showdown between the two types in Ultrabooks vs. Chromebooks. Also, there’s tons of lighter, cheaper options to choose from in the Lightest Ultrabooks of 2016, and if the HP Spectre x360 is your style but you want more selection, we’ve got you covered with the Best 2-in-1 Ultrabooks of 2016. No matter what you need, picks like the Dell XPS 13 continue to shine bright as a well-built, solid all-around choice for anyone that needs a workhorse to get them through the day and won’t need to get plugged in for another charge until well into the night.

[x] Win a Gigabyte GTX 1070 G1 Gaming Bundle [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Laptop Hardware PC News 15 Alienware 13 laptop updated with H-class CPUs and Pascal GPUs by Mark Tyson on 2 November 2016, 12:01 Tags: Alienware (NASDAQ:DELL), Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadaos Add to My Vault: Dell has updated its Alienware 13 (13.3-inch) gaming laptop. It becomes the most powerful gaming laptop of this size ever from the PC maker, thanks to the combination of an Intel quad-core H-class CPU and Nvidia 1000 series GPU. Other modern PC architecture niceties such as DDR4 memory and SSD-only storage support the headline component specs. Dell provides a wide range of Alienware 13 configurations which it is also possible to further customise before purchase. All of the machines are claimed to be VR-Ready due to the excellent entry level spec which includes; an Intel Core i5-6300HQ processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB GDDR5, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 180GB M.2 SATA 6Gb/s SSD. This entry model features a 13.3 inch HD (1366 x 768) TN Anti-Glare 200-nits display. The starting price for a machine thus configured is US$1199. Moving up to more expensive pre-built models you can go for an IPS 1080p display, or even an OLED 1440p display. Processors can be upgraded as far as an Intel Core i7-6700HQ, pre-built-RAM configurations offer up to 16GB DDR4 but can be further configured to 32GB. Storage in pre-built configs tops out at 512GB PCIe SSD but can be upgraded up to 2x 1TB PCIe SSDs. The pre-built configurations plateau at US$2099.

You can't fault longtime die-hard Mac users for being a little frustrated with Apple. In the space of just a decade, they've watched their favorite platform go from being the center of the company's attention to a minor line item. The iPhone gets refreshed promptly and consistently every September, while some Macs sit there for one or two or three years without even being mentioned. Macs aren't even regularly refreshed with new processors from Intel, Nvidia, and AMD as they're released anymore; we could rely on that as recently as three years ago. The new MacBook Pros—released, for the record, a year and a half after the 2015 models, which were in some cases changed very little from the 2014 and 2013 models—have been birthed into this era of frustration. As a result, the initial reaction has been harsher than it would have been if Apple refreshed the Mac with the same regularity that it managed back in 2012 or 2013. But not everyone is a longtime Mac user, and divorced from that context what you've got in the new MacBook Pros is a lineup of very nice-looking (if not game-changing) laptops that combine a refreshed design with a healthy dose of updated technology. Today, we'll be examining the $1,499 version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the version with the row of function keys in place of the ballyhooed Touch Bar. We'll be examining the other 13- and 15-inch model thoroughly when we can get them, of course, but the $1,499 version still tells us a lot about the design, the keyboard, the new Thunderbolt 3 ports, and about Apple's design priorities and the Pro's target audience. Differences between the Touch Bar model and this one Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.0GHz Intel Core i5-6360U (Turbo up to 3.1GHz) RAM 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 540 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 867Mbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 54.5Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,499.99 Price as reviewed $1,499.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, dual integrated mics The Touch Bar is the biggest feature separating this entry-level MacBook Pro from the more expensive models, but there are some other small and not-so-small differences you have to live with when you opt for the $1,499 model. This is the complete list—otherwise, assume that the two share all the same features. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers (one of those controllers uses "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which I assume means it's using PCI Express 2.0 instead of 3.0). Intel’s Thunderbolt controllers support a maximum of two Thunderbolt 3 ports each, and while many PC OEMs are shipping Thunderbolt 3, none is providing more than one or two ports. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard should all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. Look and feel If the Retina MacBook was what you’d get if an iPad and a MacBook Air were put into the Large Hadron Collider and smashed into each other, the new MacBook Pro is what you’d get if you took the Retina MacBook and the first Retina MacBook Pro and did the same thing. Like the MacBook, the new Pros are slimmer, have much smaller display bezels and footprints, and jettison many ports. Like the previous Pro, they’re a uniform thickness throughout rather than tapered, they’ve still got more powerful processors, and because of those more powerful components they still have fans inside. The Pro’s construction is still rock solid despite being thinner and lighter, and there’s still not a trace of creaking or flexing anywhere in its aluminum unibody design. If you were bothered by previous designs’ unadorned metal or the hard corners of their wrist rests, none of that has changed. Apple does offer both a “space gray” finish alongside the classic silver, though the MacBook’s gold and rose gold finishes and the iPhone 7’s black and jet black finishes aren’t available. I tend to prefer darker gray and black colors when I can get them, and the space gray finish is really nice even if it still bothers me that Apple can’t quite keep the “space gray” color consistent across different product lines and model years. At 3.02 pounds, the new Pro is around half a pound lighter than last year’s and roughly the same weight as the 13-inch MacBook Air. I’m jumping from the 13-inch Air to the 13-inch Pro since I can’t quite live with the 12-inch MacBook’s performance or its individual port, so if you’re making that jump the laptop is going to feel exactly the same in your bag. The weight savings is noticeable but not life-changing if you’re coming from an earlier Retina model, but remember that it’s a full 1.5 pounds lighter than a pre-Retina, 13-inch unibody Pro—if you’re coming from one of those older machines, it makes a huge difference. The laptop’s fan is normally not audible in a room with little to no ambient noise. You can definitely notice it spin up if you’re pushing the laptop’s performance for an extended period, but it’s quieter than the previous Pros or Airs, and it’s much quieter than the jet engine-style noises that come out of some PC Ultrabooks. Even when the fan is going at full-tilt, the laptop can still get pretty warm, especially underneath and on the area above the keyboard. Still, it never gets too uncomfortable to hold or rest on your lap.

The security group has begun refining its channel strategy and will continue that process after Intel spins it off as separate security firm under the McAfee banner in partnership with investment firm TPG.

The move comes five years after Intel completed its $7.7bn acquisition of McAfee and just two years after rebranding it as Intel Security. Intel will retain a 49% stake in the new business, which is expected to be up and running by the second quarter of 2017, led by Intel Security chief Chris Young and his existing management team. “The way organisations are consuming security products is changing, and our channel strategy is changing in response to that,” Steranka told Computer Weekly at Intel Security’s annual Focus conference in Las Vegas. Today, most of the products are perpetual and installed on-premise, he said, and often not implemented correctly or to their optimal ability. “It is often a painful exercise for companies. They spend the capex [capital expenditure], but do not always achieve the outcomes they were expecting,” said Steranka. As a result, he said, companies are looking to move to subscription models that enable them to pay for security products as they are used and as they deliver value. That is key to Intel Security’s “cloud first” strategy, he said, which is also aimed at accommodating the fact that many organisations’ infrastructure is not on-premise any more, but in the cloud. “The deployment model is also changing because organisations’ workloads are increasingly not on-premise but in the cloud, and that is where they are looking to secure them,” said Steranka. Selling products reaps rewards Security is becoming more services orientated than product orientated, said Steranka, and organisations are recognising that security needs to be applied to all assets in an IT infrastructure all the time. Because organisations typically do not have enough people to do that, he said they are looking to other companies to augment their security capabilities by manging alerts and helping to respond to breaches when they are detected. “Our channel is shifting to those dynamics of moving into subscription-based services, selling products that are more born in the cloud and putting all those together in a services-based offering aimed at providing a security capability,” he said. Steranka said in response to these changes, Intel Security has shifted its partner programme from being a fairly basic reward programme based on volume to one that is focused more on competencies of the partners and meeting the needs of the customer. “It is the consultative element and the services element that are the most important to them for achieving the security outcomes they are looking for,” he said. “We have started with product competencies in selling – and, in 2016, we introduced the requirement that partners be certified in selling competencies in three product areas, but plan to add more service competencies in 2017. “Training is a key area where we are investing money to bring out new courses on implementation, design and architecting.” However, Steranka said as important as training is, it can be done only inside the confines of the existing talent pool. “What we have got to do from a technology perspective is to simplify things through more automation of security processes to free up human resources, and so enabling products to do more on their own is part of our product roadmap,” he said. Increasing partner profitability As part of the new partnership programme, he said the company is looking to continually increase partner profitability through new products and business models, and making fundamental changes to partner rebates. “We have just announced a platinum rebate programme that is dramatically simplified and starts to pay out money to partners earlier – as early as 80% achievement of their quarterly target,” he said. According to Steranka, there are also “pretty substantial” accelerators such as the payment of an 8% rebate on achieving 150% of target in response to feedback from partners. “We are listening to what they think works and what doesn’t and we are making those changes pretty rapidly,” he said. Spin-off business welcomed by partners Channel partners have responded positively to the news of the planned spin off, said Steranka. “Some have said to me that they felt that powerful and internationally recognised McAfee brand had been diluted and lost in the integration [of McAfee with Intel] They are excited about not having to explain who Intel Security is,” he said. But Steranka said it is important to note that Intel will remain a very active partner in the new business. “The opportunity to bring raw silicon – and what we can do in security defence there – together with our software capability is still a powerful story that is interesting to our partners. “We will be taking all of the good that happened with Intel, but being a separate entity with very strong financial backing from TPG will give us the ability to innovate and execute at a quicker pace than we could have as a group inside Intel,” he said. The spin off, said Steranka, opens up opportunities to work with a growing number of partners, particularly with global system integrators, service providers and host companies as organisations move towards more services-based security. “Until now we have been contained in terms of developing everything internally, but with the strong [financial] backing of TPG, we can start thinking about mergers and acquisitions, although there is nothing immediately on the horizon,” he said.

The EBC-C413 models include onboard USB, Gigabit Ethernet controllers, serial ports, GPIO and additional I/O expansion through MiniPCIe and PC/104-Plus. These in-stock, off-the-shelf industrial SBCs are optimally designed for rugged embedded applications that require extended temperature operation, long-term availability, and a wide variety of I/O expansion options to meet unique project requirements. “The evolution of our EBX product line reflects WinSystems’ deep experience developing embedded solutions for rugged industrial applications,” said Technical Sales Director George Hilliard. “The EBC-C413 withstands the often-extreme temperature ranges and levels of vibration and shock in these operating environments while consistently delivering solid reliability and durability. And, because it leverages low-power Intel architecture while continuing support for legacy operating systems, it facilitates upgrades to newer technology. Customers who incorporate them can gain all the advantages of running the latest Linux and Windows 10 operating systems.” Abundant Features And Expansion Opportunities The EBC-C413 series features the Intel Atom E3800 family of processors in an industry-standard EBX form factor. The low-profile thermal heat plate design reduces its height by 47 percent – from 1.15 inches to 0.6 inches compared to its predecessor EBC-C384. The Intel Atom E3800 family delivers numerous enhancements over previous-generation Intel Atom processors including improvements in computational performance, energy efficiency and power management. The SBC EBC-C413 underpins quad-core, dual-core or single-core processors and up to 8GB of DDR3L SDRAM. The Intel Generation 7-based graphics engine supports up to two simultaneously active displays with interfaces available for analog VGA, Mini DisplayPort and LVDS connections. For networking and communications, the EBC-C413 includes two Intel I210 Ethernet controllers with 10/100/1000 Mb/s multispeed operation. It provides eight USB 2.0 channels and four serial ports to support RS-232/422/485 interface levels. The series also includes two MiniPCIe connectors and PC/104-Plus, enabling further high-speed I/O expansion and/or an mSATA SSD drive. Both of the MiniPCIe connectors accommodate full-length cards with screw-down mounting for improved shock and vibration durability. One MiniPCIe connector also supports bootable mSATA solid-state disks. The PC/104-Plus connector provides access to a full ecosystem of legacy off-the-shelf and custom-design I/O expansion modules, including dual Gigabit Ethernet and data acquisition modules. Linux, Windows® and other x86 operating systems can be booted from the CFast, mSATA, SATA or USB interfaces, providing flexible data storage options. WinSystems provides drivers for Linux and Windows 10 as well as preconfigured embedded operating systems. Accelerated Performance And Speed To Market “The EBC-C413 also represents the extension of our 34-year commitment to customers through embedded system solution development, design, production, technical support and proven product reliability,” Hilliard said. “Buying the most advanced plug-and-perform SBCs from WinSystems shrinks their development timeframes and speeds delivery, shortening time-to-market for their applications.” About Winsystems Founded in 1982, WinSystems, Inc. designs and manufactures industrial single board computers (SBCs), I/O modules, and panel PCs that operate over extended temperatures. Product lines include rugged, compact standards such as 3.5-inch SBC, COM Express carrier boards, PC/104, PC/104-Plus, EPIC, EBX, and STD Bus. These products are engineered for harsh, rugged environments, which include industrial IoT, automation/control, transportation management, energy management, Mil/COTS, medical and communications applications.

The Alienware 13 sports a GTX 10 series graphics card and a sixth-generation Intel Skylake processor with a base price of $1,199.  ( Dell ) Advertisement Alienware's touting itself as the maker of the first virtual reality-ready 13-inch laptop with the new Alienware 13, a powerful notebook that packs an Nvidia GTX 10 series graphics card, sixth-generation Intel Skylake chips and up to 16 GB of RAM. Alienware's name carries the weight of reputable gaming computers none of which are underserved with mediocre specs. The company's highly recognized for top-tier high-powered laptops, and Alienware 13 remains a service to that brand but with the prized presence of virtual reality tagging along. This year saw tremendous inroads for virtual reality, as several companies fumbled together its own virtual reality headsets such as Google's Daydream, Sony's PlayStation VR, HTC and Valve's HTC Vive and others, with the sustained imminence of mobile VR platforms slowly gaining traction. It's still a fairly nascent platform, but many companies have been exceedingly toying with it, even Atari's Nolan Bushnell wants in on the game. The Alienware 13 comes as Alienware's entry point in accessible virtual reality experiences because the setup involved in creating a VR experience requires very powerful and bulky equipment, a prerequisite many VR companies try to quash in order to make the appeal of the platform immediate. The base model of the VR-ready Alienware 13 has a powerful Intel Core i5-6300HQ chip alongside an Nvidia GTX 10 series graphics chip, specifically, the GeForce GTX 1060 with 6 GB GDDR5 and 8 GB of DDR4 RAM. This configuration will net you $1,199, but if you prefer beefier specs, there are Core i7 models with 16 GB of RAM at much higher price points. In terms of storage, Alienware 13 comes with up to 2 TB of internal storage split into two: 1 TB of PCI express of solid state drive as a boot drive, and the other terabyte serves as storage. The screen may also come in different options, with the lowest being a 13.3-inch 1,366 x 768 display. If low-resolution displays are a pet peeve, there's an option for a 1080p IPS display and a Quad HD display with touch control. Of course, a better screen spells a more expensive price. In terms of portability, the Alienware 13 weighs below six pounds and is less than an inch thick at its thickest point. Alienware has outfitted this laptop with "maximum thermal design power support," which keeps the system cool even under intensive performance. It comes with a 76 Wh battery and customizable color schemes for the keyboard. The Alienware 13 is available now on Dell's online store, which ships in 23 to 27 business days.

May Bring to the 2018 MacBook Pro Line Although Apple just refreshed its MacBook Pro lineup, the next iterations of these systems could see substantial performance boosts. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 1, 2016 at 9:26PM On Oct. 27, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced its long-awaited refresh to the MacBook Pro lineup. The company released three new models, including two 13-inch models and a 15-inch model. These machines have seen substantial improvements across the board, ranging from much better displays to faster processors, and a lot more.  Apple's new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro systems. Image source: Apple.  Although Apple managed to deliver some nice generation-over-generation improvements, it is very likely that the company's next MacBook Pro refreshes -- which I expect to come in the first half of 2018 --- will include some very substantial upgrades in one critical area: processor performance. Get ready for a large leap in performance Apple delivered solid improvements in the performance levels of its latest MacBook Pro systems relative to the prior-generation models. The 13-inch MacBook Pro saw a move from Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) older Broadwell architecture with vanilla Intel HD graphics to its newer Skylake processors with its more sophisticated Iris graphics. The 15-inch MacBook Pro enjoyed a bump from Intel's 2013 Haswell architecture to its much more modern Skylake architecture. That's a two-generation leap. However, even though the underlying processor architectures in the newer MacBook Pro systems are improved relative to those found in the prior-generation models, one thing has remained constant across the board: processor core count. Both the old and new 13-inch MacBook Pro systems come with dual-core processors, and both the old and new 15-inch MacBook Pro systems come with quad-core processors. These are currently among the fastest notebook processors available today, and certainly the highest core count Intel laptop processors available in their respective segments. However, those core counts are set to go much higher in Intel's early 2018 mobile processor lineup, which I believe Apple's next MacBook Pro systems are likely to use. More cores for the Mac Intel's next-next generation processor lineup, code-named Coffee Lake, is expected to come in a couple of new configurations that should be quite interesting to Apple. According to a leak of an Intel mobile processor road map that has made its way across the Web, the company's 28-watt processor lineup, used in the 13-inch MacBook Pro, is expected to get a variant with four processor cores paired with the company's Iris graphics technology. The 45-watt processor lineup, used in the 15-inch MacBook Pro, is expected to come in a configuration with six processor cores and Intel HD graphics, according to the leak. Those additional cores should enable a large boost in performance, particularly in applications that can take advantage of those additional cores -- think video editing. Apple's tight control of the hardware and software could better position it to find compelling use cases for the additional performance, and should Apple market the increase correctly, it could help to fuel a robust MacBook Pro upgrade cycle. We could see one even stronger than what we'll witness with Apple's recently released MacBook Pro systems -- though the strength of that remains to be seen. Not a game changer for Apple stock, but... The Mac product line isn't the major driver of Apple's revenue or profit. The iPhone is. Nevertheless, it's important for Apple's non-iPhone businesses, such as its Mac business, to perform as well as possible to provide something of a cushion in case the company's iPhone business has a bum year, as it did during fiscal 2016. Apple credited Mac with 12% of revenue in the fourth quarter. As long as Apple makes sure it delivers compelling new Mac systems at a regular and predictable cadence through a combination of delivering its own hardware and software innovations and leveraging innovations from key component suppliers, it stands a pretty good chance of keeping its Mac business healthy.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Mesa 13.0.0 3D Graphics Library Adds OpenGL 4.5 Capability, Radeon Vulkan Driver GO OpenGL 4.4 support is available as well in this release Nov 1, 2016 23:59 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  After being in development for the past month or so, during which it received a total of three RC (Release Candidate) builds, the final version of the highly-anticipated Mesa 13.0.0 3D Graphics Library is now available for GNU/Linux distributions. And it looks like it's a major release that we must install on our Linux-powered computers if we want to play games, use various OpenGL apps, or just have the best possible graphics support for our AMD Radeon, Nvidia, or Intel GPUs. The biggest new feature of Mesa 13.0.0 is, as expected, OpenGL 4.4 and OpenGL 4.5 capability. While OpenGL 4.4/4.5 is there after upgrading to Mesa 13.0.0 stable, the drivers may show a lower version. That happens because of the pending Khronos CTS validation, but it will be fixed very soon in an upcoming point release, such as 13.0.1. The good news continues with a Radeon Vulkan driver (RADV) for supported AMD Radeon GPUs by the AMDGPU kernel driver. OpenGL ES 3.2 now available for Intel Skylake or later The list of cool new features implemented in today's Mesa 3D 13.0.0 Graphics Library release continues with OpenGL ES 3.2 support for Intel Skylake or later, OpenGL ES 3.1 support for Intel Haswell, Windows-DRI support to the GLX component, as well as KHR_no_config_context and EGL_KHR_debug support for EGL component. The Mesa EGL interface also received official support for EGL_MESA_platform_surfaceless, along with various improvements for Android, X11/DRI3, and Wayland backends. H.264 encoding support is now available for the Video Acceleration API (VAAPI) and H.265 decoding support for OMX. You should also know that Mesa 13.0.0 3D Graphics Library requires Flex 2.6.1 or older, libudev is no longer required and was replaced by libdrm, third-party tools are required for certain components, such as xxd for Intel's aubinator and python2 for SWR, and dozens of GL extensions have been added to the included drivers. Check out the full release notes for more details.

Share with your friends Your Name Your Email Recipient Email Enter a Message I read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be something for you. The article is called Top 5: Best alternatives to a MacBook Pro laptop (Hint: they run Microsoft Windows) and is located at http://www.starkinsider.com/2016/11/top-5-best-alternatives-macbook-pro-laptop-hint-run-microsoft-windows.html. Captcha Submit CLOSE Culture Tech/SV Wanderlust Interviews Video Features Culture Tech/SV Wanderlust Interviews Video Features Tech & Silicon Valley Top 5: Best alternatives to a MacBook Pro laptop (Hint: they run Microsoft Windows) By Clinton Stark - 11.01.2016 If you’re in the market to upgrade your laptop these are the most interesting of times. Apple is doubling down on its premium approach. New MacBook Pros start at $1,499 (USD) and go up rapidly from there, with the entry 15-inch Pro model starting at a not insignificant $2,499. Gulp. Meanwhile, Windows-based laptops are going for a song. Many are priced less than $1,000 and, yet, don’t compromise much on power, graphics or overall usability. A lot of that had to do with Windows 10. Microsoft’s latest OS finally has the stability we always wanted, and, even better, is equally at home on a touch-based tablet, or a power-monger desktop, or, as we’re looking at today, a lean and nimble laptop. After reviewing Apple’s latest offering of MacBook Pro laptops, I did something I would never have thought possible just a few years ago: I started to consider a Windows-based machine to replace my 2012 MacBook Air. Blasphemy! I know, but I’m guessing many of you are in the same boat. Why pay thousands for an Apple logo, when you could spend far less for a laptop that is on par in basically every other way, and even better in some (touch)? So I’ve been exhaustively researching the market, testing various Windows laptops. Drawing up short-lists. Here’s 5 laptops that I consider to be worthy MacBook Pro alternatives. Some are value-based choices. While others are focused more on performance. Whether you prefer Windows or MacOS is up to you of course. Each has their merits, and both are mature, refined operating systems. But I humbly suggest this may be the time to at least take a peak at non-Apple laptop choices. You may be surprised at the quality on offer. With that, here’s the top 5 best alternatives to a MacBook Pro laptop. Top 5: Best alternatives to a MacBook Pro laptop (in no particular order) Asus ZenBook Flip 13.3-inch Touchscreen Laptop Price: $749 (USD) Strengths: portability, lots of ports, long battery life, 360-degree rotating screen works well with touch-based Windows 10 Perfect for: students, real estate professionals, those who often give presentations, creatives on the go, web browsing Watch out for: keyboard has no backlighting With the ZenBook Flip, Asus simply put, knocked it out of the park. Value-wise you’d be hard pressed to find a better 13.3″ Windows-based laptop. At under 3 pounds, you can easily slip this ultra slim laptop into a backback, or a slip cover, or just toss it into the backseat of a car. Better still, unlike Apple, Asus hasn’t skimped on ports. This is a dongle-free zone, thankfully. It’s all here: USB-C, USB 3.1, Micro HDMI, and SD card slot. Keyboard action is tactile, comfortable. As is the generously proportioned touchpad. Keep in mind the screen is “only” HD (1920×1080), but most, on this size of screen, will find it perfectly fine. The upside is decent performance (Intel Core M + Inten HD 515 Graphics), and exceptional battery life (8-10+ hours on average). Is the ZenBook Flip a gaming beast? No. But for those looking for mobile, low-cost productivity who spend most of their days in a web browser should find this laptop a sure-fire winner. Buy/research: Asus ZenBook Flip 13.3″ Touchscreen Latop (Intel Core M, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 10) $749 Dell XPS 13.3-inch QHD+ Touchscreen Laptop Price: $1,049 (USD) Strengths: mid-range power (Intel i5), super-sharp anti-glare LED display (3200×1800 pixels), backlit keyboard Perfect for: those who need to do light photo and video editing on the road, basic to mid-range gamers, office productivity users Watch out for: high resolution screen is beautiful, but it can limit battery life This is the not the Dell of yesterday. First up on the well-regarded Dell XPS 13.3-inch ultra portable: gorgeous design featuring a pretty silver anodized aluminum finish and high quality assembly. Next: a more than capable Intel i5 processor, backlit keyboard, QHD+ LED display (3200×1800) and a slim form factor coming in at only 2.78 pounds. All the ports you’d want are here to including a 3-in-1 card reader, mic/headphone, 2x USB 3.0 and 1 mini DisplayPort. Reviews are universally glowing for the XPS 13. For good reason, Dell gives you tremendous bang of the buck. Also, note that the display is finished with a rare, anti-glare coating. This makes it highly view-able outdoors, though less handy as a personal mirror. Buy/research: Dell XPS 13.3-Inch UltraSharp QHD+ Touchscreen 3200×1800 LED Anti-glare display Laptop (Intel Core i5-5200U 2.2GHz, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4, Mini DisplayPort, Windows 10 Home) $1,049 Acer Predator 17.3-inch Full HD Gaming Laptop Price: $1,499 (USD) Strengths: packed with power including top end Intel i7 processor and NVIDIA GPU, plenty of memory and storage, expansive and comfortable keyboard, huge 17-inch display Perfect for: advanced gamers, video and photo professionals, anyone who needs maximum power on-the-go (without breaking the bank) Watch out for: short battery life (no surprise given impressive specs), non-touch screen Now we’re talking power. The Acer Predator is a spec monster. Basically, this laptop is a desktop replacement. You can throw just about anything at this beast and it won’t miss a beast: advanced games, video editing, photo editing, VR applications, 3D modelling. You name it. A high end Intel i7 CPU and dedicated NVIDIA GTX 970M help, as do copious amounts of RAM (16B) and storage (1TB). All the usual ports are here, including Thunderbolt 3. Keyboard (with numeric keybpad) is backlit and the speakers have plenty of oomph (Dolby Audio) to please audiophiles, and gamers alike. Obvious downsides are limited battery life (about 5 hours), and an HD display. Still, it’s hard to argue, the Acer Predator delivers impressive performance for the price. Buy/research: Acer Predator 17 G9-791-735A 17.3-inch Full HD Gaming Notebook (Windows 10) $1,499 HP Notebook 15.6-Inch Laptop (i5-6200U Processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10) Price: $459 (USD) Strengths: low price, comfortable keyboard, mid-range performance (Intel i5), large 15.6-inch anti-glare display Perfect for: those on a tight budget Watch out for: weight (4.73 pounds) and battery (7 hours) – those not too bad considering the low price Under $500 for a laptop with an Intel i5 processor? Impossible, right? Thanks to HP, you can in fact spend about $460 and get a solid laptop. It’s a little bulkier than, say, the Asus ZenBook Flip and Dell XPS 13 mentioned above, but you’re getting mid-range power at a bargain price. Do I love the design? Not particularly. This is a basic looking laptop. It has a keyboard, ports, a touchpad, and the screen folds down. Just like we’ve come to know and maybe love for the past few decades. But that price! And don’t forget you get the latest edition of Windows 10 (Home), plenty of storage (1TB), and a roomy keyboard. Aside from Chromebooks, this is certainly worth a look for those on a tight budget. Buy/research: HP Notebook 15.6-Inch Laptop ( i5-6200U Processor, 8GB DDR3L SDRAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10) $459 Microsoft Surface Book Price: $1,248 (2015) with i5, 128GB, 8GB RAM or starting from $2,499 (2016) for i7 Performance Base Strengths: 2-in-1 laptop and tablet hybrid design, stylus and inking capability is top notch, innovative hinge enables multiple operating modes (clipboard, laptop, drawing), long battery life, all the ports that you won’t find on the new MacBook Pro, outstanding 13.5-inch touchscreen (3000×2000) Perfect for: creatives who want inking capability in a portable, all-day ready design; graphic designers; those who want the cutting edge in mobile technology Watch out for: pricey I’m sure you saw this coming. The big headlines in the laptop wars these days has been: Apple MacBook Pro vs. Microsoft Surface Book. While all the laptops above are capable, most aren’t quite up to the combination of power and packaging that Apple offers. Surface Book, however, can go toe to toe with Apple’s premium laptops, and, in some cases, exceed them. Case in point: that stylus and the ability to take full advantage of the built-in inking tech in Windows 10. It’s fantastic. If you take notes, like to doodle, or are a professional graphics designer or artist, you’re probably going to like what Microsoft has done here. OneNote, for example, is an exceptional, cloud-based note-taking application. And it’s free. You can hand-write (and have it converted to text), draw free form, type, organize notes and information, and then have it sync across all your mobile devices. Can you tell I’m a fan? I recently used OneNote for a Werner Herzog filmmaking class I took over the summer. It sold me, hook, line and sinker. On the downside: price. Surface Books are positioned comparable to MacBooks… i.e. expensive. Here’s an idea. You can still buy a more than capable i5-based Surface Book for about $1,250 or so. That’s not bad. If you have the means and want the cutting edge in mobile, then by all means spring for the new i7 Performance Base editions, starting at $2,499. Whether you like Apple and its Touch Bar or Microsoft and its all-touch philosophy is up to you. As far as MacBook Pro alternative go, the Surface Book is, in my estimation, as good as it gets. Buy/research: Microsoft Surface Book (128 GB, 8 GB RAM, Intel Core i5) $1,248 (note: this is the 2015 model, it’s worth a look given the heavy discount and that Microsoft has worked out the early software bugs) Conclusion: MacBook Pros are impressive, but there’s plenty of excellent Windows-based alternatives Yes, MacBook Pros are expensive. They’re also exceptionally engineered. Consequently they typically can last for years before needing an upgrade. I expect the same will hold true for this 2016 range. However, Microsoft has come a long way. Windows 10 is easy to use, refined, and more stable than ever before. Thanks to the company’s emphasis on touch, Windows-based mobile devices tend to be more flexible in their design, affording all sorts of possibility for artists and office users alike. Top 5: Best alternatives to a MacBook Pro laptop Asus ZenBook Flip 13.3-inch Touchscreen Laptop $749 Dell XPS 13.3-inch QHD+ Touchscreen Laptop $1,049 Acer Predator 17.3-inch Full HD Gaming Laptop $1,499 HP Notebook 15.6-Inch Laptop $459 Microsoft Surface Book $1,248 (2015), $2,499+ (2016) Apple seems to be hell bent on a “less is more” attitude. So with the new MacBook Pros they’re only giving us USB-C ports (flexible, but a pain in the dongle), a Touch Bar in lieu of a touchscreen, and a keyboard featuring very flat keys with minimal travel. All of those things might not be an issue in the long-term, but for me it’s making my quest to replace my aging 2012 MacBook Air not an easy one. For once I’m thinking Microsoft is beginning to pull ahead in the laptop wars. Explore. Create. Live. Follow Stark Insider on Twitter and Facebook.

Ordinarily, this would be the perfect time to go get a new laptop. But not in 2016. See, although Intel announced its new line of Kaby Lake processors back in August, we won't see a lot of the new processors in laptops until next year. The new processors promise all sorts of improvements over the current Skylake versions, but even if you don't care about better 4K video playback, you probably do care about saving money. Which is why you should slowly back away from the Amazon cart, set down the 1-click order button, and wait. DON'T MISS: The worst thing about Apple’s new MacBook Pro in two amazing pictures Kaby Lake is the seventh generation of Intel's Core processors. On paper, it's not that much of an upgrade over the Skylake chips that came before. It runs on the same-sized 14nm process, using a mostly-similar architecture to the Skylake chips, so there aren't any giant improvements in battery life or processing power for general-use applications. But where the new chips should be much better is for specific things like 4K video playback or VR. Intel has started to tailor its silicon to the kinds of intensive tasks that currently tax the processor. It's the same thing that processor manufacturers have been doing for the last few years for smartphones: rather than just increase overall processing power, Qualcomm, Samsung and Apple have customized their chips so that they're much better at a specific task. Intel is claiming that you'll get nearly double the battery life when streaming 4K video off YouTube, which is a huge improvement. Other battery-intensive tasks, like general web browsing, also get a double-digit efficiency boost. So, for the same-size laptop with the same battery, you'll be getting hours more battery life if you wait for a Kaby Lake chip. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBgSfEzb9cg Gaming is another good example. The beefy quad-core Kaby Lake processors, which won't launch until early next year, will have the latest version of Intel's Iris graphics. We don't know a ton about it, but we've seen demos of thin-and-light laptops running graphically intensive games like Overwatch at a decent FPS. The big question is if the best Iris graphics will be able to handle basic AR or VR tasks. If they can pull that off, it will mean serious graphics performance in a thin laptop with low power draw. So when will be a good time to buy a laptop? The basic, low-power Kaby Lake chips are already out, but we'll have to wait until sometime early next year for the high-power, quad-core laptop processors that you find in the MacBook Pro or Surface Book. You can expect all the big-name laptop manufacturers to debut laptops packing Kaby Lake, so a few demos at the Consumer Electronics Show in January is a good guess. Even if you don't care about any of the graphics or efficiency improvements, it's probably worth waiting until the new year to buy a new laptop. With Kaby Lake computers coming out, the perfectly capable Skylake PCs will be going on sale anyway.

Project Olympus is being described as a way to embrace future platforms in a standardized design, much like other OCP projects, and the open source standards behind the platform are offering insights into Intel’s Skylake-EP Platform, known as Purley. It seems odd for information about Skylake-EP to be sanctioned at this time (technically none of the documents mention Intel, Skylake or Purley, but it can be deciphered as below), especially given the recent release of Broadwell-E/EP and Intel’s previous stance of limited data release prior to launch. It would appear that the information Microsoft are providing at the summit has been sanctioned, however sometimes putting two plus two together requires a little digging. All this information is posted on the Microsoft Azure blog, which links directly to the OCP pages where motherboard specifications and server mechanical specifications are provided in PDF format. It’s a Socket We’ve Seen Before, Which Can Make Waves Being the motherboard guy at AnandTech, I skipped straight to the motherboard information. Page 31 of the motherboard document gives the following example motherboard drawing: Here is a dual-socket design, with a set of PCIe slots, some power connectors and other I/O components (some fiber Ethernet, for example). But jam packed in the middle are two very large sockets. We’ve seen these before, back at Supercomputing 2015 when Intel announced Knights Landing, which is a Xeon Phi product: Xeon Phi's Knights Landing design uses an LGA3647 implementation based on its 72 cores, 16GB of MCDRAM, and six memory channels. There are a lot of pins because there’s a lot to power up. In previous generations of EP processors, both EP and E have shared the same socket. If I wanted to use my E5-2699 v4 Broadwell-EP LGA2011-3 processor in an X99 consumer motherboard instead of an i7-6950X, I could. Essentially all the Core and all the Xeon E5 CPUs have shared a common socket, making it easy for 1P/2P/4P processors to share around.  If Purley / Skylake-EP uses the LGA3647 socket, this means one of four things. The first is that this might not be Skylake-EP, and something odd like Skylake-EN. The second is that Skylake-E will also share the same socket, and be LGA3647. This sounds somewhat implausible, given that Skylake-EP will have to handle at least the same amount of cores as Broadwell-EP, so there would be a lot of pins on a consumer platform for no reason. The third possibility is that Skylake-E and Skylake-EP are going to be different sockets. This would indicate a split between consumer HEDT and dual-socket workstations and servers. Given previous generational changes, Skylake-E for consumers is expected to follow a similar pattern – around 2000 pins in a single socket design. However if Skylake-EP is making the jump to a significantly larger socket, especially for 2P workstation and server designs, it will produce a spread of difference in potential for pricing structures and implementation. The fourth possibility extends from the third, and that Skylake-EP will have two socket designs depending on the size of the core. For Broadwell-EP, there were three designs for the silicon underneath – a low core count (LCC), a medium core count (MCC) and an extreme core count (XCC). If Intel are splitting up the sockets, it may be the case that only the XCC or MCC+XCC sides of the equation are using LGA3647. LCC designs are typically used for the consumer E series parts anyway, so Intel may decide to make the low core designs of EP on the smaller socket. There’s a wealth of possibility here. I Heard You Like RAM. I Heard You Like Storage. On the main Microsoft Azure page, a handy diagram of an example machine was provided (with some areas blacked out): Here we see that motherboard from the image above, using two low profile heatsinks with copper piping feeding an optional heatsink inside the chassis. To the sides of each of the sockets are big black squares, indicating where the DDR4 memory should go. Nearer the bottom of the board are networking implementations (50G is labeled), and PCIe slots suitable for three full-height, half-length (FHHL) PCIe cards.  Interestingly on the right-hand side, we have labeled ‘up to 8 M.2 NVMe SSDs’. Back to the motherboard specification, we see the list of blacked out areas along with a more comprehensive sequence of potential configurations: There are spots for up to 32 DIMMs, which makes 16 per socket. Depending on how many memory controllers the CPU has, this could mean 8-channel and 2 DIMMs per channel (DPC), or 4-channel and 4 DPC. Nowhere does it state the maximum DRAM support per CPU, but DDR4 LRDIMMs are currently at 256GB/module, meaning a potential maximum of 4TB per CPU or 8TB per system. We expect Skylake-EP to support 3D XPoint at some stage as well. On that list of support also mentions up to 12 SATA devices, up to 3 FHHL cards, and two PCIe x8 slots capable of supporting two M.2 modules each. So this is where that 8x M.2 comes in – if we get four from two PCIe x8 slots, and combine this with up to four M.2 direct attach modules, that makes eight. The top-level block diagram is also worth a look. Patrick from STH specifically points out the PCIe 3.0 support for the platform: On the right-hand side, adding up all the PCIe numbers and it comes to 88 PCIe 3.0 lanes, or 44 per CPU. This would be an upgrade on the 40 lanes per CPU currently on Broadwell-EP. There is also provision for PCIe lanes to be used with the mini-SAS connectors on the left-hand side. Technically the BMC also requires a PCIe link as well. So When? Given the long product cycles of Intel’s EP platforms, and the fact that the Big Seven cloud providers have a lot of clout over sales means they are most likely testing and integrating the next generation hardware. The release to the public, and smaller players in the OCP space, is a long and slow one. We’re not expecting Skylake-E/EP out until well into 2017, if not the year after, so information will certainly be on the slow burn. Supercomputing 2016 is happening in Utah in a couple of weeks, and although we won’t be there due to scheduling, something may pop out of the woodwork. We’ll keep our eyes peeled.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 1, 2016 at 8:16AM In a prior column, I went over why investors in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shouldn't freak out over the company's increased investments in its lucrative and fast-growing data-center group, or DCG. Intel's data-center chief, Diane Bryant. Image source: Intel.  Here, I'd like to go over three areas in which Intel is likely beefing up its investments within DCG. Complementary technologies The bulk of Intel's DCG revenue comes from the sale of processors and related chipsets, but the company has been talking up the growing importance of complementary non-processor components to its businesses. Intel's non-processor technologies are a small but rapidly growing part of its data-center biz. Image source: Intel.  The examples of such technologies that the company routinely cites in investor presentations are 3D XPoint memory modules, silicon photonics, and its proprietary Omni-Path fabric for high-performance computing applications. It seems likely that the company is spending more money to put additional development resources on these projects, particularly as the company is banking on these technologies to help boost the long-term growth rate of DCG. More custom processor projects Analyst Romit Shah recently postulated that part of the spending increases on Intel's part could be a "defense move" on Intel's part that could potentially include "more custom projects" in a bid to "stem market share loss." Indeed, back in 2014, Intel's data-center general manager, Diane Bryant, indicated that the company integrates custom features into its server processors for specific customers and is even working with potential customers on "fully custom" processors. Image source: Intel. Considering this, I wouldn't be surprised if the company were investing more in DCG to be able to support a greater number of semi-custom and fully custom processor projects for major high-volume customers, with, perhaps, the bar for what constitutes a "worthwhile" project coming down a bit. Accelerator technologies Intel has always been good at building very high-performance, power-efficient processors. Going forward, being able to build best-in-class processors will certainly continue to be a key point of differentiation and a large part of Intel's value proposition in the data center. Intel has also been more aggressive in pursuing technologies that can be used to dramatically speed up certain specialized workloads, broadly referred to as accelerators. Intel's Xeon Phi represents a key type of accelerator technology. Image source: Intel.  Accelerators come in many forms, from dedicated hardware integrated into the same chip as the main processor to co-processors that work alongside the main processors. Unsurprisingly, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich thinks that accelerator technologies can help to boost the growth of DCG. "So we look at those accelerators as enhancing this growth," Krzanich said on the company's most recent earnings call. He further went on to claim that Intel has the "widest" portfolio of accelerator technologies, "from FPGAs through the Xeon Phi and then into [application-specific integrated circuit] driven devices." It stands to reason, then, that to support this set of technologies and to develop even more of them down the line, the company is going to need to invest more in terms of money and human resources to develop them. It wouldn't surprise me one bit to learn that a doubling down on these accelerators was part of the spending increases in DCG. Investing now is the right thing to do The last thing Intel needs is to be caught flat-footed in its data-center business, so investing today to ensure that it's in a strong competitive position tomorrow is conceptually the right thing to do. Increased investments do hurt near-term profitability, which stockholders, particularly in businesses as large and mature as Intel, don't like. However, it's better to pay the price now and reap the rewards later than to maximize profitability now only to have things fall off a cliff down the line. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Mesa 13.0 Released With Intel OpenGL 4.5, RADV Radeon Vulkan Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Display Drivers on 1 November 2016. Page 1 of 1. 43 Comments Mesa 13.0 was released today as what is likely the most significant release to this 3D graphics driver/library implementation ever! Mesa 13 is huge for open-source driver uses particularly with Intel, Radeon, and GeForce hardware driver improvements. During development this release was known as Mesa 12.1 OpenGL 4.5: The Intel i965 driver for Broadwell hardware and newer now supports OpenGL 4.5 compared to GL 4.3 on the previous stable release. This is a huge win and great to finally see the Intel driver catch-up to the latest OpenGL specification albeit doesn't yet support all the 2015~2015 extensions, including the extensions needed for the "AZDO" approaches. Haswell is still at OpenGL 3.3 for Mesa 13.0. The RadeonSI (AMD GCN) and Nouveau NVC0 (Fermi and newer) drivers have also implemented all OpenGL 4.4/4.5 extensions, but they only advertise OpenGL 4.3. Not until they complete the Khronos GL 4.4 / 4.5 conformance tests will that support be advertised via the OpenGL string. The Radeon crew is working on the CTS passing but they have said it's quite some work while the Nouveau developers are still working on figuring out the CTS approach with just being a community-organized driver effort. OpenGL ES: On the OpenGL ES front, Intel Haswell now has OpenGL ES 3.1 support while Skylake and newer have finished OpenGL ES 3.2 support. RADV Radeon Vulkan: The RADV driver was merged to mainline Mesa as an open-source Radeon Vulkan driver that made much progress over the summer (http://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=23596). This is the "unofficial" Radeon Vulkan driver with AMD having not yet open-sourced their promised Vulkan driver code and even AMD developers having recently referred to this as the "Red Hat driver", so it's still up in the air what will happen in the long-term for open-source AMD Vulkan support. At least RADV is making good progress for satisfying Linux gamers now and can successfully run The Talos Principle, vkQuake, and Dota 2 Vulkan-enabled Linux games. The RADV driver works in conjunction with the AMDGPU kernel driver meaning support by default for GCN 1.2 GPUs and newer or GCN 1.0/1.1 if you manually enable the experimental AMDGPU support in the kernel. Better Intel Vulkan Driver: Intel's "ANV" Vulkan driver is in much better shape now than when it premeiered in Mesa 12.0. There has been performance optimizations, many fixes, and other feature improvements for this open-source Vulkan driver that is supported the best on Broadwell and newer while the Haswell support may still vary. Nouveau Pascal: Early work on Pascal support in NVC0 but it is only relevant for the GP100 and not the consumer GeForce GTX 1000 series hardware, until NVIDIA releases the signed firmware images to Nouveau developers. Better RadeonSI Performance: The open-source RadeonSI driver has seen a number of performance improvements. Upgrading is very much worthwhile for users of the open-source AMD driver stack. Gallium Nine: There have been many improvements to the Gallium3D Direct3D 9 state tracker. So far this state tracker is only useful if patching Wine to support using this D3D9 implementation when running your Windows games on Linux. Mesa development was extremely fast-paced this year and is at nearly two million lines of code. As great as Mesa 13 is, there are some features you won't find in Mesa 13.0.

The question now is INTC stock worth buying at this lower price? There was nothing wrong with Intel’s third-quarter earnings. The chipmaker posted record profits. At 80 cents a share, adjusted earnings exceeded Wall Street’s earnings estimate by 8 cents. That’s a big beat. Sales topped expectations, too. The top line expanded 9% to $15.8 billion. Wall Street was modeling revenue of $15.6 billion. The backward-looking numbers looked pretty good, but then the market doesn’t pay for past performance. It’s all about future earnings, and on that basis, INTC spooked investors. The company guided fourth-quarter revenue to $15.7 billion, which is significantly below what analysts were expecting. The sales hit comes courtesy of start-up costs for next-generation manufacturing capabilities. That sounds like a good use of capital expenditures. Leveraging wise investments to goose future profits is what a company like INTC is supposed to do. But the market was having none of it. Intel stock has lost more than 7% in wake of the Oct. 18 earnings report. 9 Shiny New Dividend Stocks You Can Trust in the Long Run The sharp drop in INTC stock seems overdone. After all, it’s not like the company took an axe to its outlook. It’s sort of bizarre. How does the market punish a stock to this degree for issuing slightly disappointing revenue guidance for the ongoing quarter? If Intel didn’t say anything and fourth-quarter revenue came up short of estimates, the drubbing would have been far less severe. Heck, the company missed analysts’ average revenue estimate in the June quarter and pretty much cruised right through. Intel Stock Is on Sale These clues suggest INTC stock might be beaten down for no good reason. Most companies in Intel’s sector — and probably most companies in general — are cutting back on investment. INTC is plowing ahead even as its results and stock takes hits. More importantly, Intel is investing wisely. INTC stock still struggles with the headwind of PC sales. They’re a slowly melting iceberg. But this is old news. What investors should be focusing on is Intel’s success in the segment that makes server chips for cloud-based computing. The Data Center Group contributes about 50% of operating earnings. Revenue is accelerating. This area of growth is a secular, not cyclical, trend. PCs might be in decline, but servers have a bright future.

MacBook Pro 15-inch 2016 vs Dell XPS 15: Which is best? by Michael Passingham 01 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments MacBook Pro 15-inch 2016 vs Dell XPS 15: We take a look at two of the best laptops you can buy to determine which is the best. Apple recently launched three new laptop models: two 13-inch MacBook Pros and a 15-inch model. After years of stagnation, the fight between Dell and Apple has finally got interesting. We’ve already run the numbers on the Dell XPS 13 and the 13-inch MacBook Pro, but now it’s time for the two bigger models to face off. Aside from the obvious operating system difference – you’ll have to make up your own mind whether you want macOS Sierra or Windows 10 – the two machines' technical specifications and build quality need a close look to understand what you’re getting for your money. There are four specified Dell XPS 15s available and three 15-inch MacBook Pros. The table below shows you the differences between the base and top-spec models of each. Related: 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 vs Dell XPS 13 WATCH: Dell XPS 15 Review MacBook Pro 15-inch 2016 vs Dell XPS 15 – Full specification comparison (Based on Dell.com and Apple.com. Other retailers may vary) Device Dell XPS 15 MacBook Pro 15 Weight 1.78-2kg 1.83kg Dimensions H: 17mm W: 357mm D: 235mm H: 15.5mm W: 349mm D: 240mm Processor choices Quad-core 6th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7, up to 3.5GHz Quad-core 6th-gen Intel Core i7, up to 3.8GHz Graphics Intel HD Graphics 530 AND 2GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M Intel HD Graphics 530 AND 2GB AMD Radeon Pro 450 OR 455 OR 4GB Radeon Pro 460 RAM 8-32GB DDR4 16GB DDR3 Storage 1TB hard disk to 1TBPCI-E SSD 256GB-2TB PCI-E SSD Screen 15.6-inch 1,920x1,080 or 3,840x2,160 15.4-inch 2,880x1,800 Price £1199-£2049 £1,899-£4,049 MacBook Pro 15-inch 2016 vs Dell XPS 15 – Design and build Apple and Dell have adopted completely different philosophies in the building of their two laptops. While Apple has gone with a tried and tested aluminium unibody design, Dell has opted for an aluminium lid and carbon fibre-coated wrist rest and keyboard tray, with a metal base. Both are exceptionally pretty and well-built machines so there’s no real loser here. Related: What's new with the MacBook Pro? Physical specs tell a slightly different story, though. The MacBook is 50g heavier than the 1.78kg Dell XPS 15, although if you pick a top-end XPS 15 with a touch screen and larger battery, it goes up to a rather heavier 2kg, making the MacBook Pro the winner here when it comes to the top-spec model. The MacBook Pro is a similar size to the Dell XPS 15 when it comes to width and depth, but more substantial in terms of depth – the MacBook Pro is slightly thinner at 15.5mm while the Dell XPS 15 makes do with a thickness of 17mm. This is because the MacBook uses a 15.4-inch screen, while the XPS 15 uses a 15.6-inch panel with a wafer-thin bezel. The most obvious difference in hardware is the MacBook’s Touch Bar. Unique to the MacBook, Dell has no answer and retains a dedicated row of physical function keys. For more on the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, read our guide. Related: Dell XPS 15 review In terms of the keyboard, the new MacBook Pros use Apple’s Butterfly key switches, which offer less travel and a slightly clickier feel than conventional laptop keys. They’re not for everyone, so we’d recommend visiting an Apple Store to try them out for yourself. The MacBook has a gigantic touchpad, much bigger than that on the XPS 15, but the XPS 15's is one of the most responsive around, so what it lacks in size it makes up for in usefulness. In terms of ports, the MacBook Pro 15-inch keeps things simple yet awkward. You get four USB-C connectors that double up as Thunderbolt 3 ports alongside a 3.5mm headphone jack. Any of the USB ports can be used for charging. The Dell, meanwhile, gets two full-size USB 3.0 ports, a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 port, a headset jack and an SD card reader. MacBook Pro 15-inch 2016 vs Dell XPS 15 – Performance As ever, this is where things get messy. With a variety of different processors available on both devices, let’s keep it simple. The least powerful MacBook Pro gets a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with a maximum Turbo Boost speed of 3.4GHz. This is only slightly slower than the fastest Dell XPS 15, whose Core i7 has a maximum Turbo Boost of 3.5GHz. Beyond that, every upgrade to the MacBook Pro 15’s processor makes it faster than the Dell XPS 15. Still, both devices are highly capable and will have no problem editing Ultra HD video. If you want something a little cheaper, the bottom-spec Dell XPS 13 gets a quad-core Intel Core i5 processor instead, which reduces its capacity as a video-editing workstation. It’s still a capable photo editor and gaming machine, though. Related: Intel Core i processors explained In the graphics department, things are less clear cut. The MacBook Pro 15 debuts AMD’s Radeon Pro graphics brand, with a choice of three chips on board. There are a pair of 2GB GPUs and a third 4GB model called the 460, but this is an upgrade you’ll have to pay for. The Dell XPS 15, meanwhile, gets a 2GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M in all models. The Radeon Pro is geared towards 3D work and other creative applications but will also have the capacity to play some games, although quite what it will entail in the real world remains to be seen. Still, if you’re only looking for a boost to creative performance, these chips will suit you just fine. The 960M in the Dell is a known quantity, and can play most modern games at reduced graphics settings and resolution. Apple is claiming 10 hours of battery life on the Pro, and while it probably won’t reach that in most moderate work situations, it’ll almost certainly beat the XPS 15 that barely reaches beyond five to six hours in most work situations – one of its biggest failings. Dell also manages to squeeze 32GB of RAM into its top-end model, which will make 4K video editing a much more promising prospect. Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch 2016 vs Dell XPS 15 – Screen You get a choice of screens with the Dell XPS 15. The three cheaper models get Full HD panels while the top spec gets an Ultra HD panel. Both are capable of displaying the full Adobe RGB colour gamut, which makes them great for photo editors and videographers. Related: MacBook Pro 2016 vs Surface Book i7 The MacBook Pro gets a 2,880 x 1,800 pixel panel that’s capable of displaying the full DCI P3 colour gamut used in film making. It’s ridiculously bright at 500 nits, which is beyond anything we’ve ever seen in a laptop and puts it up there with the brightest smartphones and some pretty fancy TVs to boot. We’ve not seen it in the flesh yet, though, so we’ll wait before giving a final judgement. MacBook Pro 15-inch 2016 vs Dell XPS 15 – Pricing and final thoughts The cheapest MacBook Pro 15-inch is more expensive that the second-from-top-end Dell XPS 15, which is slightly more powerful than its Apple-made rival, so at that end of the market the Dell would seem to be better value. Buy Now: Dell XPS 15 at Amazon.com from $942 Best Deals for Dell XPS 15 However, as you move beyond the bottom-spec MacBook, the additional 8GB of RAM, faster processors and super-bright screen start to become more attractive. Without having reviewed the MacBook Pro, a final judgement call is hard. Both the Dell XPS 15 and MacBook Pro 15 are capable video and photo editing workstations, and spending more on the MacBook gets you the clever Touch Bar, a thinner and (at the top-end) lighter design. Right at the very top of the range, the Dell once again seems better value with its huge 32GB of RAM, which will be very helpful for a lot of people.

Processor has more powerful options. Speakers macbook wins with front facing stereo. Best non touch screen. Xps has better More Configurations RAM since you have options and its ddr4. Battery, xps has bigger battery Graphics Ports Value for money Upgradability, you can put more/newer ssd, ram, battery, screen easily. Touchscreen is better than touch strip. Look and feel, tie, I prefer macbook thought. Edit: I think dell precision 15 is more relevant than XPS for this comparison. sdfu November 2, 2016, 12:29 pm Except xps 15 model 2nd from the highest priced comes with a 256 SSD as well too... And still priced lower and with that extra like 500 dollars you could go out and buy a even bigger SSD drive.... And u can disable the touchscreen..easily. The mac rlly has its looks to fall back on. mothergoose85 November 2, 2016, 5:14 pm Something worth mentioning on the trackpad front is (and I know this is partly down to the OS), the gestures on OSX are incredible. They are actually what converted me. Steven Stephen November 4, 2016, 10:48 am I agree and not only that the Force touch trackpad I would say in my opinion is one of the best trackpads out there, and is unique to apple.

Desktop enthusiasts have to wait for the Intel 7th Generation Core ‘Kaby Lake’ desktop processor variants to be released, but we now know what is coming. Intel recently issued a product change noticication (#115022-00) that contains the actual names and frequencies of the upcoming Kaby Lake desktop processors. The Intel Core i7-7700K Processor appears to be the flagship part at launch with clock speeds of 4.2 GHz. Word on the street is that the base clock is 4.2 GHz and that the Turbo Boost clock speed will actually be 4.5 GHz on this quad-core processor with eight threads. The Intel Core i7-6700K ‘Skylake’ processor has a base clock of 4.0 GHz with a maximum Turbo Boost clock speed of 4.2 GHz at a voltage of 1.2V. This means that Kaby Lake will have a nice 200-300MHz stock clock speed advantage over the existing parts. The other ‘K’ sku that is going to be made available is the Intel Core i5-7600K quad-core processor that has a 3.8 GHz base clock and a Turbo Boost clock that is said to be over 4 GHz. Both of these processors feature unlocked designs that are aimed at enthusiasts and overclockers. Rumored priced will be $349 for the Core i7-7700K and $239 for the Core i5-7600K, which isn’t too bad. The Intel Core i7-6700K is available right now for $329.00 and the Core i5-6600K is $237.39 shipped. Hopefully these will come out before CES 2017, but many believe that Intel will be launching them around that time frame. Intel will also be releasing new chipsets to go along with these new processors, so get ready to see a number of Intel 200 series boards coming out soon as well. The top-end Intel Z270 boards will be aimed at enthusiasts, but there will also be the H270, B250, Q250 and Q270 boards for other market segments. Intel Kaby Lake processors will also work in most Intel 100 series boards after a UEFI update, so many can get a drop in upgrade if they felt the desire to upgrade. hapkiman LOL..

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases IoT Partner Programs Expand to Form Stronger Alliances to Combat Complexity of an Expanding IoT Supplier Ecosystem Dell is expanding its partner program ecosystem with its series of IoT gateways, relying on partners like Action Point and Datatrend Technologies. Through a portal, Dell customers can search for the partners that will best fit their needs, based on a variety of metrics like vertical offerings and location. The initial program success is so strong that Dell aims to double its program members by the end of 2016. Similarly, Intel’s IoT Solution Alliance continues to create interoperable, secure solutions to drive efficiencies and deliver device system performance insights. Program members like Advantech and relayr help Intel differentiate its devices and the value they provide to end users. Partner programs drive value for parent organizations, like Dell and Intel, by expanding their ecosystem user base through their member company connections. The programs, in turn, drive value for member companies through incremental business opportunities. Finally, enterprises acquiring IoT capabilities enjoy faster time to market and potentially a more integrated solution. “Today’s successful partner programs are the ones striking the right balance between their number of partners and the overall product offering,” concludes Harbison. “It is not about having the biggest partner program; it is about working to forge new alliances with like-minded partners across multiple sectors and consistently delivering valuable IoT services to a broad range of customers. It is about learning how to adapt in the expanding IoT universe.” These findings are from ABI Research’s SI/VAR and Partner Program IoT Ecosystem Market Data (https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/product/1026029-sivar-and-partner-program-iot-ecosystem-ma/).

News & Analysis Intel, Qualcomm Head for Car Clash Intel's role in BMW/Mobileye alliance: Xeon SoC and more Junko Yoshida 11/1/2016 00:00 AM EDT 1 Comment Login to Rate Tweet MADISON, Wis. – As Qualcomm, after its NXP takeover, becomes a $35 billion behemoth and morphs into the world’s largest automotive chip vendor, expect rivalry between Qualcomm vs. Intel to escalate. This time, the two giants will lock horns not over the smartphone chip market in which Qualcomm remains runaway winner, but in a fast-moving new world of highly automated vehicles.  Although Intel doesn’t even appear among the top 10 automotive semiconductor suppliers, the CPU processor giant has been preparing in recent months for the highly anticipated era of autonomous driving. Ken Caviasca In an exclusive interview last week with EE Times, Ken Caviasca, Intel’s vice president and general manager, described his company’s arsenal of technologies -- ranging from FPGAs to computer vision software, hardware accelerations and artificial intelligence. “We have a lot more [room] to scale our business in the automotive market” than Qualcomm/NXP would, he said. Caviasca is responsible for platform engineering and development at Intel’s Internet of Things Group. Intel’s automotive goal, described by Kathy Winter, Intel vice president and general manager of Automated Driving Solutions, is to lead in all three facets of the highly automated vehicle platform: In-vehicle computing, connectivity and data center. Intel, in short, is setting its sights high on an “end-to-end” play in the auto industry. While Qualcomm’s strategy is to buy its way into the market in one fell scoop by acquiring NXP which is an undisputed, world’s largest automotive chip supplier, Intel’s path is more incremental. The CPU giant has been already acquiring smaller companies whose technologies are diverse but deemed essential to the future of connected and highly automated vehicles. Additionally, Intel hopes to gain credibility by hiring Winter. Prior to joining Intel two months ago in August, Winter served as vice president, software & services, automated driving at Delphi Electronics & Safety. Kathy Winter Winter gained notoriety as an automotive executive by engineering the Delphi cross-country autonomous drive in an Audi Q5 outfitted with Delphi self-driving technology in 2015. That trip was billed as the first and longest drive by an autonomous vehicle in the United States, covering 3,400 miles, 99% of the time in self-driving mode. Pointing out Winter’s first-hand experience with ADAS and autonomous driving, Intel’s Caviasca said, “Kathy can help us go faster.” Intel isn’t a total novice in automotive. As is often the case with Intel’s non-core businesses, Intel did more than flirt with car OEMs and Tier Ones in the mid-1980’s. Caviasca told EE Times, “Back in 1984, we developed anti-skid control.” Those were the days when Intel’s MCU business was strong. In the 1980’s, Intel and Ford had a joint venture building ECUs. Intel’s 8051 and its derivatives were reportedly used in almost all Ford automobiles built from 1983 through the end of the 20th century. In 2005, Intel, however, announced it was discontinuing production of all automotive versions of its microcontrollers. Intel came back into the automotive market again in 2008, Caviasca explained. This time, the company initially aimed at in-vehicle infotainment systems. Let’s face it. Intel is no Freescale. Whether Intel will stick with the automotive industry through good times and bad is not known. But for now, Intel’s outsized ambition and appetite for the automotive market is credible and formidable.

For comparison, look at the amount of effort that goes into doing all this for aircraft control systems and autopilots (at a cost of millions of dollars per unit), which still go wrong occasionally -- but here there is at least one (often two) sober awake pilots not watching a film, having sex or whatever else people in autonomous cars are likely to get up to. And a lot of the systems are partitioned off to that one having a problem doesn't affect the others, so even if the cockbit screens go blank the engines carry on working. Putting all your eggs into one basket increases the chances of all of them getting smashed when the hugely complex difficult-to-verify central control system goes wrong. In comparison, having a large number of much simpler single-purpose easier-to-verify control entities (engine, brakes, instruments, entertainment) makes it less likely that everything will die at once -- including the passengers...

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 1, 2016 at 7:25AM Over the past three years or so, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been undergoing a significant transformation as the world around it has changed. The rise of smartphones and tablets, particularly as they have become powerful enough to handle tasks that were once only possible on personal computers, has negatively affected demand for notebook and desktop computers -- Intel's largest revenue source. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich holding an Intel Stratix 10 FPGA. Image source: Intel.  Let's look at three ways Intel has changed in that time, as the company's ongoing transformation should be of utmost interest to current and potential Intel investors.  Losses from mobile devices have fallen dramatically In 2013, Intel's Mobile and Communication Group (MCG), which builds chips aimed at devices such as smartphones and tablets, posted a $3.148 billion loss. Those losses expanded to around $4.2 billion during 2014 as the company began providing "contra-revenue" payments to its tablet processor customers for each Intel-powered tablet sold. Those payments, per Intel, were meant to offset the increased system-level costs associated with using Intel's Bay Trail chips relative to competing tablet platforms. Intel's Atom processors had a tough time competing with chips from rival chipmakers in the smartphone and tablet market. Image source: Intel.  Since then, Intel has been working to bring those losses down through several actions, including a reduction in contra-revenue, as its tablet processor shipments declined and the company improved the cost structures of its tablet platforms, and a significant reduction in operating expenses -- in other words, cutting or ending investments in future mobile products. The net result is that those losses dropped by "almost a billion" in 2015 -- note that Intel stopped breaking out MCG results in its earnings releases in early 2015 -- and the company said that it expects to improve that figure by $800 million, though CEO Brian Krzanich said a couple of quarters ago that the company will "shoot to do better than that." If we assume the mobile losses came down by $950 million in 2015, and by another $800 million in 2016, then the company should close out the year with those losses down to under $2.5 billion for the year. Since Intel's MCG and PC Client Group businesses have been merged into the new Client Computing Group, or CCG, any further improvement in the mobile-related losses will show up as an improvement in the operating profit of CCG -- Intel's largest business unit. Intel has embraced contract chip manufacturing work Before 2013, under previous CEO Paul Otellini, the company wasn't too keen on becoming a "general-purpose foundry" -- in other words, it didn't want to do contract chip manufacturing work for just any company. Intel's Fab 32 chip manufacturing facility. Image source: Intel.  In an interview conducted by Semiconductor Engineering in late 2012, Intel senior fellow Mark Bohr had the following to say about the company's strategy vis-a-vis contract chip manufacturing: "It's not Intel's goal to be a general-purpose foundry, but we will be partnering where it makes strategic sense." Then, when Krzanich took the reins as CEO, the company's tune changed dramatically, with stated plans in a late 2013 investor meeting for an "open foundry to any company able to utilize [Intel's] leading-edge silicon." Since then, Intel has forged partnerships with ARM Holdings, other semiconductor intellectual-property vendors, and electronic design automation tool vendors to enable a broader range of customers to build chips on its manufacturing technologies. Intel's foundry business doesn't generate much in the way of revenue today, but the company seems very intent on opening this up as a potential source of significant revenue. It takes a long time from design wins to revenue, but in three years we'll have a better idea of how much progress Intel is making here. Diversification away from the personal-computer market Although Intel has historically generated a very large portion of its revenue from sales of chips into personal computers, and thus has real incentive to make sure it can keep its revenues and profits here as high as possible, the reality is that the company can't count on this segment for sustainable, long-term revenue growth. To that end, the company has worked to grow its other business segments, such as the data center, the Internet of Things, programmable logic devices, and flash memory in an attempt to reduce its reliance on the personal-computer market. Intel's latest personal computer processor -- Kaby Lake. Image source: Intel.  In 2013, Intel's CCG represented 66% of the company's total revenue, per the company's 2015 annual report; that figure came down to 58% in 2015. In 2016, that figure is likely to come down further, as CCG is expected to decline while many of its other segments -- especially its large data-center group, accounting for about 29% of revenue in 2015 -- grow year over year. Although Intel isn't immune to declines in the personal-computer market, considering that more than half of the company's revenue still comes from it, its other businesses are in increasingly better shape to offset modest declines there going forward.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 1, 2016 at 8:16AM In a prior column, I went over why investors in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shouldn't freak out over the company's increased investments in its lucrative and fast-growing data-center group, or DCG. Intel's data-center chief, Diane Bryant. Image source: Intel.  Here, I'd like to go over three areas in which Intel is likely beefing up its investments within DCG. Complementary technologies The bulk of Intel's DCG revenue comes from the sale of processors and related chipsets, but the company has been talking up the growing importance of complementary non-processor components to its businesses. Intel's non-processor technologies are a small but rapidly growing part of its data-center biz. Image source: Intel.  The examples of such technologies that the company routinely cites in investor presentations are 3D XPoint memory modules, silicon photonics, and its proprietary Omni-Path fabric for high-performance computing applications. It seems likely that the company is spending more money to put additional development resources on these projects, particularly as the company is banking on these technologies to help boost the long-term growth rate of DCG. More custom processor projects Analyst Romit Shah recently postulated that part of the spending increases on Intel's part could be a "defense move" on Intel's part that could potentially include "more custom projects" in a bid to "stem market share loss." Indeed, back in 2014, Intel's data-center general manager, Diane Bryant, indicated that the company integrates custom features into its server processors for specific customers and is even working with potential customers on "fully custom" processors. Image source: Intel. Considering this, I wouldn't be surprised if the company were investing more in DCG to be able to support a greater number of semi-custom and fully custom processor projects for major high-volume customers, with, perhaps, the bar for what constitutes a "worthwhile" project coming down a bit. Accelerator technologies Intel has always been good at building very high-performance, power-efficient processors. Going forward, being able to build best-in-class processors will certainly continue to be a key point of differentiation and a large part of Intel's value proposition in the data center. Intel has also been more aggressive in pursuing technologies that can be used to dramatically speed up certain specialized workloads, broadly referred to as accelerators. Intel's Xeon Phi represents a key type of accelerator technology. Image source: Intel.  Accelerators come in many forms, from dedicated hardware integrated into the same chip as the main processor to co-processors that work alongside the main processors. Unsurprisingly, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich thinks that accelerator technologies can help to boost the growth of DCG. "So we look at those accelerators as enhancing this growth," Krzanich said on the company's most recent earnings call. He further went on to claim that Intel has the "widest" portfolio of accelerator technologies, "from FPGAs through the Xeon Phi and then into [application-specific integrated circuit] driven devices." It stands to reason, then, that to support this set of technologies and to develop even more of them down the line, the company is going to need to invest more in terms of money and human resources to develop them. It wouldn't surprise me one bit to learn that a doubling down on these accelerators was part of the spending increases in DCG. Investing now is the right thing to do The last thing Intel needs is to be caught flat-footed in its data-center business, so investing today to ensure that it's in a strong competitive position tomorrow is conceptually the right thing to do. Increased investments do hurt near-term profitability, which stockholders, particularly in businesses as large and mature as Intel, don't like. However, it's better to pay the price now and reap the rewards later than to maximize profitability now only to have things fall off a cliff down the line. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

On the contrary, Apple's new MacBook Pro models have been blasted from all angles, with the overarching theme being that Apple has completely abandoned its core base of creative professionals. More specifically, Apple's new laptops have been criticized for being overpriced and for limiting the amount of RAM to 16GB. DON'T MISS: This is the most stunning iPhone 8 mockup yet, and it might be accurate If you count yourself among one of the many folks who find Apple's new Pro notebooks underwhelming, there's good news lurking on the horizon. According to a new research note from reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is already planning a MacBook Pro refresh during the second half of 2017 that will include a price reduction and support for 32GB of RAM. Originally published by MacRumors, Kuo's note indicates that Apple's revamped MacBook Pros will employ Intel's Cannonlake processors, assuming of course that they are ready to ship in time. ... the new MacBook to be launched in 2H17 may support 32GB DRAM, eventually attracting more core users; this depends on whether or not Intel ships Cannonlake CPU on time in 2017, which features 15-25% less power consumption of LPDDR 4, versus the existing LPDDR 3. If Cannonlake doesn’t enter mass production as expected, the new models launched in 2H17 will adopt Coffee Lake, which continues to adopt LPDDR 3, and maximum DRAM support will also remain unchanged at 16GB. Indeed, the current MacBook Pros limit of 16GB of RAM has been a sticking point for many pro-oriented users who have been patiently awaiting new Pro laptops from Apple for some time. Addressing these RAM concerns, Apple executive Phil Schiller said that support for 32GB of RAM would "require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook." Delving further into the matter, the following comment from user Exploding_m1 on Reddit is worth highlighting. The true reason behind the lack of 32 GB or DDR4 is Intel. Skylake does not support LPDDR4 (LP for low power) RAM. Kabylake is set to include support, but only for the U category of chips. So no LPDDR4 support for mobile until 2018 I think. One example is the Dell XPS 13. On the Dell XPS 13 version, you cannot go for 32 GB of RAM. Meanwhile, the 15 inches does give you that option, but you have to sacrifice battery life for it. Another example is the surface book, they can't include 32gb. Only goes up to 16gb. These computers use LPDDR3 which is supported. Many mite make the argument that apple could have used the LPDDR3 version, but how would they look if they did that for the 15 inch MBP only? Regardless, it should at the very least be encouraging to see that Apple doesn't have plans to let the MacBook Pro stagnate any longer given that welcome updates to pricing and RAM support are reportedly on the horizon.

November 1 AAPL: 111.49 -2.05 Reports seemingly clarify Phil Schiller’s explanation of why there’s no 32GB MacBook Pro Ben Lovejoy - 2 weeks ago @benlovejoy MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Some of Apple’s decisions regarding the new MacBook Pro models are causing as much heated debate on the Internet as its removal of the headphone socket from the iPhone 7. In particular, the decision to limit the maximum RAM to 16GB rather than 32GB has been the subject of huge controversy. Phil Schiller briefly commented on this, stating that 32GB ‘wouldn’t be power-efficient enough for a notebook’ but without going into more detail. Others have now chimed in with what appears to be a fuller explanation … A Reddit poster suggested this was an Intel limitation, because Skylake currently doesn’t support the low-power RAM needed to offer 32GB. The true reason behind the lack of 32gb or DDR4 is Intel. Skylake does not support LPDDR4 (LP for low power) ram. Kabylake is set to include support, but only for the U category of chips. So no LPDDR4 support for mobile until 2018 I think. While neither Apple nor Intel has yet responded to my request for confirmation, the same explanation has been offered from multiple other sources – among them John Gruber, who said that he believes it to be true ‘from what Apple told me last week’ – as well as effectively confirmed by a KGI report referenced below. The only way to offer a 32GB RAM option would be to use desktop RAM, which is a lot more power-hungry – and would involve a big hit on battery life. There are laptops that offer 32GB by using desktop RAM, but this is achieved either by a thicker form factor to support the additional battery volume needed or – in the case of lightweight notebooks like Dell’s XPS 15 – by accepting the significantly-reduced battery life. Of course, confirmation of this wouldn’t end the controversy. Some argue that the type of power users who need 32GB RAM – such as those running multiple virtual machines – mostly use their Macs on mains power, so reduced battery life would be an acceptable trade-off. Others that a thicker machine would be a price worth paying for more RAM. However, the backlash against Apple announcing that the new MacBook Pro had a battery-life reduced from 10 hours to 5-6 would be far greater than that against the RAM limitation. Only a tiny minority need 32GB RAM today against the far greater numbers who appreciate the battery-life (many pro users commenting yesterday that they don’t always have access to mains power in the field). And while I personally would side with those willing to have greater thickness, Apple is pretty firmly committed to its never-ending quest for thinness. Of potentially greater concern is future-proofing. While 16GB is fine for most users today, we don’t know what app requirements might be 2-3 years from now in a machine many people keep for 4-5 years. KGI does hold out some hope, with a report that there’s likely to be a 32GB option in the second half of next year, when Intel releases its Canonlake processors. Again, though, this is dependent on Intel meeting its scheduled timeframes, which is not always a safe bet. As ever, let us know your thoughts and plans in the comments.

However, they have essentially leaked details of their own unannounced CPUs through a product change notification (PCN) document, which was intended for manufacturing partners but published publicly. In the PCN document, Intel lists ten desktop-class Kaby Lake Core processors and one Xeon product, along with their base clock speeds and product codes. As expected, Intel is using a similar naming scheme to Skylake: K-designators for unlocked 95W parts, T-designators for low-power 35W parts, and no suffix for regular 65W parts. We can also expect to see a similar core configuration here, with Core i7 products receiving four cores and eight threads, while Core i5 CPUs get four cores and four threads. Cheaper Core i3 parts will be dual-core with four threads. The main change moving from Skylake to Kaby Lake appears to be a slight increase in base clock speeds, somewhere in the 100 to 300 MHz range depending on model. Intel's refined 14nm+ manufacturing process allows these clock speed gains at no cost to power consumption, and users can also look forward to minor Speed Shift improvements as well. A separate document has revealed Intel's upcoming chipset names, and again they aren't a massive surprise. At the top end we're looking at the Z270 chipset, while we can also expect H270, B250, Q270 and Q250. Additionally, Intel revealed the C422 and X299 chipsets, which could be next-generation products for server and enthusiast processors respectively.

On October 27, 2016, Apple introduced a new MacBook Pro line. Credit: Apple Most Popular Apple announced the 2016 upgrade to its MacBook Pro laptops. They are really expensive. They feature last year's Intel processors. They require adaptors (dongles) for every accessory you already own such as your hard drive, jump drive, HDMI, SD card reader and power cable (goodbye MagSafe). And, incredible as it might sound, they feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. So much for Apple's "time to ditch the 100-year-old headphone jack" story from its iPhone 7 launch. (See: Apple iPhone 7: Are You F#$king Kidding Me? for details) All of which elicits my somewhat incredulous response, Apple MacBook Pro 2016: WTF? Should You Buy One? Before I get into what's awesome and what's puzzling about the new MacBook Pros, there is one model that is probably worth all of the WTF-ness, the purchasing of new dongles, the revision of workflows, the transition from Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3, and all the pain and expense that will come with it: the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro 15-inch (available in Space Gray or Silver), which includes four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, the new Touch Bar, Force Touch trackpad, and Touch ID, configured as follows: · 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz · 16GB 2133MHz memory · 2TB PCIe-based SSD · Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB memory This configuration (only available on apple.com) is listed at $4,299.00. If you want Apple Care (a warranty extension that makes sense only if you read the fine print), it will cost you an additional $349.00. Now let's add a few dongles so you can use your existing Thunderbolt 2 external drives, video encoders, HDMI monitors and peripherals, and all the USB devices you have in your world. You'll probably want to purchase the following: Three (3) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapters -- Price: $49.00 each (For your existing Thunderbolt monitors, drives, audio/video interfaces, etc.) One (1) USB-C to Lightning Cable (1 m) -- Price: $25.00 (To connect your iPhone) One (1) USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter -- Price: $34.95 (To plug your computer into the internet if you don't have awesome WiFi available) Three (3) USB-C to USB Adapters -- Price: $19.00 (To plug in printers, scanners, jump drives, hard drives, DVD/CD drives, etc.) One (1) USB-C to VGA Adapter -- Price: $24.95 (To be equipped to present in any low-tech meeting room in the world) One (1) USB-C to HDMI Adapter -- Price: $19.95 (To plug into an HD or 4K monitor or HDMI peripheral) All in, including approximate sales tax (8.875% in NY), the total price is $5,390.57. Is it worth it? Is any laptop worth the better part of $5,400? Only if you want (or need) the greatest MacBook Pro ever built. It is crazy expensive, but with a 2TB PCIe-based SSD, 16GB memory and this graphics card … it will empower you in ways no MacBook Pro has empowered you before. It is simply awesome! What About All the Other Models? This is where WTF becomes a real question. If you're not going for the very top of the line, you are spending a lot of money for a few relatively minor new features, last year's processor and some exceptional inconveniences. The low-end, lower-priced 13″ models have only two USB-C ports and one 3.5mm headphone jack. You'll use one for power, and that leaves you one port to handle all of your accessories. While the highest-priced 13″ with the Touch Bar does have four USB-C ports, it is only available with 1TB of SSD storage, which makes it almost identical to the 1TB all-singing, all-dancing 13″ MacBook Pro from 2014/2015 which has a Retina display, an HDMI port, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, an SD card reader, a MagSafe power port, two USB ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack. I cannot see a reason to upgrade from a top-of-the-line 13″ 2014/2015 MacBook Pro to the 2016 model. The Touch Bar just won't add enough capability or wow factor to justify the investment. Is There Anything to Like About the Upgraded MacBook Pros? There is plenty to like about the new MacBooks (except the 13″ entry-level model, which at $1,499 is really not an upgrade; it's just someone's "crazy expensive" first MacBook Pro). The Touch Bar is a super-neat trick and will be very useful. The Touch ID will be more helpful for Apple Pay than it will be for consumers, but it has a bit of a hidden benefit. You can switch profiles by putting your finger on the Touch ID. This is wonderful news if you are significantly inconvenienced by the current process (Shift-Command-Q and enter your password). I also think people will find behavior-changing uses for the Force Touch trackpad, assuming it has near-perfect palm-rejection capabilities. You will always be resting your palms on the 46 percent bigger touchpad. They Are Works of Art Yes, I am asking a very serious WTF about some of the choices Apple made in this "upgrade." I was incensed by Apple's choice to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, and I'm doubly incensed by its decision to force the universe to immediately adopt the USB-C port as the "one and only true peripheral and power port." But that said, these are the best MacBook Pros Apple has ever made. They look amazing! Actually, they are amazing!

Moore Posted 28 Oct 2016 | 15:00 GMT Advertisement Editor's Pick Multicore CPU: Processor Proliferation Photo: Intel It’s Getting Crowded:  This Intel Haswell-EX Xeon E7 V3 processor has 18 cores trying to work together without messing up one another’s calculations. A bit of additional hardware could speed up communication among the cores. Researchers at North Carolina State University and at Intel have come up with a solution to one of the modern microprocessor’s most persistent problems: communication among the processor’s many cores. Their answer is a dedicated set of logic circuits they call the Queue Management Device, or QMD. In simulations, integrating the QMD with the processor’s on-chip network at a minimum doubled core-to-core communication speed and, in some cases, boosted it much further. Even better, as the number of cores was increased, the speedup became more pronounced. In the last decade, microprocessor designers started putting multiple copies of processor cores on a single die as a way to continue the rate of performance improvement computer makers had enjoyed without causing chip-killing hot spots to form on the CPU. But that solution comes with complications. For one, it means that software programs have to be written so that work is divided among processor cores. The result: Sometimes different cores need to work on the same data or must coordinate the passing of data from one core to another.  “We have to improve performance by improving energy efficiency. The only way to do that is to move some software to hardware”—Yan Solihin, North Carolina State University  To prevent the cores from wantonly overwriting one another’s information, processing data out of order, or committing other errors, multicore processors use lock-protected software queues. These are data structures that coordinate the movement of and access to information according to software-defined rules. But all that extra software comes with significant overhead, which only gets worse as the number of cores increases. “Communications between cores is becoming a bottleneck,” says Yan Solihin, a professor of electrical and computer engineering who led the work at NC State, in Raleigh. The solution—born of a discussion with Intel researchers and executed by Solihin’s student, Yipeng Wang, at Intel and at NC State—was to turn the software queue into hardware. This effectively turned three multistep ­software-queue operations into three simple instructions: Add data to the queue, take data from the queue, and put data close to where it’s going to be needed next. Compared with just using the software solution, the QMD sped up a sample task such as packet ­processing—like network nodes do on the Internet—by a greater and greater amount the more cores were involved. For 16 cores, QMD worked 20 times as fast as the software could. Once they achieved this result, the researchers realized that the QMD might be able to do a few other tricks—such as turning more software into hardware. They added more logic to the QMD and found it could speed up several other core-communications-dependent functions, including MapReduce, a technology Google pioneered for distributing work to different cores and collecting the results. Srini Devadas, an expert in cache control systems at MIT, says the QMD addresses “a very important problem.” Devadas’s own solution for the use of caches by multiple cores—or even multiple processors—is more radical than the QMD. Called Tardis [PDF], it’s a complete rewrite of the cache management rules, and so it is a solution aimed at processors and systems of processors further in the future. But QMD, Devadas says, has nearer-term potential. “It’s the kind of work that would motivate Intel—putting in a small piece of hardware for a significant improvement.” The Intel researchers involved couldn’t comment on whether QMD would find its way into future processors. However, they are actively researching its potential. (Wang is now a research scientist at Intel.) The researchers hope that QMD, among other extensions of the concept, can simplify communication among the cores and the CPU’s input/output system. Solihin, meanwhile, is inventing other types of hardware accelerators. “We have to improve performance by improving energy efficiency. The only way to do that is to move some software to hardware. The challenge is to figure out which software is used frequently enough that we could justify implementing it in hardware,” he says. “There is a sweet spot.” Advertisement Recommended For You The Role of RTK GPS in Survey Result Accuracy Video Friday: Robot Dance Contest, 500 Drones Flying, and Steady Humanoid Doctors Still Struggle to Make the Most of Computer-Aided Diagnosis Brain and Spine Implants Let a Paralyzed Monkey Walk Again Wanted: Smart Public Policy for Internet of Things Security Sensor Monitors Kids' Screen Time Learn More MapReduce core-to-core communications multicore processors on-chip networks parallel computing Comments Comment Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> Comments powered by Disqus Topics Aerospace At Work Biomedical Computing Energy Gadgets Geek Life Green Tech Robotics Semiconductors Telecom Transportation Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ RSS IEEE Spectrum Contact Us About Newsletters Mobile Site Reprints & Permissions IEEE Partners Advertising & Media Center IEEE Job Site Buyer’s Guide The Magazine Subscribe Now Digital Download © Copyright 2016 IEEE Spectrum Terms & Conditions | Privacy & Opting Out of Cookies | Accessibility | Nondiscrimination Policy Join IEEE About IEEE Conferences & Events Education & Careers Membership & Services Publications and Standards Societies & Communities © Copyright 2016 IEEE — All rights reserved.

The company was the target of scrutiny last month when customers accused it of conspiring with Microsoft by blocking the installation of non-Windows platforms at the firmware level. The accusations started on a Reddit thread, with customers claiming that Lenovo teamed up with Microsoft to lock down Yoga 900 laptops by keeping the installed solid state drives in RAID mode via the BIOS. The problem is that the RAID mode relies on a proprietary SSD driver from Intel, which is compatible with Windows 10. That means if Linux is somehow installed on the device, the operating system can’t see the SSD because there is no available driver. AHCI, which is supported by Linux, is disabled in the firmware and can’t be changed. Related: Hardware specs for Lenovo’s upcoming Miix 720 show seventh-gen Intel processors AHCI is a standard created by Intel, and is short for Advance Host Controller Interface. It is hardware that enables software to communicate with devices that connect to the SATA interface, such as a hard drive or SSD. RAID, on the other hand, stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. It is another type of disk management for configuring one or more drives. These drives can be combined as one single volume (C:), used as two separate storage volumes (C: and D:), or set up in a primary/mirrored configuration (C: only). Typically, when OEMs like Lenovo and HP provide desktop and laptop devices with Windows already installed, they come with what is called “bloatware” or “crapware,” which is unnecessary software that takes up precious memory and hard drive space, bogging down the PC. Windows 10 Signature Edition is a clean install of Microsoft’s platform without any additional software from the OEM. Unfortunately, that doesn’t stop retailers like Best But from including their own bloatware. Lenovo responded to accusations of conspiring with Microsoft on a Lenovo Yoga 900 product review listed on Best Buy. The review was posted on September 20, and was followed by Lenovo’s response on September 21. “To improve system performance, Lenovo is leading an industry trend of adopting RAID on the SSDs in certain product configurations. Lenovo does not intentionally block customers using other operating systems on its devices and is fully committed to providing Linux certifications and installation guidance on a wide range of products,” said a Lenovo Product Expert. “Unsupported models will rely on Linux operating system vendors releasing new kernel and drivers to support features such as RAID on SSD.” A Lenovo Product Expert made a statement on another product review posted on Best Buy accusing Lenovo of  locking the BIOS to prevent Linux installs. According to this company representative, the system was locked due to Lenovo’s agreement with Microsoft to provide Windows 10 Signature Edition on the Yoga 900 devices. Naturally, that statement added fuel to the fire. However, Lenovo recently denied that it intentionally blocked the installation of non-Microsoft platforms, and asserted that it could not confirm its relationship with the Product Experts who were providing feedback on Best Buy device reviews. The company followed its denial with a new BIOS to install on the Yoga 900-13ISK2 model that enables customers to use Linux on that specific device. The release notes confirm that the new BIOS creates an AHCI SATA Controller Mode selection so that users can switch to AHCI and install Linux. The new BIOS is not meant for customers who plan on using the Windows 10 Signature Edition installation that came with the device.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM professionals Research Legal updates Events International directory Media Country Correspondents India: Courts step up when it comes to famous marks < Back to issue By Mohandas Konnanath and Ranjan Narula RNA Intellectual Property Attorneys Recent case law from Indian courts confirms their pragmatic approach and bodes well for the protection of well-known marks in India, even when trademarks are not registered in the country Having trademarks recognised as well known or famous is a coveted accolade for brand owners. Additional protection for well-known marks originated in the Paris Convention and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), and is implemented through Article 6bis of the former and Article 16 of the latter. The underlying idea is to grant broader protection to famous marks against indiscriminate copying by third parties – not only for the same goods, but even for goods and services in completely different classes. Some countries have set out specific criteria in their trademark laws to determine whether a mark qualifies as well known, generally reproducing the criteria set out in TRIPs. Well-known marks in India In 2003, when the new Trademarks Act came into effect in India, it specifically included a definition of a ‘well-known mark’ and established elaborate protection criteria, which mostly conformed to the stipulations set out in TRIPs. In its present form, the law expressly extends statutory protection to well-known marks, even in relation to dissimilar goods. In addition, since 2003 the Trademark Registry has compiled a list of over 60 marks – including PHILIPS, INTEL, PEPSI, HONDA, OMEGA, MARS, HORLICKS, TATA, WOOLWORTH, TOSHIBA, SONY and CARREFOUR – on the basis of court decisions holding them to be well known. The registry has formed a committee which reviews and updates the list periodically. Thus, rights holders can bring any court decisions which recognise their marks as well known to the committee’s attention and present a case for inclusion on the list. To formalise the process of registering a mark as well known, a new provision – in the form of an amendment to the Trademark Rules 2015 – has been mooted. Further to the proposed amendment to Rule 127(2), the registrar would be empowered to stipulate criteria for determining whether a mark is well known. Such a request would be accompanied by a statement, along with all evidence and documents relied upon by the applicant to support its claim. With regard to these proposed amendments, stakeholders have raised the following concerns: The basis for stipulating the criteria for determining whether a mark is well known is still unclear. It is not apparent whether ‘determination’ by the registrar is necessary if the mark has already been recognised as well known by a court, IP appellate board or registrar in a contentious proceeding. Given that the Trademarks Registry already publishes a list of well-known marks, it is unclear whether a new list would be created or the existing list updated. There is controversy over the proposed fees for filing a request to determine whether a trademark is well known – Rs10,000 for e-filing (approximately $1,490) and Rs11,000 for physical filing (approximately $1,640) – which critics have denounced as unreasonable and unjustified. To safeguard the rights of an aggrieved person, a procedure for publishing an opposition or intervention against determination of a trademark as well known should also be provided. No timeframe has been proposed for the registrar to deal with such requests. Judicial rulings Recent judicial pronouncements show that the Indian courts are pragmatic when it comes to giving due credence to the international character of trademarks and granting recognition of their well-known status. In addition, decisions tend to take account of how the Internet and satellite television broadcasts have made the world a much smaller place. Thus, the Indian public may be aware of well-known marks even where the goods or services in question are unavailable locally. Liberal foreign exchange laws mean that Indian consumers can purchase goods online even if they are unavailable in India. In addition, Indian traders and consumers often travel overseas for business and leisure. They are exposed to products bearing well-known brands and often bring them home as gifts for families and friends. In Choice Hotels International Inc v M Sanjay Kumar the Delhi High Court considered the well-known nature of the mark COMFORT INN in relation to hotels and the goodwill and reputation associated with it – accordingly, it restrained the defendants from using the mark HOTEL RAJ COMFORT INN in relation to an identical business. The court also restrained the use of the website www.hotelrajcomfortinn.com, which contained the plaintiff’s well-known mark COMFORT INN, in order to prevent confusion and deception in the market. In Industria De Diseno Textile SA v Oriental Cuisines Pvt Ltd the court dealt with use of the mark ZARA, primarily known in respect of fashion and related lifestyle products, with the mark adopted by the plaintiff in 1975. The plaintiff argued that ZARA-branded products were sold extensively in several countries around the world and that the mark had achieved a significant degree of fame. The defendant was found to be using the mark ZARA TAPAS BAR and ZARA RESTAURANT and BAR in relation to dining. The court gave short shrift to the defendant’s contention that several entities were already using the mark ZARA and that it had a dictionary meaning. Instead, it held that the mark was well known since as far back as 2003, when the defendant adopted it. Further, the court found that the plaintiff was entitled to protect its mark even in relation to dissimilar goods and services. In Intel Corporation v Gautam Gupta, the Delhi High Court considered the well-known nature of the INTEL mark, which features in the list of well-known marks maintained by the Trademark Registry. The defendants in this case were engaged in an entirely different line of business – real estate and property development. The court took account of the fact that the INTEL mark was well know and was thus entitled to broader and wider protection, and permanently restrained the defendants from using it as part of their trade name, Intel Land Developers Pvt Ltd. Well known but unregistered The courts have also shown willing when it comes to upholding the common law rights of brand owners where a mark is unregistered in India, as is evident from the recent judgment of the Delhi High Court in Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha v Deepak Mangal. Toyota had filed the case aggrieved by the defendant’s use of its PRIUS mark for automobile parts. Toyota argued that it was the prior adopter and user of the mark PRIUS, which it had been using in relation to its first hybrid car. Toyota had not registered the mark in India, whereas the defendant had registered the mark PRIUS. Toyota filed extensive evidence of its use of the PRIUS mark worldwide and proved its prior adoption. The court noted the fame of the mark and restrained the defendant from using it. A further instance of the court taking into account advancements in science and technology when considering trans-border reputation is the decision in Laverana GMBH & Co KG, Germany v Mac’s Personal Care Pvt Ltd. The plaintiff had been using the LAVERA mark in relation to cosmetics and body-care products, and filed an action for passing off against the defendants, which were found to have been using an identical mark for cosmetics. Although the plaintiff’s mark was not registered in India, the court considered its prior adoption, use, arbitrary nature and registration in other countries and restrained the defendants from using the same. The defendants’ appeal was also dismissed by the division bench, which raised the following points to consider when judging a mark’s trans-border reputation: the registration of a trademark in another jurisdiction – details or declarations of which are usually open to inspection; that registration will have been granted only because the authority was convinced of the mark’s distinctiveness and registrability; that registrations in multiple jurisdictions create a stronger presumption in favour of the subject mark; and that account should be taken of advertising in well-known magazines – even in only a few instances – as well as volume of sales. Digital economy fuels brand recognition Social media has added a new dimension to how people perceive brands. These days, consumers express opinions about the brands with which they engage positively, by either leaving a review or sharing ‘likes’. Most brands these days have a YouTube channel or Facebook page through which to communicate with consumers. Thus, any brand that aspires to be well known is expected to have a brand strategy for social media – not only to manage consumer expectations, but also to monitor any brand squatting. It will be interesting to see how jurisprudence develops to take account of this new world. Will courts start to take account of factors such as the number of Twitter followers to determine a brand’s notoriety? To sum up, growing consumerism and a large youth population are driving brand culture in India. It may thus be an attractive proposition for smaller local businesses to copy a well-known brand to gain instant recognition and boost sales. Provisions on well-known marks aim to protect not only the interests of owners of well-known marks, but also members of the general public, who are likely to assume a trade connection, sponsorship or approval of goods, and in many cases – due to the presence of similar colour schemes – cannot distinguish unauthorised use. The pragmatic outlook of the courts and the Trademark Registry bodes well for the protection of well-known brands.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM professionals Research Legal updates Events International directory Media Country Correspondents European Union: Protecting well-known marks under international treaties < Back to issue By Frédérique Bodson Locke Lord LLP The lack of a common definition of ‘well-known mark’ under international treaties has led to variations in interpretation and thus protection. However, EU legislation and case law continue to evolve in this area Trademark protection in the European Union has developed mainly based on international treaties such as the Paris Convention, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) and the Madrid Agreement. Protection granted to famous marks originates from Article 6bis of the Paris Convention and Article 16 of TRIPs, which give additional cover to well-known marks, even where they have not been registered. However, there is still no common definition of a ‘well-known’ mark, leading to variations in interpretation and thus protection from country to country. In the European Union, well-known marks enjoy a special and broader degree of protection, as set out in Article 5(3) of the EU Trademark Directive (2015/2436 – formerly Article 5(2) of Directive 89/104/EEC) and Article 9(1)(c) of the EU Community Trademark Regulation (207/2009, as amended by Regulation 2015/2424). The owner of a well-known trademark is entitled to prevent third parties from using any sign that is identical or similar to its mark, irrespective of whether it is in relation to goods or services which are identical or similar to, or even completely dissimilar to, those for which the well-known mark is registered, where such use, without due cause, would take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the earlier mark’s distinctive character. These provisions were created to protect the functions of a trademark other than those of indicating a trade origin (ie, messages conveyed as to the qualities or particular characteristics of goods or services, as well as images or feelings such as luxury, lifestyle, exclusivity or adventure). Such messages give the mark an inherent economic value independent of and separate from the goods or services for which it is registered, which is nearly always the result of considerable effort and investment on the part of the rights holder (Sigla/OHIM – Elleni Holding, T-215/03, March 22 2007). Intel and L’Oréal In Intel Corporation v CPM United Kingdom Ltd (C-252/07, November 27 2008) and L’Oréal v Bellure (C-487/07, June 18 2009), the European Court of Justice (ECJ) attempted to define the scope of protection granted to well-known trademarks. In Intel, the ECJ held that a well-known mark will be diluted if a later mark is used to create an immediate association with the goods and services for which it is registered. The court found that the stronger the distinctive character of the earlier mark, the more likely it is that the relevant public will call it to mind – increasing the risk of dilution. Moreover, the ECJ held that the owner of a well-known mark must provide proof that use of the later mark “would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier trade mark”. Although the owner of the earlier mark need not demonstrate actual and present injury, it must prove that there is a serious risk that such an injury would occur in the future. This requirement introduces a high threshold for proof of dilution, which is arguably unfavourable to owners of well-known marks. In L’Oréal, the ECJ extended the protection granted to well-known marks, holding that it is not necessary to demonstrate a likelihood of confusion, a likelihood of detriment to the mark’s distinctive character or reputation, or even any general detriment in order to find unfair advantage. The ECJ held that the advantage is unfair where a third party “seeks by that use to ride on the coat-tails of the mark with a reputation” and does so to benefit from the mark’s power of attraction, reputation and prestige, with a view to exploiting the marketing efforts of the well-known mark’s owner, without any financial compensation and regardless of any detriment to the mark. In L’Oréal, the argument that a later mark might take unfair advantage of the earlier mark’s reputation or distinctive character became more advantageous over claims of dilution of the earlier mark, previously argued following Intel. Spa Monopole Post-Intel and L’ Oréal, the General Court considered what constitutes use of a mark when assessing its reputation in Spa Monopole, compagnie fermière de Spa SA/NV/OHIM-Orly International, Inc (Case T-131/12, May 5 2015). The court annulled the decision of the Board of Appeal of the EU Intellectual Property Office, which failed to find that the word mark SPA had a reputation in the European Union and ruled that there was no likelihood that SPARITUAL would take unfair advantage of the SPA mark under Article 8(5). Instead, the court held that the reputation of the figurative mark SPA with the Pierrot device could be extended to the word mark SPA, and that the board had wrongfully interpreted Il Ponte Finanziaria v OHIM (C-234/06 P, September 13 2007), which related to proof of use of marks of the same family and should therefore be distinguished from this case. In its decision, the General Court recognised that in order to demonstrate the particular distinctive character and reputation of a trademark, the owner may rely on evidence of its use in a different form, as part of another registered mark, provided that the relevant public continues to perceive the goods or services at issue as originating from the same undertaking. Iron & Smith More recently, the ECJ provided further guidance on the extent of protection granted to well-known trademarks in Iron & Smith v Unilever (C-125/14, September 3 2015). Unilever, owner of an EU trademark registration for IMPULSE, filed an opposition against a Hungarian trademark application for BE IMPULSIVE, which it considered too similar to its earlier mark, even though this was intended to cover dissimilar goods. In support of its opposition, Unilever referred to Hungarian legal provisions which provide extensive protection to famous marks and which go beyond the protection set out in Article 4(3) of the EU Trademarks Directive (2008/95/EC). The Hungarian application was subsequently rejected. The applicant appealed the decision and the Hungarian court asked the ECJ to clarify whether it was sufficient for Unilever to provide evidence of its reputation in some EU countries only (not including Hungary), or whether it had to provide specific evidence of its mark’s reputation in Hungary. The ECJ confirmed that an EU trademark has a reputation in the European Union if it has a reputation in a substantial part of the European Union. However, it also explained that such substantial part of the EU territory may coincide with the territory of a single member state, even though this might not be the state in which the application for the later national mark is filed. The ECJ thus provided a more flexible analysis of the requirements for a mark to be considered well known. It was not relevant that the IMPULSE mark had no reputation in Hungary, provided that it still fulfilled the requirement of reputation in the European Union. Nonetheless, where a national trademark application has been opposed and an earlier EU trademark has a reputation in a substantial part of the European Union, but not within that particular member state, the owner will have to show that a “commercially significant part of that public is familiar with that mark, makes a connection between it and the later national mark, and that there is, taking account of all the relevant factors in the case, either actual and present injury to its mark, for the purposes of that provision or, failing that, a serious risk that such injury may occur in the future”. By doing so, the ECJ has opted for a more practical approach, basing the assessment on the reality in the member state in which the owner of a well-known mark seeks protection. However, given that the ECJ did not define precisely what would be considered a ‘commercially significant part of the public’, this is likely to require further clarification in the future. EU trademark law reforms The protection granted to trademarks with a reputation has been extended by the new EU Trademark Regulation (2015/2424), which came into force on March 23 2016, and the new Trademark Directive, (2015/2436), and will have to be transposed by member states into national law by January 14 2019. Previously, owners of well-known trademarks could oppose or apply to invalidate a later mark covering “goods or services which are not similar to those for which the earlier trade mark was registered”. However, in Adidas-Salomon v Fitnessworld Trading (C-408/01, October 23 2003), the ECJ held that where goods or services are identical or similar, the protection granted to the well-known mark must be at least as extensive as where the goods or services are dissimilar. The new rules set out in the regulation confirm and codify Adidas by providing that oppositions or applications for invalidation can be filed “irrespective of whether the goods or services for which it is applied are identical with, similar to or not similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered”. Even if in practice this will not affect the owners of earlier marks directly, it does clarify the rule and helps to prevent potential questions of interpretation. Additionally, the directive states that registered trademarks with a reputation must enjoy the same protection under the legal systems of all member states, making the protection of marks with a reputation against dilution mandatory in all EU member states. Comment The EU legal provisions and case law surrounding well-known and famous marks have evolved steadily since the introduction of the EU Trademark Regulation in 2009, providing further clarification regarding the definition and extent of reputation, the economic link necessary to demonstrate unfair advantage or detriment to a mark and other requirements needed to benefit from the extended protection granted to marks with a reputation in the European Union. This protection is likely to become even stronger in future in light of the provisions imposed on member states by the new directive, which requires that such extended protection be granted at a national level to all registered trademarks with a reputation in the member state concerned.

Backyard·后花园 Home Categories Archives Tags Search Vanilla Installation of Asterisk 13 on Raspberry Pi 3 with G729 Codec Posted on 2016-11-01   |   In Asterisk , Raspberry Pi   |   I have an Asterisk server at home I built few years ago. It has an old Intel atom processor running on CentOS 6. It works quite well. I have couple SIP trunks to severial ITSP, including Google Voice. The Asterisk is version 11 LTS and it is a vinilla installation. The current Asterisk LTS version is 13 and it come with support of PJSIP. I never had a chance to learn PJSIP configuration. And I just happen to have a Raspberry Pi 3 on hand. So I think I should give a try. Raspbian Jessie First, I load Raspbian on a 8GB micro SD card and boot it up. I try to keep this system clean and tight so I used “Raspbian Jessie Lite” (Release date: 2016-09-23) without Desktop. After the RPi up and running, set the timezone. timedatectl set-timezone America/Vancouver And bring it up to date: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo reboot After reboot, start installation as root Install MySQL database I need to use MySQL database to save CDR. sudo apt-get install mysql-server -y sudo mysql_secure_installation The database creation and configration is just starand as on other platform. So I just skip them here. Install Asterisk Some dependencies need to be installed: apt-get install build-essential apt-get install openssl libxml2-dev libncurses5-dev uuid-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev pkg-config libjansson-dev subversion libiksemel-dev libspeex-dev libssl-dev libmyodbc unixodbc-dev libsrtp0-dev Installation of Astersik is quite simple: cd /usr/src wget http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/asterisk-13-current.tar.gz tar zvxf asterisk-13-current.tar.gz cd asterisk-13.12.1/ ./contrib/scripts/get_mp3_source.sh ./configure --with-pjproject-bundled make menuselect make -j 4 make install make config make samples G729 Codec In order to compile the g729 codec for a Raspberry Pi(ARM processor), the fastest way is to build it with the bcg729. The bcg729 is a software encoder for g729a and decoder library written from scratch. The resulting codec will be x2 slower than if it has been compiled with IPP, but it’s good enough for my home use.

Stating that Dell Technologies is the largest enterprise systems company, he said the goal is to be the most trusted, innovative provider of essential infrastructure for organisations to build their digital future, transform IT and protect their most important asset – information. In an interaction with BusinessLine on the sidelines of the conference, Michael Dell talked about what it means to be a tech powerhouse, new opportunities for growth and innovating for the future. Excerpts: Traditionally, customers do not like being locked to a single vendor. Dell customers that BusinessLine spoke to fear that the combined powerhouse of Dell and EMC would lead to a monopoly. What’s your take? If you think about the PC space, for example, where we have gained share for the last 15 quarters in a row, we are doing very well. But if you double-click a little more on the architecture, when a customer chooses Dell for commercial PCs – this concern doesn’t really come up with consumers – they are choosing Dell for the product, for the service, and support. At the same time, they are also choosing Intel, AMD and Microsoft typically; which actually have much higher shares than Dell. So, there are suppliers of ours that have an even higher share than us. If one were concerned about the issue you mentioned; you would be concerned about our suppliers like Intel and Microsoft maybe more than you would be concerned about us. That’s precisely the point. You may not yet be there, but you are you not getting there? I think one of the reasons we’ve succeeded is because we’ve created a tremendous amount of value for customers and democratised technology – made it more available, more affordable. There is no shortage of competitors in the businesses that we are in. I think if we continue to deliver great value to customers, continue to provide high levels of service, continue to innovate, and have great relationships with them, customers will reward us with more business. If we don’t, they will not do so and choose somebody else. And there are plenty of other choices really in every business we are in. What are the challenges of integrating the two distinct corporate cultures of Dell and that of EMC? It’s already done. We had a decade-and-a-half lead up to the combination of Dell and EMC. This goes back to 2001, when Dell and EMC announced an alliance in which Dell would sell EMC storage technology to its customers and form a Dell-EMC storage business. The Dell server technology was embedded into pretty much every EMC storage product line that existed, and EMC became our largest OEM customer in the world. And so our teams, starting in 2001, learned how to work together in terms of supply chain, R&D, sales and importantly culture; we became friends. I was present within EMC from the day of the announcement – at leadership meetings, learning about them as we came together. It is one family and the cultures are more similar than different. Customers have paid different margins for Dell and EMC products. With the new organisation structure in place, how do you plan to rationalise the margins customers will have to pay henceforth? In terms of margins, the averages tell the story. When you de-average, you get a very different story because Dell has some products with high margins, and some with low margins. There definitely are ways across the portfolio to manage that. We also tend to focus more on the margin dollars than the per cent, as a private company. Let me explain what I mean by margin dollars – if your goal is to have a business with the highest margin per cent, then sell mousepads. Why do we spend $4.5 billion every year in R&D? We think we will get back more than the $4.5 billion in margins, because of the innovation we are applying. And margins are a way of the market telling you that your innovation is valuable and appreciated. What more needs to be done to create opportunities for growth, and a stronger value proposition to customers? We have a lot of cross-selling to do with the combined entity. We have an organic innovation engine that is very significant, with the R&D teams across Pivotal, VMware, Dell EMC and the whole family. We also have alliances with hundreds of important companies from SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, to many others. We have our own Dell Technologies Capital Group investing in hundreds of new companies that are 24, 36, 48 months out into the future in terms of new things that are evolving. These may be in machine learning or security, cloud or big data. We will continue to make acquisitions. We think of ourselves as a company with big ears – we are always listening and trying to figure out what the unsolved problems of customers are.

The system is equipped with NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1070 graphics, a quad-core CPU from Intel, rich I/O capabilities and a hot-swappable battery. Despite its positioning, the VR GO can be used like a normal desktop computer, which differentiates it from early prototypes of wearable VR PCs from other makers. ZOTAC is mostly known for its graphics cards and high-performance small form-factor PCs, but not wearable systems (which are not that uncommon: industrial- and even space-grade wearable PCs have existed for years). To develop its VR GO computer, the company had to use experience it obtained from building SFF systems for gamers as well as to find ways to minimize weight and to ensure that the design can handle harsh treatment during gaming sessions. Basically, ZOTAC had to fix everything tightly inside the box while ensuring appropriate cooling and proper position of the I/O ports. To make it convenient to connect a VR headset to the VR GO, one side of the device has the appropriate ports. The single side has one HDMI output, two USB 3.0 ports and one power connector on top of it. Such positioning greatly simplifies cable management and makes VR gaming with a PC on your back a little more comfortable. The system also comes with a removable battery pack that enables autonomous operation for (waiting on offical numbers) hours. While virtual reality is considered as an important milestone for gaming, it hardly makes sense to develop a PC only for VR, which is why ZOTAC’s VR GO is a powerful PC in general and can be used like a desktop computer too. It has three additional USB 3.0/3.1 Type-A connectors, an SD card reader, four additional display outputs (two HDMI, two DP), two GbE ports as well as two 3.5 mm audio jacks. Inside the ZOTAC VR GO there is a custom motherboard in a proprietary form-factor carrying an Intel Core i7 CPU, two DDR4 SO-DIMMs, an M.2 SSD (PCIe 3.0 x4), an 802.11ac Wi-Fi module and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1070 MXM module. To cool down the CPU and the GPU (a total TDP of 150 W), ZOTAC uses a proprietary low-profile air cooling system but has not disclosed details. At this point, we do not know whether the manufacturer reinforced the design of its cooler's backplate somehow, but this is a logical thing to expect. To expand the storage capacity of the system, ZOTAC also added one bay for a SATA-based 2.5" storage device (either HDD, which might be affected by rapid movement, or a high capacity TLC SSD). ZOTAC’s VR GO system is not the first backpack-type PC developed by the company. At Computex 2016 the hardware manufacturer already demonstrated a wearable system, but that was largely a prototype and still in the early design stage. By contrast, the VR GO looks like a commercial product. ZOTAC does not specify exact availability timeframe for its VR GO backpack PC other than Q4 2016 as well as its estimated price. We expect to see it at CES in early January for sure.

(MGT) MGT stock may look alluring, but its rally can't go on forever By John Divine, InvestorPlace Assistant Editor  |  May 17, 2016, 12:58 pm EST     Popular Posts: The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2016 The $68B Uber IPO Is DEFINITELY Not Worth the Wait Why You Should SELL 3x Gold Mining ETFs JNUG and NUGT Today Recent Posts: Best Stocks of 2016: Snap-On Incorporated (SNA) Stock Is a Steal MBLY Stock: Why It’s a Great Time to Buy Mobileye NV SWHC Stock: It’s Time to Dive in With This Gun Stock View All Posts Editor’s Note: This story has been changed to reflect the fact that McAfee was not involved with his eponymous company when it sold to Intel (despite the insinuation that he was in MGT’s May 9 press release), and that John McAfee is not technically CEO of MGT Capital yet. Also, he does not own D-Vasive. You rarely, if ever, see a chart like this. MGT Capital Investments Inc. (MGT) stock is up over 40% in intraday trading on Tuesday, more than 1,000% in the last five days, 1,556% in the last month and 1,700% so far in 2016. Languishing in the company of other penny stocks as recently as a week ago, MGT stock traded as low as 15 cents per share at its 52-week low. On Tuesday, shares flirted with $5/share at their peak. So what changed? Two words: John McAfee. In a surprise move last week, the software security pioneer was suddenly proposed as the new CEO of MGT Capital Investments, a company involved in mobile gaming, social casino and fantasy sports areas. 7 A-Rated Small Caps to Pocket and Run With But frankly, the whole thing is a little shady when you start to take a look at the deal. At the end of the day, buying MGT stock is an extremely high-risk, high-reward play, but with so little insight into what the endgame is here, I’d venture to say that there are better stocks to take fliers on. MGT Stock: McAfee’s Public Plaything When McAfee was installed as CEO of MGT on May 9, that wasn’t the only news; MGT also agreed to purchase certain assets from D-Vasive Inc., an anti-spy software firm, for $300,000 cash and 23.8 million restricted shares of MGT stock, or 47% of the company. But the McAfee madness doesn’t end there. MGT is also renaming itself to John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc. I guess he figures, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The MGT press release announcing these moves claimed that McAfee sold his old company, the antivirus software company McAfee, to Intel Corporation (INTC) for $7.6 billion in 2011. In reality, he had nothing to do with the company at that point and was not involved in its sale to Intel. In conjunction with these two major announcements, MGT also struck a consulting agreement with Future Tense Secure Systems Inc., a tech incubator founded by none other than John McAfee himself. If you’re starting to wonder just how great these deals will be for MGT stock owners going forward, we’re on the same page. At the end of 2015, MGT had just $359,000 in cash. $300,000 of that is now gone, in the coffers of McAfee’s D-Vasive. The company posted revenue of just $104,000 last year, which is a pretty meager sum considering the current price of MGT stock values the company at upward of $70 million. When you add to that the fact that the company isn’t even growing fast — that $104,000 was up just 10% from the $94,000 it sold in 2014 — this becomes a real head-scratcher. Electronic Arts Inc. – ‘Star Wars’ Shoots EA Stock Into Hyperdrive Obviously, the X-factor here is what sort of value John McAfee, and the newly acquired assets of D-Vasive, bring to the table. Since D-Vasive is a private company, we don’t have much insight into that. It’s pretty overtly clear, though, that the recent hot streak we’ve seen with MGT stock is due to rampant speculation that McAfee can come in, work some magic with his knowledge and connections, and make this company a player or maybe even sell it. But with pretty much zero insight into how that’s gonna go down, and after a run of epic proportions that is based on nothing of fundamental significance, I’m far more prepared to bet on MGT being a zero than a hero. As of this writing, John Divine did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. You can follow him on Twitter at @divinebizkid or email him at editor@investorplace.com.

The tax collecting HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) launched a specialist unit in 2009 which studies the tax accounting of the U.K.’s 6,500 richest individuals. This is a group which makes up only 0.02 per cent of the population and counts over £20 million (US$24.5 million) worth of assets apiece. The dedicated unit uncovered an additional £416 million of tax for collection in 2015 to 2016 on top of what was paid voluntarily by these individuals. This is a more than doubling of the £200 million (US$ 245.4 million) secured by similar investigations four years earlier. It was also a sum that came in far ahead of the HMRC’s internal target of £250 million (US$306.7 million) for the period. Tina Riches, national tax partner at financial affairs adviser Smith & Williamson, told CNBC via telephone that the theme of tax entities keeping a closer watch was not just restricted to the U.K. According to Riches: ”Across the board all tax authorities are trying to step up a gear in terms of pursuing any taxpayer where they feel they can squeeze some extra tax out of them.” Change of direction Turning to the U.K. specifically, she noted while the first strategic objective for HMRC had been simply to “maximise revenues”, this mandate was expanded in February 2016 to “maximise revenues due and bear down on avoidance and evasion.” This prioritisation to tackle what in some cases may be considered routine tax planning is said to have marked a notable change of direction for the agency. The report was keen to emphasise that the discrepancies primarily relate to tax avoidance schemes and the legal interpretation of complicated tax issues rather than outright – and illegal – tax evasion. The complexity of some cases and the high amount of capital at stake mean that investigations can drag on at length, with 4,000 now having been open for over three years. The report also stated that an average of four issues are being looked into for each taxpayer involved in the probe. Further complexities concern even the initial identification of high net worth individuals as reporting is not required for most of the information about their wealth, including sources of income or assets owned. The risk to HMRC of targets slipping under the radar is evident from the unit’s uncovering of an additional 1,000 people with net worth above the £20 million (US$24.5 million) cut-off point. A word of warning Drilling down into the numbers, Riches cautioned about the haul reported by the NAO, saying some of the money collected was due to newly introduced powers to demand accelerated payments, where taxpayers are required to pay a requested amount in advance of the final agreed tax charge being decided and while the case remains open. The report notes that by March 2016, HMRC had issued 1,400 accelerated payment notices to high net worth individuals with the average value of such a notice to a high net worth individual being around £450,000 (US$55, 2100.50), compared with £75,000 (US$92,016.80) for the broader population.

Wednesday 16 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 10:25 / GMT - 06:55 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Wed Nov 02, 2016 10:43 Alienware 13 A 13-Inch VR-Ready Laptop: GeForce GTX 1060, Intel Skylake Make It A Portable Beast Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Alienware's touting itself as the maker of the first virtual reality-ready 13-inch laptop with the new Alienware 13, a powerful notebook that packs an Nvidia GTX 10 series graphics card, sixth-generation Intel Skylake chips and up to 16 GB of RAM. Alienware's name carries the weight of reputable gaming computers none of which are underserved with mediocre specs. The company's highly recognized for top-tier high-powered laptops, and Alienware 13 remains a service to that brand but with the prized presence of virtual reality tagging along. This year saw tremendous inroads for virtual reality, as several companies fumbled together its own virtual reality headsets such as Google's Daydream, Sony's PlayStation VR, HTC and Valve's HTC Vive and others, with the sustained imminence of mobile VR platforms slowly gaining traction. It's still a fairly nascent platform, but many companies have been exceedingly toying with it, even Atari's Nolan Bushnell wants in on the game. The Alienware 13 comes as Alienware's entry point in accessible virtual reality experiences because the setup involved in creating a VR experience requires very powerful and bulky equipment, a prerequisite many VR companies try to quash in order to make the appeal of the platform immediate. The base model of the VR-ready Alienware 13 has a powerful Intel Core i5-6300HQ chip alongside an Nvidia GTX 10 series graphics chip, specifically, the GeForce GTX 1060 with 6 GB GDDR5 and 8 GB of DDR4 RAM. This configuration will net you $1,199, but if you prefer beefier specs, there are Core i7 models with 16 GB of RAM at much higher price points. In terms of storage, Alienware 13 comes with up to 2 TB of internal storage split into two: 1 TB of PCI express of solid state drive as a boot drive, and the other terabyte serves as storage. The screen may also come in different options, with the lowest being a 13.3-inch 1,366 x 768 display. If low-resolution displays are a pet peeve, there's an option for a 1080p IPS display and a Quad HD display with touch control. Of course, a better screen spells a more expensive price. In terms of portability, the Alienware 13 weighs below six pounds and is less than an inch thick at its thickest point. Alienware has outfitted this laptop with "maximum thermal design power support," which keeps the system cool even under intensive performance. It comes with a 76 Wh battery and customizable color schemes for the keyboard. The Alienware 13 is available now on Dell's online store, which ships in 23 to 27 business days.         LATEST STORIES (10) American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US Eleven Killed, Wounded in Terrorists' Rocket Attack in Western Damascus Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syrian Army Discovers Terrorists' 700-Meter-Long Tunnel in Khan Al-Sheih Connecting Damascus to Quneitra Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win Yemen Water Crisis Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US TEHRAN (FNA)- Protesters were not slowing down six days after Donald Trump's election, many of them high school students leaving class by the hundreds to carry signs and flags on the streets of several US cities.

ROGERS Apple MacBook Pro showing Touch Bar. Photo courtesy of Apple - + Apple's event last week, a day after Microsoft's announcement of some well-received devices, revealed the expected updates to the MacBook Pro range. The new devices from Microsoft and Apple use the Intel Skylake processor, not Kaby Lake. While Microsoft favours a touchscreen, Apple has avoided this. Apple's iPhones have shown how touch technology can help productivity, but there is a feeling that using this on the computer monitor is not helpful. The Touch Bar puts input where needed. Long-time Mac users often make use of key commands for efficiency, so this extends that functionality. This second display is run from the T1 -- an ARM chip based on the ones used in the Apple Watch. More features could be made available, but for now the Touch Bar changes depending on which app is being used. One addition that the Touch Bar allows is Fingerprint ID like on iOS devices, which will make secure online payments easier. At the Apple event there were demonstrations on its use in Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop, showing how quickly users can do things. Other developers (like 1Password) are already working on providing support. When running Windows in BootCamp, Function keys will be displayed. The 13-inch models with the Touch Bar are US$1,799 and US$1,999. Converting the former price gives 63,055 baht. Adding 7% for VAT is 67,469. On Apple's online store this model is 67,900 baht, so pricing is close. The price of the other new 13-inch MacBook Pro converted to baht and with 7% added is 74,969 baht, making this model a fraction cheaper at its listed 74,900 baht. The two 15-inch models are $2,399 and $2,799: 89,971 and 104,972 baht with VAT factored in, while the prices quoted here are 89,900 and 105,900 baht respectively. When I checked the weekend, these new Macs were shown as "currently unavailable" here. In the US, the new 13-inch versions have delivery times of four to five weeks, with the 15-inch at three to four weeks. Two weeks ago, the Apple Watch Series 2 went on sale here. I have been running a black version for the last few days. I had been quite happy with the first release of the Apple Watch, especially messaging and fitness monitoring, although I am not a gym visitor or runner and use this for basic inputs. Last Friday, the Apple Watch Nike+ was released worldwide. There are two versions: 38mm at 13,900 baht and 42mm at 14,900 baht, on sale here now. The Series 2 Apple Watch has added considerably to what can be done by those who do make use of the fitness features, helped by some of the 18,000 apps now available. Placement of apps can be done as before using the iPhone Watch app. Users may also add regularly used items (such as heart rate or message apps) to the Dock. There are more complications available so a watch face (and there are more of these too) can be set up to provide a user with personalised input and output methods. There were several improvements to the S2 chip that now powers the Watch. With dual cores, enhanced graphics capabilities and GPS, it works faster. The screen is easier to see and GPS location capabilities help provide significantly more detail for those who run (or in my case, walk). Improvements for fitness include colour-coding on the map for different running speeds or when stationary. As GPS only works outside, dotted lines indicate when tunnels or subways are used. This additional location information is assisted by built-in Wi-Fi. WatchOS allows for several types of exercise input, including running and walking, plus more highly-tuned workouts for wheelchair users and for swimming. These require new types of motion recording: input from arm movements is completely different. Activities can be shared, which adds group or family competitiveness. As swimming needs full immersion, waterproofing was developed for the Watch. A quick-access menu turns off input to the watch face -- avoiding unwanted input from splashes -- and locks the watch. When done, turning the digital crown unlocks the watch and expels any water from the speaker housing with a sonar-like beeping. It is water resistant up to a depth of 50m. When the watch I am now using arrived, it had the black fluoroelastomer band which is ideal for sports. I loved the stainless steel Milanese loop band I had with the first Apple Watch, so I also bought a black version of this. It felt thinner than the original, so I checked this with the help of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Mahidol University's Engineering Faculty. The black band was 1.44mm thick compared with 1.45mm of the older band. It may be that the weave of the band is finer. Next time: more on the Apple Watch. Graham K. Rogers of Mahidol University's Engineering Faculty, has OS X-flavoured web pages at www.extensions.in.th/index4.html and he can be followed on Twitter (@extensions_th).

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Samsung Galaxy TabPro S Review By Hubert Nguyen on 11/01/2016 16:33 PST Samsung was the first major brand to announce a 12-inch HiDPI ultralight notebook running with Windows 10 and an Intel core m3 processor. The announcement sent shock-waves through the PC OEMs who were impressed behind closed doors. At 1.53 lbs (694g), the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S is impressively light and portable, especially when the lightest clamshell PCs often start at 11” and 2.3+ Lbs. An extreme design like this will, of course, have strengths and weaknesses. In this article, we aim at showing you what they are, so you can see the beat use cases and be able to map our experience to your needs. Configuration as tested The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S varies only in storage capacity (128/256 GB), so none of the variants would affect CPU/GPU performance. The SSD size could theoretically influence performance depending on the controller, but we only had access to one unit. Intel Core m3-6Y30 (0.9-1.51 GHz) 4GB RAM 128GB SDD [256 GB Max.] 108GB formatted Windows 10 Home [Windows 10 Pro] Industrial design The industrial design of the Galaxy TabPro S is very neat. At first glance, It is a metal and glass design, which look like a high-end 12-inch tablet. Interestingly enough the backside isn’t made of metal. Instead, it seems like a sheet of hard plastic, possibly to accommodate the optional wireless broadband LTE modem. The back seems to have been designed with the idea that most users will have the keyboard/cover on the laptop. Samsung Galaxy TabPro S Unboxing Ports The number of connectors is extremely limited: one USB-C and one 3.5mm audio ports. At the bottom of the TabPro S, there’s a proprietary connector for the keyboard, which is nice because a wired connection avoids lag, pairing and having to include a keyboard battery. This is always the preferred option from a user standpoint. At the top of the tablet, you will find the Power and Volume control. There are also two small holes which appear to be microphones. On the left side, there’s an additional button, which is the equivalent of the Windows “Start” button. The Stereo speakers are set on either sides when in portrait mode. The speakers output a quality sound, and you can most definitely enjoy listening music with them. From that, you can conclude that movie soundtracks and voices will come out nicely as well. Even at 100% volume there isn’t much distortion: it looks like Samsung tweaked things well. Keyboard (free / included in the box) The Galaxy TabPro S comes with the keyboard directly in the box, which explains why it is a little more expensive than the closest competitor, the Huawei Matebook Pro, which sells its keyboard/cover option for $129. I typically consider that the keyboard is a must-have feature, so most people should consider adding its price comparing with the Huawei Matebook. If you do not want to have the keyboard for some reason, then having it as an option may be a good thing. "REMINDS ME OF THE SURFACE PRO 3 KEYBOARD"The Galaxy TabPro S keyboard is fairly compact and reminds me of the Surface Pro 3 keyboard. Since then, Microsoft has gone with a better chiclet keyboard with a longer key travel. That said, the TabPro S keyboard is pretty decent and gets the job done, although it could certainly use some design improvements later. The trackpad integrated into the keyboard is relatively small but I found it to be sufficient, and it didn’t get in the way. Obviously, larger trackpads are more comfortable to use, but I don’t think that Samsung had a lot of options since the design is very compact and takes a minimal footprint on the table. Galaxy phone fingerprint unlock The Galaxy TabPro S doesn’t have a built-in fingerprint reader by default (unlike the Huawei Matebook), but Samsung added an interesting option to log-in via your (Samsung) phone’s fingerprint reader via Samsung Flow. It’s an interesting option which uses the phone as a proximity safety, but it adds just enough friction that I find myself not using it. If you have a long password, you could go through the effort, but I can type my relatively long password faster than login with the phone. Tip: How to Create a Strong, Easy To Remember, Password Learn more: How do Fingerprint Scanners Work? Your mileage can vary, and it’s nice to have the option — but in the end, it’s just better to have it integrated into the computer. Samsung Flow has other benefits, but I don’t think that it is a sway factor at the moment. Display (very good) The Galaxy TabPro S has a 12-inch, 2160×1440, Super-AMOLED, which means that it’s an AMOLED screen with an integrated touch sensor. Note that Super-AMOLED or sAMOLED is not a technology, but a Brand which is owned and used by Samsung. "THE SAMOLED DISPLAY IS SUPERIOR TO HUAWEI’S LCD IPS DISPLAY"With a pixel density of 216 PPI, thinks to very sharp (for a PC), and Windows 10 comes out nice and clear. We measured the maximum brightness at 206 NITs, which isn’t very much as many laptops can hit 300+ NITs. Concretely, it means that working in a sunny/bright environment may become challenging, especially since the screen has a glossy finish. Learn more: LCD vs. OLED. Which is Best And Why? Learn more: What is PPI? Learn more: High PPI displays: do you really need them? That said, the closest competitor, the Huawei Matebook’s brightness is about the same (216 NITs), so that’s about the best will you get with this kind of form-factor, since I consider the Surface 4 Pro a serious machine, but not quite in the same category of size and price. The sAMOLED display is superior to Huawei’s LCD IPS display in black-levels/contrast, and possibly saturation. The difference in brightness is small, and I don’t think it’s perceptible without instruments (216 NITs for Huawei vs. 206 NITs for Samsung). The difference in contrast is however visible to the naked eye, and everyone can see it. Webcam + Main camera (very good, for a PC) The Galaxy TabPro S has two cameras: a main camera at the rear, and a front camera (webcam) for video calls, and possibly selfies. Although both cameras are a far cry from what you can find on a Galaxy S7 phone, they are better than what’s in pretty much all the laptops I’ve played with recently, and it becomes the notebook to beat in terms of imaging and low-light selfies. That’s nice because, with the increasing quality of displays, it’s fair to say that the PC industry has been cheaping out on decent camera module. It’s nice to see Samsung put some pressure here, and the difference is worth mentioning as we would like to encourage higher quality notebook camera hardware. System performance In general, the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S has performance that is comparable to other computers running with the same processor. And because the Intel core m processor also integrated the GPU, the graphics performance is also very close from one computer to the other. The TabPro S does not have a core m5 option, so there’s no way to pay extra to gain a little CPU performance. Huawei’s Matebook does have an m5 processor and 8GB RAM option, which is a big deal for multitasking. The TabPro S now has a 8GB+ option (TabPro S Gold Edition), and although the lower memory amount won’t show up in benchmarks, it can affect performance if the system runs out of memory and starts swapping data (memory-intensive tasks like Photoshop/video editing). You may think that you’re “just browsing the web”, but leaving a bunch of browser tabs open can be incredibly taxing on the system too. Opinion: Are benchmarks important? What do they mean? With a score of 4868, the Galaxy TabPro S has an excellent mobile storage system, which is even faster than the Surface Pro 4 (4662 points, core i7), but Huawei’s Matebook benchmark scores are even a little bit higher 4921. In reality, those differences are not perceptible, but your takeaway is that storage is excellent. Speed in relation to price and weight In general, the TabPro S performs decently regarding its price and weight, but in most benchmarks, the Huawei Matebook has slightly higher performance which puts it just a little ahead. The difference in performance isn’t really perceptible, but this shows how competitive this space is, and how cutting-edge both companies are. It also shows that specialized designs can bring significant value to users who target ultra-light designs. Our charts clearly show that those small computers can pack a lot of punch in relation to their weight and that increasing the weight does certainly not increase performance linearly. But in absolute terms, you will have to make some sacrifices in terms of performance because these Intel m3 based computer designs flirt with the edge of a “good enough” user experience. From time to time, things can start feeling slow if you are not mindful of your resource usage. Battery With a 39.5 Wh battery capacity, the Galaxy TabPro S come ahead of the Huawei Matebook that has 33.7 Wh. That’s even more than the Surface Pro 4 which has 38.2 Wh while being 35% bigger in volume. While Samsung claims 630mm (10.5hrs of battery life), it’s not immediately clear in what conditions those numbers were obtained. Usually, this is done by watching a local video with the screen setup to be not overly bright. In my personal use case where I write and do some photo/video editing in the context of Ubergizmo, I wouldn’t expect more than 4 to 4.5 hours of battery if I’m mindful of power consumption. Keep in mind that things like web browsers can be deceptively power-taxing when many tabs are left open. The Galaxy TabPro S easily brings the most battery capacity for the price, and for the weight. At this specific size/weight point, that’s the most battery you will get. Samsung says that you can go from 0% to 100% battery in 150mn, which is a believable claim since battery charging measurement can be done very accurately. There’s also a “fast-charging” mechanism according to Samsung, but without further data, I can’t lend more or less credence to it. To date, the most effective fast-charging that we have seen comes from Lenovo, which can charge from 0%-80% in 30mn laptops such as the Carbon X1 (2014) or the Yoga X1 (2016) – this is a hot feature that every PC OEM should include, but yet, very few do. I’ll see if I can establish a baseline later. 0%-100% in 150mn isn’t super-fast when compared to what we’ve seen with Lenovo. Also, charging tends to slow down considerably after 80%, so Samsung should really communicate about 0-80%… just a piece of advice. OEMs should realize that fast-charging is one of the key features that this ultra-light category of laptops needs. There’s no way to put much more battery capacity in there, but it’s possible to replenish the energy storage faster. Conclusion The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S introduced an impressive world-class design that still leads the pack today. It competes with the Huawei Matebook which also has an excellent industrial design. A complete comparison between the two would deserve its own article, but the bottom line is this: The Galaxy TabPro S works better because it has a better keyboard design. There’s also a wireless broadband LTE version as well, which we have not tested. If you are shopping for a tablet-only Win10 device and don’t plan to use the Keyboard, the Huawei is arguably better in some ways, so it’s worth considering for that scenario. On Windows, I expect the large majority of users to want a keyboard. As you can see from the list below, both Huawei and Samsung have similar pricing once the keyboard is bundled. "AN IMPRESSIVE WORLD-CLASS DESIGN"Also, the Surface Pro 4 is never far from mind when talking about these tablet/notebooks. It’s important to understand that despite some design and pricing similarities, the “feel” of using and carrying a Surface Pro 4 is quite different. That is because it has a ~35% larger volume than the Samsung TabPro S. It’s fair to assume that if you’re reading this, size matters to you. If not, just get a Surface Pro 4 — if in doubt, try to hold them at a retail location. Microsoft has stores in many places and good show rooms. Performance-wise, the Core m platform is getting better. A couple of years ago, I wouldn’t have considered one for my use (trade shows…), but now it’s getting “good enough” for my needs. Keep in mind that these are still ultra-light computers who do have performance trade-offs, so avoid heavy multitasking and heavy workloads.

Google "Eve" Kabylake System Gains Coreboot Support Written by Michael Larabel in Coreboot on 1 November 2016 at 07:06 PM EDT. 1 Comment I haven't seen Google announce any Intel Kabylake powered Chromebooks yet, but activity indicates that they may not be too far out with now having mainlined Coreboot support for a new device codenamed "Eve". References to Google's "Eve" Kabylake device surfaced a few days ago in other Google repositories while this afternoon Eve received support in mainline Coreboot. The Coreboot commit confirms that Eve is a new board using a Kabylake CPU and the FSP 2.0 firmware support package. It's not clear if this is just a developer target or something to soon be released. Hopefully we'll end up seeing some Kabylake Chromebooks before the holidays. Those wanting to dig through the support landing in Coreboot can find it in Git. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Read about Teena Maddox's hands-on experience and find out what's next for the Los Angeles-based startup. By Teena Maddox | November 1, 2016, 12:47 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Daqri tests the smart helmet on a robot at its Los Angeles headquarters. Image: Teena Maddox/TechRepublic Industrial uses for augmented reality (AR) wearables are on the rise, and earlier this year California startup Daqri launched an Intel-powered smart helmet. The third version of the helmet is now available in a $15,000 developer edition that debuted on October 31. The new helmet arrives just in time for an AR market that is predicted to hit $90 billion by 2020, with VR pegged for $30 billion by 2020, according to Digi-Capital. "It's been in the last year or two where augmented reality is where you can use it to solve hard problems. It's an exciting time for the industry," said Daqri CEO Brian Mullins, who founded the company in 2010. More about Innovation Our autonomous future: How driverless cars will be the first robots we learn to trust Google Fiber pivots: What it means for the future of gigabit internet IBM Watson's latest gig: Improving cancer treatment with genomic sequencing Subscribe to TechRepublic's Next Big Thing newsletter. The helmet includes four cameras to help in assessing problems in the field by sending video in real-time to a technician in the office who can view what the on-site worker is seeing. "This is the first helmet that customers can work with directly and roll out. It's based on the last three years of working closely with key partners and designing specifically for field engineers. There are smart workers and they use valuable and sensitive instruments to get the job done. It connects them to more information, more knowledge, and it allows them to make better decisions," Mullins said. The company was originally located in Santa Monica, but when it outgrew that space in 2013, there wasn't enough room to expand in the area. Daqri moved to downtown Los Angeles, which has a thriving tech scene, Mullins explained. Daqri also has offices in the UK, Ireland, and Austria. SEE: AR and VR: The future of work and play? (ZDNet) Hands-on experience with the heads-up display During a visit to Daqri's headquarters, I tried on the smart helmet, which looks like a gleaming white motorcycle helmet, and was surprisingly light and comfortable to wear. At Daqri's Los Angeles headquarters, Senior Writer Teena Maddox takes the smart helmet for a test run. Image: Teena Maddox/TechRepublic I tested it in a series of applications. In the first, I was a field worker, assessing pipes, and as I looked at the pipes on the wall, someone from my fictional company's main office was able to remotely direct me through the repair job. They were able to see what I was seeing, and circle the problem areas and explain to me, through the helmet's speakers, what I needed to repair and how to do it. Of course, in reality I was simply speaking to a member of Daqri's PR team, who sat 20 feet away from me, but the concept was clear, and highly effective. In another scenario, with thermal imaging activated, I felt a bit like the lethal alien in "Predator." I was able to see which pipes glowed bright yellow, signifying heat, and which ones were red, signifying no heat. This is ideal for a quick scan of an area where mechanical components should remain at a steady temperature and not become overheated. It's also fun for viewing people, although I felt like a bit of a voyeur. Mullins said, "Augmented reality isn't about augmented reality. It's about augmenting people." He explained that people are smart, and if they have enough information, they can make the right decision. The helmet is ideal for all levels of field workers, from people on their first day at the job, to experienced technicians. While the smart helmet is ideal for industrial settings, there's also the consumer market. Daqri is working on a heads-up display for car windshields after acquiring Two Trees Photonics, a UK-based company that designs holographic technology, in March 2016. The laser-based technology projects information onto a vehicle's windshield for a futuristic heads-up display powered by holograms. I was also given a chance to see this new technology for vehicles. It's the ultimate way to use GPS, or be forewarned that another car is nearby. The hologram appears as an overlay on the lower right side of the car windshield, so that it doesn't block the driver's view of the road, but still allows for information to be shared with the driver. "Consumers will see augmented reality in their car before they see it in any other form factor. Three to five years down the road, you'll see it more and more," Mullins said. Three takeaways for TechRepublic readers On October 31, Daqri released a $15,000 developers kit for its AR smart helmet. AR and VR is predicted to be a $120 billion market by 2020, and only $30 billion of that will be VR, according to Digi-Capital. Daqri is also making a heads-up display for car windshields after acquiring UK-based Two Trees Photonics earlier this year. Innovation is what tech is all about.

A new task force of industry experts wants to help home-grown semiconductor companies square up to their overseas challengers. by Jamie Condliffe November 1, 2016 The U.S. semiconductor industry faces increasing competition from overseas, but the government hopes a new panel of experts can go some way to ensuring that it maintains its dominance in the coming years. The domestic industry still isn’t in bad shape: according to the White House, it still employs 250,000 workers and is the third-largest source of manufactured exports in the country. And Intel remains the world’s biggest chipmaker. But its competitive advantage has certainly been slipping. That’s down to two main factors. First, the likes of Intel and AMD pulled up short on designs for mobile chips, an area now dominated by companies that specialize in low-power processors, such as ARM. Second, even when American companies, such as Apple, design chips that are built by U.S.-based organizations, like Globalfoundries, the hardware itself is now often manufactured overseas. President Obama tours an Intel manufacturing facility in 2011. There are other threats looming, too. China, in particular, is pumping $100 billion into subsidizing its own semiconductor market, while the slowing of Moore’s Law is causing industrywide headaches of its own. The new working group—made up of industry veterans from the likes of Intel, Qualcomm, and Microsoft—will seek to overcome some of those issues. John Holdren, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House, explained in a statement that the group would “identify the core challenges facing the semiconductor industry at home and abroad and identify major opportunities for sustaining U.S. leadership.” In reality, that will mean finding potential new strategies—from radical new geometries and optical computing approaches, to increasingly specialized chips—and then investing heavily. Some of that will be private, such as Samsung’s new commitment to invest $1 billion into its semiconductor facilities in Austin, Texas, but plenty will come from the government, too. The all-American iPhone may remain somewhat of a fantasy for now, but at least a few more of its internal chips could end up being manufactured on home turf.

Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Nov 1, 2016 12:03 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Computer Processors Computer Hardware Comments The world's fastest computer runs a Chinese chip, and that fact hasn't escaped notice by the U.S. government. So how does the U.S. government bludgeon the Chinese chip threat? A new U.S. government working group aims to encourage domestic companies to use homegrown chip technology and resist the urge to buy inexpensive Chinese semiconductors. The White House this week established the Semiconductor Working Group, a private-public advisory group that will create policy and research guidelines for semiconductor development. The ultimate goal is to retain U.S. leadership in semiconductor technology. Nations are waging a battle to build the world's fastest computers, and homegrown chips are at the center of that race. Supercomputers help with economic projections, weapons development, scientific simulations, and scenarios critical to national security. Advanced semiconductors will also drive the development of self-driving cars, robots, drones, and satellites. Semiconductors are building blocks for most electronics. "A loss of leadership in semiconductor innovation and manufacturing could have significant adverse impacts on the U.S. economy and even on national security," said John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The working group is also encouraging the development of new types of computers. Companies are already developing quantum computers and chips mimicking brain functionality, which could eventually replace today's PCs and chips. Without mentioning China, Holdren said some countries subsidize chip development and dump inferior technology on U.S. companies. That hurts the development of new semiconductor technology, he said. "Such policies could lead to overcapacity and dumping, reduce incentives for private-sector research and development in the United States, and thereby slow the pace of semiconductor innovation and realization of the economic and security benefits that such innovation could bring," Holdren said. The call for national cooperation in semiconductor development is timely. Researchers believe that Moore's Law, a guiding light for the semiconductor development cycle codified by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, is coming to an end, creating an opportunity to rethink chip design. But technological challenges are holding back chip advances. It's becoming difficult to cram more features on smaller chips, and adoption of new materials and manufacturing technologies are progressing at a slow pace. Major chip companies IBM and Intel have their own ideas of what future PCs and servers will look like. One goal is to bring uniformity into semiconductor development so that large and small U.S. companies can benefit alike. The U.S. government may have its own interests in mind. U.S. companies sell chip technology to China, but the government has blocked some sales in the name of national security. Last year, the U.S. government blocked Intel from selling its Xeon chips for China’s supercomputers, reflecting concerns they could be used in supercomputers related to "nuclear explosive activities." The Semiconductor Industry Association, which boasts major chip companies as its members, applauded the formation of the working group, saying it was long overdue. "The chip industry spawns new industries, makes existing industries more productive, and drives advances once never imagined," said John Neuffer, president and CEO of SIA. The U.S. is creating faster supercomputers and has efforts to develop new computing technologies through the Brain Initiative, the Advanced Manufacturing Initiative, the National Nanotechnology Initiative, and Computer Science for All, which promotes technology education. Many other technologies are developed by private sector companies or academic institutions. It's unclear how effective the advisory group will be, but it'll likely have little impact in creating new semiconductor and computing technologies, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. This task force is being established just as U.S. President Barack Obama leaves office, and it may be scrubbed by the time the new president takes over. Moreover, little gets done in the U.S. government, and the working group won't change the way companies like Intel and IBM develop technologies or do business, McGregor said. The U.S. government needs to invest more heavily to assert its influence and drive technological change, McGregor said. The nominal U.S. government investments in technological development come through organizations like the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. By comparison, China, South Korea and Taiwan have centralized organizations that help consolidate IT and drive technological education, McGregor said. The working group should instead prioritize promoting STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education and retraining the workforce for homegrown semiconductor development, McGregor said. A lot of chip development for companies like Intel and AMD are exported to countries like India, China, and Israel. Prominent members of the Semiconductor Working Group include Qualcomm chairman Paul Jacobs and former Intel CEO Paul Otellini.

Cooperating with industry partners Lenovo Group and other domestic personal computer vendors, Shanghai Zhaoxin Semiconductor Co plans to sell 1 million computers with the new chip by 2018, said Ye Jun, chairman and chief executive of the developer. “We don’t want to replace Intel and AMD immediately at the current stage. But it does make sense that we have another choice from a Chinese chip designer,” Ye said during an interview at the company’s booth at the China International Industry Fair yesterday. The advantage of the self-developed chip is its high-level security, which will be used in government bureaus, state-owned firms and the military. Lenovo desktops featuring the chip are already used in some local government bureaus.

However, the corporation has prematurely provided part names, base frequencies and more in a PDF document supplied to manufacturing partners and available publically, if you know where to find it. Yet another partner focussed document provides a sprinkling of details on new supporting Intel 200 series chipsets. The document detailing the new Kaby Lake desktop chips is described as a 'Product Change Notification'. It has been put together to help manufacturers with purchase order planning and so on, Intel wouldn't want them to be surprised on launch day. Inside you can find a table with the updated processors listed. I've reproduced the table of new desktop processors above. You will notice that we get to see a list of Kaby Lake Core i5, Core i7, and a new Xeon E3 chip with their associated base clock speeds. Unfortunately juicy information regarding the processor Turbo Boost clocks, core counts, TDPs, and thread counts is missing. Another omission seems to be of any Core i3 chip details… The top new Core i7 processor from Intel looks to be the Core i7-7700K with a base clock of 4.2GHz. Its 'K' suffix surely denotes an unlocked multiplier and we reckon it will offer a 4C/8T configuration. Intel's fastest Core i5 looks to be the similarly unlocked i5-7600K with a base clock of 3.8GHz. Following Intel 'tradition' it is likely to be a 4C/4T config part. Pondering over the new Intel Chipset document for partners reveals no surprises. We can see references to various 200 Series chipsets but no further descriptions. There will be a top end enthusiast Z270 chipset with others such as the H270, B250, Q250, and Q270 targetted at various other market segments. The C422 could be a next-gen Xeon supporting motherboard. Lastly, the X299 suggests an upcoming high-end modern chipset replacement for the X99 line. As a reminder, Intel launched its laptop Kaby Lake processors back in August. We should get the full official details of the 7th generation Core desktop processors from Intel at around CES 2017 time.

ASUS Sabertooth Z170-S Rear I/O Cover and Fan Assist Being a part of the ASUS TUF series motherboards, the Sabertooth Z170 S has gone through heavy duty testing before it is packaged for the user.  This testing includes subjecting them to high and low temperatures, bending, shocking and even dropping them.  It is developed to military standards for durability, which includes military grade components to protect your system and to ensure 24/7 reliability.  In fact, ASUS is so sure of their TUF motherboards, the Sabertooth Z170 S is covered by a 5 year warranty! So what TUF components are included on the Sabertooth Z170 S?  The TUF Allow Chokes, and 10K Ti-Caps, are designed to last longer and to have a better tolerance for temperatures.  The MOSFETs are more power efficient, which in turn means less heat.  The Intel Gigabit ethernet connection has the LANGuard system, to help protect your vital components from electric surges coming in over the ethernet connection.  The other I/O ports on the back are also protected with advanced ESD protection. ASUS Sabertooth Z170 S Features Overview Let’s take a quick look at the features and specifications of the Sabertooth Z170 S before taking a look at what else this motherboard has to offer.

When a customer reached out to Phil Schiller, he responded by saying that having more than 16GB of RAM would basically result in a laptop that isn’t as energy efficient. However it seems that maybe this isn’t entirely Apple’s fault, but rather the limitations of the Intel chipsets found in the laptop. This is according to a post on Reddit (via 9to5Mac) which suggests that maybe the limitations of Intel has more to do with why the MacBook Pros are capped at 16GB, as opposed to it being something that Apple has chosen to do. According to the OP on Reddit, exploding_m1, “The true reason behind the lack of 32gb or ddr4 is intel. Skylake does not support LPDDR4 (LP for low power) ram. Kabylake is set to include support, but only for the U category of chips. So no LPDDR4 support for mobile until 2018 I think.” The poster also points out that other laptops like the Dell XPS 13 is maxed out at 16GB, and so is the Microsoft Surface Book. That being said, if you don’t need a new laptop right this instant, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had earlier predicted that in 2017 we can expect new MacBook Pros that will support up to 32GB of RAM.

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship Who’s to Blame for the 16 GB RAM Limit on the New MacBook Pros: Apple or Intel? “Exploding_m1”, in a thread on Reddit: The true reason behind the lack of 32 GB or DDR4 is Intel. Skylake does not support LPDDR4 (LP for low power) RAM. Kabylake is set to include support, but only for the U category of chips. So no LPDDR4 support for mobile until 2018 I think. One example is the Dell XPS 13. On the Dell XPS 13 version, you cannot go for 32 GB of RAM. Meanwhile, the 15 inches does give you that option, but you have to sacrifice battery life for it. From what Apple told me last week, I believe this is true. You can certainly argue with the design of the new MacBook Pros — and many are. The argument against this design is that it’s backwards — that for MacBooks targeting pro users, Apple should start with high performance specs and then build a machine that supports things like 32 GB of RAM. If they had done that, they’d have wound up with thicker, heavier designs. Many actual pro users would be delighted by that. Apple simply places a higher priority on thinness and lightness than performance-hungry pro users do. Apple is more willing to compromise on performance than on thinness and lightness and battery life. Intel just doesn’t make the chips that Apple needs. This is why Apple designs its own chips for iOS. You don’t see people complaining that the iPhone or iPad Pro are underpowered. In fact, they’re faster than their competition. (The iPhone 7 has a single-core Geekbench 4 score that is double that of the Google Pixel.) With iPhones and iPads, Apple makes them ever thinner and lighter and yet they still offer industry-leading performance. We’ve all been speculating for years that Apple might start designing its own chips for Macs. At this point it looks like they have to do it. If anything, these new MacBook Pros were overdue — they arrived late and Intel still doesn’t have the chips Apple really needs. Intel is designing its chips for an industry that does not share Apple’s obsession with thinness and lightness. ★ Monday, 31 October 2016 Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2016 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.

SARAH MULLINAX A University of Kansas scientist has been named one of the first recipients of an $825,000 fellowship for her work in developing a protein designed to thwart antibiotic resistance. Listen Listening... / 0:48 Joanna Slusky, 37, who heads the Slusky, Lab at KU and specializes in outer membrane proteins, is one of five inventors nationwide recognized by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in Palo Alto, California. The foundation, established by the co-founder of Intel Corp. and his wife, anticipates awarding a total of $33.75 million to support 50 promising inventors over the next 10 years, according to its website. Slusky is part of the first cohort announced today. Slusky is an assistant professor of computational biology and molecular biosciences at KU. She was recruited there two years ago after completing postdoctoral work at Stockholm University and the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. She received her Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biophysics from the University of Pennsylvania. Her lab looks at how outer membrane proteins fold. It seeks to develop applications for cancer therapeutics, vaccine development and environmental remediation. The invention for which Slusky is being recognized is a so-called helper protein that disables a bacterium’s ability to protect itself from an attack by antibiotics. “In order to do that, what one needs to do is disable the resistance mechanism of the bacteria,” Slusky said in a telephone interview. Slusky said the resistance mechanism is a protein pump that pushes antibiotics out of a cell, thwarting their ability to kill it. “So I’m making proteins that disable that resistance and disable it in a particularly interesting way that has never been tried before,” she said. Slusky, fourth from left, and members of her lab study how outer membrane proteins fold. Credit Becca Peterson Overuse and misuse of antibiotics have spawned antibiotic-resistant bacteria, one of the world’s most pressing health problems. Illnesses that were once easily treatable with antibiotics now often mutate into dangerous and sometimes life-threatening infections. “More than 700,000 people are dying worldwide every year from antibiotic-resistant infections,” Slusky said. Some studies project that, if current trends continue, by 2050 more people in the United States will die from such infections than from cancer. Slusky’s invention is still a long way from coming to market. It has yet to undergo preclinical studies, let alone clinical trials in humans. “It’s probably a minimum of 15 years off, or something like that,” Slusky said. “And that’s partly related to the fact that it takes so long, once you have something that works, to bring to market.” The Moore Foundation money – $825,000, including $50,000 from KU, over three years – will help accelerate that process. The funds will enable Slusky to do more hiring, plan more long-term experiments and, with any luck, begin pre-clinical trials in three to five years. “We are investing in promising scientist problem solvers with a passion for inventing – like Gordon Moore himself,” said Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, president of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, in a news release. “By providing support to these early-career researchers, we can give them the freedom to try out new ideas that could make a real and positive difference.” The release said that Slusky’s invention “could have a global impact on antibiotic resistance and re-establish the efficacy of antibiotics.” The other recipients of this year’s Moore Foundation awards are Deji Akinwande of the University of Texas; Shane Ardo of the University of California, Irvine; Xingjie Ni of Pennsylvania State University; and Mona Jarrahi of the University of California, Los Angeles. The awards are being given out on the 50th anniversary of Gordon Moore’s now-famous prediction, known as Moore’s law, that components on integrated circuits would double every 18 months, exponentially increasing computer power.

And you can thank her for helping lead the way to a pretty hefty parental leave policy at the tech giant. “When we increased our maternity leave to 18 weeks, we saw the number of women who left Google cut by 50%,” Susan Wojcicki told CNNMoney in an interview at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit last month. That data was enough for Google to make the argument that paid leave is well worth the cost. “We wanted to retain women, we wanted to show them that Google cared, that they can be a mother and they could work at Google,” she said. As CEO of YouTube (now with over 1 billion users a month) Wojcicki has her eyes on changing TV as we know it — while advocating for more women in top roles at tech companies. Oh, and in the meantime raising her five children. Wojcicki was one of the first woman hired at Google — and now she’s the only female CEO under Google’s behemoth umbrella. In 1998, Wojcicki left her marketing job at Intel and became employee number 16 at Google. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had been running the fledgling company out of Wojcicki’s garage in Menlo Park, California at the time. She’d agreed to rent it to Brin and Page (then PhD students at Stanford) to bring in some extra dough. “It was truly because I needed help paying the mortgage.” Eventually, Page and Brin convinced her to join their team. Wojcicki was the first woman to take maternity leave in the nascent days of Google. “When I first started I don’t think we really had an HR department. So it wasn’t really clear.” She said, “‘Hey Larry, hey Sergey, I’m going to take a little time off … Nobody had ever done it before at the company.'” Fast Forward nearly two decades and she’s helped lead the charge on family leave at Google — for men and women — which now offers new mothers 18 weeks of paid leave and new fathers 12 weeks. Google certainly isn’t the only company in Silicon Valley offering lengthy periods of paid time off for new parents. Companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Netflix all generous new parental leave policies last year. Facebook now offers four months paid leave to new mothers and fathers. In making the announcement, Facebook’s VP of People, Lori Goler, posted: “Studies show that when working parents take time to be with their newborns, outcomes are better for the children and families.” So why have tech companies seemingly led the way on parental leave? “I think Silicon Valley has led on this because Silicon Valley, at the end of the day, is really focused on talent,” Wojcicki said. “It’s a talent business, getting the right engineers, the right leaders … And Silicon Valley is also focused on having more women, more diversity.” But there’s still a long way to go. Wojcicki is perturbed by the dearth of women in top technology jobs in Silicon Valley. Only 26% of all tech jobs in the U.S. are held by women. At Google, 31% of global employees are women. And just 24% of leadership positions and 19% of tech roles are held by women. “I see tech as … a force that is changing pretty much all parts of our society,” Wojcicki argues. “It’s really sad for me that we don’t have enough women that are part of that. I compare this to the revolution where people were able to read and write for the first time, and the printing press. I think it is that big, in terms of how much our society is being changed.” Last year, Time Magazine dubbed Wojcicki “the most powerful woman on the internet.” Like so many working parents, Wojcicki is juggling a big job — and a big family. And she says that being a mother has actually helped her do her job better. She credits her children with priceless user feedback on what YouTube is doing well — and where the platform could improve. “I try to watch my kids behavior, and I try to get insights from that, and understand how are they thinking about media, what are they watching. Then I try to marry that with quantitative data that we have in the office.” And she feels a responsibility to change the narrative, and the statistics, on girls and women in technology across the country. “One of the things that I’m trying to do is use the position that I’m in … to encourage the next generation of girls to think about the internet as a career opportunity.” Her gender has in no way held Wojcicki back from excelling — but she sees the path that she took as far too narrow for too many women. “You see a lot of powerful women on the internet,” Wojcicki said, “but I wish there were more. I think the internet really could use a lot more women.” And Wojcicki wants everyone to remember the contributions women have made to technology. “I think people have forgotten the role that early women played in computer science and [the first computer programmer] Ada Lovelace is a great example of that.” Fitbit stock tanks 30% on lousy sales Facebook nears 2 billion users Related Posts New Jersey retirees won’t get pension increases Why China’s Tencent wants to own Beyonce online Opening Day victory: Oil and stocks soar Mark Cuban says Apple should ban Twitter Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Blog :  On-Premises Can Be Just as Effective as On-Cloud Article :  IT Business Edge 2016 Editorial Calendar Gen-Z Consortium Preps High-Speed Memory Interconnect Mike Vizard |   IT Unmasked   |   Posted 02 Nov, 2016          |         |     Share 9 Rules for Digital Transformation in the Enterprise Sometime shortly after the turn of this decade, IT organizations should witness the arrival of servers capable of maximizing a new generation of high-speed nonvolatile memory that is supposed to begin arriving next year. A Gen-Z Consortium formed by AMD, ARM, Cavium Inc., Cray, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Huawei, IBM, IDT, Lenovo, Mellanox Technologies, Micron, Microsemi, Red Hat, Samsung, Seagate, SK hynix, Western Digital Corporation, and Xilinx is working on a new high-speed interconnect based on a specification due out later this year. Gen-Z Consortium president Kurtis Bowman, who is also the director of server solutions in the office of the CTO at Dell EMC, says that specification will then be used to create a new open memory interconnect in the form of a proof-of-concept in 2017. Production of the new memory connect would then move forward in 2018, resulting in servers using that memory bus most likely arriving by 2020, says Bowman. Capable of supporting several hundred GB/s of bandwidth to provide access to sub-100 nanosecond memory such as the 3D X Point memory technology that Intel and Micron are developing, the memory interconnect technology being proposed by the Gen-Z consortium is at the very least intriguing because it provides a crucial missing piece in the quest to shrink the data center. As more primary storage moves into the memory, the overall density of the data center environment can increase dramatically because both the number of physical servers and storage devices can theoretically be sharply reduced. Bowman says the new memory interconnect will be designed to support both multiple types of processors and nonvolatile memory. Of course, that may also account for why Intel has not yet elected to join the effort. Given its investment in 3D X Point, it’s probable that Intel is investing in developing its own advanced memory interconnect technology. Intel is also absent from an OpenCAPI Consortium that has pledged to develop open interfaces by 2017 that more tightly couple different classes of co-processors with main CPUs. That effort is being led by AMD, Dell EMC, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Mellanox Technologies, Micron, NVIDIA and Xilinx. The one thing that everybody does seem to agree on is that multicore processors and advanced forms of nonvolatile memory will soon transform IT. “Faster memory connects will turn on the innovation ignition,” says Ron Noblett, vice president of advanced architecture development in the CTO Organization of HPE. “The amount of memory available per core today is actually less than it was in 2003.” Whatever form that innovation takes, the one thing IT organizations can count on is that the data center as a whole will not only be a lot smaller in terms of space and energy consumed than today; it will also provide orders of magnitude more performance.          |         |     Share Add Comment      Leave a comment on this blog post Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment!

DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Twitter Facebook Instagram Google+ RSS Feed DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Cloud How DreamHost Builds Its Cloud: The Future November 2, 2016 Written by Luke Odom This is the seventh and last in a series of posts about how DreamHost builds its Cloud products. Written by Luke Odom straight from the data center operations.  Welcome to the last post in the “building a cloud” series! In this post, we’re going to look at where we are going next. Technology is always moving forward. Processors, hard drives, memory, and networking technologies are ever-evolving and getting faster, smaller, and more power efficient. Now that the cluster is designed and implemented, we are constantly looking at ways we can improve both the current cluster and future clusters. Here are a few upgrades you might see coming to DreamCompute soon! Since the release of our new DreamCompute cluster, Intel has released a new generation of their x5-2600 processors. The new Broadwell processors are an upgrade of the Haswell processors we currently deployed—but with smaller transistors, giving us the same amount of power but with less wattage and less heat output. AMD Zen is also expected out this year. Zen is a significant update from the server chips currently sold by AMD, which were released in 2012. We will be keeping a close eye on Zen and may consider it for DreamCompute if the price and performance is right. On the drive side, NVMe drive prices are rapidly going down and will be on par with SATA drives soon. As soon as prices drop sufficiently, we will move to NVMe as it’s a more optimal SSD interface than SATA or SAS. Based on the current market, we expect to be moving to NVMe some time next year. However, many of our SSD vendors are already phasing out Enterprise SATA SSDs and replacing the models with NVMe so the transition may be much sooner. With faster processors and faster NVMe drives, we would need to consider using a faster networking technology to connect the machines. The next bump in speed would be to move to 40 Gbps. There is a standard for fiber, Twinax, and ethernet that is 40 Gbps, but there is only fiber and twinax widely available on the market. The final thing we are looking at to improve DreamCompute—expansion to other locations. Having availability in our Portland facility will probably be our next step. After that, it will depend on where the most customer demand is. We’ve now come to the end of the “building a cloud” series of blog posts.

FILE PHOTO , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By FROM REGISTER NEWS SERVICE REPORTS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Chipmaker Broadcom is buying Brocade in a deal valued at approximately $5.5 billion. Brocade shareholders will receive $12.75 per share, a 13 percent premium to the Tuesday closing prices of the computer networking company. The deal, which also also includes $400 million in debt, comes less than a year after Broadcom Ltd. Chief Executive Hock Tan, then CEO of Avago Technologies Ltd., closed on the chipmaker’s more than $30 billion purchase of Irvine-based Broadcom. Tan has orchestrated at least six transactions valued at more than $100 million over the past five years. Only semiconductor heavyweights like Intel Corp. have been more active on the M&A front, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This probably won’t be the last deal we see from Broadcom, now based in San Jose, and its CEO. On a conference call to discuss the Brocade deal, he said he doesn't think the company has reached a point where it says it’s done with deals and it can be flexible about addressing opportunities when they show up. Broadcom Ltd. plans to sell Brocade’s IP Networking business, which includes wireless and campus networking, data center switching and routing and software networking solutions. Brocade CEO Lloyd Carney said the company will work with Broadcom to try to find a buyer for the IP Networking business. The deal, targeted to close in the second half of Broadcom’s fiscal 2017, is not conditioned on the sale of the IP Networking business.

The great plan to crush oil prices, secure their own market share, kill U.S. shale production, and force OPEC members in line has been a complete failure. The only thing they've managed to get right is the "crush prices" part. They've certainly not killed the U.S. shale industry. Hurt it, yes. Something like 80 U.S. oil companies have gone out of business. But the oil is still there and will get pumped by stronger hands.  How did they miss the fact that Permian Basin oil is profitable around $30 a barrel? I don't know, seems like a pretty significant oversight.  To be fair, I'll grant that the Saudis may have gained a couple points of market share. But at what cost? You can't make up the lost revenue on volume. They're pumping as much as they can. And they've blown a massive hole in their budget. Deficits were $98 billion last year, and should be around $87 billion this year. Plus, they've had to spend $170 billion of their savings, roughly 23%. And debt to GDP has gone from 2% in 2013 to around 20% today. There's just no way you can look at those numbers and not think "disaster." But the funniest part to me has been the whole production cut fiasco that the Saudis have tried to orchestrate. It definitely looks like a face-saving move to me. The Saudis want prices higher, but they don't want to admit that they made a mistake. If anything, the Saudis have lost power in OPEC, not gained it. Eye for an Eye It was assumed that Saudi Arabia wanted to put the squeeze on Iran when they boosted production and cut prices. Iran was just about to re-enter the global oil market, and the Saudi didn't want them suddenly flush with cash. In addition to Iran, the Saudis screwed over every OPEC member. Look at Venezuela. Sure, it's never had a healthy economy. But today it's on the brink of total collapse. And it's the Saudis' oil policy that pushed it over the edge.  So now, the Saudis want to throw OPEC a bone and get oil production in line and prices higher. Only other OPEC countries don't want to play ball. In a perfect act of retribution, both Iran and Iraq want production cut exemptions. They are both basically saying, "You want prices higher, you cut production." Iraq has been steadily raising its production to pre-war levels. That extra production is a bit like gravy. For Iran, it's all gravy, because they haven't been able to sell oil at all. Talk about a miscalculation — it might be true that both Iran and Iraq are better able to deal with low oil prices than the Saudis! Pride is now at play in the OPEC production cut dealings. So I have no doubt that more article-worthy material is on the way.  The Best Free Investment You'll Ever Make Stay on top of the hottest investment ideas before they hit Wall Street.

You know I like to write "digest" style articles, hitting a few different topics in one article. Well, here goes... ****Keep on semiconductor stocks. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) bought out Avago earlier this year, and now the powerhouse is taking out Brocade (NASDAQ: BRCD). Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) just announced a $110 buyout price for NXP Semi (NASDAQ: NXPI). NXP does near-field communications (NFC), chips that broadcast in a small range. These are the chips that just appeared on credit and debit cards. NFC will also be very important when the Internet of Things (IoT) really gets going.  It makes me wonder what Intel is doing. It is missing the mobile communications chip boom in a big way. And as cars go automated, this a huge opportunity that Intel is also behind on. So, keep an eye on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia has a lot of potential in the driverless car space. That's why it keeps hitting new highs.  Also, Cypress Semi (NASDAQ: CY) has been getting some buyout interest around $14. It's at $10 now and pays a 4.4% dividend.  ****My election barometer stock Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD) just threw a curveball. I've been watching it because it's a biotech, and biotechs have been in the crapper since presidential hopeful Clinton attacked drug pricing. Investors worry that Clinton will try to reel in prices, hurting biotech profits. I've theorized that strength in biotech/Gilead suggests that investors are now comfortable that valuations are in line with the worst that a potential Clinton presidency could do.  But Gilead missed earnings last night. The stock is down, and it may be losing its usefulness. Still, I'm watching the $73 level. If that holds, we may see some more upside action for biotech. ****Q3 GDP came in looking good at 2.9%. But don't forget, health care spending is included in this. So as we spend more and more on insurance, GDP improves. But real spending on stuff that we want isn't improving. This might not be widely understood by the general population, but it's an issue for the stock market. In fact, it might be the biggest issue for the long term. Consumer spending is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. You just don't want to see discretionary dollars being diverted to things like health insurance premiums. ****Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR) business is actually improving. Last week, the company beat earnings expectations and grew monthly user numbers. Not by much, mind you, but anything is good at this point. I don't know if you use Twitter, but as an investor, you should. The traders, money managers, and analysts that share their work on Twitter are top-notch. It's a really great and useful community. And it looks like Twitter management has figured this out... I understand that it is going after Yahoo! Finance, with soon-to-be-released stocks charts and other stuff. My experience of Twitter management is that they haven't been very responsive to what their users want. This move would mark a change in that attitude. I know I've recommended Twitter stock higher than it is now, but I'll say it again: around $18, it looks pretty good. And if you want to follow me on Twitter, here's where you can.

According to the New York Times, chipmaker Broadcom has agreed to snap up Brocade Communications Systems, which makes routers and other networking gear, for a reported $5.5 billion. Broadcom makes computer chips for a long list of tech heavyweights, including Intel and Apple. Broadcom itself was bought up by Avago in 2015, and Avago then changed its name to Broadcom. This latest deal comes among a flurry of mergers: Qualcomm just bought chipmaker NXP for $38 billion last week, right after NXP merged with Freescale Semiconductor in a $12 billion deal, and Japan’s Softbank shocked the tech world this past summer by snapping up British chipmaker ARM for $32 billion. What’s driving all the dealmaking? Analysts say the rise of the “internet of things” is helping to fuel chip demand, because all those “smarty things” – which eventually, will be every “thing” – will all need little computer chip brains. And that’s a lot of chips. Why stick with 7 when 10 is such a 10? Microsoft is pushing users to upgrade to Windows 10, and they just made the decision easier by announcing they will no longer sell Windows 7 Pro and 8.1 to PC system builders. Halloween marked the cutoff date for Win7 Pro and 8.1, while no cutoff date has been specified for Windows 10. That might seem obvious, but Microsoft has said that Windows 10 will be the “last” version of Windows they’ll make. Whether that means the next Microsoft PC OS will be a clean-sheet effort not called Windows, or Windows 10 will become an endlessly evolving platform, sort of like Apple has done with MacOS, remains to be seen. But for the moment, if you’re still hanging on to that dusty copy of Windows 7 Pro, you might want to just concede and pull the trigger on Redmond’s latest and greatest. Adobe’s Sensei A.I. won’t tell you to sweep the leg With A.I. being the hot topic in cutting edge tech, it might surprise you to learn about some unlikely places it’s popping up. Case in point: Adobe and their AI tech, called Sensei. The maker of industry standard software including Photoshop and Premiere says future updates will include help from Sensei that will streamline tedious tasks and make advanced operations, such as cleanly altering facial features, easier to accomplish. So when will Sensei arrive in a Creative Cloud update? Adobe says its already present in some tools in the current versions of Photoshop and Premiere, and will be coming to more apps soon. Adobe is expected to give a big demo showing Sensei being used in Photoshop next week, and we’ll be watching closely, especially when its used in a feature called “Face Aware Liquify.”

While Lenovo did just recently release the Miix 510, an upgraded successor to last year’s Miix 700, WinFuture reports that the upcoming Miix 720 will offer further improved specs. Specifically, the 12-inch is getting a higher-resolution 2880 x 1920 screen, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to a 1TB SSD. And even more importantly, Lenovo is also updating the processor options to Intel’s latest seventh-generation i3, i5, and i7 Kaby Lake models. the Miix 720 charges via USB-C, but keeps two legacy USB ports WinFuture also claims that the Miix 720 will update its port selection, joining the Miix 510 in adding a USB-C port (that’s also used to charge the device). Unlike other recent laptops, like Apple’s MacBook and new MacBook Pro models, the Miix 720 will also offer two legacy USB ports. And similar to the earlier Miix and Yoga models, Lenovo is keeping its signature watchband hinge on the kickstand. We still don’t know when the Miix 720 will release, or how much it will cost, but with this much information already leaked out, it probably won’t be too long before an official unveiling from Lenovo.

How Apple blew the MacBook name game CNET 11/2/2016 Sean Hollister © Provided by CNETJames Martin/CNET, edited by Kelly Nelson/CNET Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. One word could have made all the difference. Popular Searches Audi AG AUDVF ▼ 656.20 -11.30 -1.69% Dick's Sporting Goods Inc DKS ▼ 56.71 -4.18 -6.86% International Business Machines Corp IBM ▲ 158.67 +0.46 +0.29% LGL Group Inc LGL ▲ 4.49 +0.18 +4.28% "Air," instead of "Pro."  If Apple had introduced a new MacBook Air last week, the company wouldn't be facing down a mob of angry creative professionals. It might not have Apple software developers questioning whether the company has lost its way. Because the new MacBook Pro basically is a MacBook Air -- the most impressive Air ever made. Let's rewind time for a moment. It's Thursday, October 27, and Apple's event is under way. Imagine that instead of introducing the new MacBook Pro, Apple unveiled a new MacBook Air. One that's 12 percent lighter, 13 percent smaller by volume and practically the same weight -- but manages to cram in a faster Intel processor, faster graphics, plus the far sharper, brighter and more colorful Retina Display the MacBook Air so desperately needed. Sure, it starts at $1,500 rather than $1,000, but you get twice the solid-state storage for the price -- and you can double the RAM, quadruple the storage and get the awesome new Touch Bar secondary screen with Touch ID fingerprint sensor if you're willing to pay even more. How long has your MacBook Air had a 1.6GHz processor? This new one is 2.0GHz or 2.9GHz; there's even a 3.3GHz option. And sure, it's got a thinner keyboard and only two (or four) general-purpose Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of handy full-size USB ports and SD card slots. But we, Apple, figured you'd rather have a more accurate keyboard and amazing single-cable Thunderbolt 3 docking options to go with your mobile MacBook Air lifestyle. Now, you can pull your MacBook Air right out of your manila envelope and plug in a single cable to charge it, dock with your peripherals and power multiple monitors all at the same time. Oh, and one more thing: we knew you'd like the MacBook Air so much, we built a 15-inch model. You won't believe how fast it is -- this Air has a quad-core CPU that's 50 percent faster than last year's MacBook Pro! The graphics are over twice as fast, and yet we've kept the same 10 hour battery life as the 13-inch version. If you've ever wanted to edit photos or home videos on a MacBook Air, this computer's for you. Oh, and it comes standard with the Touch Bar and Touch ID, too. We think you're going to love the new MacBook Air. It's the best MacBook we've ever made. Everything I just said is true of Apple's new laptops. But all of it describes the new MacBook Pro, not the MacBook Air. Apple chose to market a thinner Pro instead of a faster Air, even though they're basically the same thing. And that's not lost on Apple -- it was Apple marketing VP Phil Schiller who suggested the 13-inch MacBook Pro (the one without the Touch Bar) was designed for MacBook Air buyers. (That's him in the pictures above.) "We think that a lot of potential MacBook Air customers are going to be very excited by this product, too," said Schiller. But the choice between a thinner Pro and a faster Air isn't just semantics -- the word "Pro" carries weight. The new MacBook Pro is not for pros, and pros know it. That one word could cost Apple an awful lot of customers.

Staples announced today to release the Staples Black Friday 2016 ad through their shopping app on November 6. The Staples Black Friday 2016 deals will be available on online starting Thanksgiving Day. Stores are closed on Thanksgiving Day as previously announced by the office supply retailer.

We have to wait to find out which model the laptop is and its other specifications. The Staples Black Friday 2016 sale will begin online on Thanksgiving Day. This concept of Black Friday is a sane way, but many of the large retailer stick to their plans of also opening stores on Thanksgiving Day.  The releasing of Black Friday ads through shopping apps is getting more common.

We thought Apple would conclude the wait with a laptop that would last with us for years, but instead we got a transitional device that bridges the perpetual gap between present and future with the metal corpses of (almost) every useful port we now use and rely on. Apple’s position is clear: you either sign up for its vision of wireless and USB-C communications dominating everything, or you go elsewhere. For those adventurous MacBook users who are now finding themselves more open to exploring Windows waters, here’s a quick rundown of the top alternatives to Apple’s new, port-less MacBook Pro. Dell XPS 13 Dell This laptop is the most obvious and direct alternative to the MacBook Pro. Dell’s 13-inch XPS 13 has a wonderfully minimal bezel around the display, a great keyboard, good trackpad, solid construction, and attractive design. Its battery life stretches up to 10 hours and it has recently been upgraded with Intel’s 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) processors, a generation ahead of Apple’s latest MacBook Pros. Handsome, affordable, and a proven design that won’t spring any surprises: there’s very little wrong about the Dell XPS 13. It can be had with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and that lovely gold shell above for $1,199. To get it with a high-resolution (3,200 x 1,800) touchscreen display, you’d have to step up to $1,449, but that’s still $50 less than the MBP and it manages to fit an SD card reader and two regular USB ports alongside the Thunderbolt 3 connector. Razer Blade Stealth Razer This one, I’m less confident about, but it sure is a stunning piece of machinery, isn’t it? Razer’s 12.5-inch Blade Stealth is the gaming gear maker’s first ultrabook, and it does the whole aluminum unibody thing in a gorgeous matte black highlighted by the company’s signature Chroma keyboard backlighting. You can have it with a Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) display, a Kaby Lake CPU, 256GB of storage, regular USB and a Thunderbolt 3-capable USB-C for $1,250. Now, granted, the Blade Stealth is kind of in a funny position with its own lack of an SD card slot, and its battery life won’t rival the MacBook Pro’s, but Razer’s secret weapon with this laptop is the ability to plug it into the company’s Core box. For another $400, the Core lets you hook up a full desktop graphics card to the Blade Stealth, which raises it gaming ceiling exponentially, lending this laptop a unique advantage that many in its category lack. HP Spectre x360 Props to my colleague Dan Seifert for calling this one out as a very attractive escape route for dissatisfied MacBook users. HP’s newly updated 13-inch Spectre x360 has an edge-to-edge display much like Dell’s XPS 13, but it also has a fully rotating hinge like Lenovo’s Yogas. It’s got a quad-speaker array, and HP makes some terrific claims about it lasting up to 15 hours on a single charge — even if it only achieves two-thirds of that claim, it seems likely to be able to keep you productive through a whole day’s work. At 2.85lbs (1.29kg), the 13.3-inch HP Spectre x360 is lighter than Apple’s corresponding new MacBook Pro. It also has two USB-C ports, but HP doesn’t forget to include a regular USB one "for added flexibility." Alas, this super thin and light computer does lack an SD card slot, so you’d have to go to the 4lbs (1.81kg), 15-inch model to have that photographer-favored port. Still, with prices starting at $1,159, there’s a lot of headroom to max out a Spectre x360’s spec before reaching even the entry-level MacBook Pro’s cost. Worth considering. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga I saw this laptop at IFA 2016, and The Verge’s Tom Warren reviewed it very recently. Our shared conclusion? The ThinkPad X1 Yoga has a couple of foibles, but its OLED display is easily among the very best we’ve seen on a laptop. Spanning a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 and including touch capabilities, it’s pretty close to our ideal laptop display. Being a Yoga laptop also means this one can rotate a full 360-degrees, which doesn’t matter on a daily basis but is a nice extra to have. Apple’s MacBooks have always opened to just a little bit past vertical, which can be problematic when they’re used in bed or in any other circumstances that are less than ideal. Now, buying into this OLED futurism isn’t cheap, and the ThinkPad X1 Yoga with OLED starts at $1,682 right now, but I’d say this is a much more enticing use of the technology than Apple’s thin strip of it above the keyboard (aka the Touch Bar). Microsoft Surface Book Well, it couldn’t be a roundup of the best Windows computers without one from Microsoft, now could it? The newly refreshed Surface Book has more of everything: more power, longer battery life, and a higher price. Kicking off at a mighty $2,399, this 13.5-inch laptop includes a stylus and a touchscreen along with an SD card slot and some trusty old USB ports. The display is detachable from the base, and there’s a discrete Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics chip to amp things up. The biggest advantage of this upgraded Surface Book is Microsoft’s claimed 16 hours of battery life, which is an extraordinarily long endurance by any laptop category’s standards. And it doesn’t weigh all that much, either, at 3.63lbs (1.65kg). As its screen size, weight, and price suggest, the Surface Book sits somewhere between Apple’s 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models, but it offers plenty of functionality (and ports) that Apple’s new computers lack.

Richard Florida @Richard_Florida Nov 1, 2016 Comments Share on Facebook Tweet LEGO statues for the South by South Lawn Festival of ideas, arts, and action are seen at the White House in Washington. (Gary Cameron/Reuters) In today’s knowledge economy, science and technology are prerequisites for economic success. But which states are America’s science and technology leaders? A new report, the State Technology and Science Index, from Ross DeVol and his colleagues at the Milken Institute, illuminates the great divide separating America’s leading and lagging states, ranking all 50 of them on an updated State Technology and Science Index (STSI) based on dozens of indicators spanning five broad categories: research and development, entrepreneurship and risk capital, human capital, the scientific and technological workforce, and the concentration and dynamism of high-tech industries. (Taylor Blake) The map above by Taylor Blake of the Martin Prosperity Institute shows the broad pattern. The leading states, in deep purple, are mainly in the Northeast and West Coast, with Minnesota, Utah, Colorado, and Texas also scoring highly. The table below lists the top ten states on the STSI. Massachusetts tops the list, followed by Colorado, Maryland, California, and Washington. Connecticut, Minnesota, Utah, Virginia, and Delaware complete the top 10. There has been some shuffling of positions on the list, as the table shows. Rank State STSI Previous Rank 1 Massachusetts 83.67 1 2 Colorado 80.40 4 3 Maryland 80.31 2 4 California 75.94 3 5 Washington 71.84 6 6 Connecticut 71.05 9 7 Minnesota 69.58 12 8 Utah 69.14 5 9 Virginia 65.88 7 10 Delaware 65.38 10 The next map shows the change in position of states from 2014 to 2016. Wyoming saw the biggest improvement, rising ten spots from 46th to 36th, while New York and Vermont saw the largest declines, the former falling from seventh to 15th, the latter declining from 18th to 26th. (Taylor Blake) The study finds a close association between a state’s technology and scientific capability as measured by the STSI and a state’s economic success. The chart below shows the association between real high-tech economic output per capita and the STSI Index across the 50 states. The report points out that overall the STSI predicts about 75 percent of the variance in real high-tech GDP per worker. And once the study factors out the outlier effects of Oregon and Washington, whose tech economies are driven largely by two companies, Intel and Microsoft, respectively, the explanatory power gets closer to 90 percent. (Milken Institute) So what kinds of states do better in science and technology? There are certain basic characteristics that distinguish more technologically and scientifically innovative states from those that are less so. To get at this, my colleague Charlotta Mellander ran a basic correlation analysis between the Milken Institute’s STSI measure and key economic, demographic and political characteristics of the 50 U.S. states. Economists have long argued that science and technology are generators of wealth. So it’s not surprising to see that states with higher scores on the STSI are also wealthier. The STSI is positively associated with wages (0.77), income (0.61), and economic output per capita (.49). More educated states also do better on science and technology. There is an even closer connection between the STSI and the share of adults who are college grads (.84). More innovative states are not only more affluent and educated, they are healthier and fitter as well. The STSI is positively associated with both overall well-being (.48) and the share of the population that engages in regular exercise (.59). That said, these same states are also more expensive to live in; the STSI is higher in states with more expensive housing (with a correlation of .49). The kind of work people do factors in as well. The STSI is highly correlated with the share of the workforce who make up knowledge, professional, and creative workers (.80), and negatively associated with the share that are members of the blue-collar working class (-.59). The reality is that some kinds of creative and innovative work are more highly connected to the science and technology capabilities of states than others. It’s not surprising to see that states with greater concentrations of computer scientists and mathematicians are more innovative (with a correlation of .83), as these are the kinds of occupations required to staff science and technology organizations. The STSI is also closely associated with the share of business and finance occupations (.80) and engineering and architecture occupations (.57). What is perhaps more surprising is the close connection between the arts and the scientific and technological capabilities of states. Indeed, the STSI is more closely associated with the share of workers in arts, culture and entertainment occupations (.53) than it is with the share of the workforce that is comprised of scientists (.41). Many states have invested in educational and medical institutions, so-called “eds and meds,” as a way to build up their high-tech capabilities and spur economic development. But, we find no statistical association whatsoever between the STSI and the share of workers in eds and meds occupations. Another thing that matters is openness to diversity. I’ve long argued that innovation turns on tolerance and diversity. Scientists and technologists come from all backgrounds and ways of life. Many are immigrants. Openness to diversity is a feature that enables places to attract top scientific and technical talent across the aboard. The STSI is positively associated with both the share of the population that is foreign-born (.45) and the share that identify as LGBT (.40). Urbanization plays a role too. Urbanists have long argued that innovation requires density. More urbanized states are also more innovative. The STSI is positively associated with the share of a state’s population that lives in urban areas (.55) and negatively associated with the share that drives alone to work, a proxy measure for sprawl (-.30). This stands in contrast to the older notion that innovation and high-tech industries grow up in suburban office parks and nerdistans like those of California’s Silicon Valley or in the suburbs along Route 128 outside Boston. Indeed, my own research has found high-tech startups coming back in large numbers to urban centers in order to attract talent. Innovation at the state level also reflects America’s long running political and cultural divides. Liberal, blue states are more innovative than conservative, red ones. The STSI is positively associated with the share of voters who voted for Obama (.48) and who currently favor Hillary Clinton (.56). They’re negatively associated with the share of voters who voted for Romney (-.48) and favor Trump (-.64). The sociologist Max Weber long ago argued that the growth and development of Western nations was tied to their “Protestant work ethic.” But today religiosity appears to be a fetter on innovation. The correlation between the STSI and religiosity, measured as the percent of the population who say they are “very religious,” is negative (-.40). More innovative states are also more highly taxed states, with the STSI being positively correlated with state income taxes per capita (.45). Building a state knowledge economy which requires public funding for universities and research institutes. Spending for urban infrastructure is another expensive investment, but one that ultimately pays off in the form of greater scientific and technological capability as well as higher wages and incomes. Ultimately, the science and technology capabilities of states not only reflect, but underpin America’s underlying economic, political, and cultural divides. Our most technologically advanced states are bluer, denser, more expensive, more diverse and richer, while those that lag in science and technology are redder, more working class, and falling further behind in the knowledge economy.

News & Analysis Anticipating a More Virtual Moores Law Alan Patterson 11/2/2016 00:00 AM EDT 5 comments 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet TAIPEI — Nicky Lu, executive director of the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association, is looking forward to the coming era of a “virtual” Moore’s Law, leading to a resumption of growth and profitability in the chip industry. Nicky Lu “There will be another 30 years of growth for the semiconductor industry,” Lu predicted in an interview with EE Times. “We are going to see ‘effective’ 1nm. Moore’s Law will become a ‘virtual’ Moore’s Law. The industry needs a boost. From 1995 to 2008, the sector delivered a 7 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and a total return to shareholders nearly three times that of the overall stock market, management consultancy McKinsey notes in a 2015 report. Now, the story is much different. Although some semiconductor players continue to thrive and gobble up smaller competitors, overall growth and revenue have declined. The semiconductor industry can break out of stagnation at around $400 billion in annual revenue to achieve $1 trillion at 1nm, according to Lu. In his paper entitled “A New Silicon Way” that will be presented at the IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference on November 7 in Toyama, Japan, Lu outlines a transition to a new generation beyond the limitations of traditional linear scaling on silicon. There is evidence that linear scaling has already reached its physical limits. “People say they are doing 10nm process modes, but you will not find any line widths at that level,” Lu says. Departing Flatland That’s why technology development has gone non-linear. In 2011, Intel announced its Tri-gate technology, leading the way from planar development of transistors on silicon into three dimensions. With 3D, even scaling by a factor of 0.85 results in a transistor density that is more like 0.5 scaling in two dimensions, Lu says. Other companies have followed that trend. Toshiba built 3D NAND in 48 layers, and that memory has been used in Apple’s iPhone 7. Samsung has taken the idea a step further with the creation of a 64-layer flash memory device. The technology level was only 32nm, yet it was the virtual equivalent of 13nm, Lu notes. “Now we are in silicon age 2.0 with vertical transistors and a scaling parameter of 0.8 to 0.85,” Lu says. “Silicon 3.0 is like a 3D landscape. We are seeing more and more people going there.” Lu says that his theory, as described in his paper, starts with Silicon 4.0. The advances from the current 3.0 generation have enabled a lot of new applications such as augmented reality, virtual reality and machine intelligence, he says. The next threshold is what Lu calls heterogeneous integration, or the incorporation of silicon and non-silicon materials by means of technologies such as integrated fan out (InFO). To InFO and Beyond InFO is a packaging technology developed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to put bonding pads on the edge of silicon, eliminating the need for a interconnecting substrate. InFO provides a 20% reduction in package thickness, a 20% speed gain and 10% better thermal performance. Infineon developed the technology in 2008 as embedded wafer-level ball grid array (eWLB,) to cut cost and package thickness while boosting component integration. However, yield problems impeded adoption of the new technology up until TSMC’s commercialization of InFO. (Source: TSMC) “This new InFO structure is what will lead heterogeneous integration to Silicon 4.0,” Lu says. “Another innovation is through interconnect via (TIV), which is like a pillar connecting the die to the outside. So you have both horizontal and vertical interconnect, both outside the silicon. That’s key for the continuation of heterogeneous integration. In the past, we couldn’t do TIV because we didn’t have InFO technology.” With InFO, silicon will connect directly with parts such as lenses, sensors or actuators that are currently built into systems and haven’t yet been miniaturized, according to Lu. “That’s heterogeneous integration of silicon and non-silicon using InFO,” Lu says. “All of these parts today are sitting on a printed circuit board, burning a lot of power. We are still five orders of magnitude away from optimal power consumption.” That’s where Lu sees new potential for foundries, silicon designers and system houses to cooperate. Silicon is a $300 billion industry, but consumer electronics is a $1.6 trillion industry, he notes. System makers will need heterogenous integration to create smaller devices with lower power consumption, according to Lu.  “There should be a very smooth transition to these new technologies because we are still two generations away from the end of Moore’s Law,” Lu says. “Tri-gate, 3D NAND and InFO have come very smoothly. Silicon will scale down to 5nm with performance like 1nm.” Email This Print Comment More Related Links Chip Veterans Scan Horizon Electronica: CEO Forum Rambles on IoT Security, Safety Chip Forecast Rises Through 2017 ASML Invests $1.9B in Next-Gen EUV U.S. Needs Big Bet on Chips Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author scaling apaDAV   11/8/2016 1:10:15 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate If we did scale every dimension by a factor of 0.85 every generation, that would be 0.7225 in area. To achieve twice as many transistors we would also have to add 44.5% more transistor layers every generation or double their number every two generations. As of now I am not aware of any logic with more than one layer of transistors. The issue of power density is not solved but compounded, now you have to cool more more devices per area. The other option would be to add a new technology every few nodes, that make up for the lack of scaling. Sounds unrealistic to me.

Answering that question, the term 'virtual' is sometimes thrown about these days with little real consideration to its meaning in the term of software and electronic hardware systems. And marrying this oft misused term of virtual in a statement about Moore's Law makes those of us who appreciate precision in language wonder about the quality of that following argument.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Nov 2, 2016 at 10:31AM Image source: NVIDIA. With their stocks soaring in the last year, it's been an incredible time to be a shareholder of semiconductor stocks NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). AMD data by YCharts. To see which stock looks like the better buy going forward, though, let's examine AMD's and NVIDIA's stock histories, the financial trends underpinning their recent rises, and the long-term outlook for their respective businesses to see which stock remains the better buy today. Advanced Micro Devices' investment thesis WIth the stock tripling in the past 12 months alone, investors clearly see a major opportunity ahead for AMD. As longtime second fiddles to rival Intel in the PC CPU market, AMD and NVIDIA have benefited mightily from a resurgence of interest in graphics-intensive computing in a number of markets. Specifically, AMD's move deeper into semi-custom graphics chips that ship into video game consoles has proven to be a boon for the company of late. Case in point: Revenue from its semi-custom chip segment increased about 5% in AMD's most recent quarter. However, I'm not so sure the rally in AMD stock can sustain itself. Looking to the bigger picture, several red flags emerge in AMD's business model that could conceivably reverse the recent GPU market share gains it has achieved. For starters, there is increasing competition in graphics chips, since NVIDIA -- traditionally the high-end vendor in the GPU market -- recently launched its GeForce GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti chips. These chips target the lower-cost segment of the market where AMD has recently been able to eke out some market share gain. The company's balance sheet isn't particularly impressive, either. AMD carries about $3.3 billion in total assets, compared to $2 billion in long-term debt. This isn't an acute issue, but interest payments on its debts do create one more headwind for a company still struggling to switch to profitability -- which is by no means the case for NVIDIA . Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA's investment thesis NVIDIA shares many of the same opportunities as AMD, but the company's long-held status as the premier graphics processing chipmaker has allowed it to branch this specialization into a number of emerging growth areas -- and to do so better than its rival. The rise of competitive gaming is one area that few -- myself included -- expected to grow into a major business, but NVIDIA's wares have become the leading chip for the professional gaming industry, which favors the computing power of PCs over consoles. Self-driving cars also serve as another emerging source of significant opportunity for NVIDIA, since they use many external sensors to gauge their surroundings and behave accordingly. Strange as it may sound, discerning in real time whether the object next to it is a person riding a bike or a car requires a tremendous amount of graphics processing power, for which NVIDIA has also created a series of turnkey solutions. NVIDIA enjoys a similar opportunity in big data and AI visualization, but by now, hopefully you see a trend. The general direction of computing and technology is toward more graphics-intensive activities, and NVIDIA stands to be the beneficiary of this movement, perhaps more than any other company. Equally compelling is the fact that NVIDIA is also profitable and enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its 47 times P/E ratio makes the company about twice as expensive as the broader market. However, given the generational nature of some of NVIDIA's opportunities, the company could easily outgrow that valuation for investors willing to hold its stock over the long term. Better buy: NVIDIA Hopefully, the likely winner in this scenario is abundantly clear. NVIDIA has the better business model, technological leadership, and a stronger balance sheet, and it has already achieved profitability. What's more, NVIDIA's move into some areas that have driven AMD's recent success threatens to derail AMD's growth story before the company can flip to profitability. Here, the conclusion is obvious. NVIDIA is the better semiconductor stock for investors to buy today. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Nvidia.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung who Supplies new OLED for 'Touch Bar' Hints that Apple may Expand OLED to Main Display | Main | Xiaomi's New 'Mi Mix' Premium Smartphone is out to steal the Industrial Design Spotlight away from Apple » November 02, 2016 Acer sees Apple's High MacBook Pro Pricing Knocking them out of the Top Five PC Vendors Worldwide for Q4   Last month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple the only Major PC Company to have Negative Shipments in the U.S. and Worldwide for Q3." The thinking was that once Apple updated their PC line-up sales would rebound and Apple's standing in the PC market would once again rise. The problem is that Apple only updated their MacBook Pro with updates to Mac desktops being delayed to sometime in the first half of 2017 when Intel finally releases their 7th generation Core processors. Secondly, the MacBook Pro is more expensive than expected and for countries outside the US, such as Canada and the UK, the MacBook Pro is out of reach for most because of the strong U.S. dollar. Macworld noted today in their review of the MacBook Pro that two things stood out. "The Touch Bar looks lovely and, ouch, the price tag is steep." Yesterday Acer unveiled their new notebook line-up and basically thanked Apple for their steep price that would help them in the market over the holidays.   In Q3 IDC's report showed Apple in fourth spot for Q3 2016 while Gartner's report showed Apple in fifth spot with Acer a hair under Apple in sixth spot. Acer said that Apple's high MacBook Pro pricing opened the door for them to return to the the fifth spot for Q4 worldwide.   It was reported today in Taiwan that "A senior executive at Taiwanese PC maker Acer on Tuesday suggested Apple's pricing strategy for its latest notebooks could benefit the industry's 'Wintel' camp. With the spread of smartphones eating into their sales, PC brands could use the boost."   Dave Lin, president of Acer's Taiwan operations, told reporters during a launch event for his company's own new notebook in Taipei that "Apple's new MacBook Pro is way too expensive -- it's really not affordable for ordinary users."   Acer claims its new Swift 7 notebook, priced at US$1,360, is the world's thinnest laptop in the 13-inch-screen segment. "We aim to overtake Apple and return to be a top-five PC brand [by shipments] next year," Lin confidently said.   Of course by shipment stats alone, that could very well occur, but in terms of profits, Apple will probably crush most PC vendors as always.   In fact, Vincent Chen, head of regional research at Yuanta Investment Consulting, supports this view wholeheartedly by stating that "Apple is trying to focus on the high-end PC and smartphone market. Apple's MacBook Pro is synonymous with Hermes or Chanel in the PC market," Chen said. "Apple no longer wants to compete with any of the low-to-mid priced PCs in the market."   Chen added that "Apple's main strategy has shifted to generate more income from services rather than selling more hardware products."   Jessica Hsu, an analyst at Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute, echoed Chen's view and suggested Apple is not as fixated on market share as other PC makers.   Finally some market analysts are starting to see the value in making money instead of playing the volume game that the likes of IDC and Gartner love to play up as to what makes a leader in any given product category.   Yet with that said, the general opinion thus far on the net is that the MacBook Pro may be worth the price, but customers, especially outside of the U.S, may find it realistically out of reach for this year.     And one more thing: Beyond the price issue, it must be said that there's a lot of anger in the Pro Mac Community. This morning MacRumors posted a report titled "Professional Mac Users' Complaints List Grows After 'Disappointing' Apple Event."   The MacRumors report notes that "Over the weekend evidence mounted of a backlash within sections of the online Mac community in response to Apple's latest announcements. In a blog post on his site titled "New MacBook Pros and the State of the Mac", developer Michael Tsai collated and linked to the most commonly aired grievances. The post has since become a common point of reference in the blogosphere for negative sentiment toward Apple following last week's event."

Fedora 25 Won't Ship With Mesa 13 Or Vulkan Drivers Written by Michael Larabel in Fedora on 2 November 2016 at 08:22 AM EDT. 10 Comments While Fedora 25 is shaping up to be an excellent release, there are two separate but related disappointments: it won't be shipping this month with Mesa 13.0 drivers and also it's not enabling any Vulkan support out-of-the-box. While the Vulkan loader landed in Fedora a while back, the Mesa builds in Fedora are still shipping without the Vulkan support enabled. Mesa 12 is currently used by Fedora 25 and with that release is the Intel ANV Vulkan driver but is disabled at build-time by the packages. Then again, Ubuntu 16.10 doesn't ship Vulkan by default either. Mesa 13.0 was officially released yesterday with big improvements for OpenGL and Vulkan, including the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver. Sadly, Fedora 25 isn't going to be shipping out-of-the-box with Mesa 13.0. Confirmation was posted to this Fedora devel thread. It's likely we will see Mesa 13.0 support ship later on as a F25 stable release update, but that could still take some time. But at least there should be some Copr repository options for those wanting bleeding-edge Mesa with Vulkan on Fedora right now. 10 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Apple Tech Review MacBook Pro review: the Air apparent More power, more portability, more dongles by Vlad Savov Nov 2, 2016, 8:15am EDT share tweet Linkedin If you’re a fan of Apple laptops, I’ve got some good news and some bad news. The good news: Apple has finally updated its Pro laptop line with some genuinely new and powerful options. Even better, the new MacBook Pro has been shrunken down to the degree of serving as the MacBook Air’s spiritual successor, which is what many of us had been hoping for all along. The bad news? Apple isn’t just giving, it’s also taking away. At first blush, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, sans fancy Touch Bar, looks like the perfect replacement for my aged MacBook Air from 2013. It’s the thinnest and lightest Pro ever, and it provides the display and performance upgrades my three-year-old laptop has been in desperate need of. Costing $1,499, it sits right in the middle between Apple’s $1,299 MacBook and the new $1,799 MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and four Thunderbolt ports. It’s like the Air, in that it bridges the gap between Apple’s most portable and most powerful mobile computers, but it does so in an interesting new way. Without the much-ballyhooed additions of Touch Bar interactions and Touch ID on the pricier new MacBook Pro models — which won’t be shipping for weeks — this more basic MBP is essentially the professionalization of the 12-inch MacBook. It’s a bigger and significantly more powerful version of that super-thin machine. More of a pro MacBook than a MacBook Pro. If you wanted a bigger and more powerful MacBook, this is it Why does it feel more like a MacBook? Well, just look at it. The familiar MagSafe charger is gone, retired along with Apple’s SD card reader, HDMI output, and old-school USB ports. This $1,499 MacBook Pro strips connectivity down to just a headphone jack on its right side and two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 on the left. That’s it. You also get the new option to style it out in a handsome space gray and an upgraded version of the MacBook’s super flat butterfly-mechanism keyboard. All of this, along with the solid-state Force Touch trackpad, expresses Apple’s modernized laptop design, whose signature change is the frenzied push of USB-C as the unitary replacement for all the world’s ports. Apple is determined to force the future into existence, and this laptop is just the next logical step. Logical though it may be for Apple, this MacBook Pro presents a dichotomy. Professional video editors and photographers have been waiting for a new Pro laptop — but this midrange MacBook Pro probably isn’t that. Instead, the world’s coffee shops are filled with nomadic professionals seeking an Apple computer to replace the much more ubiquitous, but now dated, MacBook Air. So while Apple has been busy crafting the Pro MacBook, the way it will be received by most people is the way that I’m addressing it today: as a Pro MacBook Air. The MacBook Air kicked off the ultrabook trend among laptops before Intel even coined that term. Its familiar wedge shape has been copied by almost everyone, and it has served as a benchmark for thinness, battery life, and industrial design in its category. But the Air design hasn’t changed in six long years. In the meantime, Lenovo’s Yoga laptops reinvented the hinge, Dell’s XPS 13 reinvented the display, Razer reinvented the keyboard, and Microsoft reconfigured our entire idea of a laptop. The Air once stood alone as an ultra-portable with negligible compromises, but now there’s competition, and the Air has fallen dramatically behind with its anachronistic, washed-out screen. So Apple’s first task is to simply get its slimmest 13-inch laptop back on par with its Windows rivals. And it all starts with the industrial design. Apple’s industrial design remains best-in-class The new MacBook Pro is precision engineering at its absolute finest. Run your finger along the spartan, portless side of this laptop and you won’t detect even a millimeter’s discrepancy between the bottom chassis and the top lid. They are two separate parts, but when the MacBook Pro is closed, they feel like one cohesive, solid slab of aluminum. The final vestiges of plastic on the exterior have been shorn off, replaced by a metal bottom to the display and a sapphire glass Apple logo that no longer lights up. Yes, this is very much the MacBook design scaled up. (One advantage to the new Apple logo is that you’ll no longer see its ghostly presence on your screen when there’s a strong light behind your laptop. That used to frustrate me on sunny days with the Air, and it felt like a distinctly un-Apple-like oversight in the overall design.) The interior of the new MacBook Pro is another spot that will be familiar to MacBook users, but largely foreign to everyone else. The keyboard’s keys seem to have been melted down into millimeter-thick slabs: they’re wider and a little more densely packed than on an Air or earlier Pro models. I found them alien at first, but once I stopped "testing the keyboard" and just started typing naturally, I found my rhythm and was quickly up to full speed — after a while, these larger keys start to feel like big input islands that are hard to miss. Their key travel is a shallow 0.55mm, which won’t be to everyone's taste, but this updated MBP keyboard definitely has a better feel than the practically flat one on the MacBook. The Rolls-Royce of touchpads, offering outsized luxury and unerring operation Apple’s touchpad on this year’s MacBook Pro is something special. It spans the entire height of the wrist rest and half the width. It’s enormous, limousine-sized, and seemingly excessive, but I love it. The vastness of this thing means it’s always within easy reach, and because it’s built using Force Touch — simulating the tactile response of a click without ever moving — I can click the top of it in a way that I can’t do with the mechanical switch of my MacBook Air. I also like this new touchpad for the sheer visual appeal: compared to older versions, it looks like a display that’s had its bezels removed; like cutting-edge, space-maximizing technology. Not being mechanical also means it’ll stay this way for years, whereas my Air’s more conventional trackpad has developed a slight creaking habit. Compared to my MacBook Air, the new Pro has a much smaller footprint, yet feels larger and more accommodating in use. That's mostly thanks to the touchpad, but the larger keys on the keyboard also help. The display’s bezels are vastly thinner and with the stereo speakers sitting either side of the keyboard, Apple has basically left no wasted space on the 13-inch MacBook Pro. There’s even a double-wide Escape key, perhaps to make up for its loss on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. I’m writing this entire review on the 2016 MacBook Pro and I frankly don’t want to go back to typing on my Air. It’s a universally better experience. If you were still harboring reservations about either the flatter keyboard or artificially clicking touchpad of the MacBook, this new MBP is sure to allay them in a hurry. The absolute biggest upgrade for any Air user will be the display. The new Pro’s 2560 x 1600 display is gorgeous, from literally any angle, and it matches the wider color gamut of the latest iPhone 7 models and Apple’s 5K iMac. Even for existing MacBook Pro users, this is a nice step up in contrast and brightness (now 500 nits versus the prior model’s 300), both of which are 67 percent higher. Apple may be killing us softly with all these incremental upgrades, but they really do add up to a supremely well-designed machine. The same wide color gamut as on the 5K iMac and iPhone 7, now on a laptop Beside its great build quality and fantastic display, the new MacBook Pro also performs superbly. I am swiping between desktops and darting in and out of heavy-duty apps like Adobe’s Lightroom and Photoshop with perfect ease and fluidity. The external polish is very much matched by the internal performance, and I struggle to imagine scenarios where anyone would feel constrained by this, the so-called entry-level, Pro laptop. It’s not a cheap computer by any means, so you should expect nothing less, of course. I would go further and say that if you’re not involved in high-volume, high-resolution photo or video processing, you should just stick with the basic 2GHz Core i5 CPU and 8GB of RAM. Anything else would be overkill for most people. Any doubts about why this new MacBook Pro exists while being so similar to the MacBook should really be extinguished by its performance. The Pro has a much more powerful processor and smoother graphics to go along with a significantly improved keyboard and a titanic trackpad. The MacBook is still the better computer to take on a flight with you, but the MacBook Pro approaches its level of portability while offering vastly more power and a longer-lasting battery. Like an artfully carved chess set without a queen, this laptop is lovely but is missing vital pieces It’s at this point that I would have expected to be able to say to Air users that they can stop reading and should just go buy the new MacBook Pro. But Apple’s futurism has expressed itself in less advantageous ways, too. The Cupertino company has both given and taken away. Vjeran Pavic For starters, the SD card slot is gone from the new MacBook Pro. A company that built up its entire product line on the adulation and money of professional photographers is now turning its back on them and blowing up the best bridge between the tools of their trade: camera and laptop. Without an SD card slot in the computer, we’re left having to tote an adapter everywhere ($50 when bought from Apple), or buying a USB-C cable for our cameras ($30), or relying on entirely unreliable wireless transfer apps. Maybe that’s fine on the MacBook, but it’s not okay on the MacBook Pro. Apple’s solution for everything cabled is now a combined Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C port, of which the company provides two on the Touch Bar-deprived MacBook Pro I am reviewing. Is there any technical reason why this computer couldn’t have four, like the $1,799 model with a Touch Bar? Nope, it all comes down to price. Two USB-C ports are still double the number I’d get on a MacBook, but they’re both on the left side of the MBP and are compatible with nothing I own other than, amusingly, my Android phones. The future may be wireless, but the present is full of dongles The cool thing about the pricier MacBook Pros is that they split their USB-C ports evenly, two on each side, and since you can use any one of them to charge, that lets you pick which side to plug the charger into. I’ve always thought that an underrated advantage of Google’s Chromebook Pixel, but in Apple’s world, $1,499 is apparently not enough to unlock ambidextrous convenience. The MacBook Pro does have a headphone jack, unlike the new iPhone 7, but that’s hardly a consolation since buying the two devices together would mean either carrying around two sets of headphones or always having yet another dongle with you. Apple has chosen one unifying port for everything that plugs into the Mac, and it has one unifying port for everything connecting to the iPhone. But the problem is that they’re not the same port. If I want to plug an iPhone into my MacBook Pro, I’ll need a dongle or a new cable ($25 from Apple), and neither is provided with either Macs or iPhones. And there’s no interchanging iPad peripherals with MacBook Pro ones, even as the two devices continue along a path toward converging into one. If I want to connect an external hard drive to back up my MacBook Pro data, I’ll need a USB adapter ($19). If I want to plug into Ethernet because the Wi-Fi around me sucks, I’ll need a new dongle ($35), different from those already in existence for prior MacBooks. If I want to connect to an external display or projector to do a work presentation, I’ll have to choose between the VGA dongle ($40) or the AV multiport dongle that includes HDMI ($69). If I bought into Apple’s previous Thunderbolt promotions and have any Thunderbolt accessories, those will need an adapter, too ($49). You can find most — if not all — of these adapters for less money than what Apple is charging. But many people won’t bother. And for those who do, the quality and consistency of USB-C hubs leaves a lot to be desired right now. Stare long enough into the immaculate, minimalist symmetry of that pair of USB-C ports, and you too might perceive the alluring future of personal computers. The future. But we live in a present where Windows XP is still widely used by businesses resistant to change. A world where the aforementioned VGA port is still the likeliest way to get visuals off your laptop in a boardroom meeting. And that thing’s almost as old as I am! Apple is making users adapt to it when it should be adapting to users Apple is forcing me to accept the loss of compatibility with USB sticks, USB drives, USB Ethernet adapters, HDMI cables, and, most painfully, MagSafe chargers, all because it’s decided to be impatient about the future. I’m not disputing the advantages of standardizing around USB-C, but I question how fast others will follow Apple’s lead here — MacBooks don’t have quite the same industry-wide influence as iPhones — and in turn how quickly this inconvenience will disappear for people like me. Apple could have at least kept the SD card slot alive, as a gesture to some of its most loyal fans and to ease the transition. The MagSafe charger has been another mainstay of Apple laptops for years, latching magnetically into place with ease and disconnecting just as easily should the power cable get yanked away. Its plug has an LED light that indicates charging status. It gently decouples from the laptop without needing your intervention. It’s kind of perfect. In its place, Apple’s new USB-C connector is hard to pull out and requires actual attention while doing so. There’s no charging indicator, either — though there is a little jingle, just as with your phone, when the charger is successfully connected. This change is good in that it moves Apple to a broader industry standard, but bad in that it downgrades the convenience and ease of use of the entire laptop. Vjeran Pavic Battery life on this new MacBook Pro doesn’t rival the Air’s 12 hours, but it does achieve Apple’s claimed 10 hours. I’m a writer, so my typical use may be a bit more forgiving than other professionals, however I keep seeing a perfect match between remaining percentage and hours of battery life left: 56 percent equals five and a half hours, 22 percent will get me two and a quarter hours, and so on. Apple seems to have very deliberately targeted 10 hours as its goal and benchmark. You can expect to get less if you throw some intensive photo or video editing at this MacBook Pro, but I have little to no worries about the battery; it lasts a consistently long time. And don’t forget that you’re getting a more productive machine: editing photos on the Air’s old and faded display was essentially color guesswork, whereas Apple’s new laptop would delight photographers if only it offered them a way to get their photos onto the damn thing. For the first time in seven years, I’m not sure that my next laptop will be a MacBook While the display, build quality, and looks of the new MacBook Pro are beyond reproach, they’re no longer beyond the competition. Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Yoga has a spectacular OLED display. Dell’s XPS 13 has great battery life and design. HP’s EliteBook Folio has a hinge that folds out to a full 180 degrees, whereas Apple’s laptops have always been limited to opening to a little bit beyond vertical. Razer’s Blade Stealth has a 4K touchscreen, Thunderbolt 3, and the latest seventh-gen Intel processors, whereas Apple is still using sixth-gen chips. Why does any of that matter? It matters because this new MacBook Pro’s compromises are large enough to make me, a loyal and satisfied MacBook user for seven years, look outside the cozy confines of Apple’s ecosystem. Apple has built a beautiful computer with all the upgrades I wanted, but it’s taken away things that I actually need, and now I’m looking elsewhere. To Apple’s credit, there’s no single Windows laptop that yet matches all of the MacBook line’s key strengths — touchpad ergonomics, battery life, display, and industrial design — but Apple’s changes have now created an opportunity that didn’t exist before. All a Windows vendor needs to do to convince me is to build something as good as a MacBook and then top it off with a simple SD card slot. macOS isn’t as major an advantage as it used to be, especially for someone like me whose professional life revolves around Google and Adobe’s cloud services. When it launched the MacBook in 2015, Apple wasn’t shy about claiming it had reinvented the laptop. With the benefit of some hindsight, I’d argue Apple only reinvented its own product line. Copycat designs have arisen, as they always do, but the MacBook’s biggest impact so far has been within Apple’s walled-in ecosystem. We can see more of the new MacBook’s DNA in the new MacBook Pro than original MacBook Pro features. This is just the way Apple laptops are made now and we can either learn to like it or go elsewhere. Apple could have been a USB-C trailblazer even while retaining a classic USB port and SD card slot And that, frankly, is the problem here. Apple is trying to return to its old habit of dragging us forward into the future like a wild-eyed inventor, but this time it might have cut a little too deep into present-day functionality while trying to promote tomorrow’s technology. Apple could have been a major trailblazer for USB-C even while retaining a classic USB port and a photographer-friendly SD card slot. I don’t think those things would have disrupted the MacBook Pro’s scrupulously perfected proportions or Apple’s bottom line too much. I don’t know if I’ll be buying this MacBook Pro, in spite of its superb design and performance, and that’s surprising to me. There’s no doubt that this is the best computer for current MacBook Air owners to upgrade to, should they be unwilling or uninterested in giving Windows or Chrome OS a shot. I’m also confident that this 13-inch MacBook Pro is a better, more versatile, functional, and powerful laptop than the 12-inch MacBook, so I’d recommend spending the extra cash if those are your only choices. Having used Apple’s Touch Bar on the more expensive MacBook Pros, I’d say that’s an intriguing and nicely executed addition, but the price for those models is really quite silly right now. But think carefully before you decide that you’re irrevocably locked into the Apple ecosystem. If its future is going to be characterized by such hostile decisions as the removal of the headphone jack from the iPhone or the scything off of the beloved MagSafe and SD card slot from laptops, maybe Apple isn’t your best friend anymore. Can this company continue to claim it’s looking out for its users’ best interests while discarding some of their most necessary tools? The new MacBook Pro is as beautiful and desirable as ever, but using it is alienating to anyone living in the present. I agree with Apple’s vision of the future. I’m just not buying it today.

Add to Diigo Bookmark this on Delicious Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Press Release Global POS brand Posiflex launches new top-of-the-range mobile solution for retail and hospitality London, UK – 2nd November 2016. Posiflex Technology, Inc., a global leading brand in the design and manufacture of POS solutions has announced the launch of its upgraded top-of-the-range POS system, model MT-4308W. The MT-4308W is available for purchase now. This new flagship model is the latest addition to Posiflex’s multi-award-winning and US-patented (no. 9436226 B2) MT Series. It addresses the growing wave of mobile POS adoption and provides the utmost flexibility for retailers and hospitality companies, offering all the mobility of a tablet whilst having the ability to convert to a fully-fledged stationary POS when necessary – in one single hybrid POS system. Posiflex MT-4308W Purpose-built for business mobility, the MT-4308W features an 8” Corning Gorilla Glass touchscreen that provides a higher level of durability and improved drop resistance for daily use. Built with Intel’s new Cherry Trail processor, the tablet, which runs on both Windows Embedded 8.1 Industry Pro 64bit and Windows Embedded 10 IoT, delivers enhanced performance and impressive productivity. Owen Chen, President and CEO of Posiflex Technology, Inc. comments; “Posiflex is committed to developing cutting-edge solutions that enable businesses to provide customers with the best integrated experience possible in today’s mobile world. There is an increasing demand from retailers and hospitality companies for mobile and hybrid POS systems and we have responded to this with the development of the new MT-4308W which gives greater flexibility, durability and performance than ever before.” With its ergonomically designed detachable pistol grip and compact Al-Mg chassis, the MT-4308W is aimed at redefining mobility and is suitable for many hours of use without causing fatigue. A separate hand-strap is available for hospitality use to prevent the tablet dropping on the ground accidentally. Advanced power saving technology provides long battery life for daily operation and if businesses require even longer battery life for more intensive usage, the pistol grip also houses a removable battery that can vastly extend the overall operating time. The MT-4308W integrates with an optional MSR attachment and an optional 1D or 2D built-in barcode scanner in the pistol grip, making the device itself a payment device and a data collector at the same time. Another highlight of MT-4308W is its charging dock station, which has a 3” dual band WIFI thermal POS receipt printer built-in, and full connectivity to a wide range of peripherals. The integration of tablet and dock station allows the device to have the features and functionality of an all-in-one POS. Chen concludes, “The objectives of rolling out a hybrid mobile POS solution include improving face-to-face customer engagement, boosting intimacy; line-busting; increasing operational effectivity and efficiency; and bringing the online experience into the store or hospitality outlet. With the MT-4308W we have created a greater experience for mobile retailing and hospitality applications, combining the benefits of both mobile and stationary POS in a single hybrid terminal. It maximises in-store POS hardware investment while at the same time delivering great flexibility in whichever application the user chooses."

For some this will be deal-breaking IndiaToday.in Last Updated: NOV 02, 2016 New Delhi Email Author Apple recently launched updated MacBook Pro laptops. These are, as the India Today Tech wrote earlier, very nice laptops with some cool features like the Touch Bar and the larger touchpad. They also have a slightly tweaked design which makes them the lightest and most compact MacBook laptops ever. To summarise, these new MacBook Pro laptops are super nice, but also super expensive. But not all is hunky-dory. The new MacBook Pro laptops also have some issues. They lack a few features that Apple consumers usually take for granted, especially those who are using MacBook Pro for a long time. Here are 6 things that the nice new MacBook Pro laptops lack and that could be a deal breaker for some. USB 2.0 Port: This is biggie. The new MacBook Pro all use the USB C ports. And although they are backward compatible with the USB 3 or the USB 2, you will need an adapter. In other words, without an adapter you can't use a regular pen drive, a regular external hard disk with the new MacBook Pro. You also can't without an adapter connect an iPhone (or many other Android phones) or your camera to the MacBook Pro because there is no compatible port. Now, it is true that the USB C is the port of the future, but right now the removal of the legacy USB ports from the MacBook Pro does mean a lot of pain for the end users. Magsafe charger: This is one part of the MacBook that every user loves. There is no plugging in the charger into the MacBook Pro (or Air for that matter). You bring the charger closer to the Magsafe port and voila it connects using the magnets. It's delightful. It's the kind of feature that makes Apple devices such a joy to use. Well, in the new MacBook Pro it is not there. Instead the charger uses the regular USB C port for charging, just like an Android phone. Not a big deal, many will say. But it just doesn't have the charm of Magsafe connector. The glowing Apple: There is no half-bitten glowing Apple Logo on the new MacBook Pro. Functionality wise, its removal is no big deal. But just like the Magsafe connector, the glowing logo too was something that gave the Apple laptops a unique identity. With it gone, the charm too seems to have gone. Also, keep in mind that Apple users have this strange sort of emotional attachment to their devices. It's the brand thing. It's all about the perception, that particular feeling and the half-bitten logo was one element that helped in creating that perception. Esc key: Actually it has not gone. It is still there. But along with the function keys, the Esc key too has become a virtual key. No longer you will hit the Esc and feel the springy action under your finger. It will be there in its usual place above the regular keys, but now only if you want it. Latest hardware: Apple is famous -- and rightly so -- for using the latest Intel processors in its MacBook Pro laptops. But this time around the new MacBook Pro laptops come with Intel's sixth generation Core processor, the same processors that Apple is putting in its machine for the last one year. Although the reason why there is no 7th generation Core processors inside the MacBook could be due to Intel's problems and not because Apple doesn't want to use the latest and greatest chips anymore. The Intel roadmap has slowed down in the last two years and although in the past Apple had managed to get the latest Intel chips in advance, ahead of others this time it is likely that such a feat wasn't possible. SD card reader: Yes, just like Apple got rid of the USB 2 and USB 3 ports, it also got rid of the SD card reader. So, no more taking out the card from your camera and quickly moving the photos to the MacBook Pro while you are working out in the field as the National Geographic photographer. Sad actually, because the SD card reader was so convenient.

Kuo is an analyst for KGI Securities and has a remarkable track record when it comes to predicting Apple’s plans. Apple’s latest MacBook Pros sell for $1,499 onwards today (Rs 1,29,000 in India). The top-end model is also limited to just 16GB RAM, which might seem like a lot, but may not be enough for pros. The restriction on the RAM is a result of the architecture that Apple chose for the new Pros. Apple is currently using Intel’s sixth generation SkyLake architecture, which requires DDR4 RAM (or LPDDR4) for optimal performance. Apple however, opted to go for LPDDR3 RAM, which significantly improves battery life, but caps RAM at 16GB. Kuo explains that Apple always prices its MacBooks high, but that it backs down in a few months. He adds that Apple will most likely move on to Intel’s upcoming Coffee Lake or Cannonlake CPUs in 2017, depending on availability, as well as LPDDR4 RAM. Together, these upgrades should result in improved performance, battery life and support for more RAM, reports 9to5Mac. If you’re holding off on a MacBook Pro purchase because of the price, you might want to heed Kuo’s words and wait for the inevitable price drop. If the lack of USB ports and SD card slot bother you, however, just get yourself an XPS 13 or the older MacBook Pro.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Chinavasion predicts mini PC invasion Chinavasion predicts mini PC invasion Posted on November 2, 2016 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer The popularity of Chinese mini computers on the Western market is currently booming thanks to a flourishing Chinese manufacturing environment where there is an abundance of high-end technology and cheap labor. Shenzhen, Guangdong (PRWEB) November 02, 2016 The abundance of high-end and powerful hardware available on the Chinese market along with the availability of relatively cheap labor has created an environment in which Chinese manufacturers can take their advantages and create affordable high-end electronics that are easily capable of competing with their well known Western competitors. As stated by Ms. Rose Li, PR Manager at Chinavasion, "One industry in which this has become visible in particular is that of the Android mini PC and TV boxes." Thanks to the flourishing environment where Chinese companies are able to produce top-class electronics at low prices, many Chinese brands are now producing products with comparable specs as those of the big Western players in the industry. "As of late a new range of Windows mini computers are rolling out of Chinese factories, allowing them to compete at the higher levels in the global personal computer market," added Ms. Li. Not only does this give Chinese brands a stronger presence in the industry, it also is great news for consumers as it offers them a wider range of high-end electronics that now come with a price tag people 2 years ago could never have dreamt about. Ms. Li confirmed that "this shift and development in the global micro PC industry is great news for consumers and manufacturers alike as it is believed to bring along innovations that are sure to drive the market forward." One of the latest Windows 10 mini PC boxes of Chinese descent is the NEO Z83-4 by MINIX. This is a prime example of the thriving Chinese electronics industry. Featuring the Intel X5-Z8300 CPU that has been clocked at 1.84GHz, and holding an astonishing 4GB of RAM this micro PC, that is now available through China Wholesale Electronics Company Chinavasion, is considered to be one of the most powerful mini computers produced in China. Running on a fully licensed version of Windows 10 Home, the NEO Z83-4 mini PC provides a smooth user experience that brings along all the functionalities and production tools associated with Microsoft. Along with its powerful hardware that includes an Intel HD Graphics GPU, this Windows mini computer allows people to browse the web, play the most demanding games, and stream the latest movies in astonishing quality – "Making it a perfect media hub that goes far beyond what most Windows TV boxes have to offer," Ms. Rose Li commented. With its state-of-the-art thermal design, the NEO Z83-4 is among the first micro computers that features an innovative passive cooling design that perfectly balances speed, temperature, and performance. Ms. Rose Li mentioned, "This latest energy efficient mini-desktop-PC contains no moving parts so it is able to operate without even a whisper of noise, while, at the same time, it maintains an incredibly low operating temperature. This allows the user to enjoy all their media in absolute peace and silence, significantly increasing the overall user experience." Additionally, and unlike most desktop PCs, this Intel mini PC supports 4K resolution, allowing you to enjoy a truly cinematic experience from the comfort of your own living room. Ms. Li advised that "by combining an ultra compact design and premium performance, this mini Windows PC is ideal to be used for work and entertainment alike." Being cheaper than comparable laptops and outperforming many PC systems from Western brands, the popularity of Chinese mini computers has seen a steep rise during the past several months. Accordingly, Chinavasion, with its long history of offering value for money, is now offering the NEO Z83-4 mini PC as well as other Chinese TV Boxes and micro computers at wholesale prices to its customers all over the world.

The logo of Samsung Electronic is seen at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, July 4, 2016.  The South Korean firm, the world's second-largest chipmaker behind Intel Corp (INTC.O), said in a statement its investment would boost output of chips for mobile and other electronics devices from its existing facilities in the city. The investment comes after Samsung said last week its capital expenditure for 2016 would rise to a record 27 trillion won ($24 billion), with 13.2 trillion won earmarked for its semiconductor business. While most of Samsung's semiconductor profits come from memory chip sales, it has been trying to boost earnings from other products including its own Exynos mobile processors and contract manufacturing deals with clients such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O).Samsung did not give further details for its investment plans in Austin, such as how much production capacity would be added.    Source: Reuters Samsung Electronics, invest, chip production   Name: * Email from: * Email to: * Messages:     Send      Read on Pop singer Justin Bieber after walking off stage: 'I'm not a robot' Cheap cancer measures could save hundreds of thousands of lives in poor countries S.Korean president's confidante placed under emergency detention Lady Gaga's 'Joanne' debuts at top of Billboard album chart Trump raises specter of crisis if Clinton wins the White House Zika causes infertility, lasting harm to testes in mice: U.S. study Tesla's Musk adds solar roofs to his clean energy vision Asia stocks stutter as FBI probe of Clinton jolts markets New earthquake rocks Italy, buildings collapse but no deaths reported One in seven children suffer high air pollution: UNICEF     Top Stories Vietnamese representatives at international beauty pageants 2016 Large M&A deal could change Vietnam’s sugar industry Universities produce bachelor's degree candidates to businesses’ orders Visit Da Nhay beach in Quang Binh Visit to traditional fish-pot making village in Hung Yen Top 10 historic and famous prisons Tycoons now indifferent to buying "golden land" plots Students learn English to pass exams, not to communicate Vietnamese companies spend big money to advertise products overseas T’nung Lake in Pleiku Latest News BUSINESS IN BRIEF 16/11 KIDO to soon issue $45m in bonds Asia shares win reprieve as bond rout pauses for now Anh Vien aims high for Asian Swimming Championship 2016 Large-scale int’l charity bazaar comes back to HCM City in late November Bank for overseas Vietnamese proposed Da Nang to adjust 2030’s Master Plan Son-in-law Kushner poised to wield clout in Trump presidency Vietnam has huge franchising potential Hanoi celebrates Polish literary giant     RssIN FOCUS Indonesia transport plane crash kills at least five The debate about Nem Thuong pig-chopping ritual Vietnam International Fashion Week 2014 review The China-Philippines dispute in the East Sea Overview of the East Sea Dispute The East Sea disputes Legendary General Vo Nguyen Giap The sadness of heritage Human resources training for healthcare in trouble Analyzing Vietnam-China trade relations PrevNext   Home | Advertising | Weblink | Contact Us VNN © Copyright of VIETNAMNET Bridge Tel: 04.37722792 Fax: 04.37722882, Email: evnn@vietnamnet.vn

The lineup comes in four base models: a TN model, a 1080p IPS model and two 1440p OLED models — with 8GB or 16GB of RAM. The two non-OLED models are powered by an Intel Core i5-6300HQ while the OLED models feature an i7-6700HQ. All four models can be outfitted with an Nvidia GeForece GTX 1060 GPU, which is the perfect discrete graphics core for gaming at 1080p, providing 40 to 50 percent more performance than the GTX 970M at a similar power and heat cost. In terms of design the Alienware 13 features a leaner, more elegant profile than its predecessor, measuring 13 x 10.6 x 0.87-inches and weighing in at 5.4 pounds. The lid uses Alienware's Epic Gray anodized aluminum, while the rest of the body is made of magnesium alloy and plastic. The laptop incorporates a new hinge-forward design which Alienware claims allows it to offer more rear ports and larger fans for increased cooling without additional noise. The base TN model starts at $1,199 while the OLED version starts at $2,099. They all ship standard with an IR camera for Windows Hello facial recognition and secure login features, 7.1 channel audio, stereo speakers, a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port, a USB 3.0 Type-C port, two USB 3.0 ports, HDMI 2.0 and Mini DisplayPort 1.2, and two audio jacks. The new laptops also support the Alienware Graphics Amplifier, which is the company’s proprietary external dock that lets you connect the desktop graphics card of your choice.

Both Austin’s mayor and the head of the city’s chamber of commerce welcomed the news with open arms. The world’s second-largest chipmaker behind Intel makes most of its semiconductor profits from the sale of memory chips but as Reuters highlights, Samsung has been trying to bolster earnings from other products like the home-grown Exynos processors that power some of its mobile devices. The South Korean technology titan has also been working on contract manufacturing deals with clients such as Nvidia and Qualcomm. Company executives tell the Austin American Statesman that the $1 billion investment will be used to buy new manufacturing equipment and cover the cost of construction. Catherine Morse, general counsel and senior director of public affairs at Samsung Austin Semiconductor, said Samsung will be hiring between 250 and 500 manufacturing technicians and engineers to help operate the new equipment. Samsung put down roots in Austin way back in 1997 and currently employs roughly 3,000 locals. Competition in the semiconductor manufacturing industry has been heating up as of late. Just last week, for example, Qualcomm said it had reached an agreement to buy NXP Semiconductors for $47 billion as it looks to diversify into automotive and Internet of Things industries.

The device, called Voyager, is an optical switch described as the first “white box” transponder for Open Packet DWDM optical networks. Unlike conventional copper-based networks, optical networks (also known as optical fiber networks) use light pulses to transfer data. Related: Facebook’s OpenCellular makes it easier to start your own mobile network Voyager is being developed as part of Facebook’s burgeoning Telecom Infra Project (TIP), an open-source telecoms initiative similar to the company’s Open Compute Project (OCP) for computer hardware. The latter was launched five years ago and has seen Facebook collaborate with other tech giants (such as Microsoft, Apple and Intel, among others) on data center server product designs. Facebook describes its approach to optical networking in the following excerpt from its blog post announcing Voyager: “More and more people are connecting to the internet every day, and as new services like video and VR become more popular, those people are using more and more bandwidth. These two factors are driving the need for more scalable and cost-effective infrastructure … The highest-performing “bandwidth and reach” are still fiber-based technologies — in particular, switching, routing, and transport DWDM technologies. Facebook is exploring new approaches in this space, focusing on packet-optical technologies.” As with OCP, Facebook is hoping TIP can drive down hardware prices and accelerate the growth of telecoms technology. TIP’s members include Intel, and Nokia (both of which are also involved in OCP) along with network operators such as Deutsche Telekom, SK Telecom, E2E, and Globe. “We have a huge opportunity to move the industry forward to solve the connectivity challenges we’re all facing, and we’re going to have to work together if we want to make the most of that opportunity,” said Jay Parikh, Facebook’s global head of engineering and infrastructure. The Voyager device includes parts designed by Acacia Communications, and software from startup Snaproute. Global data center company Equinix carried out tests of Facebook’s optical switches inside two of its interconnected data centers in Silicon Valley, with chief technology officer Ihab Tarazi claiming the company was “thrilled [with] the initial results.” Christoph Glingener, chief technology officer and chief operating at ADVA Optical Networking (which provided commercial support for Voyager) also praised the device in his statement: “What has been developed here is a true landmark in our industry. It’s a game changer that will open up networks to a whole new range of customers.” Correction: The original article incorrectly implied that copper-based networks are slower than optical networks, this has been corrected.

Apple could announce a new MacBook and price cuts for the current model early next year, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities. Kuo's latest research note predicts that Apple is planning to introduce new hardware features for a revamped 2017 MacBook lineup, including MacBook Pros, and that prices for those notebooks will drop in the first half of next year, MacRumors reported this week. While a price drop would be consistent with Apple's historical strategy, which has been to discount prices of older models after a year or so, component upgrades may be more of a stretch. Kuo predicts that the refreshed MacBook Pro will have support for up to 32GB of RAM, an amount that Intel processors in current Apple notebooks don't support. Such an upgrade, then, would depend on whether or not Intel releases its Cannonlake processors in time. They're currently scheduled for the second half of 2017. In addition to supporting more RAM, the Cannonlake family is expected to take advantage of recent advances in 10 nanometer chip fabrication, recently pioneered by Samsung. //Related Articles Apple Ditches Iconic Mac Startup Sound Meanwhile, the iPhone 8 rumor mills have also been churning this week, with Nikkei citing sources that say the next iPhone will include wireless charging. Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturing giant that supplies components found in many mobile devices, is reportedly making wireless charging modules compatible with a next-gen iPhone. Nikkei notes that whether or not such a feature ends up in a future Apple handset depends on whether or not Foxconn is able to iron out supply chain issues, which recently plagued the launch of the iPhone 7. Apple, which just last week unvieled a refreshed MacBook Pro, did not immediatley respond to a request for comment. Back to top Previous : MacBook Pro 2016: Should You Upgrade?

The networking giant also reckons it's the first fully modular server architecture in the industry. The S-Series is designed for data intensive workloads such as big data, streaming media and collaboration applications, and for deploying software-defined storage, object storage, and data protection solutions. Cisco says the boxes will try to access and analyze data quickly to generate results in real time, with unstructured data coming from sources such as the Internet of Things, video, mobility, and collaboration. Applications processing the data could be recommendation engines, video analytics, diagnostic imaging, streaming analytics, and machine learning. The concept is to analyze the data as close to its arrival as possible, and before it gets punted off to back-end storage. Its now a couple of years since the gen 4 C-Series range in Cisco's UCS server line was launched. The C3260 member of that range was positioned as a storage server, but what defined a storage server then has moved on. Now we've got the S-Series S3260, which is a follow-on from the C3260. Much of the bare-bones specification remains, such as 600TB of local data storage with enterprise-class redundancy, connectivity including NFS, iSCSI, Fibre Channel (FC), FCoE, SMB and SMB Direct, scaling to petabytes with Cisco UCS Manager, and a dual-node two-socket architecture using Intel Xeon CPUs. But much else has changed, particularly the adoption of a modular design so that different components can be refreshed at different times. The S3260 is the first product in the S-Series line-up and the main features are: Dual two-socket server nodes using an Intel Xeon E5-2600 v2 or v4 CPU, with up to 36 cores per server node or 72 cores per system. Up to 512GB of DDR3 or DDR4 memory per server node (1TB total) Support for high-performance Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) and flash memory 600TB data storage capacity that scales to petabytes with Cisco UCS Manager Policy-based storage management framework Dual-port 40Gbit/s system I/O controllers with UCS Virtual Interface Card (VIC) 1300 platform embedded chip Unified I/O for Ethernet or Fibre Channel to existing NAS or SAN storage environments Support for Cisco bi-directional (BIDI) transceivers, with 40Gbit/s connectivity over existing 10Gbit/s cabling infrastructure UCS S-Series 4U chassis This slide from Cisco summarizes the modularity. One point is that Cisco's 40Gbit/s virtual interface card (think VNIC) provides 256 virtual adapters per node plus 16Gbit/s native Fabre Channel options. UCS S-Series modular design Modular components include disk, SSD and NVMe media (caching flash with Fusion ioMemory3 PX), disk expanders, IO expanders, flash memory and Ethernet/FC/FCoE connectivity options. They can be cache-optimized, capacity-optimized, compute-intensive and IO-intensive configurations; the latter having 160GB/sec of aggregated VIC IO, and either 8 or 16Gbit/s FC. Capacity can be scaled out, by adding nodes, to 86PB in a UCS domain. S-Series module details ... Click image for larger view Cost comparisons Compared to Cisco's own traditional-style servers, we're told the UCS S3260: Reduces CapEx by 34 per cent Lowers ongoing management by 80 per cent Reduces cabling by 70 per cent Takes up 60 per cent less space Consumes 59 per cent less power Cisco also compared costs over three years with Amazon's S3 service: specially, 420TB of AWS capacity versus 600TB raw on the S3260. The comparable costs were, it is claimed, $0.015/GB/month for the S3260 and $0.041/GBN/month for S3. Cisco said all OPEX and CAPEX elements for the on-premises and public cloud scenarios were taken into account. 3-year TCO for S3260 and Amazon S3 Breakeven occurred at the 13-month point. Cisco's partner eco-system is being primed to take advantage of the S3260. Expect their offerings to endorse it shortly. For example, the S3260 can provide a hardware platform for Ceph, Cloudian, GlusterFS, Nexenta, Scality, StorMagic, SwiftStack, and Windows Server Storage Spaces storage software products. The S-Series joins other server variants in the UCS range: Mini and E-Series for remote and branch offices Gen 4 UCS for mainstream computing Converged infrastructure offerings from NetApp, Nimble, IBM, Pure and Dell-EMC's VCE HyperFlex hyper-converged systems S-Series for data-intensive computing and distributed storage All these variants share a unified management facility. Cisco ONE Enterprise Cloud Management Suite Cisco has an updated generation of its ONE Enterprise Cloud Suite, a hybrid cloud software offering automated deployment with a self-service portal tailorable for users, app developers and IT pros. Admin teams can deploy to over 20 different data centre, private and public cloud environments. There are annual subscription licenses with one, three, and five-year options at different price points. There are four options, which can be used singly or in any combination: Infrastructure Automation: for consistent and faster delivery of error-free infrastructure environments to business and application teams Service Management: self-service order and service management Cloud Management: model application profiles once and deploying to multiple hybrid environments Big Data Automation: one-click installation, provisioning and deployment of Hadoop and Splunk clusters The UCS S3260 will be available from November 7 with a three-year warranty and multiple support options.

Josh Miller/CNET How Apple blew the MacBook name game 0 Share: Laptops by Sean Hollister November 1, 2016 2:25 PM PDT @starfire2258 Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? Enlarge Image Photo by James Martin/CNET, edited by Kelly Nelson/CNET One word could have made all the difference. "Air," instead of "Pro." If Apple had introduced a new MacBook Air last week, the company wouldn't be facing down a mob of angry creative professionals. It might not have Apple software developers questioning whether the company has lost its way. Because the new MacBook Pro basically is a MacBook Air -- the most impressive Air ever made. Photo by James Martin/CNET Let's rewind time for a moment. It's Thursday, October 27, and Apple's event is under way. Imagine that instead of introducing the new MacBook Pro, Apple unveiled a new MacBook Air. One that's 12 percent lighter, 13 percent smaller by volume and practically the same weight -- but manages to cram in a faster Intel processor, faster graphics, plus the far sharper, brighter and more colorful Retina Display the MacBook Air so desperately needed. Sure, it starts at $1,500 rather than $1,000, but you get twice the solid-state storage for the price -- and you can double the RAM, quadruple the storage and get the awesome new Touch Bar secondary screen with Touch ID fingerprint sensor if you're willing to pay even more. How long has your MacBook Air had a 1.6GHz processor? This new one is 2.0GHz or 2.9GHz; there's even a 3.3GHz option. Photo by James Martin/CNET, edited by Kelly Nelson/CNET And sure, it's got a thinner keyboard and only two (or four) general-purpose Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of handy full-size USB ports and SD card slots. But we, Apple, figured you'd rather have a more accurate keyboard and amazing single-cable Thunderbolt 3 docking options to go with your mobile MacBook Air lifestyle. Apple makes Thunderbolt 3 more versatile with USB-C charger Apple designs new ports for MacBook Pro with four Thunderbolt 3 ports; each one can also act as a charger. 2:20 Close Drag Now, you can pull your MacBook Air right out of your manila envelope and plug in a single cable to charge it, dock with your peripherals and power multiple monitors all at the same time. Oh, and one more thing: we knew you'd like the MacBook Air so much, we built a 15-inch model. You won't believe how fast it is -- this Air has a quad-core CPU that's 50 percent faster than last year's MacBook Pro! The graphics are over twice as fast, and yet we've kept the same 10 hour battery life as the 13-inch version. If you've ever wanted to edit photos or home videos on a MacBook Air, this computer's for you. Oh, and it comes standard with the Touch Bar and Touch ID, too. We think you're going to love the new MacBook Air. It's the best MacBook we've ever made. Everything I just said is true of Apple's new laptops. But all of it describes the new MacBook Pro, not the MacBook Air. Apple chose to market a thinner Pro instead of a faster Air, even though they're basically the same thing. And that's not lost on Apple -- it was Apple marketing VP Phil Schiller who suggested the 13-inch MacBook Pro (the one without the Touch Bar) was designed for MacBook Air buyers. (That's him in the pictures above.) "We think that a lot of potential MacBook Air customers are going to be very excited by this product, too," said Schiller. But the choice between a thinner Pro and a faster Air isn't just semantics -- the word "Pro" carries weight. The new MacBook Pro is not for pros, and pros know it. That one word could cost Apple an awful lot of customers. Tags Apple Apple Event Laptops Apple All the latest Apple news, featuring developments on the iPhone, iPad, Macbooks, OS X and much more.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Solid Rose Gold TAG Heuer Connected offered with a mighty high price tag By R Padla - November 1, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter When TAG Heuer ventured into the world of smartphones back in year 2012, we didn’t think it would be the last hi-tech move by the luxury watchmaker. It also entered into the smartwatch game together with Google and Intel by launching the TAG HEUER Connected Android Wear. The device is said to be in demand, causing the company to increase weekly production. The TAG Heuer Connected Watch was unveiled a year ago as the next step to innovation. We have no idea how many units have been sold already around the world but we’re assuming it’s selling because the watchmaker is even releasing a more expensive version. Starting price of the original version is $1,200 but for it’s first birthday, the line is getting a Solid Rose Gold version which is now super pricey at $9,900. We’re not really sure if there’s an actual watch ready on hand but TAG Heuer is serious with this one. Knowing TAG Heuer, the brand will not launch something it’s not certain of. Perhaps the people behind it saw the potential and that there are people who are willing to spend that much. Apple released a $10,000 Watch before and once teamed up with Hermes. The $9,900 is quite “affordable” if we’re talking with those who are really into luxury watches. If you have the means to buy this Solid Rose Gold version or even just the standard Connected Watch, head on to tagheuerconnected.com or straight to a local dealer near you to inquire.

Tech solution OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Bangalore, Nov. 1: Harried home-owners in Bangalore's Whitefield can now breathe a bit easy: a free Web application can help them check whether their properties are encroaching on storm water drains in violation of land rules. Developed by a city-based techie after corporation bulldozers recently razed parts of homes standing on such drains, Mapshalli covers only 33 areas in and around the tech neighbourhood of Whitefield at the moment. But it could soon cover the whole city. One of the families that had to pull down a concrete pillar on their residential premises was of Lt Col E.K. Niranjan, the NSG commando who was killed during mop-up operations after the terrorist attack on Pathankot air base in January. Bothered by the spate of demolitions carried out to reclaim storm water drains, software engineer Shiv Shankar - he is from IIT Madras - decided it was time he checked if all was clear with his property in Whitefield. "I basically used available technology to check if my property stood clear of any rajakaluve (principal storm water drain), but in the process ended up developing this application," said the former director of enterprise software technology at Intel. The demolitions began after it was discovered that outflow of water during the monsoon was being blocked by encroached drains, leading to flooding in some areas of north Bangalore. Water flows through a network of smaller secondary storm water drains into principal drains that open into lakes across the city. There are survey maps that the city corporation, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), has uploaded on its website but ordinary people find it tough to decipher them. Not only are they in Kannada, they are very technical too. That was where Shankar's skills came into play. "It's a very cumbersome process to even find the relevant survey map on BBMP's webpage and then decode them to figure out if your property is on a rajakaluve. What I basically did was to overlay their map over Google Earth to give the lay user an easy solution with a few clicks," said Shankar. His application provides a clear picture of where principal and secondary storm water drains are. "Around 120 people from other parts of the city have already contacted me to help them check if their properties stand on storm water drains," he said. Going by the interest his application has generated, Shankar sounded confident that MapsHalli could one day become a user-generated one - something like Wikipedia where users generate content. A corporation official said violations would happen with or without such solutions: "There are nearly 2,000 properties under scrutiny for encroaching on storm water drains." E.K. Shashank, the brother of Lt Col Niranjan, said: "It's good that something is available for commoners to easily check if they have erred unwittingly." Thippe Gowda, a real estate agent, said the corporation's anti-encroachment drive had hit buyer confidence. "Earlier, buyers mostly wanted to know if the property had proper documents and got them checked by lawyers. But now they are worried about encroachment on government land and storm water drains," he said. "I think using technology is the only way to find out details like if there was a drain in the place where one is going to build a house. It's very difficult to get such information from the corporation."  More stories in Nation Scapegoat, cries axed jail top cop Mayawati demands judicial probe What SC says: No automatic right to shoot BJP sees poll gain from encounter Quizzes and films at embassies to celebrate Patel Chandigarh misses party Raw and daring mill letter Scientists on hunt for Chyavanprash 8 Arnab Goswami to resign Woman on house hunt gang-raped Cow boot on Bajrang foot Mulayam and Kishor meet Hint of extension and long wait Gautami reveals split with Kamal    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

Inside they found a smaller battery, removable custom SSD, and more. Apple’s latest engineering marvel: the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro Apple introduced new 13-inch and 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro models at a media event on October 27th. The new models include brighter displays with a wider color gamut, USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, a larger trackpad, and Intel Skylake Core i5 and Core i7 processors. Apple’s new Touch Bar replaces the function keys on the 15-inch model and one 13-inch model—both of which will be available in a week or so, although ship times are slipping. The 13-inch model with function keys, however, is available now, and that’s what iFixit ripped apart. Inside they found a battery that’s 27% smaller than the previous 13-inch MacBook Pro, but it still offers the same 10 hours of use. The battery also easier to remove, which is good news should it need to be replaced. The SSD storage module is removable, although replacements aren’t currently available. Apple is using SanDisk memory chips along with a custom designed controller, which may limit future upgrade options. Still, the fact that the SSD can be popped out is promising. Like previous MacBook Pro models, the RAM is soldered in, so the 8GB or 16GB is comes with is all you’ll get without any upgrade option. The new keyboard Apple bragged about that’s supposed to be an improvement over the MacBook uses different butterfly switch mechanism, and does feel different. Since the feel of a keyboard is subjective, you’ll have to decide for yourself if different is better. Apple left the 3.5mm headphone jack, which was something of a surprise considering it’s gone from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. That doesn’t mean it isn’t welcome; the headphone jack is still an important port for many MacBook Pro users. iFixit gave the function key 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro a repairability score of 2 out of 10, which means you shouldn’t expect to have much luck with DIY repairs and upgrades. That’s a little disappointing but not surprising considering Apple hasn’t been keen on users going under the hood with Macs for some time. That said, it’s pretty impressive Apple was able to keep the overall battery life at 10 hours while reducing the battery size by 27%.
