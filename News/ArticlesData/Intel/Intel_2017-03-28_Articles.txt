Intel has been working on a technology that it claims will boost older hard drives to the speeds of ultra-fast solid-state-drives (SSDs), a claim that could revitalise the aging hardware. The technology, known as Intel Optane Memory, is a specialised chip storage chip that sits in the M.2 storage slot on a motherboard, and comes as standard on boards designed for Intel's latest generation of Kaby Lake processors. It is currently available in 16GB or 32GB variants, providing a blisteringly fast cache that is able to increase the speed of older spinning hard drives. The memory module is capable of enhancing multiple aspects of a machine's performance, but most interestingly it promises to make hard drive access speeds up to 14 times faster. That means a traditional 1TB 7200RPM hard drive would be twice as responsive during daily tasks. Overall system performance would also increase by up to 30%, and actions like opening a clean browser would happen up to five times faster. Typically, processors can only access data as fast as the storage device will allow, which is often dependent on recall speeds and the transfer rate over the motherboard's connectors. By placing the memory module between the processor and SATA-based storage devices, such as hard drives or SSDs, it is able to store data and commonly-used programs in close proximity to the processor. The technology then chains together memory and storage into a single virtual drive that is accessible to the OS, which then uses Intel's Rapid Storage Technology to accelerate the rate at which actions can be performed, and prioritise the services you use most often. This has the effect of increasing start and boot times, file searching, multitasking, and the launching of applications. RAM has traditionally filled the role of storing frequently-used data for the processor to quickly access, but that technology is expensive to create at high capacities. Despite its name, Intel Optane Memory does not replace current RAM modules found on PC motherboards, nor does it act in the same way to power applications. Instead, the module is an optional performance enhancer that helps you squeeze the most out of current technology. While Intel has confirmed Optane Memory will boost the speeds of SSD storage, the biggest benefits will come from its effect on older hard drives that are generally much slower. Intel Optane Memory is set to launch on 24 April, priced at $US44 and $US77 for 16GB and 32GB respectively. The technology is only compatible with Intel's 7th generation Core i3, i5 and i7 processors, or Intel 200 series chipsets on desktop PC configurations, although laptop and notebook support will be available later.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 29 March 2017 | MYT 6:00 AM How to figure out which processor is right for you Not all about the money: Price comparisons don’t really help when it comes to making sure your computer has the right processor for your needs. — dpa Intel Core i7-6800K or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X – who can decipher the combinations of numbers and letters that chip makers Intel and AMD give to their processors? And how can you decide which one is best for you? Price comparisons don’t really help. "If you want to buy a car, it’s not enough to compare the price of a model with different dealers," says Christian Herzog from German IT association Bitkom. "It is also not enough to simply compare two laptops when you buy a computer. You have to know what performance you want." The two big manufacturers Intel and AMD have a variety of processors on offer and their names provide information about their construction and performance. The simplest to figure out are Intel’s desktop processors. "Core i3, i5 and i7 are the basic performance class. The higher the better," says Michael Schmelzle from PC Welt magazine. "The Core i7 are high-end versions with four or more CPU (Central Processor Unit) cores, hyper-threading and high clock speeds," says Christian Hirsch from c’t magazine. Core i5 are mid-range chips with four cores while Celeron, Pentium and Core i3 are two-core chips. "The variants with U in the name are economical dual cores, those with HQ or HK are more powerful quad cores," Hirsch explains. Intel chips also have a four-digit number. “The first position stands for the microarchitecture generation, the higher, the more modern – the current generation is the seventh generation,” says Schmelzle. The second position is the clock frequency or computing power – again, the higher the better. There are also letters. X stands for high power, S or LM for reduced power consumption and a T or UM mean greatly reduced power consumption. In the case of Intel’s competitor, AMD, the Ordering Part Number (OPN) gives information about the model, base type and other properties of the chip, explains Herzog. The CPU series is easy to recognise: there’s the A series and the FX series. “The Series A processors include a graphics unit: CPUs of type A12, A10 and A8 have four cores, the A6 and A4 have two,” says Hirsch. High-end processors for gaming computers use the FX series. The first figure shows how many cores the CPU has – for example the FX-8350 has eight cores. The second figure refers to the CPU microarchitecture and the third to the clock rate. “The higher it is, the higher the workload,” Schmelzle says. In the A series the four digits indicate the clock rate – the higher the number, the higher the computing power. In the case of AMD’s new Ryzen chips the higher the number is, the more cores and the higher the clock frequency. But which processor is suitable for which purpose? “In general, always buy the current processor generation of AMD or Intel,” advises Schmelzle. These will bring the most modern capabilities and the lowest power consumption. For the latest 3D games, he recommends CPUs with at least four cores. And if the PC is intended for image processing and video editing it should have four cores and a speed of at least 3 GHz (Intel) or 3.5 GHz (AMD). "For simple office applications, two-core Intel chips such as Celeron, Pentium und Core i3 are sufficient," says Hirsch. For surfing the web and writing e-mails any current computer will do, Herzog says – regardless of what CPU it has inside. —  dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested Facebook Messenger gets mentions and reactions, including a 'dislike' button Tuesday bankruptcy filing for Toshiba's Westinghouse ideal option: source Samsung to sell refurbished Galaxy Note 7 smartphones Soccer - Messi banned for four international matches Cracking the whip on child sex offenders Digi spearheads digital learning trend among employees Others Also Read Talks and panel discussion featuring trailblazing women were the highlight for many Healthier solution for people on the go Federer, Nadal reach Miami semis, Wawrinka falls advertisement Latest News How tough is that smartphone?

Separately, it announced a 22nm low-power FinFET node to compete for foundry business with fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) from rivals such as Globalfoundries. At 10nm, Intel will pack 100.8 million transistors per square millimeter. It estimated 10nm foundry processes now in production from TSMC and Samsung have about half that density. Intel’s metric averages density of a small and a large logic cell. Specifically, it uses a two-input NAND cell with two active gates and a scan flip-flop cell with as many as 25 active gates. “I think it’s a comprehensive, quantitative and honest metric,” said Mark Bohr, a senior fellow and director of process architecture and integration. “TSMC and, I think, Samsung used to quote it, but my guess is they weren’t looking very good with this metric anymore,” he said. Intel proposed rivals resurrect this density metric to define nodes.Click to enlarge. The existing metric of multiplying gate pitch and cell height gives a relative advance between nodes, rather than an absolute number of a node’s capability. In addition, it does not include a variety of factors embraced by the density metric Intel proposed, Bohr added. Whatever the metrics, Intel said it will start making 10nm Cannonlake chips in the second half of this year, three years after it launched its 14nm process. It expects to continue a three-year cadence, stretching 10nm with two annual upgrades to be called 10+ and 10++. “Even with the longer time between nodes, we’re staying on the same cost per transistor curve and we expect this will continue through the 10nm generation,” said Stacy Smith, executive vice president of Intel’s fab and sales groups. Interestingly, Intel’s 14++ sports higher performance than its initial 10nm process. However the 10nm node delivers lower power and higher density. Intel gave more details than usual about its 10nm node. The x86 giant needed to be more forthcoming to show its advantages over 10nm processes already in production at foundry rivals TSMC and Samsung. Specifically, Intel’s10nm node sports: 34nm fin pitches 53nm fin heights 36nm minimum metal pitches 272nm cell heights 54nm gate pitches Intel claimed the node sports the tightest gate and metal pitches in the industry and marks the industry’s first use of self-align quad patterning. FinFETs are 25 percent taller and more closely packed than on its 14nm node. The company described two transistor innovations to compensate for the rising costs of more lithography patterning steps. A contact-over-active-gate (COAG) helps deliver an additional 10 percent density; a single rather than double dummy gate at 10nm provides additional scaling advantages.

You or the manufacturer mount a device on your dashboard. As the device's software algorithms "interpret" a video feed in real-time, it detects anything in your car's path – pedestrians, other vehicles, animals, large debris – and your distance from it. If the software interprets what it "sees" as "trouble," it alerts the driver with a series of beeps and flashing lights. It can also "read" and interpret traffic signs and signals. No, this isn't a driverless car yet – you still need to hit the brakes – but it's a big part of the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that will get us there. And to me at least, it's pretty amazing technology. Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) thinks so, too. It picked up the developer of this technology for $15.3 billion last week – catalyzing the much smaller firm's stock up 30% that day. And suddenly Wall Street has fallen in love with the "car of the future"? We know better. In fact, you're way ahead of the Street. We were in this stock years ago – and another "car of the future" company that got acquired recently – and we've made a bundle on both. So let's go over those two deals today – see what happened and exactly how much money we made. And then we'll take a look at what I think is the best pick in the connected and driverless vehicle space right now. It'll be good for a very quick 30% pop in your portfolio. And that's something you'll be able to brag about to your friends and family. Or maybe you'll save your bragging for the showroom – where you can use those gains to pick up a connected car yourself. Take a look… Your Guy on the Inside I have to admit: We have an unfair advantage over Wall Street when it comes to seeing the worth auto technology. I was an auto analyst in Detroit in the early 1980s and saw firsthand how new tech even back then was reshaping the industry. Over the years, I've combined that deep expertise with my 33-year background as a Silicon Valley insider. That's why I was able to start sharing the news about "the car of the future" with you folks several years ago. And it's why you've been able to make quite a bit of money in this sector – before Wall Street really caught wind of it. Here's the real story – a point I've made several times over the past few years… The auto sector's power has shifted from Detroit to the Silicon Valley. The fact that Intel gladly shelled out $15.3 billion, the second-largest deal it has ever made, to buy Mobileye NV (Nasdaq: MBLY) – the developer of that ADAS technology I described above – pretty much proves it. This deal – again, a $15.3 billion deal – demonstrates the huge value created by tech firms that establish a strong foundation in connected and self-driving cars. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) forecasts 12 million fully autonomous vehicles leaving factories each year by 2035, with an even larger figure of partially autonomous vehicles doing the same. In dollar terms, we're talking about a $42 billion market by 2025… and $77 billion by 2035. To work as promised, these cars will need catlike reflexes and the smarts of a supercomputer. Intel sees its purchase of Mobileye as a foundation to create a "server on wheels." Like I showed you, Mobileye's systems help cars "see" and process all the visual data around them. A lot of this tech is already on the road. Keeping a car in its own lane even if the driver is distracted is just one of the safety payoffs that Mobileye and other ADAS developers provide. I recommended Mobileye to you folks on March 31, 2015. I noted that many automakers – Audi AG, Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F), General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), Tesla Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA), and Volvo AB among them – had turned over the keys of their driverless vehicle programs to Mobileye. If you acted on my recommendation, you're sitting on gains of 44%. Samsung Pulls Out Its Checkbook Mobileye wasn't the only big winner I picked in this space. Back in December 2015, we saw how Harman International Industries Inc. had basically pioneered auto tech innovation. I noted that "3D navigation, multimedia systems, Bluetooth integration, smart apps for mobile users… even cloud-computing services for the car," were all developed by Harman. And I recommended it as a way to capitalize on this unstoppable trend. Fast-forward to November 2016 – and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (OTC: SSNLF) moved to buy Harman for $8 billion, handing investors a 28% one-day gain when the deal was announced. Like Intel, Samsung has no desire to become an automaker. But these firms do want to play a major role in bridging the worlds of transportation and technology – of Detroit and Silicon Valley. And the fastest way to build a strong presence here is to write a very large check… The Next Big Play With those big deals in place – and money in our pocket – let's turn our focus to the best pick in the connected and driverless vehicle space right now. Delphi Automotive Plc. (Nasdaq: DLPH), which started out as an auto-parts subsidiary of GM, now develops and markets hundreds of small components and systems that work together to seamlessly provide the ADAS tech that is appearing in more and more new cars and trucks. Delphi also provides a broad range of other systems, including powertrains, dashboards, safety gear, and security devices. But in a sure sign of this firm's commitment to the car of the future, it has shifted more than 5,000 engineers – fully one-fourth of its R&D staff – to develop the hardware and software needed to stay on the leading edge of ADAS… the "prologue" to fully autonomous cars. Delphi's $16.6 billion sales base makes it perhaps the key tech supplier of the auto industry. It counts just about every major nameplate as a customer. So if we look at Delphi as an acquisition target, we know it won't end up in the hands of one of those automakers. But in the tech sector – where firms like Intel and Samsung are seeking to dominate the "car of the future" space – Delphi represents something of a crown jewel. So don't be surprised if a Silicon Valley or East Asian tech powerhouse goes after it. Let's get one thing clear, though. I'm not suggesting you get caught up in Wall Street's mergers-and-acquisitions rumor mill. That's a lousy strategy almost guaranteed to lose you money. What happens to most retail investors is they pile in on a rumor, and when the expected merger fails to come through, the stock gets pounded. There's only one way I know of to pick good merger candidates: Select big winners in breakout tech sectors that promise to hand you market-crushing gains. Then think of any merger that follows as icing on the cake. But you need good "cake" in the first place. Delphi has a great deal of current momentum as well. Fourth-quarter profits of $1.83 a share were nearly 15% ahead of forecasts. Robust profits helped this firm post a 74% return on equity in 2016, among the highest of any firm in the auto parts industry – or any other industry for that matter. Delphi Automotive opened today at $81.50, and the firm has a market value of $21.4 billion. Shares trades for less than 12 times projected 2018 profits, a roughly 35% discount from the S&P 500. I'm projecting 30% gains over the next 24 to 28 months – and that's a conservative projection. No, that's not based on any buyout offer we might see. Instead, Delphi is a great stock to have in your portfolio, because it's looking at a lot of growth in an unstoppable tech trend. It's good cake.

Future Intel CPUs could be cobbled together using different parts Intel could tap a new high-speed interconnect to join different chips together to make future CPUs. Gordon Mah Ung (PC World (US online)) on 29 March, 2017 10:30 0 - - - - print email IDG Today’s processors, made using a single continuous slab of silicon, may soon give way to multiple chips interconnected at high speeds, Intel said Tuesday morning. Intel said its new Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge, or EMIB, technology would let a 22nm chip connect to a 10nm chip and a 14nm chip, all on the same processor. “For example, we can mix high-performance blocks of silicon and IP together with low-power elements made from different nodes for extreme optimization,” said Intel’s Murthy Renduchintala, who heads the Client, IoT, and Systems Architecture Group. That’s a radical departure from how the company has constructed most CPUs and SoCs, where all components of a CPU or SoC are built on the same process. Renduchintala didn’t commit EMIB to any particular upcoming SoC or CPU but said it was clear the tech would play a large role in near-term and long-term products from Intel. Renduchintala said EMIB can hit “multi hundreds of gigabytes” speeds while reducing latency by four times over traditional multichip techniques. “It’s truly a transformational technology for Intel,” he said. Intel Today’s CPUs are monolithic designs with all of the functionality built on the same process technology. With EMIB, Intel could build the CPU and graphics cores on a bleeding-edge 10nm process and keep lower-performance components on 14nm. Still other parts that might actually benefit from being fabbed on, say, the 22nm process, such as power circuits, could stick to the larger process. At one point Intel dabbled with integrating the voltage regulation into the CPU with its 4th-gen Haswell and 5th-gen Broadwell chips. With 6th-gen Skylake and 7th-gen Kaby Lake though, the integrated voltage regulation was yanked, which some believed was due to problems scaling the fully integrated voltage regulator down to 14nm. An EMIB version could potentially keep the FIVR at 22nm. Intel Future CPUs from Intel could fuse together multiple process technologies. It isn’t the first time Intel has considered fusing two chips together in one CPU. The original Pentium Pro design was a multichip package as was the Core 2 Quad series of CPUs. EMIB is far more advanced though, and is constructed within the silicon itself. A traditional multichip package design runs wires through the substrate that the chips are mounted to. That limits the amount of wires and speeds they can run at. Another method is to use a silicon interposer to connect the dies. While this yields high wire density and high performance, it’s expensive to manufacturer. EMIB essentially makes it far easier to combine chips without giving up much of the performance. Intel Intel says its Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge is more cost effective than methods that use an interposer to connect chips and offers far better performance than multichip package designs. Although Intel made a point of highlighting EMIB at its technology and manufacturing day for press and financial analysts, this isn’t EMIB’s first use. Intel actually introduced it with the Altera Stratix 10, which used EMID to construct the SoC. Intel Intel is already fabbing the Altera Stratix 10 by joining together multiple chips using its new EMIB interconnect.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface.

Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too!

Add A Comment If you are a registered member of the X.Org Foundation, you have until 11 April to cast your ballot for this year's elections. There are five members competing for a spot for four seats up for renewal this year on the X.Org Foundation Board of Directors. There is also a vote for the membership agreement for updating it to better reflect the role of the X.Org Foundation. The five candidates for this year's elections are Matt Turner (Intel), Martin Peres (Intel), Daniel Vetter (Intel), Rob Clark (Red Hat), and Taylor Campbell (MIT). The elections are running a bit behind schedule as at first they didn't have enough candidates to fill the available slots. The elections run from today through 11 April. If you are a registered X.Org member, be sure to vote as some years they have come close to not meeting quorum during the elections. More details on the X.Org 2017 elections via this Wiki page.

Official Intel 7th-gen Kaby Lake Review: One big change makes up for smaller... Ryzen review: AMD is back Video Nvidia's mighty GeForce GTX 1080 Ti cranks PC gaming to 11 Today’s processors, made using a single continuous slab of silicon, may soon give way to multiple chips interconnected at high speeds, Intel said Tuesday morning. Intel said its new Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge, or EMIB, technology would let a 22nm chip connect to a 10nm chip and a 14nm chip, all on the same processor. “For example, we can mix high-performance blocks of silicon and IP together with low-power elements made from different nodes for extreme optimization,” said Intel’s Murthy Renduchintala, who heads the Client, IoT, and Systems Architecture Group. That’s a radical departure from how the company has constructed most CPUs and SoCs, where all components of a CPU or SoC are built on the same process.  Renduchintala didn’t commit EMIB to any particular upcoming SoC or CPU but said it was clear the tech would play a large role in near-term and long-term products from Intel. Renduchintala said EMIB can hit “multi hundreds of gigabytes” speeds while reducing latency by four times over traditional multichip techniques. “It’s truly a transformational technology for Intel,” he said. Intel Today’s CPUs are monolithic designs with all of the functionality built on the same process technology. With EMIB, Intel could build the CPU and graphics cores on a bleeding-edge 10nm process and keep lower-performance components on 14nm. Still other parts that might actually benefit from being fabbed on, say, the 22nm process, such as power circuits, could stick to the larger process. At one point Intel dabbled with integrating the voltage regulation into the CPU with its 4th-gen Haswell and 5th-gen Broadwell chips. With 6th-gen Skylake and 7th-gen Kaby Lake though, the integrated voltage regulation was yanked, which some believed was due to problems scaling the fully integrated voltage regulator down to 14nm. An EMIB version could potentially keep the FIVR at 22nm. Intel Future CPUs from Intel could fuse together multiple process technologies.  It isn’t the first time Intel has considered fusing two chips together in one CPU. The original Pentium Pro design was a multichip package as was the Core 2 Quad series of CPUs. EMIB is far more advanced though, and is constructed within the silicon itself. A traditional multichip package design runs wires through the substrate that the chips are mounted to. That limits the amount of wires and speeds they can run at. Another method is to use a silicon interposer to connect the dies. While this yields high wire density and high performance, it’s expensive to manufacturer. EMIB essentially makes it far easier to combine chips without giving up much of the performance. Intel Intel says its Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge is more cost effective than methods that use an interposer to connect chips and offers far better performance than multichip package designs. Although Intel made a point of highlighting EMIB at its technology and manufacturing day for press and financial analysts, this isn’t EMIB’s first use. Intel actually introduced it with the Altera Stratix 10, which used EMID to construct the SoC. Intel Intel is already fabbing the Altera Stratix 10 by joining together multiple chips using its new EMIB interconnect.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   “Why would I?”: Defying Democrats, Devin Nunes won’t recuse himself from Russia probe posted at 2:01 pm on March 28, 2017 by Allahpundit Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES The frenzy over Nunes’s mysterious visit to the White House grounds increasingly (and ironically) seems to parallel the frenzy over the underlying probe into Trump associates’ contacts with Russia. It smells fishy, but when push comes to shove, no one can say what wrongdoing supposedly occurred. But that’s the point of recusal, right? When that fishy smell starts to permeate an investigation, calling its credibility into question, you clear it out by asking the source of it to step away. The question in Nunes’s case is whether there’s now a sufficient appearance of impropriety — irrespective of whether actual impropriety occurred — to compel him to stand aside as chairman of the House Intel Committee in this matter. Yup, say Democrats, predictably. Nope, says Nunes, and Trey Gowdy, and Paul Ryan, predictably. Here’s Nunes defending himself during a scrum with reporters in the Capitol hallway this morning. Taken in isolation, I don’t think Nunes’s trip to the White House grounds (specifically, the executive office building) to review executive-branch intel on whether Trump associates were incidentally surveilled and “unmasked” would have seemed fishy. It’s the other decisions he made surrounding that decision that make it seem suspicious. Why didn’t he bring Adam Schiff or some other Democrat on the Intel Committee along with him? Why did he call a press conference the next day to announce his findings before he’d informed the other Committee members of what he’d found? Why did he then go running off to the White House to brief Trump personally? This is the House’s de facto chief investigator into the Russiagate matter, which involves the question of whether Russian officials were coordinating with Trump associates during the campaign. Even if, as Nunes claims, the incidental intel he reviewed about surveillance of Trump transition staffers is unrelated to Russiagate, it still makes for strange optics under the circumstances to have him assisting Trump on an intelligence matter. Is he a White House surrogate or the head of an adversarial committee in a rival, independent branch charged with checking the president? For that matter, as Michael Warren asked, why did Trump need Nunes to brief him on the material Nunes had found on incidental surveillance? If that intel was on the White House grounds, on executive-branch servers, it was already available to Trump’s team. They could have found it and briefed the president on it at any time. And how did Nunes supposedly get into a secure facility in the executive office building, on the White House grounds, without anyone on Trump’s staff knowing he was there or signing him in, as Nunes claims? Compounding all of these suspicions is the fact that Nunes was a member of Trump’s transition team and thus has a bit more allegiance to Trump than the average member of Congress. You don’t have to reach far to cook up a theory in which it was actually Team Trump that discovered the intelligence on incidental surveillance and then, instead of publicizing it themselves, decided to hand it off to Nunes to reveal it publicly in order to make it seem as though a neutral congressional investigator had discovered it. There’s nothing inherently improper about that — after an avalanche of accusatory leaks against him, go figure that Trump and his team might want to do a little leaking themselves — but again, as the head of a Committee that’s pursuing an investigation that may implicate people in the White House, it’s bizarre that Nunes would call his own independence into question by doing the White House that favor. If it happened that way, that is. But if it did, if Nunes really was willing to publicize intel the White House had handed him as a favor to Trump, what reason is there to think he’ll pursue the Russiagate inquiry diligently if it happens to lead to someone in the White House? This is why Democrats want him out. Here’s Lindsey Graham marveling at Nunes’s “Inspector Clouseau” investigation.

Twitter Facebook Intel digs deep to keep Moore's Law alive Intel is changing the way it measures process technology advancements in a bid to hang on to Moore's Law Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 29 March, 2017 08:19 - - - - print email Comments The landmark Moore's Law observation, which is now more than 50 years old, keeps shapeshifting as the physical challenges of making smaller chips mounts. Many scientists agree that Moore's Law is dying, but Intel is clinging on to it for dear life. It has been Intel's guiding light for making chips smaller, faster and cheaper. Now, Intel is changing the way it measures process technology advancements, which will help the company continue to boast about hitting key Moore's Law metrics in terms of economics and the shrinking of chip sizes. Primarily, the company is changing the way it measures logic transistor density, using a wider cell width. "Moore's Law is not dead, at least not for us," said Stacy Smith, Intel's executive vice president leading manufacturing, operations and sales, during an event to talk about manufacturing in San Francisco on Tuesday. At its heart, Moore's Law states that the cost of making chips goes down while the capabilities go up. Intel's interpretation of Moore's Law has changed multiple times. Initially, Intel was doubling transistors every 18 months, which then expanded to two years. On its most recent 14-nanometer process, that time line expanded to three years. With the new measurements, Intel will be able to boast that its manufacturing improvements are surpassing Moore's Law. The company also said it would cut the manufacturing cost per transistor by half with each new manufacturing process, which is in line with Moore's Law. But there are caveats to the new metrics. Intel is making multiple changes and introducing more chip architectures on each manufacturing process, and advancing to new processes at a slower pace. Later this year, Intel will start making chips using the 10-nm process, which is being projected to last for roughly three years. After that the company will move to 7-nm, and Smith said there is "visibility" to the 5-nm process. Rival fabs are now catching up with Intel, which had a manufacturing advantage for more than a decade. Samsung is making 10-nm chips for mobile devices, with one example being Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 -- though Intel says its latest 14-nm chips are as good as the 10-nm chips from Samsung and GlobalFoundries. Intel's reformulation of Moore's Law metrics is an attempt by the company to make up for lost time and a messy move to the 14-nm process from the previous 22-nm process, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64, who was at the Tuesday event. Manufacturing issues on 14-nm in early 2014 meant Intel couldn't achieve the cost or transistor density it wanted. As the 14-nm process matured, Intel started hitting those metrics, and had to press the restart button on its Moore's Law projections. Chip advances have also contributed to reconsideration of the metrics. "There is an amount of reasonableness to it," Brookwood said, saying Intel remains ahead of rivals on chip density. Intel has an advantage on gate and metal pitches, giving its chips more density. Intel will continue to deliver new PC and server chip architectures every year, with a minimum 15 percent performance improvement per generation. Coming next will be 8th Generation Core chips made on the 14-nm process, an unprecedented fourth chip architecture on the process technology. Intel will also be releasing PC chips code-named Cannon Lake based on the 10-nm process later this year. That could create a scenario where Intel has 14-nm and 10-nm PC chips hitting the market at the same time. That could create issues in the branding of chips and confusion among buyers looking to acquire the latest and greatest Intel processors. Intel last month said it will stress performance benefits to chip buyers, while playing down the role of process technology. For the past few years, Intel has moved away from the once-famous "tick-tock" scaling, where new processes were "ticks" and new architectures were "tocks." It is switching to what the company calls "hyperscaling" advances, a new metaphor announced on Tuesday to describe manufacturing advances. Intel will now use the "+" and "++" symbols to mark advances in the 14-nm and 10-nm processes. Hyperscaling will help Intel cram new architectural and process innovations without hurrying a move to a new manufacturing process. New lithography techniques like quad-patterning will help Intel take advantage of the economic benefits described by Moore's Law, said Kaizad Mistry, vice president and co-director of logic technology development at Intel. That will improve transistor density, which also brings performance and power-efficiency enhancements. Intel is projecting 15 percent improvements in performance with each advance in the 10-nm + and ++ processes. Intel will also reduce the chip size to pack I/O, logic and SRAM blocks into a much smaller area. Intel is doing what the company calls "aggressive pitch scaling," which involves packing wires, transistors and 3D fins closer together. On the 10-nm process, that helps provide transistor density improvement that is 2.7 times better than the 14-nm process, an advance that Intel said is well above the Moore's Law average. The chip maker is also bringing the ability to mix and match different cores into an integrated system-on-chip. The cores could be made using different manufacturing processes. It's also much how ARM chips are designed and made, a process that integrates CPUs, modems, graphics processors and other cores into a single chip. Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter!

Many scientists agree that Moore's Law is dying, but Intel is clinging on to it for dear life. It has been Intel's guiding light for making chips smaller, faster and cheaper. Now, Intel is changing the way it measures process technology advancements, which will help the company continue to boast about hitting key Moore's Law metrics in terms of economics and the shrinking of chip sizes. Primarily, the company is changing the way it measures logic transistor density, using a wider cell width. "Moore's Law is not dead, at least not for us," said Stacy Smith, Intel's executive vice president leading manufacturing, operations and sales, during an event to talk about manufacturing in San Francisco on Tuesday. At its heart, Moore's Law states that the cost of making chips goes down while the capabilities go up. Intel's interpretation of Moore's Law has changed multiple times. Initially, Intel was doubling transistors every 18 months, which then expanded to two years. On its most recent 14-nanometer process, that time line expanded to three years. With the new measurements, Intel will be able to boast that its manufacturing improvements are surpassing Moore's Law. The company also said it would cut the manufacturing cost per transistor by half with each new manufacturing process, which is in line with Moore's Law. But there are caveats to the new metrics. Intel is making multiple changes and introducing more chip architectures on each manufacturing process, and advancing to new processes at a slower pace. Later this year, Intel will start making chips using the 10-nm process, which is being projected to last for roughly three years. After that the company will move to 7-nm, and Smith said there is "visibility" to the 5-nm process. Rival fabs are now catching up with Intel, which had a manufacturing advantage for more than a decade. Samsung is making 10-nm chips for mobile devices, with one example being Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 -- though Intel says its latest 14-nm chips are as good as the 10-nm chips from Samsung and GlobalFoundries. Intel's reformulation of Moore's Law metrics is an attempt by the company to make up for lost time and a messy move to the 14-nm process from the previous 22-nm process, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64, who was at the Tuesday event. Manufacturing issues on 14-nm in early 2014 meant Intel couldn't achieve the cost or transistor density it wanted. As the 14-nm process matured, Intel started hitting those metrics, and had to press the restart button on its Moore's Law projections. Chip advances have also contributed to reconsideration of the metrics. "There is an amount of reasonableness to it," Brookwood said, saying Intel remains ahead of rivals on chip density. Intel has an advantage on gate and metal pitches, giving its chips more density. Intel will continue to deliver new PC and server chip architectures every year, with a minimum 15 percent performance improvement per generation. Coming next will be 8th Generation Core chips made on the 14-nm process, an unprecedented fourth chip architecture on the process technology. Intel will also be releasing PC chips code-named Cannon Lake based on the 10-nm process later this year. That could create a scenario where Intel has 14-nm and 10-nm PC chips hitting the market at the same time. That could create issues in the branding of chips and confusion among buyers looking to acquire the latest and greatest Intel processors. Intel last month said it will stress performance benefits to chip buyers, while playing down the role of process technology. For the past few years, Intel has moved away from the once-famous "tick-tock" scaling, where new processes were "ticks" and new architectures were "tocks." It is switching to what the company calls "hyperscaling" advances, a new metaphor announced on Tuesday to describe manufacturing advances. Intel will now use the "+" and "++" symbols to mark advances in the 14-nm and 10-nm processes. Hyperscaling will help Intel cram new architectural and process innovations without hurrying a move to a new manufacturing process. New lithography techniques like quad-patterning will help Intel take advantage of the economic benefits described by Moore's Law, said Kaizad Mistry, vice president and co-director of logic technology development at Intel. That will improve transistor density, which also brings performance and power-efficiency enhancements. Intel is projecting 15 percent improvements in performance with each advance in the 10-nm + and ++ processes. Intel will also reduce the chip size to pack I/O, logic and SRAM blocks into a much smaller area. Intel is doing what the company calls "aggressive pitch scaling," which involves packing wires, transistors and 3D fins closer together. On the 10-nm process, that helps provide transistor density improvement that is 2.7 times better than the 14-nm process, an advance that Intel said is well above the Moore's Law average. The chip maker is also bringing the ability to mix and match different cores into an integrated system-on-chip. The cores could be made using different manufacturing processes. It's also much how ARM chips are designed and made, a process that integrates CPUs, modems, graphics processors and other cores into a single chip. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Intel will depend on rivals like ARM for its contract chip manufacturing business Dean Takahashi@deantak March 28, 2017 2:05 PM Tags: Arm, Intel, Intel foundry, Will Abbey, Zane Ball Above: Intel foundry panel: (left to right) Zane Ball of Intel; Will Abbey of ARM; Lip-Bu Tan of Cadence; Aart de Geus of Synopsys; and Siva Yerramilli of Intel. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Intel’s push into the foundry business, or making chips for other companies, is increasingly taking it into the arms of traditional rivals. The world’s biggest chip maker can invest as much as $10 billion in a single chip factory, and it has a vested interest in making sure that the factories stay fully optimized. Making chips for other companies ensures that the factories will stay busy. As the demand for Intel’s own chips made for the PC slows down, it makes sense for Intel to diversify and add more partners who can use the capacity of its chip factories. That means Intel is working with ARM, which on the microprocessor side has been a rival of Intel’s for many years. ARM creates designs that Intel’s rivals use to create their products. But now ARM chips will soon be made in Intel’s factories. Intel talked a lot about thecost advantage it will have with its 10-nanometer manufacturing coming this year at an event in San Francisco. That production node will lead to a bigger foundry business later this year. ARM is collaborating with Intel on a manufacturing technology, and it could be a compelling path for high-volume products, said Will Abbey, senior vice president of sales and strategic alliances at ARM. “It’s unquestionable that Intel has great technology,” Abbey said. “An important thing in foundry is a customer-centric mindset. We’re pleased that as we’ve asked questions of Intel, Intel has responded very well.” Abbey said that ARM has been pleasantly surprised at how Intel has openly worked with ARM to make sure that the chip design tools from third parties work properly with Intel manufacturing. By the end of the year, Intel will have its first 10-nanometer manufacturing process in place. That will be used to make the chips for ARM’s customers. “People will see if all of our work has been smoke and mirrors or if it is real,” Abbey said. Aart de Geus, CEO of design software firm Synopsys, said that you don’t get a second chance to make a good impression on customers. He said that he was pleased with the things he heard from Intel today about its progress on 10-nm production. Not many companies have the ability to invest in advanced chip manufacturing tech, he said. “We are going into an era where everything is smart,” de Geus said. “The cost is not at all the issue. We need computation that is 10 or 100 times better. So many parties have new ideas for software, if you can support them with the hardware, you will be in a good spot.” Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of design tool maker Cadence Design Systems, said that any time a chip designer has to do a rework because of a hardware bug, it severely slows down a business. So he said working out those bugs early will be critical in the foundry market. Zane Ball, an Intel vice president, said, “It takes the ecosystem coming together to make the foundry business successful. We only succeed when companies like yours work together.” It makes for Intel to be in the foundry business in one respect. Ten years ago, there were 18 companies that built leading-edge factories. Today, there are only four. Intel’s rivals in high-end foundry work include Global Foundries, Samsung, and TSMC. David Kanter, analyst at Real World Tech and the Microprocessor Report, said in an interview that the challenge for Intel is that there are relatively few large customers that it doesn’t compete with. Nvidia uses TSMC, while Qualcomm uses Samsung. And because those design companies compete with Intel, they are not likely to use Intel’s foundry services. Kanter said that the main target that Intel could target is Apple, which uses Samsung. That could generate a lot of business for Intel, if Apple builds its A series chips using Intel’s factories.

It's called Optane Memory and it takes the form of a chip that fits into the M.2 slot on your computer's motherboard. The basic principle, at least in layman's terms, is that it combines the reliability of the DRAM memory everyone plugs into the motherboard with the speed of the NAND memory at the heart of SSD drives. Around this time next month, you'll be able to get Optane Memory in two forms: a 16GB stick for $US44 and 32GB for $US77. There's no Australian pricing as of yet, but the general idea is that you'll be able to get a traditional 1TB or greater hard drive and an Optane chip for less than what a speedy M.2 SSD would set you back. But what is the benefit, exactly? Optane's purpose is to function as a cache drive, remembering regularly accessed data even when you exit a program or your PC is turned off. By doing so, the process of loading data is greatly improved: Intel says games can launch up to 67 per cent quicker and browsers launch five times faster than a computer without as an example. Optane memory will work with any hard drive though, not just oldschool ones, although there's no real-world benchmarks available for anything right now. The real kicker is that Optane memory will only work with Intel's Kaby Lake line of CPUs and compatible motherboards, if you're fortunate enough. There's still a lot of unanswered questions around Optane, however. For one, there's no real-world benchmarks so nobody can test the claim on whether games really do load 67 per cent faster. And it's not known what other cases Optane might be worthwhile. Could streamers and YouTubers get enough performance pairing Optane memory with a traditional hard drive, rather than having to shell out for a RAID setup or an expensive 1TB SSD? And what would Optane do for laptops? On top of that, there's legitimate questions over whether Optane will be of any use for gamers. If you're already investing in a Kaby Lake system, you're paying the sort of money that warrants buying a M.2 SSD (or at least a normal SSD) to go with it. Optane won't support anything bar Windows 10 either, so if you haven't upgraded you'll be completely left out of the loop. And as it stands, you can only pair a single drive to Optane memory, it doesn't support RAID configurations, and 32GB isn't a whole lot of space especially considering the size of some games. Optane chips will officially become available from April 25. Large, consumer-grade capacity Optane SSDs won't be available until the end of the year, if not 2018. Reviews will start dropping around launch as well, so we'll be able to see just how much of an impact Optane really has.

I had this setup and the performance increase was very noticeable once it had started caching the right things. Then inevitably the ssd died and it was horrible :( Reply 0 thearbiter117 @thearbiter117 Mar 29, 2017, 12:04pm oh goody. google chrome will open in 0.24 seconds now instead of 0.38. put me down for 30 sticks of this. i know it says five times faster but we all also know thats bullshit. it will be good in 5-10 years when this doesn't cost 70x as much as a HDD or 20x the cost of an SSD per GB. I think you might have a part backwards in the first paragraph. Shouldn't it be saying 'combining speed of DRAM with reliability of NAND' because isn't the whole point of this that its non volatile unlike RAM but getting close to the speed of it? Reply 0 James @jamesh Mar 29, 2017, 12:37pm So getting past all the marketing this is just a new form of non volatile RAM that is faster than the NAND flash found in most SSDs. It's being sold in a much smaller capacity than other SSDs probably due to either cost or production or current manufacturing capacity. So instead they're marketing it as an SSD cache for a traditional hard drive. You will need Intel's drivers to achieve this, but they're only providing drivers for Windows 10. Further more, the drivers will refuse to function if they don't detect the the latest generation of Intel CPU because Intel doesn't want you to buy an AMD Ryzen. Does that cover everything? Reply 0 jerichosainte @jerichosainte Mar 29, 2017, 1:41pm This has already been done in the form of hybrid drives... Seems pointless in the current marketplace. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Mar 28, 2017 at 5:00PM In this segment from Motley Fool Money, Chris Hill welcomes Seth Jayson, Andy Cross, and Ron Gross to the radio show to discuss the major deal announced earlier this month between chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and autonomous vehicle tech company Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). Given Intel's well-publicized plans to transform its business, this full-speed investment in the driverless car industry will be important to follow. But did the company overpay? A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 17, 2017. Chris Hill: Deal of the week goes to tech giant Intel, which agreed to buy Mobileye for the tidy sum of $15.3 billion in cash. Mobileye is in the business of autonomous driving and accounts for about 70% of the global market for anti-collision systems. They've got the money over at Intel, Andy. But even though they have the money, this price raised some eyebrows. Andy Cross: Yeah, I didn't know if you said "tidy" or "tiny." For Intel, it is relatively tiny. They have $17 billion in cash, and this is a $15 billion deal. Intel does $10 billion in earnings. So it's less than two years of earnings for Intel. So in the big picture, for Intel, which does $60 billion in sales, Mobileye is a really small fish. It was all about the growth, Chris, and thinking about where their market is going. Intel has been down this road before. They did make a very large acquisition of McAfee in 2011 for more than $8 billion, and now they're probably going to end up writing some of that down. They announced last fall that they're going to be selling off part of it to TPG at a valuation half of what they paid for it. So they'll write some of that down. They did make a big acquisition last year, for another $15 billion, of Altera. So these are two back-to-back $15 billion deals that we haven't yet seen; we'll have to see. It will take years for this to play out on the return for Intel shareholders. Seth Jayson: Yeah, tough to figure out exactly what the price tag meant. I know Andy did some valuation work on this a while ago; so did I. When I did it, it looked like they would have to be selling their product into every car in the world, except there would have to be more cars selling every year than there actually are for it to even begin to make sense. So they're counting on that technology expanding a lot, or getting something else out of it, perhaps mapping data. Some people have been throwing that around, I don't know if I buy it. Cross: Yeah, interesting. They paid 40 times sales, which is an extraordinary amount, but Mobileye has been growing at 50% a year, but five years ago, it was growing at 100% a year. So we have seen steadily declining rates. Again, plug it into the Intel family, and maybe they can get a better return for their buck. Remember, we were just talking interest rates earlier. Intel, that $17 billion is making nothing for Intel shareholders. So maybe they're thinking this is a better return on their money than what they can get from keeping that cash on the books. Ron Gross: So they'll break even in about 20 years or so if the growth rate continues. That sounds awesome. Cross: Yeah, if it doesn't work out, it is a relatively small write-off for Intel shareholders. Not a reason to make the acquisition, of course, and hopefully it doesn't work out for Intel shareholders, but it's a relatively little bet for Intel. Jayson: You have to look like a player in self-driving; otherwise all the other kids are going to make fun of you. Cross: Sure. Gross: Uber has it. Hill: Well, that's the thing. This is not a little start-up company. As I mentioned in my opening read, Mobileye has 70% of this market, and they're still not selling enough, to Andy's point, 40 times sales, they're still not making enough to make this look like anything other than an overpayment for their business. Jayson: You're just not optimistic enough about the future. Andy Cross has no position in any stocks mentioned. Chris Hill has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Intel: Our 10-nanometer chips will cost 30% less than the competition’s Dean Takahashi@deantak March 28, 2017 12:45 PM Tags: chip manufacturing, chips, Intel, Kaizad Mistry Above: Kaizad Mistry of Intel at tech event in San Francisco. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Intel said that it will introduce a 10-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process for its chips this year that will give it a 30 percent cost advantage, as well as a performance advantage over its rivals. While Qualcomm announced earlier this year it was shipping a 10-nm processor in 2017 (based on a Samsung manufacturing process), Intel said that rivals aren’t using the same terminology as it does. Intel claimed that on every technical measure, from gate pitch to the number of transistors that can be put in a given area, it has an advantage. Kaizad Mistry, corporate vice president in Intel’s logic technology group, echoed other executives in saying Intel’s 10-nm process, which will hit volume production this year, will be better than competitors’. He spoke at a press event in San Francisco. Intel competes with rivals such as Global Foundries, TSMC, and Samsung in manufacturing chips. Intel’s product rivals, such as Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices, use those manufacturers to make their competing chips. Above: Intel is on the blue path, and rivals are behind on the red path, in this Intel graph. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi/Intel A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and it only takes four silicon atoms in a crystal lattice to make one nanometer. In a 10-nm process, the circuits are only 10 nm apart. This should be easy to measure, and Intel called for a standard measurement for the industry, but the other companies in the industry are using a different description, Intel fellow Mark Bohr said during the event. Intel said that it is still living up to the prediction of Moore’s Law, the prescient forecast made by Intel chairman emeritus Gordon Moore in 1965. Moore predicted the number of transistors on a chip would double every couple of years, and the industry has done that. By doubling the transistor count so regularly, the electronics industry has reaped huge benefits. “People have been saying that Moore’s Law is dead for years, and the industry has always proved them wrong,” said Dan Hutcheson, chip analyst and CEO at VLSI Research in San Jose, Calif. Above: Progress on Moore’s Law is intact, but not always steady. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi/Intel By putting miniaturizing transistors, Intel can put more of them in the same space. Each transistor is smaller and closer to each other, which reduces the distance an electronic signal must travel. That makes the chip faster. It also reduces cost, as it takes less material to make a given number of transistors on a chip. So when Intel moves from one generation to another, like from 14-nm chips to 10-nm, the chips get smaller, cheaper, and faster. Intel executive vice president Stacy Smith said that if every industry had moved forward on the same line as the chip industry has, we would be able to travel to the sun on a single gallon of gas, feed the world’s population on a square kilometer of land, and travel at 300 times the speed of light. When Intel didn’t move to 10-nm chips earlier, a number of industry observers worried that Intel was falling off the pace of Moore’s Law and that electronics progress would slow down as a result. But today, Intel executives said that, while it is taking longer for the company to get to 10-nm chips, those chips will have 2.7 times the transistor density of the previous generation, instead of the usual two times every couple of years. And so Intel says it remains on the predicted path in the long run. In other words, Moore’s Law isn’t foreordained. It is dependent on engineering advances that aren’t completely predictable from generation to generation, but have happened remarkably regularly over time. “This is really, really important,” said Mistry. “The economic benefits of Moore’s Law are intact.” Intel credits “hyper scaling” for extracting the full cost per transistor benefit of advanced patterning schemes. The Moore’s Law advances would not be possible without a combination of advances such as self-aligned double patterning. This technique uses a spacer material to create features on a chip with half the original lithographic pitch, allowing better pitch scaling than another prevailing method (dubbed litho-etch-litho-etch, or LELE). Intel is also using multiple dimensions to pack the electronics more efficiently. The 10-nm technology will use Intel’s third generation of FinFET (something Intel called tri-gate in the past) manufacturing. First introduced in 2011, FinFET is a transistor structure that takes advantage of three dimensions in a logic gate (which consists of transistors). This method improves performance and reduces power consumption over the traditional planar transistor used by the industry before 2011. Intel has a gate pitch of 54 nm, which Intel says is the tightest metal pitch (distance between circuits) in the industry, Mistry said. Hutcheson at VLSI Research said he agreed that, based on Intel’s presentation, it appears to be a generation ahead of its rivals. We asked Qualcomm for comment, and we have not had a response yet. But one Intel rival sent us a message. “We are pleased to see competitors following our lead with the introduction of low-power 22nm processes. Almost two years ago, we launched our 22FDX FD-SOI technology for wireless, battery-powered intelligent systems,” said Alain Mutricy, senior vice president of product management group at Global Foundries. “We chose FD-SOI over bulk planar or FinFET because it provides the best combination of performance, power and area for these applications. Our process is fully qualified for production and we are seeing strong customer demand, with more than 50 active engagements in high-growth areas such as mobile, IoT, and automotive.” Intel plans to use its manufacturing prowess to serve other chip design companies. It is operating as a foundry, where it makes chips designed and sold by other companies. Murthy Renduchintala, president of a number of Intel businesses, said that Intel is pursuing more customers for that business. He also said that Intel’s chip designers also have to innovate with chip designs in order to take advantage of the manufacturing advantage. “Our strategy isn’t based on one golden arrow,” Renduchintala said. “We have to count on multiple golden arrows.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

The update revolves around two new updates: firstly Intel’s Xeon E3 v6 (or 7th generation Core) processors featuring the Kaby Lake microarchitecture, but also secondly NVIDIA’s Quadro professional graphics cards powered by the Pascal architecture. The new ThinkStation P320 systems inherit form-factors and price-points from the previous-generation ThinkStation P310, but offer higher performance due to newer CPUs and GPUs as well as faster M.2 SSDs. The machines will be available starting from late April. The Lenovo ThinkStation P320-series tower and SFF workstations are based on Intel’s C236 PCH, which relates back to the new Xeon E3 v6 announced today. Variants of the P320 using Intel’s 7th generation Core i3/i5/i7 processors without ECC memory and other advantages that Xeon CPUs provide will also be available. The workstations support up to 64 GB of DDR4-2400 memory, two M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD (up to 1 TB each) as well as up to 2/4 (SFF/tower) 3.5” storage drives or up to 3/4 (SFF/tower) 2.5” SSDs/HDDs. When it comes to I/O capabilities, both tower and SFF machines are equipped with a 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0 module (Intel's AC8265), gigabit ethernet, USB 2.0/3.0 ports, DisplayPort and D-Sub outputs and so on. Just like other ThinkStation computers from Lenovo, the P320 workstations support the company’s Flex Modules (up to four per machine) that can add a Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.1 Type-C connector, a 29-in-1 card reader, a FireWire port, a slim ODD or an eSATA header to the front panel of the PC. Gallery: Lenovo ThinkStation P320 Family Traditionally, graphics is what divides Lenovo’s big and small workstations. The tower version of the ThinkStation P320 can support up to two NVIDIA’s Quadro P4000 professional graphics adapters featuring the GP104GL GPU (1792 stream processors, up to 105 W TDP) with 8 GB of GDDR5 memory each. Meanwhile, the SFF flavor of the ThinkStation P320 supports up to two low-profile Quadro P1000 cards based on the GP107GL GPU (640 stream processors, 47 W TDP) with 4 GB of memory. The new Quadro video cards featuring the Pascal architecture represent a significant upgrade for Lenovo’s entry-level workstations as current-gen ThinkStation P310 machines are shipped with Kepler-based Quadro K1200 introduced over two years ago (and based on an architecture from 2014).

Meanwhile, if the systems are ordered primarily for 2D and business applications, Lenovo can also equip them with appropriate NVIDIA NVS multi-monitor graphics cards. Gallery: Lenovo ThinkStation P320 Tower Since there are still customers who use Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating system and who intend to do so for a while, Lenovo offers Windows 7 x64 on its ThinkStation P320-series workstation by downgrading the Windows 10 Pro x64. Since the official support for Windows 7 does not exist for the new Kaby Lake CPUs, Lenovo allows customers to install appropriate Skylake processors – either the Xeon E3 v5 or the 6th generation Core i3/i5/i7. Gallery: Lenovo ThinkStation P320 SFF Lenovo plans to start selling the ThinkStation P320 Tower and the ThinkStation P320 SFF in late April. Pricing of the products is still being finalized, but it should be consistent with the previous generation P300-series workstations, the company told us. At present, the ThinkStation P310 Tower and the ThinkStation P310 SFF start at $719, and we expect the P320 to be similar.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Lenovo boosts the VR capability of its… Lenovo boosts the VR capability of its ThinkStation P-Series with latest refresh By Kevin Parrish — March 28, 2017 10:00 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Designers and content creators looking for a new workstation that supports high-quality virtual reality now have a new option with Lenovo's latest ThinkStation refresh. Lenovo is expanding its family of workstations capable of delivering high-quality virtual reality with the launch of its new ThinkStation P320 solution. Revealed during the Develop3D Live event on March 28, it’s actually a refresh of the ThinkStation P310 tower and small form factor desktop workstations. The internals have been updated with the latest Intel Xeon processors, the most recent Nvidia Quadro graphics cards, and more. Here are the hardware details of the new P320 refresh: Form factors: Tower and Small Form Factor Processor options: Intel Xeon E3-1200 v6 Intel Seventh-Generation Core i3/i5/i7 Operating system: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Windows 7 Pro 64-bit Ubuntu Red Hat Enterprise Linux Graphics (SFF): Up to 2x Nvidia Quadro P1000 cards Graphics (Tower): Up to 1x Nvidia Quadro P4000 card Memory: Up to 64GB DDR4 @ 2,400MHz (four slots) Storage Types: 3.5” SATA 3 7,200RPM HDD up to 4TB 3.5” SATA 3 7,200RPM Hybrid up to 2TB 2.5” SATA 3 SSD up to 2TB M.2 PCIe SSD up to 1TB Storage capacity (Tower): 4x 3.5” HDD or Hybrid (16TB max) 4x 2.5” SSD (8TB max) 2x M.2 PCIe SSD (2TB max) Storage capacity (SFF): 2x 3.5” HDD or Hybrid (8TB max) 3x 2.5” SSD (6TB max) 2x M.2 PCIe SSD (2TB max) Power supply: 210 watts (85-percent efficient) 250 watts (85 percent efficient) 400 watts (92 percent efficient) Connectivity: Wireless AC (Intel 8265) Bluetooth 4.0 PCI / PCIe Slots: 1x PCI3 x16 1x PCI x4 (x16 mechanical) 2x PCIe x1 Ports (front): 2x USB 3.1 Gen1 (5Gbps) 1x Microphone jack 1x Headphone jack 1x 29-in-1 SD card reader (optional) 1x 9-in-1 SD card reader (optional) 1x eSATA port 1x 1394 IEEE Firewire port Ports (back): 4x USB 3.1 Gen1 (5Gbps) 2x USB 2.0 1x Serial (optional) 1x VGA 2x DisplayPort 1x Ethernet 1x Audio line-in 1x Audio line-out 1x Microphone line-in Flex module options (supports up to 4): Thunderbolt 3 Type-C 9.0mm Slim optical drive SD card reader 1394 IEEE Firewire eSATA Tower dimensions: 6.9 x 16.8 x 14.8 inches Small Form Factor dimensions: 4.0 x 15.5 x 13.3 inches As with the older ThinkStation P310 models, owners can customize the P320 refresh before making the final purchase. Unfortunately, Lenovo didn’t provide specific seventh-generation Intel Core CPU information at the time of this publication. However, the company did produce a rather lengthy list of preloaded software for Windows 10 and Windows 7, so don’t expect a clean, bloat-free “Signature Edition” install right out of the box. More: Lenovo’s Yoga 720 packs gaming-grade graphics into a 2-in-1 “Offering Pro VR certification gives those working in industries where the workstation is already recommended a more accessible avenue into VR,” Lenovo said Tuesday. “This certification gives ThinkStation P320 users an opportunity to add virtual reality more easily into their workflow without requiring an initial high-end hardware and software investment.” Lenovo didn’t provide pricing, but as a point of reference, the ThinkStation P310 tower workstation has a starting price of $719 and is based on the Core i3-6100, i5-6500, and i7-6700 processors. The small form factor version has the same starting price, but offers a much larger processor selection. Expect the same customization capabilities with Lenovo’s new P320 workstation refresh.

Mark Bohr, an Intel fellow, said at a press event in San Francisco that “heterogeneous integration” will be a bigger part of the future for the world’s biggest chip maker. That means Intel will have two silicon chips, each known as a “die,” in a single package, which includes all of the electrical connections to the rest of a computer system. In the past, a standard multi-chip package had the problem of having too much wiring to connect all of the connections in the die to the package. It was also inefficient at connecting one die to another die. Above: Intel’s solution for connecting two chips in a single package. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi One solution in the past was to use a “silicon interposer,” Bohr said. That meant you could use a third chip underneath the two main chips. The purpose of the chip was to connect the devices more easily, but that had a higher cost. With Intel’s solution — an embedded multi-die interconnect bridge — the company has figured out how to do this more efficiently, with low-cost and better connections between the chips and from the chips to the packages. Intel is preparing to launch a 10-nanometer manufacturing process for its newest chips coming this year. The company believes that it has the most advanced chip manufacturing in the world and that it is a generation ahead of its rivals. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and it only takes four silicon atoms in a crystal lattice to make one nanometer. In a 10-nm process, the circuits are only 10 nm apart. Bohr said that packaging two chips in one package is going to be a part of how Intel can keep driving technological progress forward. Above: Three options for packaging two chips in one package.

Razer Blade Pro swims in the deep end of Kaby Lake by Wayne Manion  12:30 PM on March 28, 2017 Just six months after introducing the pretty awesome Blade Pro 17.3" gaming laptop, Razer is updating it with an Intel seventh-generation Core i7-7820HK unlocked CPU. The rest of the high-end hardware in the machine is pretty much the same, topped off with an RGB-LED-illuminated keyboard stuffed with Razer's proprietary low-profile mechanical switches. The processor upgrade is the biggest change, with the Intel Skylake Core i7-6700HQ giving way to the aforementioned Core i7-7820HK. Razer says the CPU can be easily overclocked to 4.3 GHz using the company's Synapse utility. The company stopped short of saying the 4.3 GHz figure was guaranteed, or whether the overclock settings would be available if Razer's servers went down again. In any case, the new processor sports four cores with SMT, a base clock of 2.9 GHz, and a boost clock of 3.9 GHz. The CPU crunches data pulled from the machine's 32 GB of 2667 MT/s DDR4 memory. The Blade Pro's screen is the same IGZO-supplied 3820x2160 4K unit as before. The panel's refresh rate tops out at 60Hz, but G-Sync variable refresh rate technology helps make the most of each of those precious cycles. An Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card pushes pretty pixels to that high-spec screen. Good sound goes hand-in-hand with impressive visuals, and Razer says the Blade Pro has that covered as well. The company says the refreshed notebook is the first THX-certified gaming laptop. Storage comes in the form of three different PCIe RAID configurations, ranging in total capacity from 512GB to 2TB. The Blade Pro is a laptop in the year 2017, so it has no optical drive. Bits and bytes have to have some way into the storage system, though. In this case, most of that data will flow through the three USB 3.0 jacks and single Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C port. Or perhaps through the Killer Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.1 network adapters. The heavy-hitting hardware is fed by a 99 Wh battery and an included "slim, sleek" 250 W wall charger, which we assume buyers will want to carry with them at all times. The aluminum chassis is the same one as before, measuring 16.7" x 11" x 0.88" (42 cm x 28 cm x 2.4 cm). The Razer Blade Pro weighs in at 7.69 lbs. (3.5 kg). That hefty weight could be offset somewhat by the machine's ability to remove at least $4000 from buyers' wallets when it ships in April. On a related note, gamers will be able to earn Razer's zSilver currency by running Razer software on the Blade Pro. The points can be used to purchase Razer accessories, including this amazing RGB LED-illuminated mug warmer.

Enterprise ITServer Back to Home Intel gives traditional hard drives a speed boost with Optane Memory Increase / Decrease text size Byomakesh Biswal   - Senior Reporter 28th March 2017 Add to favorites Intel Optane memory is claimed to provide uncompromising system responsiveness for large capacity storage drives. Intel has introduced Optane modules designed to boost the performance of desktop PCs and improve the daily computing experience. Intel Optane memory allows PCs to deliver more performance and faster load times across a range of personal computing experiences. The chip maker claims that the memory module will allow new levels of PC responsiveness from compute-intensive engineering applications to high-end gaming, digital content creation, web browsing and day to day office productivity applications. Powered by a seventh-generation Intel Core processor, Intel Optane memory increases the speed of application, game or large file loading. Optane memory will increase the speed of a traditional hard disk drive-based PC by 28%, with up to 14 times faster storage performance. Common apps like the Chrome browser or Microsoft Outlook should load five to six times faster, Intel said. The company said that games can start up to 67% faster, and load levels up to 65% faster. Read more: Microsoft commits to using ARM server chips in challenge to Intel’s data centre dominance Intel Optane Memory devices will be initially sold in 16GB and 32GB capacities on 24 April, for prices of $44 and $77, respectively. Optane-equipped systems from PC makers such as Dell, HP, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and others will arrive throughout the second quarter of this year. Intel SVP & GM for the Client Computing Group Navin Shenoy said: “This new innovation in memory, with 7th Gen Intel Core processor-based PCs, and other Intel technologies are paving the way for the future of computing. “These advancements change the way we interact with our devices and the world around us, from gaming to virtual reality and everyday productivity. It’s never been a more exciting time for the PC industry.” Manufacturers such as Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, ASRock and others are currently offering over 130 Intel Optane memory ready motherboards. The chip maker’s Optane Technology is a combination of 3D XPoint memory media, Intel Memory and Storage Controllers, Intel Interconnect IP and Intel software.

The world’s biggest chip maker runs its business on Moore’s Law — the prediction in 1965 made by Intel chairman emeritus Gordon Moore that the number of transistors on a chip will double every year. And at an event in San Francisco, Intel executive vice president Stacy Smith said that Moore’s Law is on track as the company moves to 10-nanometer manufacturing, where the width between circuits is 10 billionth of a meter. “Our cost per transistor is coming down at a slightly faster rate than historical,” he said. “Moore’s Law is alive and well. We are taking bigger steps. We have a three-year lead over the industry.” Above: Intel’s view of how small chip circuits are. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The chip industry has been on the metronome of Moore’s Law for decades, and that progress has delivered computing power in a smartphone that once took a whole room of computers. Smith said that if every industry had moved forward on the same line as the chip industry has, we would be able to travel to the sun on a single gallon of gas, feed the world’s population on a square kilometer of land, and travel at 300 times the speed of light. Qualcomm has previously announced it was using a 10-nanometer manufacturing process, created by Samsung, for its new Snapdragon 835 processors. But Intel believes that it has the most advanced chip manufacturing in the world and that it is a generation ahead of its rivals. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and it only takes four silicon atoms in a crystal lattice to make one nanometer. In a 10-nm process, the circuits are only 10 nm apart. A virus is about 100 nm in length. Smith, who’s the executive vice president of manufacturing, operations, and sales, said at the press event that Intel hasn’t lost its lead. Rather, he said that the new 10-nm process from rivals is equivalent to Intel’s 14-nm process introduced three years ago. Mark Bohr, Intel senior fellow, said at the event that the density of transistors that rivals can pack in a 10-nm chip the same number of transistors as Intel can in a 14-nm chip. Intel is planning on delivering “true” 10-nm chips later this year. This essentially means that Intel has a 30 percent cost advantage at any given time. “They can give it whatever node name they want, and we can agree that node names have lost their meaning,” he said. It costs about $10 billion to build a brand new chip factory. To equip a modern factory with equipment, it takes about $7 billion in investment in equipment. Over the past five years, Intel has invested $50 billion in manufacturing. A decade ago, there were 18 companies that had a leading-edge chip factory, Smith said. Now there are only four: Intel, Global Foundries, Samsung, and TSMC. “We are pleased to see competitors following our lead with the introduction of low-power 22nm processes. Almost two years ago, we launched our 22FDX FD-SOI technology for wireless, battery-powered intelligent systems,” said Alain Mutricy, an executive at Global Foundries, in a statement. “We chose FD-SOI over bulk planar or FinFET because it provides the best combination of performance, power and area for these applications. Our process is fully qualified for production and we are seeing strong customer demand, with more than 50 active engagements in high-growth areas such as mobile, IoT, and automotive.” Intel has 100,000 employees worldwide. There are 50,000 in the U.S. and a total of 30,000 working in manufacturing. Intel invested $7 billion in the U.S. from 2011 to 2015, and its contribution to the U.S. gross domestic product is $90 billion a year.

We saw the launch of Kaby Lake on the consumer desktop in January, with quad-core parts up to 4.0 GHz coming to retail. The Xeon E3 launch will be in the similar vein to previous years, designed for entry-level workstations, small business servers and storage servers, and Intel’s main comparisons for these Xeons will be to replace similar builds that are more than three years old. A total of eight processors will be launched today under the E3 v6 name, with some models receiving a corresponding low-power version later down the line. All desktop replaceable CPUs will be using the LGA1151 socket, the same as the previous generation E3 v5 Xeons.

This is the ‘professional’ version of the HD630 we see on the consumer parts, using Intel’s latest Gen9 graphics architecture and supporting H.265 encode/decode. Our Kaby Lake review piece goes into more detail. The high-end E3 v6 parts will have a maximum base frequency of 3.9 GHz base and a 4.2 GHz turbo. All the parts listed have a full 8MB of L3 cache, and either be 72W for non-IGP models or 73W for IGP parts. As with other previous Xeons, these come with ECC memory support, vPro and other technologies Intel files under the professional level. In Intel’s presentations, Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) are included, however TSX (Transactional Extensions) were not listed.

For Skylake E3 v5 parts, this was either a C232 or C236 chipset – we reviewed a few motherboards with these on (ASRock E3V5 Gaming, GIGABYTE Z170X-Extreme ECC). With a BIOS update, these C232/C236 motherboards should support the new v6 processors. For the E3 v6 line, Intel is not releasing new chipsets, deciding to stick with the C232 and C236 models. This means that users wishing to upgrade their E3 v5 system will have to wait for a BIOS update in order for the new CPUs to work. We have yet to receive word if the standard motherboard manufacturers are launching a new series of motherboards for this generation, however we suspect that several will do so. With the no new motherboard chipsets being launched, it is, therefore, odd that Intel is announcing Optane Memory support with the E3-1200 v6 Xeons. This essentially means that Optane Memory support is already baked into the chipset, and it is merely a firmware approval of a CPU and chipset combination in order for it to be enabled. Intel states that only select E3-1500M v6 (mobile) and E3-1200 v6 (desktop) configurations will be available for use with Optane, and may only be provided on an OEM basis.

Prices of the new parts are equivalent to the last generation. To call out a big elephant in the room: Intel has more competition in this space than in previous years. Intel gives value to Xeon processors above consumer products, but Ryzen could potentially be an alternative to Intel. Aside from AMD, some of the positioning that Intel puts forward with the E3 could be taken up by Intel’s Atom offerings, Xeon-D, or even musings from ARM partners on new silicon designs. All being said, Intel is still expected to have the peak single thread performance for general purpose compute, and has the larger install base of customers and ready-to-go platforms. Performance per watt will be a key metric to monitor as well. We have the E3 v5 processors in for testing on our new CPU test suite, and we hope that the E3 v6 units will arrive in due course. Stay tuned for those.  Gallery: E3-1200v6 Press Slide Deck Related Reading: Intel Launches 4/8S Broadwell-EX Xeons: E7-4800 v4 and E7-8800 v4 Families The Intel Xeon E5 v4 Review: Testing Broadwell-EP With Demanding Server Workloads Broadwell E3 v4 Xeons: Cirrascale at SuperComputing 15 Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

I wonder if it'd be possible to do the same thing with Ryzen 7 CPUs? Reply Kvaern1 - Tuesday, March 28, 2017 - link They get to be Xeons when they have ECC support and a few other non core features and go through addional QA. Or in other words, no. Reply r3loaded - Tuesday, March 28, 2017 - link You mean the ECC support that's present on the die but deliberately gimped by Intel on their desktop branded parts. Yeah, still (largely) a rebranding exercise to charge more for the same silicon. Reply Yojimbo - Tuesday, March 28, 2017 - link That ECC support wouldn't be there at all without these Xeon processors existing. It's not like the ECC support comes for free. It is bought and paid for and the cost is applied to the market that demands it. If not, the Core processors would lose competiveness because of higher cost and Intel would lose money by trying to serve the market for these Xeon processors. If that was the only other option they simply would choose not to bring these processors and the ECC that comes with them to market. Reply prisonerX - Tuesday, March 28, 2017 - link Wow, checking a parity bit, so expensive! Probably a quarter of the die, hey? Reply Yojimbo - Tuesday, March 28, 2017 - link I'm sure there's more to the difference between the Xeon and the Core chips than ECC support. That was just the particular example the previous poster mentioned. Do you think customers who buy Xeons are stupid or have no pricing power? Neither are true. The cynics in this forum just don't understand the metrics that are important to these companies. Reply fazalmajid - Tuesday, March 28, 2017 - link And yet AMD manages to include ECC support for free in Ryzen, not just Naples. It's price-gouging market segmentation by Intel, nothing less. Reply Yojimbo - Tuesday, March 28, 2017 - link AMD also has almost no data center business to speak of. Yeah, these companies are stupid and are just throwing their money away. Even worse than your implication of that is your abuse of the term "price-gouging". Reply duploxxx - Wednesday, March 29, 2017 - link and that is because of? right the old staggering way of IT business, go with the known brand. 0 open mind. we have sold thousands of workstations and servers with opteron. Even today we still have the opteron in portfolio and selling it. 16 cores 6380 is still a bargain vs 8 real intel cores for same price. But yet in many countries its just not done even at a time when the price/perf was really in favor of opteron. Reply cbm80 - Wednesday, March 29, 2017 - link Oh yeah, Intel would definitely exit the server market if they couldn't charge for ECC. It's such a tiny, unprofitable market for them, it wouldn't be worth their time.

Date: 2017-03-29Author: kopitiambot (Source: arstechnica.com) The response to AMD’s Ryzen processors with their new Zen core has been more than a little uneven. Eight cores and 16 threads for under $500 means that they’re unambiguously strong across a wide range of workloads; compute-bound tasks like compiling software and compressing video cry out for cores, and AMD’s pricing makes Ryzen very compelling indeed. Further Reading AMD’s moment of Zen: Finally, an architecture that can compete But gaming performance has caused more dissatisfaction. AMD promised a substantial improvement in instructions per cycle (IPC), and the general expectation was that Ryzen would be within striking distance of Intel’s Broadwell core. Although Broadwell is now several years old—it first hit the market way back in September 2014—the comparison was relevant. Intel’s high-core-count processors—both the High End Desktop parts, with six, eight, or 10 cores, and the various Xeon processors for multisocket servers—are all still using Broadwell cores. Realistically, nobody should have expected Ryzen to be king of the hill when it comes to gaming. We know that Broadwell isn’t, after all; Intel’s Skylake and Kaby Lake parts both beat Broadwell in a wide range of games. This is the case even though Skylake and Kaby Lake are limited to four cores and eight threads; for many or most games, high IPC and high clock speeds are the key to top performance, and that’s precisely what Kaby Lake delivers. In spite of this, reading the various reviews around the Web—and comment threads, tweets, and reddit posts—one gets the feeling that many were hoping or expecting Ryzen to somehow beat Intel across the board, and there’s a prevailing narrative that Ryzen is in some sense a bad gaming chip. But this argument is often paired with the claim that some kind of non-specific “optimization” is going to salvage the processor’s performance, that AMD fans just need to keep the faith for a few months, and that soon Ryzen’s full power will be revealed. Both parts of this reaction are more than a little flawed. It’s actually a really good gaming processor It’s true that Ryzen’s gaming performance doesn’t match Intel CPUS. If your interest is solely and exclusively gaming performance, then Intel’s Kaby Lake i7-7700K is the best chip on the market, and its price is in the same ballpark as the cheapest Ryzen, the 1700. Not even the top-end 1800X can beat the 7700K. But the 7700K is the fastest all-round gaming processor on the market today. Being “not as fast as the 7700K” doesn’t make a processor “bad” for games. It just means it’s not quite as fast as literally the fastest gaming processor ever made. For the most part, the differences between the processors are academic. In almost every case, the difference between the Ryzen and the Kaby Lake is that one has a slightly lower, but still very playable, framerate than the other. If benchmarks were showing that the Intel chips are consistently above, say, 60 frames per second while the AMD chips were consistently below, then, certainly, a good argument could be made that the Intel processor will provide a smooth gaming experience where the AMD one won’t. But generally, that’s not the case. Even where the gap is quite substantial, such as Rise of the Tomb Raider, where we saw 135fps on both the Kaby Lake i7-7700K and the (eight-core/16-thread) Broadwell-E i7-6900K, the 1800X managed 110fps. That speed is still comfortably playable. Tech Report saw even more extreme differences in Doom in OpenGL mode; 170fps for the 7700K, just 123fps for the 1800X; Tech Report doesn’t include the 6900K, but the 10-core/20-thread 6950K achieves 156fps. The 1800X certainly gives up some fps, but it remains perfectly playable. Switch to the newer Vulkan API instead of OpenGL and the difference evaporates away, with both the 7700K and the 1800X averaging 165fps. The 6950X, for what it’s worth, is slightly behind at 161fps. This is why we concluded that the 1800X was a very solid alternative to the Broadwell-E 6900X—it offers very comparable performance at less than half the price. Even for gaming, it remains a worthy contender: Ryzen is “good enough that you may well be willing to take the performance hit in some programs so that you can enjoy the big wins in others.” That’s all well and good for the games of today, but what about the games of the future? As games become more demanding, there may become a point at which the 7700K is just at the threshold of “playable framerates” and the 1800X falls short. Doesn’t that make the 1800X a bad buy? Predicting the future is an inexact science, and it’s impossible to say for certain how games of the future will behave. We can, though, make some educated guesses while recognizing that Ryzen has some features that make it a little unusual. The often made argument that software of today isn’t “optimized” for Ryzen isn’t quite right. Not because software is, in fact, optimized for Ryzen, but because it assumes a model of software optimization that doesn’t really correspond to real software. Sure, games aren’t optimized for Ryzen, but equally, they’re not really optimized for Broadwell, Skylake, or Kaby Lake. They’re just optimized in general to run faster across the board. But there is nonetheless optimization and improvement to be done.

The Optane Memory drives are meant for caching and come in capacities of 16GB and 32GB which cost $44 and $77 respectively. The Optane memory modules come in a PCIe Gen 3.0×2 M2.2280 single sided form factor and Intel currently targets them mainly for high end gamers. Using Intel Rapid Storage Technology it’s possible to pair the Optane memory with a HDD or SSD and access it like a single volume. Files needed for important tasks are recognized and stored on the Optane memory. Frequently used files and applications are also monitored and also stored on the Optane memory to increase performance. To use the Optane memory a PC has to be “Intel Optane Memory Ready” which means it has to be powered by a Kaby Lake CPU with a 200 series chipset and a compatible M.2 2280 slot with 2 or 4 PCIe lanes. Intel claims that there are currently 130+ Intel Optane Memory Ready motherboards currently available from ASRock, Asus, EVGA, Gigabyte and MSI. In Q2 this year also other mainboard vendors should follow. Intel Optane memory will be available for preorder from today and will ship to consumers from the 24th of April.   Related Forum: Related Tags: optane intel You've got to read this!

Intel and Micron jointly developed 3D Xpoint, branded as Optane, to bridge the gap between DRAM and NAND. While DRAM is fast, it's also volatile, and will lose data when powered down. NAND memory retains its data without power, but can't match the speed of DRAM. Optane is a new storage solution that promises to be non-volatile, and maintain high performance. The consumer version of Optane will be available for purchase on April 24 in 16GB and 32GB versions initially. They will cost $44 and $77, respectively, which is several times more expensive per gigabyte than traditional high end SSDs. That price will buy you a rated sequential read speed of (up to) 1350 MB/s, and a random read speed of (up to) 240000 IOPS. The 32 GB version also boasts a read latency of just 9 µs, and a slightly less impressive sequential write speed of (up to) 290 MB/s. Although the speeds are several times faster than current generation consumer SSDs, there is a major caveat: the consumer Optane drives can only be used as cache drives. You will not be able to install Windows or your favorite apps directly onto the drives. Instead, the SSD will act as a buffer for commonly accessed data and improve access speed. Intel claims a 2x faster boot time, 28% faster system performance, 65% faster game level loads, and that applications like the Chrome browser may launch up to 5x faster. In order to use the first wave of Optane SSDs, you will need to be running Windows 10 with Intel's latest gen Kaby Lake processors and a supported 200 series motherboard chipset.

Its recent deal to buy Mobileye signals that Intel hopes to print profits from autonomous vehicles, but will it work? Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Mar 28, 2017 at 10:23AM Will Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) benefit from driverless cars? The likely answer just a month ago would have been "maybe." However, in the wake of Intel's recent deal to acquire Israeli-based self-driving-car component maker Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) for $15.3 billion, the answer today has become a resounding "yes." Here's why. Image source: Intel.  Intel's Mobileye buyout changes everything Intel had, for some time, eyed the rise of self-driving cars as a major commercial opportunity. As the company loves to describe the trend in its promotional material, passenger and commercial vehicles will transform into "data center on wheels" with the rise of driverless cars. This transition will require massive amounts of additional computing resources in areas including connectivity, data-center processing, and artificial-intelligence software. Intel already produces solutions in one form or another for each of these computing tasks. However, adding Mobileye gives Intel an opportunity to move further into the car by owning the processing technology that will control the actual driving function in autonomous vehicles. This will also allow Intel to create an end-to-end self-driving vehicle solution for the automotive industry, an economic opportunity Intel CEO Brian Krzanich estimated could be worth $100 billion between in-car and data-center opportunities by 2030.  Image source: Intel.  Does this make Intel a buy? With so far to go before self-driving cars change lanes into the mainstream, handicapping the impact this deal could have on Intel is guesswork. In a big-picture sense, though, the deal makes sense for Intel, even if it did have to pay a pretty price to make it happen. Critics of the deal note that Intel valued the company at more than 130 times its current earnings; one sell-side analyst's note chided, "Since when have so few spent so much to buy so little?" Moreover, Intel has botched large-scale acquisitions in the past. In 2010, the company spent $7.6 billion to acquire security-software provider McAfee, a deal that created essentially no growth for the company and ultimately led Intel to Intel sell McAfee to private-equity firm TPG last year for $4.2 billion. However, beyond issues with the valuation, this deal makes sense for Intel, which badly needs to tap into new growth markets. Sales of personal computers, which accounted for 55% of Intel sales last year, declined another 5.7% in 2016, according to research firm IDC. Analysts see Intel's revenue increasing just 0.9% this year and 2.4% next year. Of course, Intel is a mature company, so expecting robust sales growth from it isn't fair. However, with the company having plateaued using its current strategy, the chipmaker needed to take some kind of action to remain relevant as several emerging technologies vie to become the next great generational growth driver, as smartphones were in the past decade. Though Intel does carry a fair amount debt, financing also doesn't appear to be an issue. Credit-rating agencies Moody's and Fitch have already given the deal their blessings, as it pertains to Intel's credit rating. Although Intel paid a steep price for Mobileye, inaction would have been worse. This is a big, bold bet that Intel can tap into a space where only a handful of component suppliers operate. Combining Mobileye's existing technology and partnerships with Intel's scale and resources should make both formidable competitors in what figures to be a massive global market. As such, the Mobileye deal should help Intel profit from the dawn of self-driving cars, even if the deal does carry some noteworthy risks in the process.

The technology, known as Intel Optane Memory, is a specialised chip storage chip that sits in the M.2 storage slot on a motherboard, and comes as standard on boards designed for Intel's latest generation of Kaby Lake processors. It is currently available in 16GB or 32GB variants, providing a blisteringly fast cache that is able to increase the speed of older spinning hard drives. The memory module is capable of enhancing multiple aspects of a machine's performance, but most interestingly it promises to make hard drive access speeds up to 14 times faster. That means a traditional 1TB 7200RPM hard drive would be twice as responsive during daily tasks. Overall system performance would also increase by up to 30%, and actions like opening a clean browser would happen up to five times faster. Typically, processors can only access data as fast as the storage device will allow, which is often dependent on recall speeds and the transfer rate over the motherboard's connectors. By placing the memory module between the processor and SATA-based storage devices, such as hard drives or SSDs, it is able to store data and commonly-used programs in close proximity to the processor. The technology then chains together memory and storage into a single virtual drive that is accessible to the OS, which then uses Intel's Rapid Storage Technology to accelerate the rate at which actions can be performed, and prioritise the services you use most often. This has the effect of increasing start and boot times, file searching, multitasking, and the launching of applications. RAM has traditionally filled the role of storing frequently-used data for the processor to quickly access, but that technology is expensive to create at high capacities. Despite its name, Intel Optane Memory does not replace current RAM modules found on PC motherboards, nor does it act in the same way to power applications. Instead, the module is an optional performance enhancer that helps you squeeze the most out of current technology. While Intel has confirmed Optane Memory will boost the speeds of SSD storage, the biggest benefits will come from its effect on older hard drives that are generally much slower. Intel Optane Memory is set to launch on 24 April, priced at $44 and $77 for 16GB and 32GB respectively, although Intel has yet to reveal pricing and availability for the UK market. The technology is only compatible with Intel's 7th generation Core i3, i5 and i7 processors, or Intel 200 series chipsets on desktop PC configurations, although laptop and notebook support will be available later.

The Xbox One’s latest model, the Xbox One S, comes in the default white color with a slick white controller to match; the PlayStation 4 has a glacier white color available as of January, and PC gamers will soon be able to take a shot at nabbing one the limited edition Trident 3 Arctic rigs! MSI first released the Trident 3 Gaming PC at the beginning of this year to critical acclaim, with reviews giving nods towards the unit’s price, power, and compact form factor which helps make it a VR-ready console alternative that can do a lot more. The Trident 3 Arctic doesn’t just come with a new color scheme though, it also houses a customized GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card and uses the latest Intel Kaby Lake processor to get performance levels far above its similarly-sized console counterparts. The Trident 3 Arctic’s customized MSI GeForce® GTX 1070 graphics card in ITX format outshines any ITX reference cards found in other small form factor PCs. Built with an Intel Core i7 processor and combined with the stronger graphics card, the Trident 3 Arctic can fully support the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. MSI made it super easy to connect a VR headset by implementing VR Link, an HDMI-port on the front side of the system, supported by MSI’s One-click to VR software that automatically optimizes both system performance and prevents any software from impacting the VR experience. MSI also crafted a unique way to keep the system as cool and quiet as possible despite the smaller form factor for the Trident 3 by individually cooling the most important heat-generating hardware in the system using separated chambers. When performance really matters, Trident 3 Arctic is up to the task and delivers powerful gameplay without annoying gamers with a noisy fan or overheating hardware. MSI Trident 3 VR7RD-048US Specifications Arctic Specs Processor Intel® 7th gen Core™ i7-7700 @3.6GHz Chipset Intel® H110 Graphics MSI GeForce® GTX 1070 8GB GDDR5 Memory 16GB (2x SO-DIMMs DDR4 2400Mhz) Max up to 32GB Storage 1x 256GB M.2 SSD + 1x 1TB 7200RPM HDD Power supply 330W Power Adapter I/O FRONT: 1x Earphone, 1 x Microphone jack, 1x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C, 2x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A (one supports super charger 2), 1x VR-Link (HDMI Out) REAR: 1 x Microphone / Line-in / Line-out, 1x RJ45 LAN, 1x USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A, 4x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x HDMI out, 1 x DC jack, 1 x VR-Link (connect front VR-Link and graphic card) And last but not least, for gamers and power users looking to add a little personal touch to their system, MSI’s Trident 3 Arctic features RGB Mystic Light.

It all began with the Optane DX P4800X SSD for data centres but this week, Intel is launching something more consumer-oriented. In April, Intel will begin shipping Optane Memory in 16GB and 32GB flavours. Before you get the wrong idea, these aren’t RAM kits, instead Optane Memory iis more like a M.2 cache drive, intended to give your PC a big boost in storage performance. This new Optane Memory comes in 16GB and 32GB variants and aim to offer performance boosts to a broad range of PC-related tasks. This will include things like faster load times for frequently used applications, faster boot times, faster file searching and even faster loading times within games. According to Intel’s own stats, a stick of Optane Memory can increase storage performance by up to 14 times. Meanwhile, games may launch up to 67 percent faster, with levels loading around 65 percent faster. Unfortunately, we don’t know which games were used to obtain these numbers but we do know that a traditional HDD was used. Optane Memory uses the M.2 slot on your motherboard but there are some limitations. These drives run using Intel’s Rapid Storage Technology, so an Intel CPU is necessary, on top of that, you will need an ‘Optane Ready’ Z270 motherboard, which further limits use to Kaby Lake machines until newer CPUs start coming out. Intel’s Optane Memory arrives on the 24th of April. The 16GB drive will retail for $44 while the 32GB version will cost $77. KitGuru Says: It looks like Intel is trying to apply its new 3D XPoint technology wherever it can. It will certainly be interesting to see how much of a boot a 16GB or 32GB cache drive can bring.

The notebooks are available across all online retailers and channel partners at a starting price of Rs. 76,990 and is available in two exclusive colors Rose Gold and Quartz Gray. Weighing only 1.2kg, it is also one of the slimmest and lightest 13.3-inch clamshell notebooks with an Intel Core i series performance processor in the market. It has a gorgeous, ultra-sleek full aluminum chassis yet weighs just 1.2Kg and is incredibly thin at just 13.5mm. The laptop boasts of a powerful 7thGen Intel Core i processor (i7-7500/i5-7200), 13.3-inch QHD+ 3200x1800 display powered by ASUS' proprietary Splendid Display Technology, reliable Backlit Keyboard and Next-Gen USB 3.1 Type C connectivity. It features an unbelievably long lasting 12 hours Battery life, which is one of the longest for any 13.3-inch display notebooks and comes with the standard two years global warranty. Its QHD+ 3200x1800 display has one of the highest resolutions of any notebook with a 13.3-inch display, with 40 percent more pixels than any other brand in the market. The laptop packs in powerful components with the latest seventh Generation Intel Core i7 processor, fast connectivity with 802.11ac Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.1, up to 8GB of high speed 1866MHz memory, a 512GB SSD, a next-gen USB Type-C port, high resolution display, high speed SSD all in a compact design.

ASUS' elite ZenBook range was developed in 2011 as the company's thinnest and lightest laptops, created using the latest technologies and using premium materials like anodized aluminum alloys. During the first ZenBook's inception, the engineers wanted a minimalist design based on Zen principles that would evoke a sense of 'comfort' and 'balance'. In search for these, the engineers drew inspiration from a Swiss watch and Japanese Zen garden. They designed the ZenBook's tapering lid and keyboard sections to look like the slender, elegant hands of a mechanical watch when viewed from their side profiles; and the hairline concentric circles etched on the surface of their lids to mimic the raked gravel circles of a calming Zen garden. The ZenBook series always had a thin-and-light clamshell model with integrated graphics; and this, the ZenBook UX330, is the latest in this 'Essential' ZenBook series.

Aimed at increasing application access speed for slower SATA-based storage solutions (HDDs, SATA SSDs, SSHDs), it uses the same 3D Xpoint memory media technology utilized in the server series, and comes in two flavours: 16GB and 32GB. In essence, it is a low capacity storage device, intended for use as a cache drive. Using this module, Intel boasts "2x faster boot time, 28 percent faster system performance, 65 percent faster game level loads", in no small part due to where this memory is placed. It fits right into an M.2 slot on supported motherboards, thus sitting right between the processor and storage media. In order to make use of this module, you must have a supported seventh generation Core series system with one of these processor and chipset configurations: Processor Family Supported SKUs Supported Chipsets 7th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 Intel® Core™ i7-7700 Intel® Z270 Intel® Core™ i7-7700K Intel® Q270 Intel® Core™ i7-7700T Intel® H270 Intel® Q250 Intel® B250 7th Gen Intel® Core™ i5 Intel® Core™ i5-7400T Intel® Z270 Intel® Core™ i5-7400 Intel® Q270 Intel® Core™ i5-7500 Intel® H270 Intel® Core™ i5-7500T Intel® Q250 Intel® Core™ i5-7600T Intel® B250 Intel® Core™ i5-7600K Intel® Core™ i5-7600 7th Gen Intel® Core™ i3 Intel® Core™ i3-7101E Intel® Z270 Intel® Core™ i3-7101TE Intel® Q270 Intel® Core™ i3-7100T Intel® H270 Intel® Core™ i3-7100 Intel® Q250 Intel® Core™ i3-7350K Intel® B250 Intel® Core™ i3-7320 Intel® C236 Intel® Core™ i3-7300 Intel® Core™ i3-7300T A full list of compatible motherboards can be found on the official site. To make use of this technology, your SATA-based storage device needs to have Windows 10 64-bit installed, formatted as GPT have "at least 5MB of continuous unallocated space at the end of the boot volume". According to Intel the naming convention was chosen because: Intel® Optane™ memory concatenates memory and storage into one virtual drive visible to the OS with an optimized system interconnect, that uses smart software (Intel® RST) to accelerate performance and responsiveness of the PC. It is called memory because it utilizes a new memory media to store information closer to the processor similar to the function of system DRAM memory. The 16GB and 32GB modules will be available starting April 24, for $44 and $77, respectively (according to AnandTech), with OEM systems using these either of the two slated for launch during "Summer 2017". More information on the technology behind these two products can be found on Intel's dedicated section on the official website.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Facebook Hires Apple Hardware Veteran to Lead VR Product Roadmap for Oculus | Main | Apple Granted 45 Patents Today Covering the Apple Watch Charger and Original iOS Virtual Elements & Multitouch » March 28, 2017 Will Apple introduce Intel's new Optane Memory in Next-Gen Macs this year?   Today, the way most people are dealing with their storage needs is through traditional hard drives. In fact, 79 percent of desktop PCs still use hard disk drives as the primary storage. But while a hard drive may address the storage issue, it also slows down a system and makes it feel less responsive. No one likes to wait. Waiting for games, movies, videos, hi-res photos or large files in your Outlook inbox to load is just plain frustrating.   Yesterday Intel announced that Optane memory module (16GB and 32GB) for desktops will be available beginning April 24 for customers who want to install them in their Intel Optane memory ready motherboards or systems. In addition, starting in the second quarter of this year, PC manufacturers like HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Acer and others will begin shipping both consumer and commercial products equipped with Intel Optane memory.   This new innovation in memory, with 7th Gen Intel Core processor-based PCs, and other Intel technologies are paving the way for the future of computing. These advancements change the way we interact with our devices and the world around us, from gaming to virtual/augmented/mixed reality and everyday productivity. It's never been a more exciting time for the PC industry.   What are the advantages of Optane? To put it in perspective, on a given day, most people launch 11 apps, and then launch each app seven times. With the increased speed and responsiveness of Intel Optane memory in a 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processor-based system, you can power on your computer up to twice as fast and improve overall system performance up to 28 percent faster with storage performance up to 14x faster.2,3 Applications like Microsoft Outlook* will launch up to nearly 6x faster, the Chrome* browser launches up to 5x faster, games launch up to 67 percent faster, and levels load up to 65 percent faster.   Whether Apple's next-gen desktops and MacBooks will take advantage of this advancement is unknown at this time. However, last year we posted a report tilted "Intel's Insanely Fast Optane SSDs will be Compatible with Macs when it Debuts in Late 2017." The report noted that Macworld made the claim that Intel's new technology would in fact be Mac compatible. However, the context was about Optane SSDs. Logic would suggest that if Apple is considering Intel's SSDs for Macs that Optane memory would also follow. But logic doesn't always win the day and so we'll have to wait and see how this plays out in 2017.      About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Now the corporation has followed up by releasing Optane cache drives for consumers. We previously learned about these low capacity cache drives back in January when they were shown off at CES 2017. A little later it was announced that they had started to ship to hardware partners for testing. From 24th April consumers will be able to choose from two Intel Optane memory SKUs; a 16GB model with an MSRP of $44, and a 32GB model with an MSRP of $77. Both are supplied as 80mm M.2 devices. Check out the specs below: With their low capacities, Intel is angling these modules as devices to boost HDD-based PC responsiveness, though they could still offer some acceleration to users of SATA SSDs as their primary storage. So all the figures you see quoted on the Intel Optane consumer promotional pages are for HDD storage based systems being perked up by Optane. See the footnotes on the Optane memory product page, for example. Intel is promoting Optane for consumers as a technology that lets you "Get the speed. Keep the capacity". It is a "bridge between the DRAM and storage." However, consumers are getting a bridge between RAM and HDD, not the expected bridge between RAM and SSD. Let's look at the headline claimed benefits for an HDD-storage based PC system boosted by use of one of these cache drives: Power on your computer up to twice as fast Increase storage performance up to 14x Launch applications faster: Microsoft Outlook up to 5.8x faster; games launch up to 67% faster; and levels load up to 65% faster Find files on your PC up to 4x faster Intel rationalises its HDD-boost promotional angle by quoting the statistic that "79 per cent of desktop PCs still use hard disk drives as the primary storage". To use one of the new Optane cache drives you will have to have system support in place and at this time that means a 7th generation Intel Core processor and 200 series chipset. On that topic we've just had an email from Asus saying that it has a new UEFI BIOS for M.2 Optane support in its 200-Series motherboards. Asus, like Intel, suggests that an Optane drive is a great companion for a roomy HDD.

Posted by scaryjim - Tue 28 Mar 2017 10:44 Hmmm, reading around it looks like latency in single-digit microseconds is perhaps as much as an order of magnitude faster than most SSDs … OTOH, it's two orders of magnitude slower than DRAM, so in performance terms it's of barely any more benefit that using any old SSD as a cache drive … nothing new here. Wake me up when they get the latency down to sub-microsecond… ;) Posted by 3s-gtech - Tue 28 Mar 2017 10:51 So, it's like cache SSD, on a quicker interface, that we've had for years? Woop. The 79% figure is more a damning indictment of manufacturers continuing to fit HDDs well beyond their lifetime - how many of them are in domain joined PCs in businesses where everything on the disk fits into 40GB, yet they have 500GB HDDs from the factory? Posted by Rubarb - Tue 28 Mar 2017 11:02 Price wise this does look intresting but I would love to see real world testing and results before even contenplating buying one. Posted by Jace007 - Tue 28 Mar 2017 11:24 The seq writes are pretty poor on these How are these x10 or x14 more faster than M.2 NvME, i dont think they are. The IOPs are only the best thing about them, Which are more a factor with large databases etc rather than normal work for average consumers. Posted by azrael- - Tue 28 Mar 2017 11:26 M.2 is a form factor. It can transport PCIe, SATA and USB signals. I would expect these to use PCIe, though. Any clarification on the matter would be welcome, however. EDIT: Found the following over at Anandtech: Because only two PCIe lanes are used by the drive, it is keyed to support M.2 type B and M slots. This keying is usually used for M.2 SATA SSDs while M.2 PCIe SSDs typically use only the M key position to support four PCIe lanes. The Optane Memory SSD will not function in a M.2 slot that provides only SATA connectivity. Seems to me there could be quite some compatibility issues if you're unlucky.

Startups Games Makers Tech Games Hardware Software Features Women Blog Events How to Opinion Competitions Forum Press office Talk to us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Join us on Google+ Subscribe with RSS By Brendyn Lotz on 28th March · General · News Intel Optane Memory promises to make your PC faster Last week Intel announced the Optane SSD DC P4800X, an insanely fast solid state drive. Sadly its price tag of almost R20 000 means that it will only probably be used for its intended purpose in data centers. Despite that we really want one just to see how fast it really is, and now our prayers have been answered. Well, sort of. This week, Intel announced the first Optane memory module for desktop PCs, but it isn’t like the SSD we saw last week. Instead, it’s a dedicated SSD designed to make traditional hard drives a bit faster with fancy caching tech. The desktop Optane module comes in two capacities, 16GB and 32GB. This should – according to Intel at least – improve system performance by up to 28% and help PCs using those older mechanical drives to boot twice as fast. Advert “It increases the speed of application, game or large file loading so people don’t have to wait nearly as long. It does this by ensuring the data contained in a PC’s storage is more readily accessible, which means an overall faster, more responsive experience,” senior vice president of Intel’s Client Computing Group Navin Shenoy says. The trouble with this is that these modules will only work with Intel’s 7th Generation Core processors and their corresponding motherboards. That means that if you wanted to speed up a rather old PC with this clever-sounding piece of tech, you’re out of luck. Intel’s Optane modules are out on 24th April and will cost $44 (R573) for the 16GB model and $77 (R1 000) for the 32GB model according to Anandtech. Intel has also said that pre-built systems containing Optane drives are on the way from HP, Dell, Lenovo, ASUS and others. Of course, the more pertinent question here is whether performance of an Optane-equipped PC would be comparable to that of an SSD. From what we’ve read so far, that answer is “no” – a straight-up SSD will always be faster. So why splash out a thousand ZAR on an Optane module that won’t make existing drives faster than an SSD, when you can buy a 128GB SSD for the same cash or less? At a guess we’d have to say perhaps it’ll be most useful for people who just want to speed up their data/game drives. Still, seems like a lot of cash money for a questionable performance boost.

By: Bloomberg | Published:March 28, 2017 11:38 am A machine equipped with Intel’s Optane memory package will perform those routine tasks much quicker than computers currently in use. ( Image for representation, Source: Reuters) Intel Corp. is going back to its roots as a memory chipmaker in a bid to get consumers excited about high-end desktop computers. The world’s largest chipmaker, whose processors power eight out of ten PCs sold worldwide — and provide the bulk of Intel’s revenue — is offering a new memory chip package it says will improve desktop performance in a way that consumers will notice and be willing to pay for. Every day a typical consumer powers their PC on and off twice and uses 11 different programs, launching each one seven times. A machine equipped with Intel’s Optane memory package will perform those routine tasks much quicker than computers currently in use, Intel said. The new memory module is 14 times faster at loading a program from a standard hard drive. According to research provided by Intel, more than 70 percent of desktops still use spinning magnetic hard disks. “It’s basically all about responsiveness,” said Gregory Bryant, an Intel vice president. “People are spending too much time waiting.” For Intel, which was founded in the 1960s as a maker of memory chips, the push back into that business is part of Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich’s attempt to diversify the company’s revenue sources beyond processors for servers and PCs. While previous attempts to return to the market it exited in the 1990s haven’t been successful, this time Intel is bringing a new type of chip not offered by other manufacturers that it hopes will give it a sustainable edge. Also Read : Intel bets on selling Mobileye data, maps a first test Optane packages are based on Intel’s 3D Xpoint memory. They’ll function as a giant fast cache, storing files frequently used by the processor and allowing much quicker load times. The new offering doesn’t replace computer storage or main memory. The memory chip only works with Intel processors. That may help the company rebuff an attempt by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to claw back some of the market with a new range of processors it says rival Intel’s best. It’s also aimed at one of the few areas of the PC market – which has been declining since it peaked in 2011 – that has remained strong: High-end gaming PCs will grow about 12 percent this year, according to a prediction provided by Intel. That growth will be driven by gamers’ willingness to fork out for the highest performing hardware.Optane is available in two modules, a 16 gigabyte version for $44 and 32 gigabyte package for $77.

According to research provided by Intel, more than 70% of desktops still use spinning magnetic hard disks. “It’s basically all about responsiveness,” said Gregory Bryant, an Intel vice president. “People are spending too much time waiting.” For Intel, which was founded in the 1960s as a maker of memory chips, the push back into that business is part of chief executive officer Brian Krzanich’s attempt to diversify the company’s revenue sources beyond processors for servers and PCs. While previous attempts to return to the market it exited in the 1990s haven’t been successful, this time Intel is bringing a new type of chip not offered by other manufacturers that it hopes will give it a sustainable edge. Optane packages are based on Intel’s 3D Xpoint memory. They’ll function as a giant fast cache, storing files frequently used by the processor and allowing much quicker load times. The new offering doesn’t replace computer storage or main memory. The memory chip only works with Intel processors. That may help the company rebuff an attempt by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to claw back some of the market with a new range of processors it says rival Intel’s best. It’s also aimed at one of the few areas of the PC market – which has been declining since it peaked in 2011 – that has remained strong: High-end gaming PCs will grow about 12% this year, according to a prediction provided by Intel. That growth will be driven by gamers’ willingness to fork out for the highest performing hardware. Optane is available in two modules, a 16GB version for US$44 (RM195) and 32GB package for US$77 (RM340). —  Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Toshiba's Westinghouse to file for Chapter 11: Japan Government Chinese tech giant Tencent signs US$4.65bil loan deal Pakistan says Facebook vows to tackle concerns over blasphemous content Soccer - Messi banned for four international matches Cracking the whip on child sex offenders Digi spearheads digital learning trend among employees Others Also Read Pliskova beats Lucic-Baroni to reach Miami semis Equipping drivers with right skills Quest in love with the durian advertisement Latest News How tough is that smartphone?

Reuters/Tyrone Siu Intel may be releasing previews of models under its new Kaby Lake X architecture in response to the recent reveal of AMD's new Ryzen models. According to the Intel Kaby Lake X leak, the Kaby Lake X products will be the first chips available for Intel's X299 chipset for motherboard platforms. Although Intel fans can expect these new chips in the market soon, not a lot of details have been revealed about them. However, it appears SiSoftware has revealed specifications for the new Kaby Lake X line.  The Kaby Lake X chips will be placed in ASRock X299 Professional Gaming i7 motherboards. This allows the Kaby Lake X to utilise the X299 chipset, which helps it be a direct competitor with the new Ryzen chips.  The Intel Kaby Lake X leak supports rumours on the Kaby Lake X being direct competition of AMD's newer Ryzen products. The initial rumour has come from Intel's Q4 2016 earnings call in Jan. 26.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said Intel's product roadmap is "the best ever it's been." This pertains to Intel's strategy that involves retaining Kaby Lake's quad-core technology.  "We’re always focused on really, our own product roadmap and making sure that we have the highest performance product," he said. WCCFTech said this is an indication that Intel expects the 4-core Kaby Lake X to directly compete with AMD's 8-core variants.  The chip is based on the latest 14nm + process node. This improves Intel's existing 14nm FinFET technology. According to SiSoft's Intel Kaby Lake X leak, the chip's clock speeds appear to reach 4GHz base. This appears to directly compete with the recent Ryzen 5 1600, which has a base clock speed of 3.19GHz.  The Kaby Lake X products may be released alongside its sister the Skylake X. The latter features stronger specifications, which are rumoured to exceed the performance of Intel's current Broadwell E chips.  According to Videocardz, the new Skylake X and Kaby Lake X CPU series may release sometime later in 2017. Rumours also point towards a reveal at Gamescom 2017, which will take place in Germany from Aug. 22 to 26.  The products to make the reveal may include Kaby Lake X's 4-core, 6-core, 8-core, and 10-core variants. The 6, 8 and 10-core variations will be based on the more powerful Skylake architecture. Meanwhile, the 4-core model will be based on the Kaby Lake architecture. Regardless of these variants, all chips are expected to be under the Core i7-7000 series of Intel processors.  Unfortunately, Intel has not made an official comment about the Intel Kaby Lake X leak. There is no official statement on the Kaby Lake X products, including their release date and prices.  Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could come with AMD chip House Intelligence still waiting for proof; Trump defends wiretap claims Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 'Curb Your Enthusiasm season 9' will cause a lot of controversy, assures Mary Steenburgen 0 Shares 2 Dogs now entering plastic surgery scene with botox, other cosmetic treatments 0 Shares 3 ‘Ghostbusters VR: Now Hiring’ requires PS4, VR headset and Move controllers 0 Shares 4 Iron ore drops to six-week low 0 Shares 5 Cannabis stocks rise by significant margin 0 Shares 6 ‘My Pet Dinosaur’: Matt Drummond prepares to disrupt film industry 0 Shares 7 OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 3T update 0 Shares 8 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Diana Gabaldon heading to South Africa 0 Shares 9 Trump sends cease-and-desist to 17-year-old student over cat website 0 Shares 10 ‘Vikings’ season 5: Ivar and Bjorn will ‘explode in time’; The Boneless ‘doesn’t recognise boundaries’ 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Spotify acquires MightyTV, helps users decide what to watch European retailer TK Maxx chose 303 MullenLowe Qantas and Slingshot Venture Fund tap startups for airline innovation Fair Work Ombudsman launches Record My Hours app Woolworths: Pick date to pack date for supermarket produce Amazon to collect sales tax in Hawaii, Idaho, Maine and New Mexico on April 1 More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance Queensland amends medicinal cannabis laws Aussie academic not allowed to leave China Zelda Therapeutics strikes deal with CannPal Malcolm Turnbull backs extratradition treaty with China US travel ‘falls off a cliff’ according to a search site ALDI, Kroger, Publix warn customers of fake discount coupons More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets live stream: Watch NBA live on TV, preview, start time Kobe Bryant defends LeBron James, says Cavs star has 'earned the right to rest' Australian captain Steven Smith apologises for emotional outburst during fourth Test Tom Brady elite quarterback until his mid-40s says Patriots owner NFL News: Denver Broncos could still tap veteran QB Tony Romo Rafael Nadal dodges low-flying aircraft during Miami Open victory More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More Google Pixel C vs Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 Tesla Model 3 praised by Morgan Stanley analyst Facebook Messenger to add ‘dislike’ button but will stop support for older versions of Android, iOS and Windows app Elon Musk backs brain-computer interface venture Xbox One and 360 Deals With Gold until April 3 announced Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2 not expected anytime soon More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Designated Survivor' season 1 episode 14 spoilers: 'Commander-In-Chief' digs deeper into the conspiracy; President Kirkman relies on an unlikely ally ‘Power Rangers’ director reveals reason kiss between Pink Ranger and Red Ranger was cut from film [VIDEO] ‘The Walking Dead’ season 7, episode 16 (finale) preview: ‘The First Day of the Rest of Your Life’ [VIDEO] ‘The Bold And The Beautiful’ spoilers for March 28: Brooke unleashes her wrath on Ridge, agrees not to tell Eric about the affair Kim Kardashian: The fame she did not want that started her social empire ‘Hell's Kitchen Australia’ spoilers: Reality stars, actors, athletes and a politician sign up for tough cooking competition More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

Hagai Amit and Shuki Sadeh Mar 27, 2017 12:29 PM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Dr. Shmuel Harlap at a finance conference in Israel, March 21, 2017. Moti Milrod Opinion Mobileye-Intel: The good, the bad and the ugly How Israel's Hebrew University lost a Mobileye windfall Dr. Shmuel Harlap was already a very rich man two weeks ago. His controlling interest in Israel’s largest car importer, Colmobil, put him 21st on the list of Israel’s wealthiest people with an estimated fortune of $1.4 billion. But even for him, the events of March 15 constituted a significant financial upgrade: Intel’s $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye yielded Harlap about $1 billion. The businessman had invested some $12 million in the driverless-vehicle technology firm (along with Colmobil) about 15 years ago, and held about 7% of the company’s shares. He doubled the value of his paper assets overnight. Harlap, 72, has no yacht or private jet and says he doesn’t know what he’ll do with the money he earned from the Mobileye sale. An amateur marathon runner, he grew up in Rehovot, Jerusalem and Haifa, and served in the Golani Brigade’s elite commando unit in the army. His father, Amichai, founded the family business in 1963 after receiving the franchise to import Mercedes-Benz cars into Israel. Shmuel himself – who was studying Platonic philosophy when he completed his doctorate in philosophy at Harvard University – only joined the company in the early 1980s, at age 38, after teaching political science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The events that made Colmobil number one in its field took place during his tenure. In 1988, the company began to import Mitsubishi cars and in the early 1990s the Japanese automaker assumed Subaru’s place as the most widely sold car brand in Israel. In 1994, Colmobil also received the franchise to import Hyundai, and in the past five years the Korean firm has become Israel’s most popular car brand. Harlap says he left academia for the car industry after reaching the conclusion that “the important ideas I had weren’t new, and the new ideas I had weren’t important.” Even though he doesn’t need to work anymore, Harlap says he has no plans to retire. “It’s fun, it produces adrenaline and it’s activity,” he explains. “I had a philosophy professor who wrote a book in which he describes a ‘dream machine’ – in other words, a hypothetical situation in which you get an offer to enter a container of formaldehyde and attach electrodes all over your body, which enable you to have any experience you want, according to your choice. Would you choose such a life? The answer is no, because people want to do things, not only to have experiences. The greatest satisfaction comes from doing. Why do people run marathons? For that reason. The greatest satisfaction in life comes from asceticism, not hedonism. Hedonism is a bottomless pit. There are many billionaires who buy yachts and planes, and don’t get enjoyment out of that.” Sometimes it seems you’re trying to enjoy the best of all worlds. You talk about asceticism, but sell brand names... “I’m not an ascetic person, but it’s good to experience active asceticism, in the sense of physical effort, in order to understand that it provides more satisfaction. But I’m no monk.” What do you think of the trend of billionaires saying they won’t leave their money to their children? “Everyone has a right to do what he wants with his money. I’m sure, as Warren Buffett said, that I don’t want to be the richest man in the universe. “I’ll give you my formula for life: When your needs are greater than your possibilities, live according to your possibilities. When your possibilities are greater than your needs, live according to your needs. Always live according to the lower of the two. I live according to my needs, not according to my possibilities.” In 2012, the Zelekha Committee (headed by Prof. Yaron Zelekha) was established in order to examine how to improve competition in the car industry. Among other things, it recommended that importers cannot own more than one leasing company and one garage, and an importer whose market share is higher than 8% will be limited to one brand. It also recommended that discounts to leasing companies would be restricted and that importers would be required to provide technical literature and equipment to every garage, at a controlled price. When Zelekha submitted the report he said: “Although I have a great deal of experience in antitrust laws, I have never come across a market as uncompetitive as the car market. The importers’ profit margins are scandalous, and it’s a disgrace for Israeli governments that they haven’t dealt with the problem until now.” Part of the Mobileye driving-assist system on the dashboard of a vehicle in Jerusalem. BAZ RATNER/REUTERS Indeed, a survey published this week by the Chief Economist’s Office in the Finance Ministry showed that Israel’s 12 car importers, headed by Colmobil, earned 1.9 billion to 2 billion shekels (about $520 million to $550 million) in 2013 and 2014 – an aggregate profit twice that of 2006 in real terms. At the same time, there was a sharp increase in profitability to an average rate of 9.3% – an exceptional rate for a commercial industry. The continued increase in vehicle sales in the past decade led to a bonanza in the industry. According to the treasury report, from 2007 until 2014 the 12 car importers had an aggregate profit of 14.1 billion shekels (at 2014 prices). In other words, an average annual profit of 1.6 billion shekels. Compared to the years 2003 to 2006, this was a real increase of 72%. For the sake of comparison, the country’s annual revenues from purchase tax and customs tax on vehicles increased during that same period at a real rate of only 16%. Harlap has maneuvered himself into a win-win position: He is benefiting from the unprecedented growth of the Israeli car industry in its present state, and also from the direction in which it is moving – the autonomous car. So how does he answer claims about the importers’ excessive profitability? “I don’t know what other importers think, I know what I’m doing. Everyone has his own considerations; my consideration is market-oriented. It’s a sophisticated market, and I constantly have to think about my competitors. If I were working alone in the market, maybe it would be different. There’s some myth here that Israel is a price market, and that’s not true. Israel is a brand-name market. The prices are similar and the public decides what to buy according to the brand.” Hagai Amit Haaretz Contributor Hagai Amit Send me email alerts for new articles by Hagai Amit Send Close Email * Please enter your email Hagai Amit For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

He then slammed the ongoing anti-Russian witch hunt, saying "the Russia story is a hoax." “Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech, money to Bill, the Hillary Russian ‘reset,’ praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!” Trump wrote in two tweets Monday night. Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017 ...money to Bill, the Hillary Russian "reset," praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017 Trump's rhetorical questions come amid a news cycle which as discussed on various occasions today has focused on the Republican chair of the Intel Committee, Nunes, who is under fire for briefing Trump about classified material he reviewed last week without sharing the information with committee Democrats. On Monday it was revealed that Nunes had secretly visited the White House grounds one day before announcing incidental surveillance of President Trump’s transition team. His visit raised questions about whether the White House could have been was the source of the intelligence Nunes reviewed. Democratic lawmakers have now called on Nunes to recuse himself from the committee’s probe into Russia’s interference in the United States presidential election. Nunes on Monday evening said the chairman would not step aside from the investigation. The republican lawmaker has claimed that his findings had no relevance to the Russia probe, even as the committee examines the unmasking and leaking of surveillance information as part of that investigation. * * * In a follow up tweet, Trump took another stab at the House Freedom Caucus, who he said snatched "defeat from the jaws of victory" - following Friday's failure to repeal and replace plan for ObamaCare.  That followed a Sunday tweet in which he said the conservative House Freedom Caucus, along with the Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America, had “saved” Planned Parenthood and ObamaCare. The Republican House Freedom Caucus was able to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. After so many bad years they were ready for a win! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017 Finally, Trump brought it full circle, touching on Friday's failure to repeal Obamacare, saying "the Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds - not long. Do not worry, we are in very  good shape! The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds - not long. Do not worry, we are in very good shape! — Donald J.

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (14) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   READERS LIKE YOU!

Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU. Reply Brian Harvey  2017-03-28 00:43 More a question than a comment. MBP 2016 with 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7. running with 598 GB free. Docked most of the time using a Benq 32 inch 4K monitor; currently running at 1080P. Latest s/w not beta. I seem to have a lot of spinning beach balls. I cut they system down to only a few add ons such as SwithcResX. I still frequently get the spinning beach ball with Safari and iTunes. I even get the ball with the MBP native resolution with no external monitor attached. Anyone seen this happening? Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-28 04:55 I have seen a lot of spinning beach balls of late - maybe since Sierra 10.12.3? MacBook Pro 15" with Thunderbolt Display and lid closed. I only rarely use iTunes and have the feeling it is linked to use of Safari. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-28 09:34 This sounds like the sort of thing you'd need to track down carefully.

Intel lets loose Kaby Lake-based Xeon E3 v6 processors by Bruno Ferreira  4:58 PM on March 28, 2017 We love our Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs around here, particularly when it comes to gaming, but not everyone has time for such frivolity. Workstation users have a different set of processing needs, usually revolving around a stable platform, ECC memory, and certified drivers. That's where the Intel's Xeon E3 v6 family of Kaby Lake-based CPUs come in. The updated lineup contains a total of eight models, ranging from the humble-ish Xeon E3-1220 v6 with its four cores and clock speed up to 3.5 GHz, up to the mighty Xeon E3-1280 v6 and its four cores, eight threads, and turbo clocks up to 4.2 GHz. The TDP for all the CPUs in the family hovers around 72W, and the amount of cache is likewise the same for all models, at 8MB. Intel says the new models support ECC RAM in amounts up to 64GB and speeds up to DDR4-2400. Owners of existing setups with DDR3L RAM need not worry—that's supported, too. Seeing as the new Xeons are based on the Kaby Lake architecture, 10-bit HEVC encoding and decoding is on the menu, too. Like you'd expect from workstation-grade processors, the Xeon E3 v6s support all the alphabet-soup virtualization technologies: TSX-NI, vPro, VT-d, and VT-x. Those concerned with system security will be happy to know that the whole host of security features (including AES-NI, SGX, Trusted Execution, and OS Guard) are all supported, too. Here's a full list of the models: Model Cores Threads Base clock Turbo clock IGP Price Xeon E3-1280 v6 4 8 3.9 GHz 4.2 GHz - $612 Xeon E3-1275 v6 4 8 3.8 GHz 4.2 GHz Yes $339 Xeon E3-1270 v6 4 8 3.8 GHz 4.2 GHz - $328 Xeon E3-1245 v6 4 8 3.7 GHz 4.1 GHz Yes $284 Xeon E3-1240 v6 4 8 3.7 GHz 4.1 GHz - $272 Xeon E3-1230 v6 4 8 3.5 GHz 3.9 GHz - $250 Xeon E3-1225 v6 4 4 3.3 GHz 3.7 GHz Yes $213 Xeon E3-1220 v6 4 4 3.0 GHz 3.5 GHz - $193 The three models whose number ends in a 5 (E3-1225, E3-1245, and E3-1275) all pack Intel's spankin' HD Graphics 630 IGP. The company claims that when armed with this IGP, "designers may no longer need a discrete graphics card for some of the most commonly-used workloads." According to Intel, the IGP in the E3-1275 v6 CPU should offer three times the performance as the one in the old E3-1275 v2 when measured with SPEC graphics tools. The company also says that chips with these P630 IGPs are up to the task of "entry professional VR," among other pro applications. The P630 graphics driver is certified for use with multiple pro applications, too. The general theme seems to be one of upgrading the CPU rather than replacing an entire machine, given that the Xeon E3 v6 processors still go into Socket 1151, have dual-channel memory controllers, and will fit existing motherboards with C232 and C236 chipsets, likely only at the cost of a BIOS update. Those looking to make use of the P630 IGP will need the higher-end C236, though. As a recap, when compared to the C232, the C236 chipset has IGP support, 20 lanes of PCIe 3.0 instead of eight, and support for Intel Active Management Technology, Node Manager, and Rapid Storage Technology features. The new CPUs should be available to OEMs right away. Tags: CPUs Servers Workstations Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Though welcomed by diversity advocates, the revelations weren’t that surprising: Within engineering, only 15 percent are women and 6 percent are black, Latino or multiracial, which makes Uber not that different from other tech companies, where those groups make up a tiny fraction of the technical workforce. In fact, the more illuminating piece of data about diversity at Uber isn’t in its report at all. Retention -- the percentage of each demographic group that stays at the company each year -- reveals more about the hospitality of the workplace culture than the percentage of white and Asian men there overall. Most companies, including Uber and its peers in Silicon Valley, track it. They just don’t make it public. Retention data is a proxy for job satisfaction, and tech companies won’t be able to build the diverse workforces they claim to be working toward unless they can hold onto the small fraction of female and minority employees they successfully recruit. Since 2014, demographics at Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., Google, Twitter Inc. and others have stayed roughly the same: Women make up about 17 percent of technical workers; only about 6 percent are black or Latino. Across industries, few companies release employee retention data, but tech firms have consistently held themselves up as meritocracies, based on data-focused decision-making. At the same time, they’ve assembled homogeneous employee bases, and come under fire for tolerating behavior and attitudes that make minorities feel unwelcome. As far as data and transparency, they have mostly stuck to releasing annual demographic breakdowns and the occasional tidbit about the race and gender of new hires. “People are looking for ways to tell a good story around their diversity and inclusion efforts,” said Ellen Pao, co-founder of Project Include, which advocates for more diversity in Silicon Valley. “The fact that tech companies aren’t sharing their retention numbers indicates those numbers likely aren’t good.” A handful of industry-wide studies support Pao’s suspicion, at least as far as women are concerned. A 2008 survey of women in tech found that female workers in the industry leave their jobs at twice the rate of men. A 2013 study found that after about 12 years, 50 percent of women in STEM fields -- mostly in computing and engineering -- changed their professions, compared with 20 percent of professional women in non-STEM fields. The studies didn’t ask the same questions of other underrepresented groups, though a new study expected in April from the Kapor Center for Social Impact will. Meanwhile, retention numbers are trickling out of the Valley’s biggest companies. In a recent essay, former Uber Technologies Inc. software engineer Susan Fowler described how her request to transfer to another team was denied, and she couldn’t figure out why. Later, she learned, her manager was more concerned with maintaining the retention rate on his team. “It turned out that keeping me on the team made my manager look good,” Fowler wrote. “I overheard him boasting to the rest of the team that even though the rest of the teams were losing their women engineers left and right, he still had some on his team.” Fowler took it upon herself to estimate the retention rate for her department, which had gone from about 25 percent female to 6 percent in a year, according to her post. “Women were transferring out of the organization, and those who couldn’t transfer were quitting or preparing to quit,” she wrote. “There were two major reasons for this: there was the organizational chaos, and there was also the sexism within the organization.” Fowler left Uber in December. Uber declined to comment on its retention rates. Uber is now investigating Fowler’s claims, and the company promised to release findings from that investigation next month. But it had long been tight-lipped about any diversity-related data. Even recruiters tasked with hiring more people from underrepresented groups were denied access to information about the company’s makeup, Bloomberg reported last week. Tech companies all collect data on retention, said Joelle Emerson, CEO of Paradigm, which consults with Silicon Valley firms about diversity. “So it’s just about analyzing and reviewing this information regularly.” So far, only Intel Corp. has released this data. The company had long tracked its retention rate internally, and it wasn’t good: Underrepresented races and women were more likely to leave the company than white or Asian men. But after Intel started to release retention data in 2015, it set a goal for the next year to keep exit rates even for all groups and reached it in 2016. Next year’s goal is to retain underrepresented groups at a higher rate than their counterparts. Intel Chief Diversity Officer Danielle Brown acknowledges that publishing the info can be scary. “Are there risks? Sure,” she said. “No one wants to put out a bad retention number that makes it look like there’s a problem.” Collecting and publicizing retention data is important because tech companies are often more swayed by hard numbers than personal anecdotes, said Erica Joy Baker, another member of Project Include who left her job as a software engineer at Alphabet Inc.’s Google in 2015. The year before, she had written publicly about the challenge of being one of the few black women at Google. In 2015 Baker made a public call on Twitter, using the hashtag #RealDiversityNumbers, for tech companies to release retention rates and other metrics instead of just demographic breakdowns. “People leaving the company is the strongest signal that something has gone wrong,” she said. Around the same time Baker left Google, other women who had departed the company shared their experiences of casual sexism and sexual harassment on Twitter. But it wasn’t the most effective medium. “Had that been presented in data form, or if the company had had to report that one year, some percentage of their women in engineering left, I think they would have been more incentivized to work on that,” Baker said. Google declined to comment. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Some turnover can be healthy, and exit rates can vary widely between companies and from year to year. Retention metrics can also hide perverse incentives -- employees who don’t leave because they can’t find a better job, or those who stick around longer than usual to take advantage of stock options. Because so few companies make the data public, there isn’t really a known standard, said Emerson, the diversity consultant. No matter what the numbers are, she added, companies should aim to not see big disparities in the retention rate across demographic groups. Nevertheless, the retention metric remains a critical indicator of culture inside a business that isn’t shown by hiring data, said Freada Kapor Klein, co-chair at the Kapor Center. Companies are reluctant to release it for now, but they might be convinced if it starts to hinder them in one important way: hiring. “Any woman engineer, any engineer of color who is looking for a respectful work environment and has some options about where they might go, ought to be asking companies that they’re interviewing with for retention data,” Kapor Klein said. “When highly sought-after talent begins to demand the information, companies have to pay attention.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

While OLED devices are slightly slimmer than those with LCD screens, they come with reliability, cost, and longevity issues. Here are 10 reasons you might not want to buy a laptop with OLED technology, like the Samsung Galaxy Book — in 2017, at least. Samsung Galaxy Book Release Date and Specifications Before explaining why you shouldn’t buy a Samsung Galaxy Book, look at its hardware. The Galaxy Book comes in two models: the first is a 9.7-inch 2048 x 1536 Android tablet with similar specs as the other tablets on the market, the larger model comes with a 2160 x 1440 12-inch display, Windows 10, and an Intel processor. The 9.7-incher may launch on March 31st. Its 12-inch brother may release some time after that. 1. OLEDs Displays Burn-In Over Time The biggest weakness of OLED technology: the organic components found in OLEDs decay over time. While manufacturers estimate lifespans to hover between 80,000 and 150,000 hours, that doesn’t tell the whole story. Burn-in can occur within weeks of purchase — and it only gets worse over time as it is completely irreversible. Burn-in occurs when the sub-pixels that make up an OLED display decay. Of the three or four colors which compose an OLED sub-pixel, blue wears out the fastest. Unfortunately, manufacturers do not advertise the longevity of the blue OLEDs. In comparison, an LCD screen offers an MTBF of roughly 100,000 hours — equal to the life expectancy of its LED backlight. The liquid crystals that make up the display last significantly longer. Up until it fails, it retains the same picture quality at the time of purchase. When burn-in does occur, it quickly returns to normal (the image above is of burn-in on an LCD panel). 2. Operating Systems Kill OLED Displays As mentioned above, bright and blue OLEDs burn out over time. The more they’re used, the faster they die. For example, status bars, icon trays, and browser tabs sit on the screen for hours at a time. These elements rapidly burn themselves into your screen. It’s possible to dramatically reduce the rate of decay through darker and less blue colors. But while the Windows 10 Anniversary Update Windows 10 Anniversary Update Due in July & These Are Its Best Features Windows 10 Anniversary Update Due in July & These Are Its Best Features You will love the Windows 10 Anniversary Update!

We have compiled five of the best ones for Windows 10. Read More , many Windows 10 apps lack this. And even the dark theme isn’t fully OLED friendly. 3. Early OLED Laptops Cost a Fortune The first OLED laptops cost a fortune. Here are a few examples: Lenovo X1 Yoga — At over $2,000, the X1 Yoga 2-in-1 comes with fairly anemic hardware for the money. Its dual-core Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and a 256 GB SSD can be found on $700 2-in-1 laptops (like the Acer Switch Alpha 12). Compared to the competition, its 4K OLED screen runs the price up by around $1,100. The Acer Switch Alpha matches the Lenovo X1 Yoga in all aspects. It includes a similar resolution screen (LCD instead of OLED), the same RAM, SSD, and tablet functionality — for hundreds less. Alienware 13 R3 — The Alienware 13 R3 is the first gaming laptop to feature an OLED display. It comes with a quad-core Intel processor, a midrange Nvidia 1060 GPU, and a 2560 x 1440 OLED panel. On paper, it looks like a good deal. Dell (which owns Alienware) only charges $250 to upgrade the 1080p LCD display to a 4K OLED panel. Unfortunately, the price is obscured by the specs — a common practice among marketing departments. Other manufacturers, however, lack the whacky pricing scheme. The Asus STRIX offers the same specs but costs $1,400 — $700 less. We Don’t Know How Much the Samsung Galaxy Book Costs It seems that almost all OLED laptops, regardless of specs, run for around $2,000. As a Surface Pro competitor, the Samsung Galaxy Book will probably cost more than that. Perhaps around $1,800. While that might seem reasonable, it’s not. Prepare to have your mind blown: According to IHS Technology, OLED panels cost less to manufacture than LCD screens. However, the early production of large, laptop-quality OLED panels will cost a fortune due to limited supply. As manufacturers increase production, though, prices will rapidly drop. If you do purchase an OLED-equipped laptop, buy one later rather than sooner. 4. OLED Displays Aren’t Battery Friendly While in theory OLED displays consume less power than LCDs, the truth is more complicated. LCD displays use less power when displaying white colors. OLED uses less power when displaying blacks. Reviewers, however, continually note that the OLED displays used in laptops tend to consume more power than LCDs. For example, Anandtech found that the OLED version of the Yoga X1 consumed dramatically more power than the LCD version. In short, you get roughly 41 percent more battery life by using an LCD laptop, if all other factors remain the same. 6. Better Technology Is Coming Soon LCD technology is far more mature than OLED. Most OLED manufacturers, however, compare older models of LCD to the newer models of OLED. For example, technologies such as Panel Self-Refresh technology and IGZO backplanes can extend battery life by a tremendous amount. Panasonic’s LCD Technology Has the Same Contrast The newest LCD technology from Panasonic can represent blacks (contrast ratio) about as good as OLEDs. That takes pretty much all the juice out of OLEDs, except that OLEDs will eventually cost less than LCD panels. Image Credit: Panasonic Quantum Dot Technology Has Better Accuracy and Drain Another panel that beats down OLEDs: Samsung’s Quantum Dot (QLED). QLED technology blows OLED away in color accuracy, longevity, and power consumption. For example, the Asus ZenBook NX500 scores extremely high in color accuracy and battery life tests. Unfortunately, it costs a fortune at $3,000. But over time QLED displays will fall in price. But QLED isn’t the only competition to OLED. A lot of other technologies compete on a superior footing. 7. There’s Lots of Competition There are just a few kinds of OLED panel types out there. But many kinds of Liquid Crystal Displays Understanding The Differences Between LCD Display Panels [Technology Explained] Understanding The Differences Between LCD Display Panels [Technology Explained] Read More exist. The problem is that advertisers typically lump all LCD screens into a single category. Often, you don’t know whether you’re getting a twisted-nematic (TN) or in-pane switching (IPS) screen. For example, the Dell XPS 13 throws several kinds of battery-saving technologies into the same package, such as Panel Self-Refresh, and an IGZO backplane. With such technologies, the XPS 13 gets the best battery life in its size and form factor. LCDs also don’t suffer from burn-in — which can prove costly. 8. Warranty Policies Sometimes Don’t Cover Burn-in Warranty policies rarely cover physical damage outside of 30–60 day return period (depending on the retailer). Consumers aren’t warned to take precautions, either. Overall, if you start to notice that your screen is degrading, chances are you will need to pay to have it replaced. And that can cost a fortune. 9. OLED Panels Cost More to Replace If you ever break the screen, OLED panels come with much higher replacement costs. On top of that, OLED panels are very delicate and thin, compared to other displays. That makes replacing them more time consuming and costly. Image Credit: Matthew Rollings via Wikimedia On the positive side, OLED panels will drop in price rapidly over time, which will make replacements cheaper — but that won’t happen anytime soon. 10. Higher Rate of Defect in Early Production OLED panels won’t just burn-in. They’ll have a higher failure rate, due to a lack of maturation. Just as early LCD panels also suffered from a large number of broken or stuck pixels, early OLEDs will also suffer from teething problems. Combine that with the high cost of replacement, and you have a losing formula. Should You Buy a Samsung Galaxy Book or OLED Laptop? Don’t buy a large OLED display until later. OLED panels may be an inevitability, rather than a possibility. More or less, the cost of producing an OLED panel will be less than that of an LCD. On top of that, they are less durable and require more frequent replacement compared to LCD. Finally, they look better so that average consumers (who aren’t aware of the disadvantages) will likely prefer them over LCD screens. Altogether, the road seems paved toward a future in which OLEDs are the dominant technology on the market. But until that future becomes an inevitability, consumers should prefer LCD screens over OLED.

Page 1 of 3. 1 Comment Last week I published a number of Radeon and NVIDIA Vulkan/OpenGL Serious Sam 2017 benchmarks while those curious about Intel graphics performance for the updated Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter have some data to look at today. For those curious about the Serious Sam 2017 performance with OpenGL/Vulkan on Intel hardware, I used a Core i7 7700K Kabylake CPU and tested its HD Graphics 630 (Kabylake GT2) in different environments. Ubuntu 16.10 was running on the host with the Linux 4.11 kernel and Mesa 17.1-dev via the Padoka PPA to provide the latest i965 OpenGL and ANV Vulkan drivers. All of these Serious Sam 2017 Fusion tests were done in a fully-automated manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

There is one important difference, though; unlike Flash, when Optane writes it can overwrite without having to erase first.  This makes this new memory type fast but expensive; so, while enterprise servers and workstations may consider using Optane instead of an SSD, or flash memory, Intel is implementing Optane for the rest of us on PCs kind of like you’d put a blower on a car, as a speed booster but not as a replacement for what you are currently using.  Let’s talk about that this week. The Secret Problem One of the industry secrets we don’t talk about much because it makes users look stupid is that a lot of folks choose their PC configurations based on drive size instead of speed.   Now, the reason this is stupid is because big drives are hard drives, old magnetic media, and fast drives are SSD drives which cost more but are affordable at reasonable sizes now.  Over the last 30 or so years that hard drives have been in use, Windows, applications, and particularly games have gotten a lot larger, so this slow performance on hard drives is resulting in lots of complaints about current generation systems being slow.  These old hard drives can’t keep up with current generation processors and, as a result, you have a PCs where folks have paid for Intel’s best processors not able to use that performance because they bottleneck on the drives.  This is kind of like someone buying a performance looking car like a Camaro, Mustang, or Challenger, putting a 4-cylinder engine in it and then complaining that the performance sucks even though the price and gas mileage are clearly more attractive.   I drive a Mercedes GLA 45 AMG, which is a performance car with a 4-clinder engine, but I don’t complain that it’s slow; in fact in a drag race, off the line, this car is faster than the other far more expensive AMG cars Mercedes makes.  It gets there because it has a big turbo charger that gives the car nearly 400 horsepower, which, for a little hatchback, is a ton (and it doesn’t hurt that the car has four-wheel drive for traction).  So, what Intel has done with Optane is kind of like what Mercedes did with the supercharger; it created a module that boosts the performance of whatever drive you have.  A 32 or 64 gigabyte caching drive that can even make your hard drive based machine seem far faster. The Intel Supercharger Now, this isn’t as easy as just bolting on the new memory module; you do need a motherboard that will take this new type of memory.  Those boards have been in the market for a number of months now and, if you have a gaming system you built, swapping out the motherboard isn’t that hard (I did it myself earlier this month).  It took me a few hours but that was largely because I used the opportunity to also swap out the power supply and rerouting the power lines took me some time because I’d done such a good job of hiding them the first time.   But adding the new memory module should only take a few minutes, and then you just load the new drivers and you are done.  With that, suddenly, your machine should be a ton faster. The new speed will be seen in faster boot times; faster application load times, with games seeing faster paging and chapter loading; and with things like video and picture editing experiencing far faster overall performance.  Your PC will seem supercharged.  Wrapping Up Much of the performance problem that folks seem to be complaining about surrounds their tendency to choose slow drives with lots of capacity over fast drives with less.  This resulted in machines that are bottlenecked on their drives.  Intel’s first implementation of Optane for the desktop is positioned to fix this problem by basically allowing a hard drive based machine to perform in line with an SSD based system.   Now, given that Optane is substantially faster than SSD, it can also boost SSD systems. However, you won’t see as big a jump because SSD is already substantially faster than hard drives.   So, Optane on PCs is basically a PC Supercharger; it will make slow hard drive based systems much faster and SSD based systems faster still.   These Optane modules will become available at the end of April and you will need to make sure your PC will take one, which may mean waiting until you can buy a new PC. When that time comes, you might consider selecting one that is Optane ready because faster is generally better.     Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Think IT Can Handle Security On Its Own?

It was very well received and fans of the company’s gaming-oriented notebooks are going to like what it has to offer now. Razer has refreshed the Blade Pro lineup to the latest Kaby Lake processor from Intel. It also has the distinction of being the first ever THX-certified laptop. The 17.3 inch laptop now comes with an overclockable 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7-7820HD processor and its 32GB RAM has received a timing bump to 2,667MHz from the 2,133MHz of the previous edition. It retains the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. What’s interesting about this laptop is that it’s said to be the first device notebook to get THX Mobile Certification which is an “accreditation reserved for high-performance mobile phones, tablets, and laptops.” The Razer Blade Pro’s screen has been calibrated and tested for resolution, color accuracy, and video playback performance on THX processes. The audio jack has also met THX requirements for voltage output, frequency response, distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, and crosstalk. An important distinction needs to be made here, only the screen and headphone jack are THX certified, not the built-in speakers. The specs aren’t the only thing that has received a bump. The price has been increased as well. Razer is now selling the Blade Pro for $3,999. It will be available for purchase from Razer’s website starting next month. Filed in Computers.

The DS77U series, designed for supporting both 12-volts and 19-volts inputs, is an industry-grade platform for use in commercial applications that require long-term operations like in automotive, digital signage, kiosks and more. The 1.3-liter Shuttle DS77U/U3/U5/U7 product series is based on Intel's latest Kaby Lake processor for longer product life cycles. They are ultra-slim PCs powered by 7th generation Intel® Celeron® dual-core processors with a powerful graphics engine capable of playing 4K content for a rich, crystal clear video experience. "The small form factor and three-display capability makes the DS77U series perfect for a myriad of applications like digital signage, huddle rooms, and other multi-media purposes," said Robert Garcia, product manager, Shuttle Computer Group. Shuttle's unique fanless design eliminates the power consumption required by a fan as well as the cost of replacing fans. Use with solid-state disks can create an operational platform completely free of noise, a vital feature for some applications where a hum can be annoying, like in a museum or library. With a slim profile of less than 40 mm and international VESA mounting standards, this series allows users to choose the most appropriate placement configuration in various environments. Wi-Fi is standard and the computers are available as custom systems or barebones for maximum installation options. The DS77U Series accepts standard 2.5" drives and utilizes Dual Channel memory slots to achieve 32GB Max DDR4 SO-DIMM RAM. Connectivity is optimized with Dual HDMI and One DisplayPort video output as well as two USB 2.0, two USB 3.0 ports, one RS232/422/485, and one additional RS232 connections. Availability is scheduled for April, 2017. About Shuttle Computer Group Shuttle Computer Group is the North American subsidiary of Shuttle Inc., a publicly traded company established in 1983. Shuttle specializes in small form factor PC hardware for digital signage, point-of-sale (POS) and interactive kiosks in the retail, restaurant, food service and hospitality industries as well as motherboards and bare bones systems.  For more information, visit http://us.shuttle.com or call 1-888-972-1818.

Praised by media and awarded with an IF Design award, MSI is announcing a chilled limited edition of their highly-awarded gaming PC, the Trident 3 Arctic. With its icy white color, it provides a cool look to every gamer's battlestation.     Limited edition, unlimited potential.   The Trident 3 Arctic also gets a big performance upgrade. It houses a customized GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card and uses the latest Intel Kaby Lake processor to get performance levels far above its similarly-sized console counterparts. The MSI Trident 3 Arctic is the pinnacle of small form factor, but does not compromise on high performance PC gaming. Whether in a VR environment or simply on the couch with friends, gamers are sure to enjoy smooth gameplay with the MSI Trident 3 Arctic.   A TRUE GAMING PC HAS A GAMING GRAPHICS CARD   Trident 3 Arctic features a customized MSI GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card in ITX format, which outshines any ITX reference cards found in other small form factor PCs. Gamers can now enjoy the best in-game performance on a console sized PC.   READY TO IMMERSE IN VR   Loaded with an Intel Core i7 processor combined with a GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card, Trident 3 Arctic is ready to provide a smooth display of VR content on your VR headset, such as the HTC Vive. MSI made it super easy to connect a VR headset by implementing VR Link, an HDMI-port on the front side of the system, supported by MSI's One-click to VR software that automatically optimizes both system performance and prevents any software from impacting the VR experience. *Configuration varies by country     PERFECTLY COOL WITH SILENT STORM COOLING 2   MSI crafted a unique way to keep the system as cool and quiet as possible by individually cooling the most important heat-generating hardware in the system using separated chambers. When performance really matters, Trident 3 Arctic is up to the task and delivers powerful gameplay without annoying gamers with a noisy fan or overheating hardware.     ADD A PERSONAL TOUCH WITH RGB MYSTIC LIGHT   For those who like to add a little personal touch to their system, MSI Trident 3 Arctic features RGB Mystic Light. By using the Mystic Light App or MSI's Gaming Center software, gamers can instantly change the color and effects of the front LED lights on the system to show their mood.   Recommended for You CYBERTRONPC ANNOUNCES SMALL FORM FACTOR SYSTEM WITH...

While constant improvements in technology are what make the world go round in a sense, human technology is really the foundation of how great ideas are generated and manifested. Thus, when bringing in new digital tools to the work environment, Computacenter emphasises the importance of user adoption and taking a people centric approach—otherwise, companies may lose out on investments in technology as well as employees. When companies are rolling out new workplace technologies, it becomes all about implementing the most appropriate user adoption strategies to ensure that everyone gets on board and remains on board. Paul Bray, Chief Technologist in Workplace and Mobile sectors at Computacenter, explains the importance of taking a user experience approach, saying, "If you choose the wrong product, or your users reject it, you may end up paying ongoing costs for something that isn't being used." The key point is that the technology is simply a vehicle—people are the ones driving it. Computacenter's user centric attitude means that businesses can make the technology work for the people, not the other way around. When technology is introduced with a people centric focus, and user adoption is the end goal, businesses can anticipate not only more collaboration across and within departments, but enhanced overall productivity and creativity. And that's what today's business world should be about. Intel's Director of Business Solutions, Jim Henrys, explains the need to analyse current and needed work styles within a company in order to better effect a user adoption strategy. He says, "It's clear that companies need to design their workspaces and work practices to enhance the power of people working together. Technology enhances that collaboration, but it doesn't make it work. People do." We are living in a digital world. Today's workforce is becoming less likely to accept the divide that has traditionally existed between personal digital technology and digital work tools. Workplace tools are now required to be as seamless and easy-to-use as those we use all day every day. According to Mr. Henrys, "People like to work seamlessly and hassle free. It's what enables them to focus on their talents and their objective. That's how they become happy and productive. But, if you can't help people change, then simply throwing technology at them won't make a difference. You need to work on mindset." By implementing more agile, attractive tools in the workplace, businesses can better attract and retain talent—and talent is the lifeblood of any organisation.

A year later, he revised the statement to every two years, but the concept has remained — though, Moore’s law today is approximately a doubling every 18 months. An international team of researchers, led by Stockholm Resilience Centre director Johan Rockström, have proposed a similar method be used to help rapidly decrease the carbon intensity of the global economy. In an article recently published in the journal Science, Rockström and co. posited the idea of a “carbon law” which would, as a general rule of thumb, encourage the global economy to halve emissions every decade. According to the Science article, A roadmap for rapid decarbonization, “Although the Paris Agreement’s goals (1) are aligned with science (2) and can, in principle, be technically and economically achieved (3), alarming inconsistencies remain between science-based targets and national commitments.” The issue is, according to the authors, “Model-based decarbonization assessment and scenarios often struggle to capture transformative change and the dynamics associated with it” — such as the disruption, innovation, and non-linear change in human behavior. One example of this is the arguably-unpredictable swing in China’s coal use in recent years. It was only earlier this decade that China’s coal consumption was growing at around 3.7% annually. Fast-forward to today, however, and it was only earlier this month that China’s own National Bureau of Statistics published figures which showed its coal consumption had declined by 4.7% — following several years of similar declines. The reason that China’s coal consumption decline was “arguably-unpredictable” was because many of us had not envisioned China would not only be willing but able to enact such dramatic and effective policies regarding its energy usage. As the authors noted, models are reliant upon existing trends, and can’t easily predict or take into account “transformative change” such as dramatic u-turns in policy. The solution then, according to the authors of the article, is: “To harness these dynamics and to calibrate for short-term realpolitik, we propose framing the decarbonization challenge in terms of a global decadal roadmap based on a simple heuristic — a “carbon law” — of halving gross anthropogenic carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions every decade.” Such a law would take the form of, for example, doubling renewable energy capacity every 5 to 7 years, ramping up the development and deployment of technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and rapidly reducing emissions from agriculture and deforestation. And the good news, according to the authors of the study, is that this is not an inherently unfeasible goal. “We are already at the start of this trajectory. In the last decade, the share of renewables in the energy sector has doubled every 5.5 years,” said Johan Rockström, who was lead author of the study. “If doubling continues at this pace fossil fuels will exit the energy sector well before 2050.” The idea of modelling the new proposal on Moore’s Law comes in part from its longevity and ability to accurately predict the future while still driving disruptive innovation. For the authors, a “carbon law” “offers a flexible way to think about reducing carbon emissions. It can be applied across borders and economic sectors, as well as both regional and global scales” and could see the end of coal in 2030-2035, and the end of oil between 2040-2045. “Humanity must embark on a decisive transformation towards complete decarbonization,” said Co-author Nebojsa Nakicenovic, deputy director general of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). “The ‘Carbon law’ is a powerful strategy and roadmap for ramping down emissions to zero so as to stay within the global carbon budget for stabilizing climate to less than 2°C above preindustrial levels.” “The carbon law outlines a global path towards achieving climate and sustainability goals in broad yet quantitative terms,” added Joeri Rogelj, also at IIASA. “It sketches a general vision of rapid emission reductions in conjunction with the development of sustainable carbon dioxide removal options. It clearly communicates that no single solution will do the job, and that this deep uncertainty thus implies starting today pursuing multiple options simultaneously.” Buy a cool T-shirt or mug in the CleanTechnica store!   Keep up to date with all the hottest cleantech news by subscribing to our (free) cleantech daily newsletter or weekly newsletter, or keep an eye on sector-specific news by getting our (also free) solar energy newsletter, electric vehicle newsletter, or wind energy newsletter.

Throw a Quadro card on Gigabyte's Z270X-Designare by Zak Killian  11:45 AM on March 24, 2017 Gigabyte's Designare branding is reserved for boards at the top of the company's range. The company says these boards are aimed at content creation professionals, and the just-announced Z270X-Designare ATX motherboard should fit that bill easily. Like most high-end motherboards, it's covered in fancy features. It's also fully validated for use with Nvidia's Quadro graphics cards. This board isn't quite as out-there as the X99-Designare EX that we reviewed last November. That's mostly because this model is based on Intel's Z270 desktop chipset rather than the X99 high-end platform. With the Z270X-Designare, you still get four DDR4 DIMM slots supporting transfer rates up to 3866 MT/sec, M.2 and U.2 sockets with PCIe 3.0 x4 connectivity, and a trio of USB 3.1 ports. One of those ports is an internal header that can be used for a front-panel USB 3.1 connector, while the other two are standard Type-A and Type-C ports located on the rear panel. Like other companies have been doing lately, Gigabyte's moved to ASMedia's 2142 USB 3.1 controller to let users run two devices at up to 8Gbps simultaneously. Curiously, Gigabyte also included two SATA Express connectors. The Z270X-Designare includes all of Gigabyte's usual builder conveniences including my favorite feature, the "G Connector" front-panel header sleeve. All five of the Z270X-Designare's fan headers are "hybrid" headers that can intelligently adapt to run a CPU fan, a case fan, a water pump, or whatever else you plug into them. All of the memory slots and PCIe x16 slots are heavily reinforced with stainless steel, too. The board supports Gigabyte's newly-redesigned RGB Fusion application for controlling its onboard RGB LEDs, as well as RGBW light-strips and the lighting on Gigabyte graphics cards. Onboard audio is provided by Realtek's top-end ALC1220 codec and includes Gigabyte's custom-designed headphone amplifier. Meanwhile, an Intel chip offers Gigabit Ethernet connectivity. It doesn't look like Gigabyte's latest effort has hit online retailers yet, but don't expect it to be cheap when it does.

Check out this list showing the companies with the highest average salaries in the Bundesrepublik. The list, compiled by the job rating website Glassdoor, ranked the top 12 companies paying the highest average salaries in Germany, Business Insider reports. The firm with the highest average salaries was the American technology company Intel, which pays its German employees on average €77,500 per year - slightly less than double the average annual wage. The study was conducted by examining every company which advertised more than 20 jobs on the Glassdoor website, with the data taken from the period between March 14th 2015 and March 13th 2017. In second place came the European multinational aerospace company Airbus Group, which paid their employees €1,000 a year less than their Intel counterparts at €76,500. Nearly €10,000 a year less in third place was the American technology giant IBM, which paid its employees an average of €66,918 a year. Of the 12 companies that topped the ranking, nine were German. However, of the top three firms, two (Intel and IBM) are from the US and one (Airbus Group) is European. Two of Germany's biggest banks, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, came sixth and eighth place respectively.  The bottom four companies listed - all nonetheless paying their employees an average of over €60,000 - were all automotive firms. Three of Germany's largest car makers - Volkswagen, Daimler, and Audi - were joined by the automotive manufacturing firm Continental.  Wages in Germany have been on the rise in the past few years, increasing for the third year in a row in 2016 by 1.8 percent. The record percentage increase came in 2015, which saw wages increase by 2.4 percent. The states where professionals earn the most was also revealed by Statista last month. It showed Hesse was the highest-paying state, with an average of €57,000 a year before tax. The lowest paying state was Saxony-Anhalt, where workers were paid an average of about €37,700 a year. jobssalarypaymoney Share this article Advertisement From our sponsors How to survive information overload and create positive change Want to make an impact?

Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Still Not a Buy, Mobileye NV (MBLY) or Not View All Posts Monday was an active day in the market as Wall Street reacted to the drama in Washington, D.C. after the GOP health care replacement bill got caught between a rock and a hard place. The good news is the large indices cut their losses, with the S&P 500 and Dow finishing down slightly while the NASDAQ managed to turn green. The orderly nature of the selling Monday and the last two weeks underscores a lack of panic, even though the frustration is clear. For me, now is not the time to panic but rather to take advantage of opportunities. One I like right now is Sierra Wireless, Inc. (USA) (NASDAQ:SWIR), which provides wireless solutions in the growing Internet of Things (IoT). The stock got hit hard on Monday after a downgrade at Raymond James to Market Perform from Outperform. At the same time, the firm raised its target price to $30. Whether they had raised the target or not, I would still say this is an opportunity. You can see on the chart below that SWIR gapped up in February after earnings, pulled back to $25.95 on February 23, and had rallied to close last Thursday and Friday above $29, which is the breakout level I’m watching. In Monday’s selling, it fell to exactly $25.95 again before rebounding to close at $27.70, providing another buying opportunity. It’s also worth keeping an eye out for news from the International Wireless Communications Expo, which is going on this week in Las Vegas and could create some positive buzz around the stock and the industry.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 March 2017 by Military News Red Hat Reseller and Alliance Partners Help Companies Find Success with Red Hat Storage Solutions LAS VEGAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Red Hat, Inc.

But the coming revolution isn't just about AI algorithms: it's about bringing computes to the massive collections of data that AI needs to function. By Robin Harris for Storage Bits | March 28, 2017 -- 12:27 GMT (05:27 PDT) | Topic: Storage A view north to the future. Rocks or clouds?Robin Harris This month's Non-Volatile Memory Workshop (NVMW '17) has concluded, and it was truly a mind-expanding program, in more ways than one. Case in point: Stanford Professor H.S. Philip Wong presented The N3XT technology for Brain Inspired Computing (N3XT is pronounced "next"). He began with a novel insight: most system energy is spent on memory and accesses. For example, natural language processing's energy footprint is 72 percent memory access. what's hot on zdnet Apple iCloud hack threat gets worse: Here's what we've learned Samsung Galaxy S8: Six big questions - and answers How Bitly migrated from colo to cloud to save money and future-proof its innovation path Security? What security? Four million data records are stolen or lost every day The concept he is working on is computation immersed in memory. A 3D chip, with layers of processors between layers of memory. Ultra-dense, with many vertical nanoscale interconnects providing high bandwidth between CPU and memory. That's not done today because processing temperatures make it impossible to add more layers without damaging lower layers. Problem one: re-engineer chip production for low temps -- ≈200C fab. Problem two: engineer the CPU/memory layers to be thin enough to support nanoscale interconnects for bandwidth and fine-grained access to memory. Problem three: DRAM runs hot and is not feasible to cool in a 3D design. So there needs to be low-energy memory that can be fabbed at low temperatures. Colleagues at Berkeley have fabricated a 1nm transistor using a carbon nanotube gate. Used in a 32MB OpenSparc T2 system, it achieved a 12x improvement in energy usage. ReRAM Wong plans on using a tiny (5nm) form of Resistance RAM (ReRAM) that can be easily adapted to 3D designs, and doesn't need an erase cycle. The chip's ultimate goal: powerful, memory-immersed processing that is 1,000x more energy efficient -- due to both energy and processing time reductions -- than today's architectures. A single 3D chip with 128 layers and 8TB of onboard memory. Neuromorphic computing Impressive as the chip specs are, the N3XT project goals are even loftier. The professor intends to use the immensely powerful hardware to create learning chips -- neuromorphic -- that emulate the brain's synaptic functions in hardware. Synapses aren't binary switches, and creating hardware that responds to the "weight" of incoming signals requires analog memory cells that vary over a range. Wong plans to build memory-based, analog synapses on N3XT chips. The Storage Bits take Unlike WD CTO Martin Fink's memory-centric architecture vision, Wong's is a moonshot project, requiring fundamental breakthroughs in multiple technologies to achieve. That makes it difficult, not impossible. What is certain is that soon the classic Von Neumann architecture will no longer work for a growing class of economically compelling applications. For these, computation must be brought to the data because there's too much data to bring to the CPUs. Of course there won't be a clean break between today's CPU-centric designs and tomorrow's memory-centric ones. Just as we won't all be driving electric cars in 10 years, CPU-centric architectures will continue to satisfy a large percentage of the world's compute needs. There are many things that today's architectures can do to improve data handling -- which is why non-volatile memories are so important to the industry. Courteous comments welcome, of course.

Server white box supremo Supermicro has a Rack Scale Design (RSD) fix for service providers, telecoms, and Fortune 500 companies dealing with this. It’s meant to enable hyperscale and public cloud-level IT rack resource management by smaller enterprises - ones with tens or hundreds of racks. Supermicro president and CEO Charles Liang said in a prepared quote, "The Supermicro RSD solution enables more customers to build large scale modern data centres leveraging Supermicro's best-of-breed server, storage and networking product portfolio.” This RSD embraces servers, storage, networking and rack-level management software, and is a superset of Intel’s open source RSD software framework and the industry standard Redfish RESTful APIs developed by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). Supermicro says it supports composable infrastructure and enables RSD interoperability among offerings from different vendors. The problem it’s looking to solve is that of stashing thousands or tens of thousands of servers, storage and switches in tens or hundreds of racks, where individually deploying and managing each item is a far too onerous task. Instead, Supermicro says, the unit of focus should be the rack, not the server, storage or switch shelf with, for example, a 1-to-21 server management tool IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface). With its RSD, a number of racks can be grouped into pods, with pod-level telemetry and maintenance functions. The RSD software enables data centre admins to pool resources in the rack and compose them for different workloads. A composed node is an abstraction for a physical node, like a virtual machine, and it can be provisioned, powered up and managed, and then deleted when its workload is complete. An analogy to use could be a factory with production lines which can be reorganised to manufacture different products. Similarly a data centre "factory" can be reorganised to run different workloads. Individually tweaking each machine in a factory production line will take too long and be error prone, whereas managing the individual machines in a group is more efficient. Supermicro RSD marketing graphic Supermicro RSD components include; Pod Manager (PodM) sitting at the top of the logical software hierarchy and using the Redfish API to communicate with the pod’s rack. It manages and aggregates the hardware resources within multiple Pod racks by polling respective PSMEs and RMMs. Rack Management Module (RMM) to manage power and thermal resources by polling rack hardware and reporting to PodM via Redfish. Pooled System Management Engine (PSME); the drawer or chassis manager, which communicates with each Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) in the drawer/chassis and reports aggregated telemetry and asset information through Redfish to PodM. Web UI - a browser-based GUI for RSD management. An RSD rack needs to include: 1U management appliance bundling all RSD related software or a software-only distribution, Two Supermicro 1G management switches for connecting the BMCs, One Supermicro data switch, Supermicro X10 and X11 server portfolio; such as TwinPro, BigTwin, FatTwin, MicroBlade, SuperBlade and GPU servers. Storage choices, such as: 2U Ultra with 24 NVMe drives as hot storage, 2U SSG with 24 SAS drives as warm storage 45 bay, 60 bay or 90 bay JBODs as cold storage. Through the Redfish support, Supermicro says its RSD can be integrated into Ansible and Puppet data centre automation software or into VMware and OpenStack private cloud software. The company says its RSD runs on all existing X10 (Broadwell) generation as well as new X11 generation server, storage and networking hardware. It enables customers to independently refresh compute module (CPU + memory) hardware while keeping the remaining server investment intact. There’s more information available here and in a brochure (PDF). An obvious comparison is with HPE’s Synergy composable infrastructure and you can check out a Synergy brochure here. With Intel pushing the RSD concept, we can expect all x86 server OEMs to deliver RSD facilities, such as Cisco, Dell, Huawei, Lenovo and others. Inevitably HPE will have to play ball. ® * Pain In The Architecture. Why? What did you think we meant?

Last Wednesday, Associated Press claimed it had obtained business records that proved Manafort had signed an annual $10-million contract with Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska in 2006. The outlet cited people familiar with the matter, as well as a strategy plan allegedly authored by Manafort, which implicated him in representing the Russian government's political interests abroad, particularly in the post-Soviet states. "I want to resolutely deny this malicious assertion and lie. I have never made any commitments or contracts with the obligation or purpose to covertly promote or advance 'Putin's Government' interests anywhere in the world," Deripaska said in a statement published in The Wall Street Journal as a paid advertisement. "I am ready to take part in any hearings conducted in the US Congress on this subject in order to defend my reputation and name," he said. Deripaska also warned media and individuals of legal responsibility for spreading disinformation about him. "The further distribution of false allegations about my alleged activities as it is put by AP by any person or media will consequently bring the cost and burden of ultimate legal responsibility on all parties taking part in this disinformation campaign… I demand that any and all further dissemination of these allegations, by the AP or any other media outlet, must cease immediately," the statement said. Deripaska's official spokesperson confirmed to Sputnik earlier in March that Manafort provided the billionaire with consultations in the sphere of investments which were limited by Deripaska's business interests. © REUTERS/ Rick Wilking White House Has No Indication Manafort Attempted to Push Russia's InterestsEarlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Paul Manafort's program to promote Russia's interests in post-Soviet countries has no connection to Russian authorities and had never been brought to the attention of the Kremlin. Manafort reportedly confirmed having worked for Deripaska in various countries nearly a decade ago, but stressed that his work was limited to representing Deripaska’s business interests in places where he had investments. Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Manafort did not encourage or pressure Trump's team to side with Russia on any issues or matters, adding that the former campaign manager's contacts with Russian companies took place a "decade ago" while representing a number of foreign clients, including those in Asia, the Caribbean, and Europe. ...

On Monday, Rafael published another patch series for tuning P-State. This latest set of 16 patches is about further clean-ups and optimizations to the P-State scaling driver. The changes this round are aiming to reduce the overhead of this driver. Those interested in testing can grab the latest patches here. It will be interesting to do a P-State vs. ACPI CPUFreq driver comparison and different governor tests when Linux 4.12 rolls around -- hopefully all of these P-State changes allow it to be in better shape. 14 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The chip maker has introduced Optane modules designed to boost the performance of your desktop PC. They're strictly cache drives that only hold 16GB or 32GB (the server module packs 375GB), but don't let that dismay you. In theory, the combination of extremely low latency (under 10 microseconds) with solid state drive speeds (at least 900MB/s in peak sequential reads) should dramatically reduce loading times across the board, Engadget said. Compared to a PC with a conventional spinning hard drive, Intel claims that you should see a 28 percent overall performance boost, with storage up to 14 times faster. Common apps like the Chrome or Outlook should load five to six times faster, Intel says. And not surprisingly, Intel is making a big deal out of gaming performance. The company boasts that games can start up to 67 percent faster, and load levels up to 65 percent faster. Intel expects both of these desktop modules to land on April 24th, and they'll be very affordable at $44 for the 16GB module and $77 for its 32GB counterpart. Optane-equipped systems from PC makers like ASUS, Dell, HP and Lenovo will arrive throughout the second quarter of the year. Just don't expect to update an older PC. You'll need a system running a 7th-generation Core (i.e. Kaby Lake) processor and the chipset to match, so you'll have to "settle" for an SSD or hybrid hard drive if you're not quite on the cutting edge, Engadget said. As for whether or not they're worth it? That likely depends on your exact circumstances. While Intel believes you'll see a speed boost even if you already have an SSD in your computer (it can eliminate the SATA bottleneck, for instance), AnandTech notes that you might be better off relying solely on an SSD if you can afford one that meets your storage needs. This is really for people stuck with conventional hard drives who want a speed boost without the expense of buying a high-capacity SSD, Engadget said. Related links: Engadget.

Intel is now bringing that same ultra fast memory technology to the desktop, but not in the way you might think. Last week’s announcement was about bringing Intel Optane SSDs to servers and workstations. This week, Intel is bringing Optane Memory to desktops in limited capacities of 16 and 32 GB not to replace your SSD or HDD but to supplement it. Intel Optane is a new brand of memory that utilizes the 3D Xpoint technology developed by Intel and Micron. It’s a type of non-volatile, high-speed, low-latency memory that promises to be a lot faster than conventional storage like hard drives but are still slower than RAM or DRAM. The technology can be used to build an SSD, like last week’s announcement, or, in this case, a memory module. Intel Optane Memory doesn’t replace your computer’s RAM. It sits in between RAM and a HDD as a sort of cache for faster access. In a way, it’s like the SSD and HDD combos, where files and programs you want to access faster are stored on the SSD. Optane Memory, however, is both simpler yet also a bit more complex at the same time. For one, you don’t actually install anything directly on Optane memory. And with only 16 or 32 GB of space, there’s not much you can install anyway, especially games. Instead, the system, Windows in particular, cherry picks what files need to be accessed quickly and regularly and stores those in Optane memory, leaving the rest of the program in HDD. The user doesn’t have to do anything except use the program or game. The optimization is handled in the background. This is you can’t simply buy an Intel Optane Memory module and slap it on any old desktop. In addition to having an 7th gen Intel Core processor, you also need an “Optane-ready” motherboard, which boils down to having “an M.2 type 2280-S1-B-M connector on a PCH Remapped PCIe Controller and Lanes in a x2 or x4 configuration with B-M keys that meet NVMe Spec 1.1,System BIOS that supports the Intel® Rapid Storage Technology (Intel® RST) 15.5.” The specialized software also requires 64-bit Windows 10. Intel Optane Memory, in 16 or 32 GB capacities, will be available starting April 24, no price details yet. Users, especially gamers, should note that Optane Memory is no panacea as it only speeds up the launching time of apps and games. The actual running speed of apps and games won’t have a significant improvement as the programs are mostly loaded into RAM anyway. Optane Memory is also best used with HDD storage and those with SSDs might also not see much improvement.

The gap is closing fast, though. http://ark.intel.com/products/95449/...ache-2_60-GHz- Nice progress being made for 7-10watts. Interesting observation; the heat/cooling problem needs to be resolved to be able to take it much further. Lower-power (wattage) isn't that much of an issue anymore. If you watch the Doom video, you will see the guy commenting on the thermal throttling of the cpu (throttles down to less than half the full cpu speed), so, the igpu has more potential, but, the heat is holding the whole system back. Bare in-mind this is a passively cooled tablet. Still work to be done to tackle these issues, but, cool to see.

Comments I don't know about you, but I think Owen would be the better team leader. On Quantico Season 2 Episode 15, there's still some team drama that gets worked out, but, for the most part, it's all entertaining drama. There aren't any petty high schoolers this time around, thankfully.  Let's start with the good: Owen and Clay's leadership battle. Clay is in a leadership role, but he recruited most of his team's Farm trainer. Who did Clay think the team was going to report to?  This provides some tension between Owen and Clay. It's fun to watch, mainly because Owen treats Clay as a recruit. I mean Owen's not wrong to do it; Clay needs training. Everyone going to Owen made sense. He was brought in to whip them into shape, and he did just that. Clay, on the other hand, has been almost like a figurehead. He briefs the team, but that's about it. There are some great character moments between Owen and Clay because of this tension. We get to see the two of them open up to each other and discuss the op in a way we won't get to see with Alex and Shelby, for instance. Owen and Clay look at the mission from different viewpoints, and it's fascinating.  While Clay blamed Owen, I think Owen was right; Clay needs to act like a leader to be treated like one. He doesn't do anything other than brief the team and wait for them to give him intel. Clay has never stepped up. Clay still has to prove he's worth the title of "boss." Owen helps the team with their missions. He reassured Harry and Alex that their cover wasn't completely blown, and he helped give them the confidence to get the intel. Owen: They're agents. They are used to getting their criminal. Waiting is not their thing, but you and I know waiting. For politicians like you, it's all the long game. And I've waited a long time to be operational. Clay: So what do I tell them? Owen: You lie. Tell them they've won. They saved the day. Permalink: You lie. Tell them they've won. They saved the day. What has Clay done? He's been rude to his team. The Shelby issue makes sense. She slept with his brother and father. They had their tiff, and they've moved past it. If we could stop with the shipper moments that would be great, though. Clay's distrust of Nimah came out of nowhere. Maybe it got lost in all the drama from Quantico Season 2 Episode 14, but Clay's wariness of Nimah came on really strong during this mission.  It felt like Nimah needed a reason to be a BAMF during the mission, so Clay all of a sudden had to distrust her and seclude her from the rest of the team. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for Nimah kicking ass, but Clay's attitude towards her cheapened the whole thing for me. Also, Nimah, girl, do you not have anyone else's phone number? When Clay ducked her call, Nimah should have called literally anyone else on the team. If she has Clay's number, then she has to have Owen's, right?  It's a small thing, but it did not make any sense why Nimah would give up on calling her team after Clay didn't answer her once. Nimah knew what the stakes were and that the mission was going on, so she should have kept calling. She could have been calling people while driving to the town. (Calling over bluetooth, obviously. Safety first.) You know what else didn't make any sense? The lack of discretion of the team.  Ryan getting spotted by Sasha was eye roll worthy. Journalists aren't stupid. If they are out investigating a chemical explosion that never happened, because I'm sure someone would have figured it out eventually, they are going to start taking photos and looking into everyone that was on site that day. Don't have your face easily accessible, especially if you are a CIA operative. I kind of feel like Ryan is awful at being CIA. What do you think?  Okay, a show of hands, who else teared up at Alex's speech to Harry about opening up?  Alex: You joke your way around everything because you're afraid to make a connection, maybe because the closest connection you ever made died right in front of you, and I get that. After my father died, I separated from the world, hid inside myself, buried myself so deep there was no where else to go. And then I met Ryan and Shelby and Nimah and Raina and Simon, and they had all been through so much themselves, but they could still smile. And they wanted to get to know me! Just like I want to get to know you. Harry: Mhmm, and all those connections, how did they work out for you? Huh? Simon Asher, he good? Raina Amin, is she around here somewhere? I'm still waiting for that save the date card for you and Alabama. Alex: Ryan and I might not be together, but we're very, very connected. I think about him. I worry about him all the time. I'm his friend, just like I'm your friend, Harry. Look there's space for you here, but you have to choose it. You can walk out that door and end up where you always end up - separate and alone. Or you can stay here and let us in. I'm not going anywhere, and I will not leave you. Permalink: Ryan and I might not be together, but we're very, very connected. I think about him. I worry... It's no secret that I adore Harry and Alex, and this hour is a perfect example as to why they are so great to watch.  Whether it is going undercover together or just being there for each other, Harry and Alex are a great team. She will always be in his corner. Alex sharing Harry's faults was a much better glimpse into who Harry is than all of the Sebastian, Elliot, and MI6 family storylines. Those dragged down the story unnecessarily, while Alex's insight was an asset.  Her words helped Harry take a shot and ask to be on the team. It wasn't a storyline that dragged on for half a season, but it wasn't a rushed scene either. It was perfect. Are you glad that Harry is officially on the team now? What did you think of the episode?

Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is offering a new memory chip package it says will improve desktop performance in a way that consumers will be willing to pay for.PHOTO: REUTERS PublishedMar 28, 2017, 11:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/48SF Copy SAN FRANCISCO (BLOOMBERG) - Intel Corp is going back to its roots as a memory chipmaker in a bid to get consumers excited about high-end desktop computers. The world's largest chipmaker, whose processors power eight out of 10 PCs sold worldwide - and provide the bulk of Intel's revenue - is offering a new memory chip package it says will improve desktop performance in a way that consumers will notice and be willing to pay for. Every day, a typical consumer powers their PC on and off twice and uses 11 different programs, launching each one seven times. A machine equipped with Intel's Optane memory package will perform those routine tasks much quicker than computers currently in use, Intel said. The new memory module is 14 times faster at loading a program from a standard hard drive. According to research provided by Intel, more than 70 per cent of desktops still use spinning magnetic hard disks. "It's basically all about responsiveness," said Gregory Bryant, an Intel vice-president. "People are spending too much time waiting." For Intel, which was founded in the 1960s as a maker of memory chips, the push back into that business is part of chief executive officer Brian Krzanich's attempt to diversify the company's revenue sources beyond processors for servers and PCs. While previous attempts to return to the market it exited in the 1990s have not been successful, this time Intel is bringing a new type of chip not offered by other manufacturers that it hopes will give it a sustainable edge. Optane packages are based on Intel's 3D Xpoint memory. They will function as a giant fast cache, storing files frequently used by the processor and allowing much quicker load times. The new offering does not replace computer storage or main memory. The memory chip only works with Intel processors. That may help the company rebuff an attempt by Advanced Micro Devices to claw back some of the market with a new range of processors it says rival Intel's best. It is also aimed at one of the few areas of the PC market - which has been declining since it peaked in 2011 - that has remained strong: High-end gaming PCs will grow about 12 per cent this year, according to a prediction provided by Intel. That growth will be driven by gamers' willingness to fork out for the highest performing hardware. Optane is available in two modules, a 16 gigabyte version for US$44 (S$61) and 32 gigabyte package for US$77.

The world’s largest chipmaker, whose processors power eight out of ten PCs sold worldwide -- and provide the bulk of Intel’s revenue -- is offering a new memory chip package it says will improve desktop performance in a way that consumers will notice and be willing to pay for. Every day a typical consumer powers their PC on and off twice and uses 11 different programs, launching each one seven times. A machine equipped with Intel’s Optane memory package will perform those routine tasks much quicker than computers currently in use, Intel said. The new memory module is 14 times faster at loading a program from a standard hard drive. According to research provided by Intel, more than 70 percent of desktops still use spinning magnetic hard disks. “It’s basically all about responsiveness,” said Gregory Bryant, an Intel vice president. “People are spending too much time waiting.” Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up For Intel, which was founded in the 1960s as a maker of memory chips, the push back into that business is part of Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich’s attempt to diversify the company’s revenue sources beyond processors for servers and PCs. While previous attempts to return to the market it exited in the 1990s haven’t been successful, this time Intel is bringing a new type of chip not offered by other manufacturers that it hopes will give it a sustainable edge. Optane packages are based on Intel’s 3D Xpoint memory. They’ll function as a giant fast cache, storing files frequently used by the processor and allowing much quicker load times. The new offering doesn’t replace computer storage or main memory. The memory chip only works with Intel processors. That may help the company rebuff an attempt by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to claw back some of the market with a new range of processors it says rival Intel’s best. It’s also aimed at one of the few areas of the PC market - which has been declining since it peaked in 2011 - that has remained strong: High-end gaming PCs will grow about 12 percent this year, according to a prediction provided by Intel. That growth will be driven by gamers’ willingness to fork out for the highest performing hardware. Optane is available in two modules, a 16 gigabyte version for $44 and 32 gigabyte package for $77.

Mountain View, CA (PRWEB) March 28, 2017 FogHorn™ Systems, a leading developer of “edge intelligence” software for industrial and commercial Internet of Things applications, today provided a year-to-date review of events driving its 2017 thought leadership outreach. “Although we are still in the first quarter of 2017, we have already participated in more exhibitions, conferences and industry summits than all of 2016,” said FogHorn CEO David C. King. “Because the Industrial IoT industry is evolving and growing exponentially, there is no substitute for the direct, face-to-face interactions that these events provide for us, especially in a global context. It allows us to not only exchange information with customers, partners and industry thought leaders, but it also puts all of us on the same page in regards to which directions IIoT technology is heading.” In March 2017, FogHorn will have participated in ten key events ranging from private investor showcases to large international exhibitions. Last week, FogHorn was a featured partner and exhibitor at Bosch Connected World in Berlin. “FogHorn was mentioned multiple times during Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner’s keynote address,” King said. “This recognition validates what we are doing in the industry, and it would not be possible without our active participation in events like this.” During his address, Denner introduced the audience to the concept of Fog Computing. “If we do everything in the cloud we need huge bandwidth. We need to transfer huge amounts of data which doesn't make a lot of sense for all kinds of data,” he said. “That's why we need one asset, in the sensor, in the ECU, (with) capabilities for data handling and also for computing. And that's what we call Fog Computing.” Video excerpt from keynote address. “We are invested by our subsidiary Bosch Venture Capital in a company called FogHorn and they for example have a technology that allows (them) to pre-analyze data on the asset to react in almost real time,” he said.

Why so high?" Trump has been obsessed with ratings — his own and his rivals' — for some time. Since he took office, he's been engaged in a Twitter feud with former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger regarding the latter's hosting of a reality show in which the president formerly starred. Trump called Schwarzenegger's ratings "pathetic" earlier this month. Trump's record-breaking unpopularity is the lowest of any US president since the 1940s, according to the Financial Times.

Here's a brief summary of some of the high profile announcements President Trump made, regarding new job creations, versus the actual reality (thank you Jane Timm). *Exxon led until recently by President Donald Trump's secretary of state, announced a $20 billion, 47,000 jobs investment in America with a press release a little after 3 p.m. Monday afternoon.* Less than an hour later, Trump applauded the oil giant with effusive tweets and a White House press release remarkably similar to Exxon's own. He also claimed credit for the announcement in a video released on social media. "This is something that was done to a large extent because of our policies and the policies of this new administration," Trump said in the video. "I said we're bringing back jobs. This is one big example of it." *But the investment isn't new. At least some of the spending on that $20 billion investment began in 2013, Exxon's press release reveals, and is expected to continue through 2022.* One project the company touted has already been completed. Still, Exxon's new CEO specifically praised Trump's administration. *This isn't the first time Trump has claimed credit for job creation* and corporate spending that was initiated sometimes years before his presidential run — or that a company has repackaged old news to seem fresh. "Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs," Trump said during his joint address to Congress. *Here, we fact check* the various announcements Trump has sought to take credit for. GET READY TO BE DESTROYED TRUMPSTERS. Jane Timm is going to fact check Trump's record on jobs for the past month and sixteen days -- without ever mentioning official jobs numbers or economic statistics. BEHOLD. *Carrier* *Just weeks after his election, Trump bragged that he struck a deal with the state of Indiana and Carrier to preserve more than 1,100 jobs that would have otherwise been sent to Mexico.* (United Technologies, Carrier's parent company, had previously said 2,100 total jobs would go to Mexico from two different facilities — the Carrier plant, and a United Technologies Electronics Controls facility.) The company received $7 million in tax incentives over a decade, and credited Trump for his job-saving prowess. But the numbers tell a different story. *Trump's deal saved 800 jobs or fewer, according to union officials, and around 350 of those jobs had not been slated to leave.* Amid the fanfare, Carrier announced that they'd send other jobs — 600, by one estimate — to Mexico. Another 700 jobs from the UTEC facility will also be outsourced. *Did Trump help save or create jobs?**Yes, but* not the more than 1,000 he claimed. (Timm sharpens blade and sticks it into your heart, causing your heart to explode) *Ford* *In November, Trump boasted that he had "worked hard" to keep Ford's Lincoln plant in Kentucky*, but the plant wasn't going anywhere. Ford had been investing in the plant for years, and while the company had considered moving production of a single model of Lincoln to an existing Mexican plant to make room for production of another car, the company says it wouldn't have had an impact on jobs in either country. They did say their decision not to shift car production did have something to do with Trump, however. In January, the company ditched plans for a new $1.6 billion Ford Focus plant in Mexico, saying it would keep the car's production at an existing Mexican plant. It also announced a $700 million investment in an existing Michigan plant to build more electric vehicles, creating 700 more jobs in the United States. The company stressed that it didn't cut a deal with the president, and that its decisions were rooted in business priorities rather than politics. *However, Ford did say that the decision meant a "vote of confidence" in Trump's pro-business policy plans.* *Did Trump help save or create jobs?* When it comes to jobs in the Lincoln plant, *no*. *Trump may have had a hand in Ford's decision* to invest more dollars in the U.S., *but the carmaker has refuted the notion* that it was a direct result of his presidency. (Timm removes knife, cleans off the blood with a pink cloth and then sticks it into your eye socket, twisting it until your eye is removed) *Fiat Chrysler* Fiat Chrysler announced in early January that they'd invest $1 billion in plants in Warren, Ohio and Toledo, Ohio, *adding 2,000 jobs. Trump took credit for the announcement* in his joint address, but Fiat Chrysler said the deal arose from talks with United Auto Workers and that the plans predated then President-elect Trump to decisions made in 2015. "I wish I could give him credit for this," Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told reporters recently. "But the thinking was in place beforehand." Marchionne did say that the company would need clarity from the president before making any production decisions about Mexico. *Did Trump help save or create jobs?**Not yet*, according to the company's CEO. (Timm removes blade and then opens up your stomach with it, removing your small intestines, playing with it like silly string) *General Motors* General Motors announced a $1 billion investment in January alongside *the creation or retention of 1,500 manufacturing jobs,* the return of 450 jobs from Mexico, and the addition of *5,000 jobs "over the next few years"* in finance and technology. *GM officials stressed that the decision dates back as early as 2014, long before Trump* got involved and threatened a "big border tax" for the company because it imports several thousand hatchbacks to the U.S. from Mexico. GM CEO Mary Barra, who is on Trump's economic advisory council, said the firm had no plans to alter their manufacturing plans to please the president. *Did Trump help save or create jobs? Nope.* (Timm cuts off your right leg with one fell swoop) *Sprint/OneWeb/SoftBank* *Trump took credit for Sprint's plant to bring 5,000 jobs back to the United States* — "because of me they are doing 5,000 jobs in this country," he said — as well as the 3,000 jobs OneWeb said they'd add, and the $50 billion investment by SoftBank that fueled both firms' job growth. Trump met with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son in December. *Sprint and OneWeb confirmed later that the job growth had been previously announced, and SoftBank said the investment had been in the works since October as part of SoftBank's promised 50,000 new jobs.* There is some indication that SoftBank's CEO increased the size of the investment in OneWeb and the number of new hires, however. *Did Trump help save or create jobs? Possibly.* It's clear that the investment was already happening, though Trump may have helped boost it. (Timm, now rabid with blood thirst, cuts jugular vein and begins drinking your blood) *Lockheed Martin* *Lockheed announced 1,800 new jobs before Trump even took office*, as part of a deal they were working out with the Pentagon for fighter jets. The government contractor later credited Trump for the deal, as well as the cost-cutting measures Trump gave himself credit for, but experts say both things had been in the works for awhile. No matter the favor they may be trying to curry with the new president, taxpayer savings and new jobs aren't his doing completely. *Did Trump help save or create jobs?* Trump's administration inked the deal a few weeks into his term and Lockheed did credit him, but *Trump didn't sew this deal together himself.* (Timm removes your left arm from your torso with small ax) *Intel* *After meeting with Trump in February, Intel pledged to commit $7 billion to build a new factory in Arizona, hiring at least 3,000 employees.* Intel's CEO credited Trump with the move, despite the fact that Intel's domestic investment had been in the works for years; construction on a factory began in 2011, though it was delayed when demand decreased. *Did Trump help save or create jobs?* *Intel says he helped create jobs, but* their investment had been in the works (though delayed) since 2011. (Timm saws off your left leg with rusty hacksaw) *Walmart* *In January, Walmart said they'd add 10,000 jobs.* Trump thanked them in a tweet, but the jobs had been previously announced in October as part of a $6.8 billion capital-spending plan. *Did Trump help save or create jobs? There's no evidence that he had any impact here.* (Timm castrates you and begins to cook your testicles in a wok with organic avocado oil) *Alibaba* *The Chinese e-commerce giant's founder, Jack Ma, met with Trump in January, announcing that Alibaba helped create 1 million jobs in the United States.* Trump said the group wasn't considering doing that before he got elected, but the company's founder has been talking about it for years. Asked if he and Trump had talked about that investment, *Ma said "no."* The Washington Post reported that the numbers don't add up: *it's unlikely that the tech giant with just 35,000 employees can grow so quickly in the U.S.* *Did Trump help save or create jobs?* Trump is taking credit for jobs that appear to have been in the works before that he didn't specifically discuss with the group's founder while experts doubt the reality of such investment. *We'll have to wait and see on this one.* (Timm sits down to eat your testicles, washing it down with a warm cup of non-organic herbal tea) A review of sleepy teas: "The herbs aren’t organic, so hippies I consulted don’t adore this one, but I do." https://t.co/twYSP1Ooj7 — Jane C.

All meetings of the House Russia investigators were canceled this week shortly before the top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, said Nunes must recuse himself in order for the investigation to continue. Schiff also said Tuesday that he wants Republicans to agree to reschedule a pair of hearings that had been set for today — including one where former acting Attorney General Sally Yates was expected to testify about communications between former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak — before agreeing to move forward with their investigation. “We are recommending that they schedule two hearings — the hearing with directors (FBI Director) James Comey and Rogers, as well as the open hearing which they originally canceled. So we hope that they will except that invitation and we can continue to move forward,” Schiff told reporters Tuesday. “The White House today said that they want Sally Yates to testify, so let her testify. I think it will be hard now for the chairman to explain why he won’t permit her to come testify.” Nunes, however, told CNN Tuesday morning he was “moving forward” with the investigation and said he won’t recuse himself. “It moves forward just like it was before,” Nunes told reporters. Advertisement It’s a monumental shift from where House investigators planned to be Tuesday, interrogating a trio of former Obama administration officials in a public hearing. But last week’s hearing — the first and so far only public hearing of the House Russia investigation — sparked a wildfire of partisan fighting after Comey confirmed he is investigating possible coordination between President Donald Trump’s campaign aides and Russian officials. The ensuing days saw Nunes brief Trump privately on new information of potential surveillance of Trump’s aides before telling Democrats on the investigation. Nunes then apologized to Democrats, but the following day he canceled Tuesday’s public hearing, saying he wanted to hear from Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers in private, prompting outrage from Democrats. Nunes said Tuesday he formally invited Comey to testify again, though he did not specify any details on timing. Advertisement Speaker Ryan says House Intel Committee chair Devin Nunes should not recuse himself from Russia probe. https://t.co/sG0hbjyuYo pic.twitter.com/DMXCIm9m82 — ABC News (@ABC) March 28, 2017 A Republican House Intelligence Committee source defended the decision to try and move the Comey and Rogers hearing behind closed doors, saying Democrats are trying to kill the investigation. “We just had 100 questions where Director Comey said that he couldn’t answer in that setting, so you think the next step this week would be then ‘OK, we’ll come down and answer the questions in the closed session,'” the source said. “But from what I understand, we were not able to agree to have that done.” Asked to weigh in on calls for Nunes to recuse himself, the Republican source responded, “That’s horses—.” The news Monday that Nunes met his source on White House grounds sparked the latest round of partisan fighting, which has left investigators unable to continue right now. Advertisement White House press secretary Sean Spicer dismissed accusations that the White House was being evasive on the specifics of Nunes’ visit but refused to provide details on who signed the California Republican into White House grounds, as would be required protocol. The White House on Tuesday also rejected allegations that it sought to prevent Yates from testifying the House committee’s investigation. “The White House has taken no action to prevent Sally Yates from testifying and the Department of Justice, specifically told her that it would not stop her and to suggest otherwise is completely irresponsible,” deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement to CNN. The statement came after The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration sought to block Yates’ testimony before Congress. Even before Monday’s stunning split, Democrats and Republicans said they were having a hard time agreeing on how to move forward in their investigation, unable to agree on which key witnesses to bring in. That split was punctuated by announcements from three key figures at the center of the FBI investigation — former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump adviser Roger Stone and former Trump foreign policy aide Carter Page — that they would gladly testify before House investigators. Advertisement In private, Republicans have accused Democrats of “grandstanding” — using Nunes trips to the White House as a means to kill an investigation that they say is unlikely to turn up any smoking guns of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence. Democrats, meanwhile, have accused Nunes of attempting to “suicide bomb” his own investigation because they are convinced the evidence of collusion is there. In a highly symbolic move Monday, after Nunes canceled a planned committee meeting, House Intelligence Republicans and Democrats still met in the same, classified briefing space in the Capitol where they typically meet but they gathered separately, plotting their own game plans. Democrats believe Nunes is too close to the White House to lead a thorough investigation into Russia — including ties between the Trump camp and Russian officials — an assertion firmly rejected by the GOP. “I don’t think he can just recuse himself and still chair the committee,” Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat on the panel, told CNN’s Chris Cuomo Tuesday on “New Day.” “I think that the writing is on the wall. It might make a good spy novel. It doesn’t make a good investigation.” Comey and Rogers opted not to brief the panel amid the furor within the committee over how to proceed with its investigation. The full committee typically meets at least twice a week and it’s uncertain if those meetings will be rescheduled. This story has been updated to reflect breaking news. CNN’s Jeremy Diamond and Eugene Scott contributed to this report.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: After the House cancels on her, Sally Yates will testify on Trump-Russia before the Senate In Politics by Tosten Burks / March 28, 2017 Share < br />this article: Follow @tostenburks Well, it’s good to see at least one of our congressional chambers not duck and hide from the insight senior officials might have into the foggy controversy surrounding the Trump-Russia affair. After House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes canceled this week’s public hearing on the subject, at which former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates was scheduled to testify, NBC News reports Senator Mark Warner will invite Yates to speak this week before the Senate Intelligence panel. Sen Warner says no invite yet, but "It's obviously my intent that Sally Yates would be one of the people (that testifies before Sen Intel)" — Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) March 28, 2017 Ever since members of the Senate Intelligence Committee met in February behind closed doors with FBI director James Comey to discuss Russia’s influence on the election, the panel has been waging its own investigation into the Trump administration’s connections to the Kremlin. The Senate committee conducted private interviews with intelligence officials last week, and on Monday, The New York Times reported investigators plan to interview President Trump’s senior adviser and skiing sarcophagus Jared Kushner about his December interactions with Moscow’s ambassador to Washington and the head of a U.S.-sanctioned Russian bank. For what it’s worth, White House press secretary Sean Spicer denied Tuesday that the White House attempted to bar Yates’s House testimony. “I hope she testifies — I look forward to it,” Spicer said in response to reports that the Justice Department informed Yates that anything she might disclose is blocked by presidential communications privilege. “We have no problem with her testifying, plain and simple.” Tags: Sally Yates, senate intel committee 0 Recommended for you The White House tried to block Sally Yates from testifying about Russia Trump admin decides 2020 Census will not include questions on gender identity or sexual orientation Mike Pence will not attend an event serving booze without his wife Karen, aka ‘Mother’ Maxine Waters: ‘I’m a strong black woman and I cannot be intimidated’ House votes to let internet service providers sell your info to the highest bidder Trump calling a man the wrong name right after saying ‘we don’t make mistakes’ is fake news sign up to get the latest deathandtaxes news Thank you for signing up for our newsletter.

People are seen along the National Mall during warm weather on February 23, 2017 in Washington, DC. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / AFP/Getty Images) Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter How do you build a monument honoring those who fought in a war that’s still going on? That’s the problem facing veterans behind the Global War on Terror Memorial Foundation, which on Tuesday announced legislation that could speed the process along. A group of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans hopes to raise up to $35 million with the goal of putting a monument on the National Mall in Washington by 2024. On Tuesday, two congressmen unveiled legislation that would help jump a major roadblock: Under current law, the process can’t be authorized until 10 years after war’s end. “The war is not over. Every think tank in Washington will tell you it’s going to be a multi-generational effort,” said Andrew Brennan, a 32-year-old Army veteran who founded the nonprofit foundation in 2015. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day Brennan, who flew combat missions in Afghanistan, said the important question is the intent of the law, which is the 1986 Commemorative Works Act. “The intent was not 10 years or 25 years, it was: Is this historically significant enough in the course of U.S. history to warrant permanent memorialization?” Brennan said in an interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune. “We are approaching 7,000 being killed, 52,000-plus wounded, over 250,000 veterans dealing with post-traumatic stress issues, and the fact that this war is our longest ... I think we have met the historic burden context,” he said. In Washington, Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisconsin, and Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts, announced a bill that would appoint Brennan’s foundation as the designed group for the monument effort. It would also amend the existing 10-year rule to specify that a commemorative work can be considered immediately if a major conflict stretches on beyond a decade. Advocates said past generations of war veterans had to wait too long to see their memorials erected in the nation’s capital. The World War II memorial opened in 2004 on the National Mall — nearly 60 years after the end of the conflict. The Korean War memorial was dedicated in 1995, on the 42nd anniversary of the armistice that ended that campaign. Moulton, who served in Iraq as a Marine, said his World War II veteran grandfather never got to visit that war’s national monument. “I want to make sure that that’s not the case for so many war on terrorism veterans,” he said. “So we’ve got to get this process started.” Gallagher, another Marine who served in Iraq, said he sees the monument as a way to honor service members who died in combat. But, he added, “My hope is this memorial will not only remind us of that sacrifice, and the sacrifice of so many families, but also serve as a call to action for us who are alive, and remind us that those who have given their lives for this country don’t want us to sit back … but want us to get engaged in this process of self government.” Brennan also sees the memorial as a means for post-9/11 veterans — who may be missing camaraderie in civilian life — to get engaged with each other. “Ten or 15 percent of this labor to build this memorial, maybe that comes from veteran volunteers the summer that that happens,” said the former Army officer. “It could be quite literally the veterans from that era pitching in to build their own memorial. I see a lot of potential for a lot of traditions to recur around this memorial that will help bring the cohort of global war on terror veterans together,” he added. This is the second attempt at legislation. A bill introduced last fall by former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, a retired Navy SEAL, died due to lack of action in the House. Zinke could, in theory, still be a powerful advocate in his new job as secretary of the interior. Brennan said his group — which includes political heavy-hitters such as retired four-star Army generals David Petraeus and George Casey — is eyeing a spot on the banks of the Potomac River, not far from the Lincoln Memorial. That’s outside of the National Mall’s “no-build” reserve district. But no location is yet certain. Similarly, Brennan said there’s no way to guess what look the monument which have. He foresees a national competition to design it — as is customary with war monuments. More than 2 million U.S. service members are estimated to have served in combat theaters since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that led to the invasion of Afghanistan. The United States invaded Iraq in 2003 to depose President Saddam Hussein and neutralize weapons caches that never materialized. While major ground combat has concluded, U.S. troops remain behind in both places in an effort to quell extremism including the jihadist Islamic State group. Roughly 30,000 post-9/11 veterans call the San Diego region home. The Global War on Terror Memorial Foundation has a “take action” campaign that urges supporters of the national monument project to contact their legislators.

By Bob Brown News Editor, Network World | Mar 28, 2017 11:01 AM PT Credit: Thinkstock More like this Why WiGig will be a wireless game-changer Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 Aruba’s top execs talk new tech, IoT and the competition Video MWC 2017: Top phones get a new lease on life Products based on the IEEE 802.11ad (WiGig) standard have really only begun rolling out over the past year, but an effort to deliver an enhancement dubbed 802.11ay that promises to deliver faster and longer range W-Fi networks is gaining steam.  Here’s the lowdown on this newest in the 802.11 WLAN series…  I can’t believe I have another 802.11something-or-other to keep track of.  Believe it. Though really think of 802.11ay as an enhancement of 11ad in the unlicensed 60 GHz millimeter wave band of spectrum, so it should be a pretty natural upgrade. And it could really be worth any trouble given potential speed and range improvements. So what's the difference between ad and ay? The 802.11ad standard was published in 2012 and the technology gives devices access to the unlicensed and relatively unclogged 60 GHz millimeter wave spectrum band for multimedia streaming, VR headset connectivity, computer-to-monitor wireless links and other apps that don’t require more than say 30 or 40 feet of unimpeded space. [ Further reading: The votes are in: Which mobile data provider is best? ] It has been adopted by chipmakers like Intel, Peraso and Qualcomm as well as vendors of routers, access points or other devices such as Dell, TP-Link and Netgear. The Wi-Fi Alliance runs a WiGig certification program for vendors, and the early 11ad gear on the market most commonly supports data transfer rates of 4.6Gbps – way faster than 802.11n and 11ac, but more limited in range and unable to penetrate solid objects. The backwards compatible 802.11ay amendment to 802.11ad is designed to boost speeds several-fold. That initially would amount to a transmission rate of 20 to 30Gbps and a range of 33 to 100 feet with 11ay-to-11ay device setups, but once channel bonding, MIMO and other capabilities are exploited, you could be getting closer to 200Gbps and reaching distances approaching 1,000 feet, according to industry players. 11ay, as the specs are being developed, “is really allowing for a wider range of products than you’d get with ad, which has one set of data rates that everyone supports… ay has a lot more parameters to play with in channel bonding, MIMO and features at the MAC level to allow a far greater range of performance and products,” says Brad Lynch, co-founder and SVP of product development at Peraso Technologies, which already has WiGig-certified 11ad chipsets on the market and is readying for 11ay.  MORE: Read our Q&A with Peraso's Brad Lynch By the way, don’t confuse 802.11ay with 802.11ax, which will work in the 2.5 and 5 GHz bands. What would 11ay be used for? It remains to be seen how soon the high speeds of 11ay will be needed for internal uses, as 802.11ac — including Wave 2 products — are already pretty robust. But Peraso’s Lynch says that if 11ad doesn’t quite do it for you given its distance limitations, “11ay will finally be the technology that would let you snip that Ethernet cord – you no longer have to run Ethernet cables to everyone’s desk… there’s enough wireless bandwidth in ay.” Most of those we spoke with about 11ay were more enthusiastic about its potential as a fixed point-to-point or point-to-multipoint outdoor backhaul technology, especially in light of scaled back fiber rollout plans by providers like Google and Verizon in the face of extraordinary costs associated with such implementations. “I’m more bullish on using ad & ay for backhaul (instead of mesh) in the case of campus & city networks — provided that it has a useful range, says Claus Hetting of Hetting Consulting and chairman of the Wi-Fi Now event. But it’s possible that 11ay could find a role in internal mesh and backbone networks as well as for other uses such as providing connectivity to VR headsets, supporting server backups and handling cloud applications that require low latency. “I believe that eventually, there will be enterprise applications for this - but it’s probably a few years into the future, given that we will have 802.11ax fairly soon & because there’s still a lot of 5 GHz band available for that (and ac),” Hetting says.  On the consumer side, the trend over the past year has really been to get rid of cables, so 802.11ay as an HDMI or USB replacement would be "a beautiful application," says Bernd Jungbluth, senior test engineer for testing laboratory TUV Rheinland. "It could make more of the equipment intuitive," as Bluetooth and Near Field Communication have done for certain applications, he says.  When will 11ay become reality? The 802.11ay task group had its initial meeting in 2015 and the spec only hit the Draft 0.1 stage in January. Though it is expected to reach Draft 1.0 by July, according to the IEEE task group. If that mark is hit, expect pre-standard 11ay products to start rolling out within a year of that time. Who is behind 11ay?  The IEEE task force leading the 11ay work includes representatives from Huawei, Intel, LG Electronics and Teradyne. Reps from companies including Ericsson, Sony, Qualcomm, Panasonic and Peraso have also attended meetings. The group states its goal as this: "Task Group ay is expected to develop an amendment that defines standardized modifications to both the IEEE 802.11 physical layers (PHY) and the IEEE 802,11 medium access control layer (MAC) that enables at least one mode of operation capable of supporting a maximum throughput of at least 20 gigabits per second (measured at the MAC data service access point), while maintaining or improving the power efficiency per station.  This amendment also defines operations for license-exempt bands above 45 GHz while ensuring backward compatibility and coexistence with legacy directional multi-gigabit stations (defined by IEEE 802.11ad-2012 amendment) operating in the same band."

Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, Walter Yeh (葉明水), president of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), the organizers of COMPUTEX, said this year's exhibition would bring a rebranding of COMPUTEX, with the show's core focus shifting to IoT, AI and innovative startups. The four-day trade show features 1,600 businesses at 5010 booths, each showcasing innovations in one of the five following areas: AI and Robotics, IoT applications, innovations and startups, business solutions and gaming and virtual reality (VR). Some of the leading tech companies with booths at COMPUTEX 2017 include Intel, NVIDIA, Super Micro, and Taiwan's Asus. Given this year's focus on AI, Tesla, which has been at the forefront of AI development for cars, as well as AI chipmaker Dell, will attend for the first time. InnoVEX One of the four featured exhibits at this year's COMPUTEX is InnoVEX, the largest Asian platform for innovative startups This year's InnoVEX will showcase innovations from 230 businesses from 20 different countries, including the U.S., Denmark, France, South Korea, Indonesia, Germany, and Pakistan. Many of these innovations are in the area of IoT, with Taipei Computer Association's Chang Lee (張苙) claiming that 80 percent of all innovations in the future will be related to IoT. This is the second year that InnoVEX will be hosted alongside COMPUTEX in Taiwan, with the event running from May 30 to June 1. The other three exhibits are SmarTEX, which TAITRA has described as "the stage for the latest IoT applications," Gaming & VR, a platform for the latest, high-performance gaming products, and iStyle, a special showcase for Apple MFI-certified peripherals. Key Players to Watch TAITRA invited representatives from Asus, NVDIA, Intel, Tesla, and Super Micro to the Tuesday press conference. The representatives shared what visitors could expect from their booths at COMPUTEX, which runs from May 30 to June 3. Asus deputy general manager of mobile communications Huang Chung-li (黃中立) highlighted the firm's highly-anticipated ZenFone VR and its Republic of Gaming computers for gamers as key foci for this year's show. NVDIA will also put its focus on gaming, where its technology has gone from "simulating human imagination" to "simulating human intelligence." Super Micro, a global leader in high performance and high efficiency server technology, will showcase its newest products and developments in embedded processors and GPU, according to its senior embedded server product manager Charles Chi (紀士釗) Although Tesla has yet to confirm its plans for the trade show, it disclosed to The China Post that it would be focusing on its cars, perhaps showcasing one or two of them at COMPUTEX 2017.

AIDA64 version 5.90 supports Ryzen and Apollo Lake by Zak Killian  11:00 AM on March 28, 2017 Popular system information and benchmark software AIDA64 has just received its latest update to version 5.90. The update includes various improvements, but the headline news this time around is that AIDA64 now properly supports AMD Ryzen processors and their Socket AM4 motherboards. FinalWire, the developer of AIDA64, had warned previously that benchmark results on Ryzen processors may not have been accurate before today's update. AIDA64's Ryzen support includes preliminary support for server processors based on the same Zen CPU core, like the Naples chip we've heard about before. Across the aisle, Intel's latest Atom-family chips—code-named Apollo Lake—are also freshly-supported in version 5.90. Along with that, FinalWire implemented support for a bunch of upcoming Intel CPUs from the Cannonlake, Coffee Lake, Denverton, Kaby Lake-X, and Skylake-X families. The new version of AIDA also has support for Microsoft's Windows 10 Creators Update, with fixes and optimizations going into the ACPI queries, tree enumeration, and temperature measurement modules. The Creators Update is about to hit in April, so the time is nigh. If you're already an AIDA64 user, check out the full release notes. If you haven't used AIDA64, it can be an incredibly handy tool for troubleshooting. Even if everything's working properly for you, benchmarks are always fun too. Grab a 30-day free trial of AIDA64 5.90 at FinalWire's website. Tags: Software Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

At the time, we heard that Skylake X and the X299 platform would be launching in August but it seems that things might be further along than we thought as this week, AIDA 64 was updated with “improved support” for both Skylake X and Kaby Lake X. Usually, we would expect to see ‘preliminary support’ added if a CPU is still in its early stages, but the wording hear makes it sound like Skylake X might not be that far off at all. Here’s a list of other improvements brought to the latest AIDA 64 update: AVX2 and FMA accelerated 64-bit benchmarks for AMD Ryzen Summit Ridge processors Microsoft Windows 10 Creators Update support Optimised 64-bit benchmarks for Intel Apollo Lake SoC Improved support for Intel Cannonlake, Coffee Lake, Denverton, Kaby Lake-X, Skylake-X CPUs Preliminary support for AMD Zen server processors Preliminary support for Intel Gemini Lake SoC and Knights Mill HPC CPU NZXT Kraken X52 sensor support Socket AM4 motherboards support Improved support for Intel B250, H270, Q270 and Z270 chipset based motherboards EastRising ER-OLEDM032 (SSD1322) OLED support SMBIOS 3.1.1 support Crucial M600, Crucial MX300, Intel Pro 5400s, SanDisk Plus, WD Blue SSD support Improved support for Samsung NVMe SSDs Advanced support for HighPoint RocketRAID 27xx RAID controllers GPU details for nVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, Quadro GP100, Tesla P6 Now back to Intel X299 news. Aside from being name dropped in the latest version of AIDA 64, we also have our first benchmark leak for what appears to be the first X299 CPU. We don’t know if it is based on Kaby Lake or Skylake yet but we do know that Intel has a Core i7 7740K in the works. While Intel has strayed away from quad-core designs over the last couple of HEDT CPU releases, the 7740K is a quad-core part running on the X299 platform, making this leak particularly intriguing. Videocardz managed to spot the Core i7 7740K being run through the SiSoft SANDRA arithmetic and multimedia benchmark on an ASRock Fatal1ty X299 motherboard. Intel’s upcoming chip couldn’t quite keep up with AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800x in the arithmetic test, performing closer to a Ryzen 5 1600x. However, the Core i7 came close on multimedia performance. Obviously, we don’t know how far off this new Core i7 is, so things could change as Intel tweaks things behind the scenes in the build up to launch. KitGuru Says: It seems like Intel is very busy behind the scenes, though its plans are unclear at the moment. Perhaps we will start to hear more information in the buildup to Computex in June.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Intel Intel Core i7 7740K Kaby Lake X news Skylake-X X299 Previous Intel’s new Optane Memory aims to bring big boosts to storage performance Next The Calyos NSG S0 is launching on Kickstarter tomorrow Check Also Win a PC hardware bundle with Gigabyte AORUS, HyperX and KitGuru If you have been following KitGuru for a while, then you have probably noticed that … lehpron The purpose may not be to compete with Ryzen as we first started reading rumors of a 4-core coming back to HEDT long before Zen ES started showing their worth.

Some of you may recall my security webinar from back in mid-August; one of the follow-up questions that I was asked was about the performance impact of enabling SSL connections. My answer was 25%, based on some 2011 data that I had seen over on yaSSL’s website, but I included the caveat that it is workload-dependent, because the most expensive part of using SSL is establishing the connection. Not long thereafter, I received a request to conduct some more specific benchmarks surrounding SSL usage in MySQL, and today I’m going to show the results. First, the testing environment. All tests were performed on an Intel Core i7-2600K 3.4GHz CPU (8 cores, HT included) with 32GB of RAM and CentOS 6.4. The disk subsystem is a 2-disk RAID-0 of Samsung 830 SSDs, although since we’re only concerned with measuring the overhead added by using SSL connections, we’ll only be conducting read-only tests with a dataset that fits completely in the buffer pool. The version of MySQL used for this experiment is Community Edition 5.6.13, and the testing tools are sysbench 0.5 and Perl. We conduct two tests, each one designed to simulate one of the most common MySQL usage patterns. First, we examine connection pooling, often seen in the Java world, where some small set of connections are established by, for example, the servlet container and then just passed around to the application as needed, and one-request-per-connection, typical in the LAMP world, where the script that displays a given page might connect to the database, run a couple of queries, and then disconnect. Test 1: Connection Pool For the first test, I ran sysbench in read-only mode at concurrency levels of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 threads, first with no encryption and then with SSL enabled and key lengths of 1024, 2048, and 4096 bits. 8 sysbench tables were prepared, each containing 100,000 rows, resulting in a total data size of approximately 256MB. The size of my InnoDB buffer pool was 4GB, and before conducting each official measurement run, I ran a warm-up run to prime the buffer pool. Each official test run lasted 10 minutes; this might seem short, but unlike, say, a PCIe flash storage device, I would not expect the variable under observation to really change that much over time or need time to stabilize. The basic sysbench syntax used is shown below. Shell 
#!/bin/bash
for SSL in on off ;
do
  for threads in 1 2 4 8 16 32 ;
  do
    sysbench --test=/usr/share/sysbench/oltp.lua --mysql-user=msandbox$SSL --mysql-password=msandbox
       --mysql-host=127.0.0.1 --mysql-port=5613 --mysql-db=sbtest --mysql-ssl=$SSL
       --oltp-tables-count=8 --num-threads=$threads --oltp-dist-type=uniform --oltp-read-only=on
       --report-interval=10 --max-time=600 --max-requests=0 run > sb-ssl_${SSL}-threads-${threads}.out
  done
done 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 #!/bin/bash   for SSL in on off ; do   for threads in 1 2 4 8 16 32 ;   do     sysbench --test=/usr/share/sysbench/oltp.lua --mysql-user=msandbox$SSL --mysql-password=msandbox        --mysql-host=127.0.0.1 --mysql-port=5613 --mysql-db=sbtest --mysql-ssl=$SSL        --oltp-tables-count=8 --num-threads=$threads --oltp-dist-type=uniform --oltp-read-only=on        --report-interval=10 --max-time=600 --max-requests=0 run > sb-ssl_${SSL}-threads-${threads}.out   done done If you’re not familiar with sysbench, the important thing to know about it for our purposes is that it does not connect and disconnect after each query or after each transaction. It establishes N connections to the database (where N is the number of threads) and runs queries though them until the test is over. This behavior provides our connection-pool simulation. The assumption, given what we know about where SSL is the slowest, is that the performance penalty here should be the lowest. First, let’s look at raw throughput, measured in queries per second: The average throughput and standard deviation (both measured in queries per second) for each test configuration is shown below in tabular format: # of threads SSL key size 1 2 4 8 16 32 SSL OFF 9250.18 (1005.82) 18297.61 (689.22) 33910.31 (446.02) 50077.60 (1525.37) 49844.49 (934.86) 49651.09 (498.68) 1024-bit 2406.53 (288.53) 4650.56 (558.58) 9183.33 (1565.41) 26007.11 (345.79) 25959.61 (343.55) 25913.69 (192.90) 2048-bit 2448.43 (290.02) 4641.61 (510.91) 8951.67 (1043.99) 26143.25 (360.84) 25872.10 (324.48) 25764.48 (370.33) 4096-bit 2427.95 (289.00) 4641.32 (547.57) 8991.37 (1005.89) 26058.09 (432.86) 25990.13 (439.53) 26041.27 (780.71) So, given that this is an 8-core machine and IO isn’t a factor, we would expect throughput to max out at 8 threads, so the levelling-off of performance is expected. What we also see is that it doesn’t seem to make much difference what key length is used, which is also largely expected. However, I definitely didn’t think the encryption overhead would be so high. The next graph here is 95th-percentile latency from the same test: And in tabular format, the raw numbers (average and standard deviation): # of threads SSL key size 1 2 4 8 16 32 SSL OFF 1.882 (0.522) 1.728 (0.167) 1.764 (0.145) 2.459 (0.523) 6.616 (0.251) 27.307 (0.817) 1024-bit 6.151 (0.241) 6.442 (0.180) 6.677 (0.289) 4.535 (0.507) 11.481 (1.403) 37.152 (0.393) 2048-bit 6.083 (0.277) 6.510 (0.081) 6.693 (0.043) 4.498 (0.503) 11.222 (1.502) 37.387 (0.393) 4096-bit 6.120 (0.268) 6.454 (0.119) 6.690 (0.043) 4.571 (0.727) 11.194 (1.395) 37.26 (0.307) With the exception of 8 and 32 threads, the latency introduced by the use of SSL is constant at right around 5ms, regardless of the key length or the number of threads. I’m not surprised that there’s a large jump in latency at 32 threads, but I don’t have an immediate explanation for the improvement in the SSL latency numbers at 8 threads. Test 2: Connection Time For the second test, I wrote a simple Perl script to just connect and disconnect from the database as fast as possible. We know that it’s the connection setup which is the slowest part of SSL, and the previous test already shows us roughly what we can expect for SSL encryption overhead for sending data once the connection has been established, so let’s see just how much overhead SSL adds to connection time. The basic script to do this is quite simple (non-SSL version shown): Shell 
#!/usr/bin/perl
use DBI;
use Time::HiRes qw(time);
$start = time;
for (my $i=0; $i<100; $i++) {
  my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:mysql:host=127.0.0.1;port=5613",
                         "msandbox","msandbox",undef);
  $dbh->disconnect;
  undef $dbh;
}
printf "%.6fn", time - $start; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 #!/usr/bin/perl   use DBI; use Time::HiRes qw(time);   $start = time; for (my $i=0; $i<100; $i++) {   my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:mysql:host=127.0.0.1;port=5613",                          "msandbox","msandbox",undef);   $dbh->disconnect;   undef $dbh; } printf "%.6fn", time - $start; As with test #1, I ran test #2 with no encryption and SSL encryption of 1024, 2048, and 4098 bits, and I conducted 10 trials of each configuration. Then I took the elapsed time for each test and converted it to connections per second. The graph below shows the results from each run: Here are the averages and standard deviations: Encryption Average connections per second Standard deviation None 2701.75 165.54 1024-bit 77.04 6.14 2048-bit 28.183 1.713 4096-bit 5.45 0.015 Yes, that’s right, 4096-bit SSL connections are 3 orders of magnitude slower to establish than unencrypted connections. Really, the connection overhead for any level of SSL usage is quite high when compared to the unencrypted test, and it’s certainly much higher than my original quoted number of 25%. Analysis and Parting Thoughts So, what do we take away from this? The first thing is, of course, is that SSL overhead is a lot higher than 25%, particularly if your application uses anything close to the one-connection-per-request pattern. For a system which establishes and maintains long-running connections, the initial connection overhead becomes a non-factor, regardless of the encryption strength, but there’s still a rather large performance penalty compared to the unencrypted connection. This leads directly into the second point, which is that connection pooling is by far a more efficient method of using SSL if your application can support it. But what if connection pooling isn’t an option, MySQL’s SSL performance is insufficient, and you still need full encryption of data in-flight? Run the encryption component of your system at a lower layer – a VPN with hardware crypto would be the fastest approach, but even something as simple as an SSH tunnel or OpenVPN *might* be faster than SSL within MySQL. I’ll be exploring some of these solutions in a follow-up post. And finally… when in doubt, run your own benchmarks. I don’t have an explanation for why the yaSSL numbers are so different from these (maybe yaSSL is a faster SSL library than openSSL, or maybe they used a different cipher – if you’re curious, the original 25% number came from slides 56-58 of this presentation), but in any event, this does illustrate why it’s important to run tests on your own hardware and with your own workload when you’re interested in finding out how well something will perform rather than taking someone else’s word for it.

In his previous lives, he has been everything from a Perl/Java developer to a Linux sysadmin, a MySQL DBA to a Cisco network engineer, and a security auditor to an IT engineering manager, many of these things all at the same time. When not working on MySQL, he might be found on the ski slope, at a psytrance festival, or at the nearest sushi bar. 14 Comments RyanC says: October 10, 2013 at 11:52 am Could you let us know that cipher suites were being used in your SSL connections? There’s a substantial performance difference between, DES-CBC3-SHA and AES128-GCM-SHA256, for example, especially if both client and server support AES-NI acceleration (an i7-2600k should). Reply Bill Karwin says: October 10, 2013 at 11:53 am Would a VPN or stunnel therefore be a better solution for systems that make frequent MySQL connections? Because the SSL handshake is done once, and removed from cost of repeated connections. The old lessons are still true, e.g. remove loop-invariant code from the loop. Reply Peter Zaitsev says: October 10, 2013 at 1:14 pm Ernie, Wow. that is quite a lot more than I would think… I think what would be very interesting is also to run the test with very simple queries (lookup by primary key) vs streaming – ie SELECT * FROM sbtest; to see the overhead per query vs “streaming” Reply Razvan Musaloiu-E. says: October 10, 2013 at 1:20 pm Quick question: was the sysbench and the server on the same machine? Reply Baron says: October 10, 2013 at 1:35 pm The smoothed lines in the charts are making my nose twitch. I will put Tufte on your Christmas list 🙂 Reply Topher says: October 10, 2013 at 2:09 pm I concur with Bill and Ryan’s comments. The SSL key size is little bit of a red herring in that it’s only used in the handshake at connection setup time. When using a connection pool, this penalty applies ideally once when the pool is setup… I’m sure there are reconnects and re-negotiations. The supporting algorithms that carry the SSL sessions would seem to be more important here if there isn’t any acceleration. Even wit AES-NI I’m curious if the CPU can carry both DB threads and SSL termination effectively. AES128 is light and secure. If sniffing is low risk and performance is critical, I’d maybe consider RC4 despite some of it’s crypto short comings. Reply Paul says: October 10, 2013 at 7:30 pm What is causing such a significant drop in thruput when using SSL? Granted there is a handshake to establish, which will obviously have some overhead. But surely this handshake overhead is almost identical to that used by HTTPS? Interestingly, when Google changed Gmail to require HTTPS in 2010 (instead of it being an option), they required no further hardware, servers, hosts, nothing. The cpu penalty was less than 1% across the board. Admittedly they used 1028 bit keys, but the graphs above show that strength is not significant factor in handshake time. Is there something peculiar about mysql’s implementation of ssl, which means it cannot be comparable to https? Reply Ernie Souhrada says: October 10, 2013 at 7:54 pm To answer these in order… @Ryan: I did not specify a cipher during the configuration, so I got the default: DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA. I’m sure that the results would be different with different ciphers. @Bill: My thinking here is yes – that’s something I was planning to do for the second post. @Peter: At one thread, “SELECT * FROM sbtest” is 4x slower with encryption than without, regardless of key length, so that matches up pretty closely with the sysbench results. @Razvan: For the tests reported on in this post, yes, but I see where you’re going with that question. I have not tried the sysbench tests from a separate machine, but for the connection setup tests, the performance isn’t really any better. With no encryption, network speed becomes the limiting factor, and over a gigE link I can create about 930 connections per second. At 1024 bits, throughput drops to 72 cps, and it just gets worse from there. @Baron: I’m happy to accept Christmas presents of all kinds. 🙂 @Paul: My working theory at this point is that it has a lot to do with openSSL and not necessarily anything specific to MySQL. I have a copy of Percona Server 5.6 which, I think, has openSSL statically linked, and connection setup time is more than 2x faster at 1024 bits and almost 4x faster at 4096 bits. Choice of cipher, as Ryan mentioned, is also likely to play a large part. More investigation required – this is a fairly deep rabbit hole. Reply Mark Callaghan says: October 10, 2013 at 10:03 pm I am curious about connection create performance with/without SSL when there is more network latency between client and server. Any chance you will run such a test? Reply Paul says: October 10, 2013 at 10:14 pm Hi Ernie, I agree in theory the results should be influenced primarily by OpenSSL rather than MySQL. If you could share your openSSL version (and operating system ideally, since RedHat backports things but keeps version same), that would be very useful. Id like to see if I can replicate these tests myself. They are unexpected yet interesting Thanks Reply marc castrovinci says: October 12, 2013 at 2:10 pm Any idea if the same impact is seen with Galera using ssl certs for group communication? Reply Ernie S says: October 12, 2013 at 11:48 pm @Mark – I hadn’t originally planned on running a test like that, but that is an interesting question. It wouldn’t take very long to set up and run, so I’ll put that on the list for the follow-up to this post. @Paul – CentOS 6.4 (kernel 2.6.32-358.18.1.el6.x86_64), and these are the versions of OpenSSL I have installed: openssl098e-0.9.8e-17.el6.centos.2.x86_64 openssl-1.0.0-27.el6_4.2.x86_64 And I used the binary tarball of MySQL 5.6.13 – not a CentOS/RHEL-specific RPM, although I would think (hope?) that it shouldn’t matter. @Marc – Another interesting question. I would assume that the performance hit for Galera would be similar to the performance hit for standard replication, which I would assume (yes, I know, a lot of assuming going on here) to be about the same as the performance hit for the connection-pool test. Time permitting, I’ll take a look into this, too. Reply Nicky Helmkamp says: November 6, 2013 at 11:48 am Hey Ernie!

Reply mark says: March 28, 2017 at 11:55 am Thank you for explanation. In my case a mysql database is experiencing delay in connection authentication when using SSL. usually it takes 30ms but intermittently it takes up to 1000ms. this issue is not persistent. What could be the reason for this. during same time If i connect without SSL it takes 30ms only. What could be reason here. My instance has 122GB of ram and is hosted over AWS RDS.

Razer today announced an update to its Blade Pro laptop, adding THX certification and a seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processor to its high-end gaming system. The Blade Pro will become the first laptop with THX Mobile Certification, an accreditation that applies to audio and visual output from the machine. By working with THX, Razer is able to provide a headset jack that meets several high-quality audio watermarks, as well as a display calibrated and tested for premium color accuracy and video playback. The audio jack matches THX requirements for voltage output, frequency response, distortion, and crosstalk, all to guarantee clear sound through headphones. The screen, meanwhile, remains at 17.3 inches with a 4K resolution, but boasts a THX color profile for a better picture. With a Kaby Lake processor, the Blade Pro will be a bit faster than its Skylake predecessor, boast better 4K playback, and be more power efficient. It will also feature faster DDR4 memory (2,667MHz as opposed to the previous 2,133MHZ) and still make use of an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. It will be available in April on Razer's website and select retailers, starting at $3,999.99. Related The Best Gaming Laptops of 2017 The Best Gaming Laptops of 2017 These features are included specifically in the Blade Pro because Razer's premium laptop aims not just at hardcore gamers, but art and design professionals. Adding this support to the refreshed version further appeals to that demographic, supplementing existing features like the 100 percent Adobe color spectrum display. For our detailed thoughts on the original Blade Pro, see our full review. "The Razer Blade Pro is a top-level laptop providing an excellent THX viewing mode and audio experience," says Ty Ahmad-Taylor, CEO of THX. "It can easily handle extreme gaming and content creation with exceptional mobile audio and visual performance."

Page 1 of 4. 9 Comments With DragonFlyBSD 4.8 making its debut yesterday, I was excited to give this updated BSD operating system a try now that it has UEFI support and some performance improvements. Here are some early benchmark results of DragonFlyBSD 4.8 compared to 4.6 and Intel's Clear Linux for some additional reference points. DragonFlyBSD 4.8 is the first release to officially support UEFI. When booting the USB installer image, sure enough, it was working smoothly and could be installed in either the legacy or UEFI modes. Trying out the UEFI installation on my Core i7 6800K test system, it worked fine. Great to finally have DragonFlyBSD joining FreeBSD, most Linux distributions, and other OSes in supporting UEFI. DragonFlyBSD 4.8 features kernel improvements for many-core and multi-socket systems, namecache lookup improvements, exec() enhancements, and other improvements. I used the Intel Core i7 6800K box for all of my initial testing of DragonFly 4.8 for what was available and having 12 threads so can potentially see some improvements. A Samsung 850 EVO SSD was used for testing, MSI X99A WORKSTATION motherboard, and NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X graphics. DragonFlyBSD 4.6.1, DragonFlyBSD 4.8.0, and Clear Linux 14200 were cleanly installed each time on this test system. These were the results I was able to gather in the past 24 hours. A follow-up article in the days ahead will feature a larger BSD vs. Linux benchmark operating system comparison. All of the BSD/Linux benchmarks are done in a fully-automated manner using the Phoronix Test Suite.

(AMD) Stock Gears Up for War The meteoric rise of AMD stock isn't over yet By Greg Gambone, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 28, 2017, 10:02 am EDT     Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Gears Up for War Recent Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Gears Up for War Apple Inc. (AAPL) Can’t Commit to Hollywood Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is No Longer Top Dog in China View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has quite literally skyrocketed over the past year, as shares of AMD are up nearly 400%, while the Nasdaq is up only 22% over the same period. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr With the release of its Ryzen 7 processor line earlier this month, and the Ryzen 5 products slated for April 11, more than a few analysts on the Street have issued upgrades and raised price targets for AMD stock. According to MarketWatch, 11 of the 29 analysts providing recommendations call AMD stock a “buy” and 15 call it a hold. Why the Recent Spike for AMD Stock? For decades, the often-challenged (but undisputed) big dog in the CPU arena has been Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Today, the Intel Core i7 is considered by many to be one of, if not the top performing consumer desktop processor. But, now that the AMD Ryzen is available, tech experts have conducted benchmark tests that show the Ryzen equal to, and in some cases better than, the Core i7. Further, AMD is preparing to face off against Intel on the enterprise side as well, having announced a partnership with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to develop a data center chip, dubbed Naples. According to an AMD executive, “Next quarter AMD will bring hardware innovation back into the datacenter and server markets.” So AMD will simultaneously compete with INTC on two fronts, enterprise and consumer. According to Forbes, upward of 95% of the world’s servers are powered by Intel, but now is definitely the time that companies will be most open to consider switching from Intel to AMD. “For the first time in many years, AMD could pose a real threat to Intel’s server supremacy.” This is exciting news for AMD stock investors, as it seems to alleviate some of the concerns about a potential correction in the relatively near future. At this point, AMD stock is still soaring and will continue to do so as the company chips away at Intel’s market share. Bottom Line on AMD Stock The technology industry is perhaps one of the most competitive of all, with new startups appearing almost daily. The potential for shifting market share is often more fluid than in other industries, as innovation is the true king here. And in the tech sector, innovation is the lifeblood of any successful company. To that end, AMD’s ability to remain on top is only as secure as its latest silicon creation. While the company has done fairly well remaining innovative on its own, there is even greater potential going forward with Microsoft’s help and involvement. AMD stock price hasn’t been this high in more than a decade, and considering the state of the technology industry, particularly CPU development, this is one stock that has solid potential for longer-term growth going forward. As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Wed 29 Mar 2017 | 6:27 GMT You are here: Home > News > World > Article Home News News by Country Top News Sport World Oddly Enough Investing Video AlertNet Humanitarian News About Thomson Reuters Political, regional clouds gather over Israel even as economy booms Tue Mar 28, 2017 1:26pm GMT   Print | Single Page [-] Text [+] By Luke Baker JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's politics are darkening: the governing coalition, in power for barely two years, is in tumult and regional tensions are rising. Looking only at the economy, things seem bright. U.S. chip giant Intel recently bought local start-up Mobileye for $15 billion, growth is robust and the currency is at record highs. But beyond the boom, speculation of early elections is rife, friction with Gaza's Hamas rulers is intensifying and Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah fighters in Syria have provoked anti-aircraft missiles in response from Damascus government forces. To an extent, Israel is always juggling economics and politics. In the past it has sustained growth and foreign investment despite electoral uncertainty and bouts of conflict, whether with Hamas or with Hezbollah on the Shi'ite movement's Lebanese home turf. The difference now is how rapidly the picture has changed and how close it may be getting to shifting out of control, even if neither Israel nor Hamas nor Hezbollah seeks war. A month ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition appeared solid. Despite being a suspect in two criminal investigations, "Bibi" was set to eclipse David Ben-Gurion's record to become Israel's longest-serving leader. But in the past few weeks Netanyahu has picked a fight with his finance minister - they disagree over the creation of a new public broadcaster - exposing wider discontent in the coalition and prompting active talk that he might seek an election two years ahead of schedule. At the same time, tension with Hamas has surged, especially after the assassination of one of its high-profile militants last week, a death blamed on Israel. The air strikes targeting Hezbollah forces fighting in support of the Syrian government prompted Damascus to fire Russian-supplied surface-to-air missiles at Israeli jets, ratcheting up regional anxiety.   Continued...

(NYSE: RHT), the world’s leading provider of open source solutions, today announced that more than 20 North American reseller partners are now accredited to sell the company’s software-defined storage solutions, Red Hat Ceph Storage and Red Hat Gluster Storage. This is in addition to more than 15 technical alliances partners, such as Cisco, Dell EMC, Intel, QCT, Samsung Semiconductor, Seagate and Supermicro. We’re pleased to see such strong interest in our storage portfolio from the channel and the dedication of our partners to become accredited through OPEN. We believe that this commitment shows a desire to be able to provide modern, software-defined solutions as an alternative to traditional storage appliance offerings. Ben Cherian“director, Partnerships, Alliances, Channel – Storage, Red Hat “ The accreditation of Red Hat’s storage resellers — underway since Red Hat expanded the routes to market for the Red Hat Storage portfolio in November 2015 — is indicative of growing demand for software-defined storage as part of modern IT solutions, including more agile container-based and cloud environments. As organizations deploy these web-scale IT architectures, open, software-defined storage offers them more flexibility in how they manage a wide variety of data, even on a massive scale. In addition, Red Hat’s active technical alliance program seeks to improve solution compatibility, devise supportive architectures and enhance innovative software-defined storage designs, with advanced hardware from partners around the globe. Red Hat Advanced and Premier partners that meet the training requirements for their region’s partner program via Red Hat Online Partner Enablement Network (OPEN) are accredited to sell Red Hat Storage solutions. Red Hat Ceph Storage and Red Hat Gluster Storage are open, scale-out, software-defined storage solutions that are designed to run on top of industry standard hardware. They offer partners flexibility that enables them to address a wide array of their clients’ needs regardless of their IT infrastructure. Additionally, the Red Hat Storage portfolio offers a storage platform that can scale across physical, virtual, and cloud resources. Supporting Quotes Ben Cherian, director, Partnerships, Alliances, Channel – Storage, Red Hat “We’re pleased to see such strong interest in our storage portfolio from the channel and the dedication of our partners to become accredited through OPEN. We believe that this commitment shows a desire to be able to provide modern, software-defined solutions as an alternative to traditional storage appliance offerings.” Shea Hart, director of product and partner management, CDW “Software-defined storage is an area of growing interest and we are excited to collaborate with Red Hat to orchestrate solutions to fit the needs of our mutual customers. For CDW, this a natural extension of our collaboration with Red Hat delivering innovative open-source solutions to customers for the past several years.” Terry L. Smith, senior director, Advanced Solutions Group, Penguin Computing, Inc.   “Penguin Computing has almost two decades of leadership in HPC and open technologies. Across our diverse customer base, we have seen significant growth in data requirements with flat or linear increases in IT storage budgets. This has been particularly prevalent in the cloud and in industries like financial services. As an Advanced Red Hat Partner, Penguin Computing has been able to respond to customer needs with complete, turnkey, workload-optimized, enterprise-ready Gluster and Ceph storage solutions.” Phil Williams, principal architect, Rackspace “The Red Hat Storage team has been a great partner to work with when defining the Ceph software-defined storage offering as part of Rackspace Private Cloud powered by Red Hat. While Red Hat Ceph Storage is a powerful storage solution for OpenStack private clouds, many customers prefer not to take on that management, preferring to hand that task to an expert. That’s where Rackspace comes in, with our managed private cloud offering, based on Red Hat OpenStack Platform and Red Hat Ceph Storage.” Matt Francis, senior director, Storage Engineers, Redapt “At Redapt, we provide innovative data center solutions combining leading technologies. We are excited to be a Red Hat Storage partner as it allows us to take advantage of the product portfolio, in-depth training, and support that Red Hat provides. This allows us to more confidently deliver fully integrated solutions to our hyperscale customers that can be more rapidly integrated into their OpenStack and container environments as soon as we roll the rack into the datacenter.” Joe Wojtal, vice president service provider solutions, World Wide Technology “WWT is excited to work with Red Hat to deliver leading software-based storage capabilities within the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) solutions created in WWT’s Carrier Grade NFV Test Facility jointly established in collaboration with Red Hat, Cisco, and Intel.” Additional Resources Connect with Red Hat CategoriesUncategorized Tagsbase, carrier, Companies, company, Computing, Industry, Markets, private, service, Technology, Uncategorized, World Post navigation Previous PostPrevious PTC to Offer Commercial Robotics Track at LiveWorx® 2017 Next PostNext The Melting Pot Celebrates National Cheese Fondue Day with World Champion Cheese Search Business Contacts Business Directory Proudly powered by WordPress

According to the manufacturer, the review notebook with its quad-core i7 CPU and discrete graphics card was designed to handle everything…from immersive streaming sessions to lag-free photo editing . Since the notebook is equipped with a middle-class Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU, many potential buyers might be interested in the multimedia allrounder-laptop also because of its potential as a budget gaming machine. Speaking of budget: at the time of writing, our configuration with Intel Core i7-7700HQ, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 , 16 GB of RAM, dual hard drives , and 15.6-inch FHD IPS display costs $1150 directly from HP. The supplier of our test unit, Computer Upgrade King, offers a smaller subset of the configurations and sells the notebook for $1040. A similarly equipped – but decidedly more upscale – Dell XPS 15 sells for hundreds more and doesn’t natively offer dual hard drives. Since we’ve covered the general construction and the feature set fairly recently, please consult the reviews of the HP Pavilion 15t-au100 and the Pavilion 15 UHD T9Y85AV – the quad-core predecessor of our unit with 4K display – for details on the case design, input devices, and connectivity. We’ll still point out noteworthy differences and features, however. Note: we unfortunately experienced numerous stability issues with the Pavilion 15t during the review period. These issues increased in severity as time progressed. Various programs – like Battery Eater, PCMark 8, LuxMark, among others – as well as many games would cause stop errors and subsequent reboots. Driver updates and a reset of the operating system did not help. HP just released a firmware update for this model which supposedly resolves the stability issues. We will update this review… Post navigation HTC U Ultra Smartphone Review Is Rajkumar Hirani being a strict director to Ranbir Kapoor?

Image Credit: Razer Razer is promising to deliver an amazing display in its next gaming laptop. Above: The skinny Blade Pro still has Razer’s excellent industrial design paired with the power of the GTX 1080 and the latest i7. Image Credit: Razer THX, the company that specializes in perfecting audio and video experiences (and is now a subsidiary of Razer), has given its official Mobile Certification to the upcoming Razer Blade Pro 17-inch gaming laptop. This updated laptop begins shipping in April for $4,000. This is Razer’s new megapowered laptop that features both a Nvidia GTX 1080 video card and the seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake i7-7820HK processor. Despite that power, however, Razer has still designed the Blade Pro so that it’s less than 1-inch thick. Please check out our GamesBeat Summit 2017 event taking place from May 1 to 2 on the inspiration between science fiction, tech, and games. Use Deantak code for 20 percent off. Insomniac’s Ted Price will be one of our speakers. The THX Mobile Certification means that the Razer Blade Pro’s 17-inch screen meets a certain threshold for resolution, color accuracy, and performance. The audio jack for headphones also meets THX’s standards for quality. “The Razer Blade Pro is a top-level laptop providing an excellent THX viewing mode and audio experience,” THX chief executive Ty Ahmad-Taylor said in a statement. “It can easily handle extreme gaming and content creation with exceptional mobile audio and visual performance.” In addition to the updated display and the latest Intel i7, Razer has also introduced faster 32GB DDR4 memory that runs at 2,667MHz as opposed to the 2,133MHz RAM in previous Razer Blade Pro versions. Razer claims that with all of the improvements, the Blade Pro is the thinnest laptop that can play most modern games on Ultra settings at a 4K resolution. In my experience with the Nvidia GTX 1080 paired with fasted RAM and an older i5, that’s probably true for most games — and many will likely even get 60 frames per second. But with the Razer blade Pro’s G-Sync monitor, you’ll still get a smooth experience even if your framerate drops into the 30s or 40s. “The Blade Pro was recently hailed as the ultimate Windows laptop, and we’ve leveled-up on our previous achievements with certification by THX,” Razer boss Min-Liang Tan said in a statement. “Each refinement of the Razer Blade Pro moves us closer to an ultimate desktop replacement.” Here are the full specs for the new Blade: 17-inch IGZO UHD G-sync display Intel Core i7-7820HK 2.9GHz/3.9GHz quad-core processor Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 512GB/1TB/2TB SSD storage options 32GB dual-channel DDR4 2.667 GHz memory Ultra-low-profile mechanical keyboard USB-C port 3 USB 3.0 ports HDMI 2.0 output SDXC card reader Built-in stereo speakers 7.1 codec support 3.5mm headphone/microphone combo audio port 2.0 megapixel webcam Array microphone Approximate size: 0.88 in. / 22.5 mm (Height) x 16.7 in. / 424 mm (Width) x 11 in. / 281 mm (Depth) Approximate weight: 7.69 lbs./3.49 kilograms ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

The chip maker has introduced Optane modules designed to boost the performance of your desktop PC. They're strictly cache drives that only hold 16GB or 32GB (the server module packs 375GB), but don't let that dismay you. In theory, the combination of extremely low latency (under 10 microseconds) with solid state drive speeds (at least 900MB/s in peak sequential reads) should dramatically reduce loading times across the board. Compared to a PC with a conventional spinning hard drive, Intel claims that you should see a 28 percent overall performance boost, with storage up to 14 times faster. Common apps like the Chrome or Outlook should load five to six times faster, Intel says. And not surprisingly, Intel is making a big deal out of gaming performance. The company boasts that games can start up to 67 percent faster, and load levels up to 65 percent faster.

Optane-equipped systems from PC makers like ASUS, Dell, HP and Lenovo will arrive throughout the second quarter of the year. Just don't expect to update an older PC. You'll need a system running a 7th-generation Core (i.e. Kaby Lake) processor and the chipset to match, so you'll have to "settle" for an SSD or hybrid hard drive if you're not quite on the cutting edge. As for whether or not they're worth it? That likely depends on your exact circumstances. While Intel believes you'll see a speed boost even if you already have an SSD in your computer (it can eliminate the SATA bottleneck, for instance), AnandTech notes that you might be better off relying solely on an SSD if you can afford one that meets your storage needs. This is really for people stuck with conventional hard drives who want a speed boost without the expense of buying a high-capacity SSD.

We found the Micron 5100 MAX to be an outstanding drive, please read on to see what we make of its ECO sibling. All models in the 5100 range feature Micron’s 24 layer, eTLC 3D NAND. Micron considers the 5100 ECO’s closest competitors to be the Intel SSD DC S3510, the Samsung PM863, the Sandisk Cloudspeed ECO, and the Toshiba HK4R, which places the Micron 5100 ECO into one of the most competitive storage market segments. We have previously reviewed the Samsung PM863, which we considered to be an exceptional product, so tough competition indeed.  Market Positioning and Specification Market Positioning Micron announced the Micron 5100 Series of SATA Enterprise SSDs in December 2016.  The 5100 Series is available in three workload focused configurations: Micron 5100 ECO (Endurance class - <1 DWPD) Read intensive applications (e.g. content sharing, video and media streaming) Micron 5100 PRO (Endurance class – 1-3 DWPD) Mixed, latency sensitive workloads (e.g. Databases, e-commerce, trading transactions, etc.) Micron 5100 MAX (Endurance class – 5 DWPD) Write intensive applications (e.g. logging) Micron seeks to differentiate the 5100 Series through the introduction of its Micron FlexPro Architecture. The FlexPro Architecture enables customers to change the usable capacity of a drive, and thereby the level of Over Provision (the amount of NAND set aside to support the drive’s controller in its maintenance of performance and endurance) at the firmware level. Customers are readily able to make an additional OP at the OS level (by restricting the amount of data that is written to a drive, through for example allocating partitions that do not occupy all of the drive’s user capacity).  As part of this review we test the difference in effectiveness between making a firmware level additional OP and an OS level additional OP. The subject of this review is the Micron 5100 ECO 1920GB, which has a raw NAND capacity of 2112GB (and thus a default OP level of 192GB).  In this review we will increase the OP level to see if the ECO can perform as well as a Micron 5100 MAX 920GB.      This is how Micron positions the best use cases for the Micron 5100 Series –     Specification Here is Micron’s specification for the performance of the Micron 5100 ECO –   Here is a picture of the Micron 5100 ECO I tested -       Now let's head to the next page, to look at Myce’s Enterprise Testing Methodology.....   Testing Methodology » You've got to read this!

By Hayden Dingman Games Reporter, PCWorld | Mar 28, 2017 6:00 AM PT Credit: Hayden Dingman More like this Razer Blade Pro (2016) review: Now this is how you do a 'Pro' laptop The best laptops of 2017: Ultrabooks, budget PCs, 2-in-1s, and more Razer's Project Valerie is a radical three-screen laptop that unfolds with... Video Building virtual PCs in PC Building Simulator Late last year Razer resurrected its Blade Pro laptop line, finally stuffing it with hardware worthy of the “Pro” appellation. Our three-word review: We loved it. It’s a great machine, if you can afford it. And now it’s a bit better, thanks to the standard year-over-year refresh. Razer released details on a new Blade Pro today—it’s keeping Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080, but moving over from an Intel i7-6700HQ at 2.6GHz to an overclockable i7-7820HK processor at 2.9GHz. The Blade Pro’s 32GB of RAM also gets a timing bump up to 2,667MHz (from 2,133MHz). Hayden Dingman The really interesting news though: The Blade Pro is now the first-ever laptop to receive THX Mobile Certification, “an accreditation reserved for high-performance mobile phones, tablets, and laptops.” From the press release: [ Further reading: Our picks for best PC laptops ] “Through the processes of THX, the Razer Blade Pro screen is calibrated and tested for resolution, color accuracy and video playback performance...Similarly, the audio jack on the new Razer Blade Pro met THX requirements for voltage output, frequency response, distortion, signal-to-noise ratio, and crosstalk that guarantees clear sound through headphones.” It’s worth noting that only the headphone jack is THX-certified, not the built-in speakers—an important point, I think, given people usually associate THX with surround sound systems. While the Blade Pro’s speakers are certainly better than your average laptop's, they’re still not amazing by any means. We could also debate all day about the usefulness of THX certification. Is your non-certified Blade Pro from six months ago suddenly a decrepit old hag? Not at all. Razer’s even using the same 4K IGZO display on this new THX-certified laptop as it did on the 2016 model—just calibrated slightly differently, and with (presumably) a big ol’ THX stamp on the box. So yeah, this is a bit of a marketing win more than anything else. On the other hand it does prove the Blade Pro is one hell of a laptop. A THX representative confirmed to me that competing laptops have undergone testing, but Razer’s is the first to meet the standards of this new Mobile Certification program. That makes it somewhat-objectively the best laptop in the world for the moment, at least by THX’s standards—meaning as far as the display and headphone jack are concerned. Is that useful? I don’t know. The display is certainly an important aspect with laptops, so THX Mobile Certification isn’t a wholly made-up honorific. Still, it does seem of limited use to tech nerds—no consideration given to internal hardware, benchmarks, or anything we usually use to compare laptops. The Blade Pro is THX-certified to be easy on the eyes, and that’s about it. I guess you’ll have to keep reading our PCWorld reviews for the full picture. The good news in this case is we agree with THX: The Blade Pro is one of the finest laptops available, provided you’ve got $4,000 burning a hole in your pocket. Look for the updated Kaby Lake model in April on Razer’s website, and be sure to brag to all your friends about that THX Mobile Certification. They’ll love hearing about it.

One message that we heard repeatedly was how staying above politics is necessary to be fair and impartial. Not too long after the questions began, Democratic Sen. Sheldon WhitehouseSheldon WhitehouseGovernment Accountability Office will review Mar-a-Lago security procedures Green groups vow war over Trump’s climate rollback Gorsuch is restoring lost faith in government MORE of Rhode Island challenged Gorsuch’s premise by bringing up my case (McCutcheon v. FEC) and other recent 5-4 decisions of the Supreme Court.  Specifically, Whitehouse said, “The question that faces me is what happens when the Republicans get five appointees on the Supreme Court? I can’t help but notice the array of 5-4 decisions … helping Republicans at the polls.” Whitehouse fails to realize that as a direct result of the 5-4 McCutcheon decision Democrats have raised and spent more money that the Republicans. Even though I am a conservative, I am glad to see more money in the political process, even if it is going to candidates with who I rarely agree. The McCutcheon decision helps candidates advance their message and empower voters with key information on the positions and values held by those seeking to represent them. That was always the point. ADVERTISEMENT To assert that my case is helping Republicans, or giving any party for that matter, an advantage at the polls, is flat wrong. Like the philosophy that Gorsuch advanced during the hearings last week, the First Amendment and Free Speech are above politics – and my case proves it.   Leading up to the Supreme Court decision, critics asserted that my case would lead to undue influence on officials. With more money in the system, critics argued, the floodgates to corruption would be opened. That didn’t happen. We worked hard, just like Gorsuch is now, to illustrate campaign finance matters are about empowering people and keeping those in power from abusing the system to gain unfair advantages. Despite the incorrect assertions still made today, the arguments in McCutcheon were never about the limits on the amount of money you may contribute to an individual candidate. It is about your right to contribute that amount to as many candidates as you chose. Allowing individuals to donate to as many candidates as they wish would draw contributions away from PACs and bring money directly to candidates, giving underdog candidates a fair chance in the political arena. While base limits were not a part of my case, arguments over these restrictions are coming. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch will rule on another campaign finance case challenging base limits. I have often advocated that base limits make some sense, but current levels are too low. We will surely see many of the same arguments leveled at these cases that were used against mine. And if the past is precedent, those most vocal in the opposition will be those most likely to benefit. Gorsuch has proven that he can be a tireless First Amendment advocate. During the Senate testimony, he repeatedly and convincingly affirmed his own independence and the ongoing need for judges to be independent from everything but the Constitution and law.  I have not seen anyone lately with such an innate ability to explain the complexities and answer senators' questions in simple understandable language. It was if he had answered them all a thousand times before which indicates his extensive experience.  Like Scalia he sees the law like a great opera or work of art with everyone playing their roles for one big masterpiece.  A message like that resonates well. Political leaders should take notice that the message is more important than money. And last week Gorsuch proved it too.  As the fights over the confirmation process loom, steering clear of the distractions and the politics part of the equation will be key. So long as he stays above politics, assertions of unfairness by those looking to portray Gorsuch unfairly will continue to fail. The last election proved that candidates win when they demonstrate a real commitment to the ideas voters care about, not because they raise more money. While some will continue to argue that money is the root of all political evil, the First Amendment is clear, and Gorsuch is a great advocate for it. Anyone who brings a campaign finance or First Amendment case will want a judge like Gorsuch because regardless if you’re billionaire or facing foreclosure, he will listen attentively and apply the law. That’s what a judge is supposed to do anyway.  People like Gorsuch restore some of my lost faith in government.  Shaun McCutcheon, an electrical engineer from Alabama, is the successful plaintiff in McCutcheon v.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Nunes’ spokesman has said the congressman visited the White House on March 21 to review information provided by a source. The following day, Nunes confirmed in a press conference that the US Intelligence Community collected information on Trump’s transition team. Moreover, Nunes said the collection was unrelated to allegations of Russian collusion and widely disseminated within the US government. "I think there needs to be a lot of explaining to do," McCain stated on CBS News. "I’ve been around for quite a while and I’ve never heard of such thing." © AP Photo/ J. Scott Applewhite Nunes Apologizes to Intel Committee for Briefing Trump on SurveillanceMcCain further said Nunes should reveal the source of the information he discussed at the White House. Later, Nunes explained why he decided to brief the press and US President Donald Trump on new intelligence information before telling the ranking Democrat on the committee. Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff, a Democrat representing California’s 28th district, said later on Wednesday that Nunes did not follow proper protocol of the investigation, and called his briefing of the US president a profound irregularity. On March 4, Trump took to Twitter to accuse Obama of having his Trump Tower headquarters' "wires tapped" prior to the 2016 presidential election, describing this as the former administration's "new low. The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech Reviews / Eurocom Sky X4E2 laptop review ( i7 7700k, GTX 1070) Eurocom Sky X4E2 laptop review ( i7 7700k, GTX 1070) Leo Waldock 18 hours ago Featured Tech Reviews, Laptop / Mobile, Reviews Rating: 8.0. There are two ways we can tackle our review of the Eurocom Sky X4E2. The first approach is to talk about the combination of desktop Kaby Lake CPU with GTX 1070 graphics that allows you to rock your games along at 1080p. Added to that you get a huge number of upgrade paths that make use of the four drive bays you’ll find inside the chunky Clevo chassis. Those are headline features however we cannot avoid the second angle where we mention that Eurocom is a Canadian company, as we simply had no idea the Canadians were suppliers of laptops. In this instance the Sky X4E2 was assembled in Canada and then shipped to their Czech distributor before it made its way to the UK. That’s unusual, but even so we won’t drag up a weak joke about Bryan Adams, Rush or maple syrup. It is worth pointing out the International nature of this laptop means that currencies play their part in the pricing as we Brits work in GBP and Sterling while the Czechs use Euros. When you configure and buy the Sky X4E2 the pricing is in Euros with VAT added at the end, which means it can all get a bit complicated. Watch via our VIMEO Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 2160p HERE Eurocom Sky X4E2 Specification Processor: Intel Core i7-7700K Socket LGA 1151 Chipset: Intel Z170 GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 8GB Modular MXM 3.0 Camera: 2MP FHD Display: 15.6″ FHD 1920×1080 @60Hz; IPS eDP G-Sync: up to 4 active internal and/or external displays; up to 3084×2160 @ 60Hz Memory: 32GB DDR4-3000MHz SODIMM (maximum 64GB) Total Storage – Up to 4 physical drives 512GB Samsung SM951 M.2 NVMe Hitachi 1TB 7K1000 2.5-inch HDD Card Reader 6-in-1 Push-Push Card Reader MMC/RSMMC, SD/mini SD/SDHC/SDXC, UHS-II Audio Architecture: High Definition Audio; Realtek ALC892 /PDIF Digital Output Built in microphone Built in two 2W speakers and subwoofer Sound Blaster X-FI MB5 7.1CH output (headphone, mic, line-in and S/PDIF) ESS Sabre HiFi DAC for high resolution headphone audio LAN/WLAN/Bluetooth 1Gb Ethernet LAN on-board; Killer E2400 – WLAN Intel Wireless-AC 7265 – prewired for 3G/4G/LTE Keyboard: Backlit full size keyboard with numeric pad TouchPad with multi-gesture and scrolling W/A/S/D Gaming key Battery: 8-cells Smart Li-Ion; 82Wh/5400mAh Weight: 3.4kg w/ battery Dimensions: 386(w) x 262 (d) x 38(h) mm Operating  System: Windows 10 Pro Eurocom puts a significant emphasis on the fact that the Sky X4E2 can be upgraded to a huge extent. The Clevo chassis used in the Eurocom Sky X4E2 has a Z170 chipset and was originally used with a desktop Skylake CPU however Eurocom has upgraded to a Kaby Lake Core-i7 7700K CPU that supplies extra clock speed. The stock clocks are 4.2GHz base and 4.5GHz boost however there is scope for overclocking if you feel the urge. In addition, the graphics module uses an MXM 3.0 interface and Eurocom makes the point they will offer upgrades as far in the future as possible. This is pretty much in the hands of Intel and Nvidia as there might be changes in power, heat or physical form factor that prevent an upgrade but it is very encouraging to hear from a laptop manufacturer with a proven track record in this field. The laptop we were supplied came with a decent specification including a Full HD screen (rather than 4K) with G-Sync and 120Hz refresh rate. The GTX 1070 graphics chip is the fastest that Eurocom supplies for this chassis and as you will see in our video there is plenty of scope for upgrading the memory and drives. Eurocom has only filled half the slots and bays in the chassis and if you take a look at our photos you will see there is an empty 2.5-inch SATA bay, an M.2 slot and two DDR4 SODIMM slots. If you choose to buy extra drives when you specify your new laptop you will find you are offered the option of joining them together in RAID. We were impressed by the way the chassis is covered in ports and connectors; on one side you get Ethernet, two USB 3.1 type C (Thunderbolt 3) and two USB 3.0 ports. On the other side there is a USB 2.0 for your mouse, a USB 3.0 and a bunch of audio jacks. Turn to the rear and you’ll find two mini DisplayPorts and an HDMI 2.0 output. Testing   The test results from Eurocom Sky X4E2 show that this is a gaming laptop that delivers the goods. It is interesting to refer back to the PC Specialist Vortex VI which uses a Core i7-6700K as the Kaby Lake used by Eurocom clearly delivers extra performance. We didn’t test the two laptops at the same time with the same drivers so it would be unfair to put them on the same graph but nonetheless we can see the benefit of Kaby Lake.  It is also clear the extra clock speed of the desktop CPU gives significant gains when compared to the mobile Core i7 you typically find inside a high end laptop. On the graphics side of things the GTX 1070 GPU does the business, exactly as we would expect, and delivers frame rates north of 50fps in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and a crazy 128fps on average in Rise of the Tomb raider. Cooling Performance As you can see in our video and photos the cooling system inside the Eurocom Sky X4E2 looks entirely conventional with an array of heatpipes that shift the heat from the CPU, GPU and chipset and expel it through the exhausts vents at the rear. It was quite noticeable that the right hand exhaust was hotter than the left and this is reinforced by our  thermal photos. Having said all that, both the CPU and GPU were cooled sufficiently to avoid problems. The CPU topped out at 85 degrees under extreme load and the GPU hit 90 degrees. This is pushing the limits but stopping just short of throttling and Clevo and Eurocom have done a good job of keeping the temperatures under control. Acoustic performance When the laptop works very hard the fan noise is certainly audible however the fan curve is completely smooth and progressive with the result that the noise is almost of no concern. This is impressive and while we would prefer the fans to be quieter we had very few complaints. Battery life Looping PC Mark 8 continuously gave us a battery life of 2 hours 26 minutes. In the real world you can double that figure to four and a half hours which is pretty impressive for such a powerful gaming laptop. Closing Thoughts The Eurocom Sky X4E2 is an impressive gaming laptop that offers a great many upgrade paths both at the time of order and also in the future. Right now in 2017 we have little idea about the plans of Intel and Nvidia and have no clue whether Eurocom will be able to offer a next generation CPU or GPU for this laptop. All we do know for sure is that they will do their best. When it comes to pricing the Eurocom Sky X4E2 gives us a bit of a problem. It is certainly expensive, and every upgrade or change to the specification adds to the cost. Eurocom tells us the price is only a starting point and isn’t set in stone so there may be some flexibility here. In terms of performance and build quality, the Eurocom Sky X4E2 lives up to Clevo’s usual high standards. The ports and connectors are first rate and you have a huge number of options. The screen gave us a really good gaming experience and worked well with the GTX 1070 graphics chip while the Kaby Lake CPU kept everything moving at a brisk pace. Configure and buy Eurocom Sky X4E2 HERE Discuss on our Facebook page, over HERE. Pros: Good selection of ports and connectors Eurocom offers future upgrade paths as your laptop gets older Massive number of options when you order your laptop Solid gaming performance from the GTX 1070 and Core i7 combo Cons: Pricing at the Eurocom web store is very high The rubber coated mouse buttons and touch pad are imprecise Under heavy load the CPU and GPU get fairly hot A chunky and heavy laptop KitGuru says: Sky X4E2 is a solid gaming laptop with a long list of good features.

Whatever your inclination, everyone seems to be wanting a piece of this lighting pie. We've seen coolers, motherboards and graphics cards all go under the RGB umbrella so it was only a matter of time until memory was also suitably laden. Guess what? RGB RAM is coming thick and fast. Corsair has updated its Vengeance series with multi-colour lighting, Kingston already has some out on the market, so it's now the turn of DRAM veteran G.Skill to have a go. Building on its premium Trident Z line, G.Skill has released no fewer than 25 RGB-equipped kits into the wild. Capacities range from 16GB to 64GB - though 128GB is available as two packs of four modules - and speeds run from 2,400MHz to a lofty 4,266MHz. You're looking at shelling out about £150 for a 16GB (2x8GB) kit of DDR4-3000 memory while £300-£350 covers 32GB. The price premium over non-RGB memory of the same speed is around 10-15 per cent. There's obvious similarity to the standard Trident Z modules that have been available for some time. Both stand 44mm tall, have XMP 2.0 profiles built in, and feature the same type of bar across the top. The biggest difference here, of course, is that the standard plastic bar has been replaced by an RGB-equipped lightbar that, like the regular module, spans the entire width. A G.Skill-provided shot shows a four-module pack in the standard rainbow scheme where each stick cycles through predefined colours. This is how the modules light up when they're plugged into any motherboard. Here is a 32GB kit of DDR4-3,200 memory installed in one of our Z270 test systems. The lighting effect is more pronounced in reality, particularly in a darker environment, and we reckon G.Skill's RGB interpretation feels a little brighter than Corsair, whose regular clip gets more in the way. You could argue the Trident Z modules were made for RGB usage. Each module carries five evenly-spaced LEDs across the width of the bar, and the lighting effect is nice and even as you look across. Without any additional software, there is no brightness or speed control, so what you see is what you get. To get the most out of the modules you need to either download a motherboard manufacturer's utility; we ran with multi-platform Asus Aura on a Z270F motherboard, or download the beta G.Skill control utility that currently only fully works on the Intel 200-series chipset. G.Skill says that Intel 100-series and AMD X370 chipsets have partial support, while X99 isn't supported at all. This is one area where Corsair does better with its Link integration. Asus Aura is able to synchronise the colours and effects between the modules and the RGB lighting already on the motherboard. G.Skill uses very similar LEDs to Asus as setting the board and RAM's lighting results in indistinguishable colours, and it's kind of eerie to see both sets of lighting breathe the same patterns. The Asus utility can define the speed of effects but not the brightness, yet it is possible to light each zone on each module, if you have the patience. Here, for example, is the top module's right-hand LED in green and the middle one's left-most LED is light pink. You can play around at leisure and tinker enough to get the effect you want, though we actually liked the default wave pattern when synchronised to the motherboard's lighting. Tieing it all up, for Asus at least, the use of a Strix card would extend the lighting to at least three sections of the PC's interior. It won't take a degree from MIT to work out that G.Skill's own utility, available since the start of this month, is a reskinned version of the Asus Aura, likely under license. The benefit here is that you won't need an Asus motherboard for the effects to work, and G.Skill adds a couple of extra options for good measure. Faster Trident Z RGB packs, like this one, require 1.35V to work, and we had zero problems when inputting XMP timings - the sample pack booted first time and caused no stability issues. On to some benchmarks.

WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee has scrapped all meetings this week amid growing partisan rancor now threatening to derail its investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign. The full committee meetings were canceled amid an increasingly tense back-and-forth that intensified over Chairman Devin Nunes’ decision to cancel a public hearing set for Tuesday, two sources on the committee told CNN. The controversy widened as Democrats called on Nunes to step aside because of his decision to brief President Donald Trump on intelligence information he received from a source on White House grounds. Democrats believe he is too close to the White House to lead a thorough investigation into Russia — including ties between the Trump camp and Russian officials — an assertion firmly rejected by the GOP. FBI director confirms investigation into Russian election interference “I don’t think he can just recuse himself and still chair the committee,” Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat on the panel, told CNN’s Chris Cuomo Tuesday on “New Day.” “I think that the writing is on the wall. It might make a good spy novel. It doesn’t make a good investigation.” The decision to scrap this week’s meetings shows that the panel is facing serious turmoil and questions about whether it can proceed. Nunes scrapped a Tuesday public hearing on Russia to hold a private briefing with FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, prompting outcry from Democrats who wanted the issue of the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to the Kremlin to remain in public view. But Comey and Rogers opted not to brief the panel amid the furor within the committee over how to proceed with its investigation. The full committee typically meets at least twice a week and it’s uncertain if those meetings will be rescheduled. 38.907192 -77.036871 Related Stories Ryan, Senate Intel committee see no evidence of Trump wiretap Russian spy ship again spotted off East Coast Authors: CNN Wire Filed in: National/World News Topics: campaign, House Intelligence Committee, meetings, partisan rancor, Russia, this week, trump 290 Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel More in National/World News Michigan to pay nearly $100 million in Flint lawsuit settlement More from WGNO Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App facebook twitter instagram pinterest Email Alerts About & Contact Screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • EEO Report • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 1 Galleria Blvd., Suite 850 Metairie, LA 70001 • Copyright © 2017, WGNO • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Articles & Reviews News Archive Forums Premium Categories Computers Display Drivers GPUs / Graphics Cards Linux Gaming Memory Motherboards CPUs / Processors Software Storage Operating Systems Peripherals Close Articles & Reviews News Archive Forums Premium Categories Computers GPUs / Graphics Cards Linux Gaming Memory Motherboards CPUs / Processors Software Storage Operating Systems Peripherals Atomic Mode-Setting Support For VMware's VMWGFX DRM Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 28 March 2017 at 08:17 AM EDT. Add A Comment The latest DRM driver going atomic is VMware's vmwgfx driver used by VMware virtualized guests. Atomic mode-setting allows setting output modes more cleanly and straight-forward by either being able to succeed or fail in one-go while also being able to test a desired mode in advance of the commit operation, reducing possible flickering situations and also being faster. Enlightenment, Weston, and other compositors already have basic support for interfacing with atomic-enabled drivers. Intel's DRM driver is in the best shape for atomic mode-setting at the moment. Nouveau picked up atomic support in Linux 4.10, AMDGPU's atomic support will come once DC lands, and the smaller DRM drivers have also worked towards atomic mode-setting. VMWgfx is now the latest. The patches implementing atomic mode-setting for vmwgfx can be found on the dri-devel list for review. Perhaps we'll see it merged for the Linux 4.12 kernel.

(Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) Share Written by Selina Cheng March 28, 2017 A 1983 picture map of Silicon Valley may be a goofy throwback, but it reveals how much the US tech landscape was once changed—to everybody’s surprise—by an outsider called Microsoft. Originally the work of artist Maryanne Regal Hoburg, the map below is now housed at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. It was designed as a branding souvenir for Eaton, and isn’t geographically precise, but it does roughly indicate where tech companies and landmarks were once located: Cities include Mountain View, San Jose, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and Cupertino in Santa Clara county, and Fremont, in Alameda county. (Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) Among hardware manufacturers of microprocessors and semiconductors, the big names we can recognize today include IBM, HP, Apple, Intel, and perhaps chip manufacturer Zilog, and Atari, one of the frontrunners of the gaming industry. The map also includes some cultural icons, such as Stanford University and Foothill College, and attractions like the Great America park. Some of the best-known tech brands today only joined the Valley in recent years and never made it on the map. Here’s where they would be today: Google Google was founded in 1998 in Menlo Park, but it has since found its home in Mountain View. Today, it would be marked on the top left of the map, roughly where Sytek, Activision and PFS used to be. (Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) Apple On the 1983 map, Apple is marked with its old color-striped logo, right on top of the “Cupertino” label. The company is still there, but is now expanding its headquarters as Apple Park and would certainly occupy much more space than it once did. (Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) Tesla Founded in 2003, the Tesla Factory currently occupies the far northeast, in Fremont, which used to be home of the General Motors plant. (Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) Facebook Facebook, too, is missing from the map. Created in 2004, the social media network is now housed in Menlo Park, which barely makes it onto the west side of the map. (Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) But what may be most astonishing is that many companies on this map can no longer be found at all. “Actually there’s an entire industry that’s gone,” says Chris Garcia, curator of the Computer History Museum and a Santa Clara native. “Before the IBM PC concept took off, everyone—and I mean everyone—was banking on CP/M being the dominant force, and it didn’t happen,” he says, referring to companies that produced hardware for CP/M, an operating system for microcomputers at the time. Then a Silicon Valley outsider appeared. Founded not in California, but in Washington state, in 1975, a company called Microsoft sold its operating system MS-DOS to IBM in 1980. IBM used MS-DOS in its personal computers, which became the standard for home computers. And although CP/M is still considered to have marked the “beginning of the personal computer revolution,” leading manufacturers like Cromemco and Sperry Univac that depended on the system disappeared within a few years time, says Garcia, “largely because the PC just took off so hard, which is weird because the PC has no direct connection to Silicon Valley.” Other microcomputer producers like Onyx Systems, RAIR, and System Plus Inc, also phased out. Microsoft’s main campus is in Redmond, east of Seattle. But in 2001, perhaps in a nod to all the companies it buried, it opened a relatively small Silicon Valley location near Google. Correction: An earlier version of this story stated Fremont was a city in Santa Clara county. It is in Alameda County. It also stated Menlo Park as part of Palo Alto. They are neighboring cities.

Edward Hardy Mar 28, 2017 6:02 AM EDT Three Reasons Investors Should Hold On to Advanced Micro Devices 1. There is better visibility into Ryzen 7 and the imminent Ryzen 5 launch on April 11. While the Ryzen 7 series competes with Intel's (INTC)  workstation and professional applications, it has received mixed reviews. 2. A major factor behind AMD's share price outperformance is its peerless leadership strategy. 3. Advanced Micro Devices' ability to balance pricing and competitive performance has been fairly impressive. There are challenges, nonetheless. Near-term revenues and gross margin upsides could be impacted by increasing operating expenses and smaller licensing gains for 2017. Looking at the company's balance sheet, cash and liabilities are at manageable levels. If AMD manages to show profits, analysts will upgrade price targets, and the stock will move upward.

(MU) Stock Is More Than Just a Memory Memory maker Micron's run has just begun By , NavellierGrowth.com  |  Mar 24, 2017, 11:43 am EDT     Popular Posts: 7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your Portfolio Amazon.com, Inc.

(MU) Stock Is More Than Just a Memory Recent Posts: 110 Actions to Take on Today’s Market Dip 7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your Portfolio Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Continues to Impress View All Posts Micron Technology, Inc. (NYSE:MU) is just about the biggest thing to come out of Boise, Idaho, besides the potato. Source: Mike Deal via Flickr Begun in 1978 in the basement of a dentist’s office, four partners began building what would become one of the largest and most well-respected memory chip makers in the world. The success that they have brought into being has been a function of their ability to adapt and pivot. Many hardware makers have come and gone over those four decades, but MU has continued to grow. MU Stock Is an Innovator This is a firm that built its first DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chip in 1981, long before the advent of the internet, online gaming, content streaming, digital cameras and mobile phones. But MU kept innovating, and it has paid off handsomely. Over the past decade, MU has easily doubled the performance of competitors Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC). And in the past year, the outperformance has been even more impressive — MU is up 175%, almost tripling WDC’s return, and beating INTC by an order of magnitude. Some of its recent fortunes have turned on the fact that the DRAM and NAND (named after a type of gate in a circuit) markets are in a boom cycle right now. These memories are key to modern-day electronics, everything from mobile phones to Big Data servers. There’s no doubt that this sector is volatile. And Micron’s ability to thrive in these feast-or-famine, dog-eat-dog business cycles is testament to the company’s ability to find next solutions before customers even have a significant need. Also, the thing to remember about some of these tech cycles is that many are changing duration due to the leapfrogging of technologies. The better they make chips, the more demand for chips there is and the longer the upcycle lasts. For instance, in the case of memory, as speeds increase, there is increasing demand from hardware makers to get as close to 0 latency as possible (i.e., no delay between the action and the command). It also requires display makers to eliminate what’s known in the industry as the ‘screen door effect’ or SDE. This is when viewers can see fine lines separating the pixels. Getting rid of SDE is going to be especially important as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets become more common. VR and AR are far more than new ways for gamers to entertain themselves. They are a way for all of us to interact with our world — both real and imaginary — in a totally immersive experience. And to get there, it’s going to take huge leaps in DRAM technology, especially in mobile devices, which are used in the current generation of VR goggles. Micron is already stepping up to the challenge. Another important fact to bear in mind is, while MU has benefited from DRAM pricing and demand, no one is taking into account the growing demand for NAND devices. Analysts anticipate a bull market for NAND to continue for at least another year. Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

(GME) Stock for Something Better Already View All Posts I’ll be honest: I never understood the optimism toward Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock. While AMD stock languished in the $2 range for much of the past few years, I thought the bullishness toward the stock was simply too optimistic. Source: AMD Advanced Micro Devices was a distant second to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in CPUs. It lagged behind Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in gaming. Its balance sheet wasn’t exactly spectacular, and AMD consistently lost money and burned cash. Obviously, I missed the huge run in AMD stock, which has gained almost 700% from early 2016 lows. At the risk of joining the party too late, I think there could be more upside, even after a modest breather in those gains over the past few weeks. Advanced Micro Devices has some risk at current levels, to be sure. But there remain a number of catalysts that can continue the run. The Ryzen CPU Can Push AMD Stock Higher AMD’s Ryzen chips already have driven some of the optimism toward shares of late — but they might have more to contribute. Jefferies recently upgraded AMD stock based in large part on the competitive boost from the new chips. In fact, the firm said revenue could potentially double in a best-case scenario. The rollout of Ryzen 7 has hit an early speed bump, with the CPU leading computers to lock up. But Advanced Micro Devices appears to have a fix and issues aside, reviews seem positive. Ryzen 5 will be launched soon, to likely be followed by lower-cost desktop CPUs and laptop and server chips later this year. And Ryzen’s impact goes beyond its sales and profit contributions. It positions AMD as once again a worthy competitor to Intel, not just a second source of supply for lower-cost, lower-performance processors that drive lower-end desktops and notebooks. And its early reviews bode well for Vega, which AMD hopes will allow to target Nvidia in gaming the way Ryzen has improved its competitive position in CPUs. The Numbers Still Work It is worth pointing out that AMD still isn’t profitable, and still isn’t really growing – yet. Advanced Micro Devices lost almost $500 million in 2016. Revenue did increase 9% year-over-year … but sales remain 20%-plus below 2014 levels. But higher-priced Ryzen chips can reverse substantial pressure on gross margin: AMD’s gross profit dollars declined a stunning 46% between 2014 and 2016, with both lower sales and lower margins. Cost-cutting has brought down marketing and G&A spend, and Advanced Micro Devices still has room for improvement on that front. Meanwhile, the balance sheet has improved, with both debt and interest expense declining of late and likely again in 2017. There’s a substantial amount of earnings leverage to be unlocked over the next few years. Higher pricing will improve gross margins; those incremental dollars will fall to operating income at a high rate due to a fixed-cost model. Cost-cutting should keep opex increases in check. Add in lower interest expense, and AMD’s recent losses can reverse quickly. Analysts expect an 8-cent profit in 2017 and 30 cents in 2018. A reinvigorated Advanced Micro Devices could beat those estimates … which would drive AMD stock higher still.

As many of us had the feeling - in 2017 there's just no place for it. Can you just sort out your manufacturing issues and release a proper SSD based on Optane tech? (with some sane price along the way) I am totally disappointed.

I bet those numbers aren't even compared to a SATA SSD, let alone an NVMe SSD. Not that it really matters since after the OS, how much stuff are you going to store on a 16 or 32GB unit anyway? Maybe it's great if you only ever do 2 things with your PC. I'd rather install a 500GB NVMe SSD if I had a 270 series mobo.

There are people out there who have multiple terabytes worth of applications and game data. If you need at least 2TB of storage, I am pretty confident a HDD + Optane would be a much cheaper option than a 2TB SSD, while offering similar performance. It wouldn't surprise me if you could actually get 2x 2TB HDDs and put them in RAID1, and still pay less. Doing so would improve performance while keeping data redundant. I would have to say that Optane is a pretty stupid choice is you're going for less than 1TB of storage. I also think Optane could be especially handy if you could reserve it for a paging file, and, Windows' prefetch/superfetch. Even Windows 10 will still use a paging file despite available un-buffered memory, and will close applications saying you've run out of virtual memory even though you have plenty of physical memory left over. I personally don't like the idea of wearing out an SSD because Windows does such a crappy job at knowing what resources it has available to it, but I dislike the idea more of applications failing to run properly, and I dislike even more the idea of putting in a HDD to use as a dedicated swap partition. This is where I think Optane comes in handy - if you can designate your paging file to it, then you can effectively buy less RAM and then buy an Optane drive (which in comparison to RAM is priced pretty well). That way, you still get pretty close to RAM performance while getting Windows' paging issues out of the way, all while keeping your SSD fresh.     schmidtbag View Public Profile Find all posts by schmidtbag   (#9) Ricepudding Newbie     Videocard: 980ti Zotac Amp Extreme Processor: I7-2700k @4.6 Mainboard: Asus Maximus IV Extreme-Z Memory: Corsair 16gb 1600mhz Soundcard: Asus Xonar Xense PSU: Corsair 1200w Yesterday, 15:58 | posts: 24 From what i can tell this seems to be a cheap alternative for people still stuck using HDD's as their main drive, anyone using SSD or NVME drives will find almost no use for these. Although SSD prices have dropped they are still fairly high for the main stream consumer, much cheaper to buy a TB HDD + optane than it would to get an SSD.     Ricepudding View Public Profile Find all posts by Ricepudding « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 March 2017 by Military News Latest Series of 3.5” Boards Elevate Processing Power in Human-Machine Interfaces Industrial automation demands faster image processing capabilities for control and monitoring of manufacturing equipment. Fremont, CA (PRWEB) March 28, 2017 NEXCOM’s latest series of 3.5” boards, EBC 357X, improve processing power and enhance display performance in a reliable and power efficient compact design. Based on multi-core SoC Intel® Atom™ processor E3900 product family, advanced computing, graphics power, and wide temperature range, the EBC 357X series is aimed at HMI for industrial automation, building management systems and outdoor retail. Industrial automation demands faster image processing capabilities for control and monitoring of manufacturing equipment. The EBC 357X series works seamlessly with manufacturing equipment and general motion control systems displaying 2D graphics, as well as running smooth 3D animations in CNC machine processes. The same way, HMI panels allow operators to visualize actions while data is protected and backed up thanks to the additional storage connected through M.2 connector. Reliable operation under certain thermal conditions is essential to facilitate building automation. Superior resource management is attained knowing the EBC 357X series will remain fully functional even when placed in closed rooms without ventilation, given its working consistency in a wide temperature range of -40 to 85 degrees Celsius. The 3.5” board can control different areas of utilities effortlessly in a building, such as elevators, sewage, maintenance services and even video surveillance. Ultra-HD 4K graphics and triplex display support permit the EBC 357X to become a complete retail solution for self-service kiosks. The customer can navigate through options to select the desired product or service using a touchscreen or keypad, execute payments, and get a printed receipt. Promotions and advertisements are constantly presented thanks to the multiple displays supporting VGA, HDMI and LVDS. Shopping centers, gas stations, photo printing, check-in counters and even public information are some areas where the EBC 375X series can create a better user experience.

And for the first time in three years, toy-maker Lego is no longer the company with the best reputation among U.K. consumers. One company that made big strides was Volkswagen, which saw its reputation score rise from 55.3 in 2016 to 68.3 in 2017. That wasn’t enough, however, to move the automaker back into the 150 companies on the list developed by the Reputation Institute. In the institute’s earlier listing of the companies with the best reputations globally, Volkswagen eked in at number 100 with a score of 64.73. According to the Reputation Institute, there are seven key rational dimensions of reputation: products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship, leadership and performance. The Reputation Institute collected about 40,000 ratings from U.K. respondents who are either “somewhat” or “very” familiar with the companies they rated and who have completed at least 75% of the rating survey. The 10 companies and their reputation scores are: Dyson: 86.8 Aston Martin: 85.4 Lego: 85.0 Michelin: 84.0 Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE): 83.7 Waitrose: 83.5 Intel Corp. (NYSE: INTC): 83.5 PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) Samsung: 83.0 Rolls-Royce Aerospace: 82.3 In the global survey, Rolex finished at the top, followed by Lego and Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS). Sony, Intel and Rolls-Royce also finished in the top 10 globally. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google finished in 11th place and Apple Inc.

And yes, you will have to travel to Paraguay and find the shop, but somebody in Paraguay is shouting "who's your daddy!" :-) Of course, to skip the embargo date by this amount, well that's just steep alright. The photos have been posted on Reddit, the end-user who has his hands on that platform bought a Ryzen 5 1600 (six-cores enabled processor) and a MSI B350 Tomahawk motherboard.

The case, TC Heartland v. Kraft Heinz, might not appear to be tied to tech at first glance, but is being closely watched by Silicon Valley. Heartland, a beverage flavor company, is appealing a decision over a patent infringement suit it brought against Kraft. Kraft filed the case in Delaware, but Heartland wants it moved to Indiana, its home base. That request, though, was denied by a lower court. Heartland is now challenging that decision. Heartland's problems with the decision parallel a similar issue faced in the tech industry: patent suit plaintiffs frequently seek to move patent cases to a rural district in East Texas, that in recent years has been favorable to such lawsuits. ADVERTISEMENT Defendants in these cases often contend that the ability of the plaintiff to pick the venue disadvantages them. In 2014, one judge in the small Texas town, Marshall, handled about a quarter of all patent infringement cases. 72 percent of all patent holder wins came from this district. Companies dubbed "patent trolls," or entities that hold patents, but usually don't manufacture anything, have filed a slew of lawsuits in the district. That's enraged some tech companies who keep find themselves on the losing side of those suits. Dell, Oracle, Intel and Adobe have all filed amicus briefs in support of Heartland's argument against plaintiff court shopping. Companies on the other side, including Ericsson, who have benefited from the status quo, filed amicus briefs supporting Kraft. During the arguments presented at the Supreme Court today, a lawyer representing Kraft argued that problems stemming from patent cases in East Texas shouldn't affect the case as it pertained to his client. "In other words, it's an inconvenient forum compared to where I am located. They tend to be complaints about how the cases are managed, how discovery takes place, how motions practice is handled, and so on," Kraft's lawyer said. "They are problems that should be dealt with on their own terms..." But several justices questioned that argument. They noted a 1957 Supreme Court decision that said "any civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides." Reside being interpreted to mean where it the company was incorporated. A decision is expected by the end of June.

HOUSE VOTE TOMORROW ON BROADBAND PRIVACY: The House will vote Tuesday on eliminating Obama-era Federal Communications Commission privacy regulations on internet service providers. The vote comes days after Senate Republicans passed a bill introduced by Sen.

That measure passed the Senate on Friday in a 50-48 party-line vote. If it passes the House and is signed by President Trump, as is widely expected, the resolution would nullify privacy rules that make it harder for internet providers to sell consumer data. The FCC rules would have required broadband providers to get permission from their customers before using or sharing their data for advertising purposes. The rule covers data including the apps consumers use, the websites they visit and their location.

If the bill is signed into law, as is widely expected, the Fight for the Future campaign will put up billboards in Washington, D.C., and select districts that list the lawmakers who voted for the measure. A draft of the billboard shows a list of the 50 Republicans who voted for the bill on Thursday in the Senate, along with the text, "They betrayed you." Read more here. UK MINISTER ATTACKS TECH OVER ENCRYPTION: British Home Secretary Amber Rudd called encrypted apps "completely unacceptable" on a BBC Sunday talk show in the wake of last week's Westminster attack -- one of multiple officials to call for encryption backdoors. "We need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into encrypted systems like WhatsApp," Rudd said on "The Andrew Marr Show." Police investigating last week's slaying of four people on the Westminster Bridge in London believe Khalid Masood acted alone in the attack, driving a car into pedestrians and stabbing a police officer to death. Officers shot him dead on the scene. Newspapers have reported that Masood, who grew up in Kent, England, used the chatting app "WhatsApp," which is encrypted in a way so that police cannot retrieve messages without his password.

The social media company on Monday announced that it is rolling out three new products to help users more easily find information about their representatives, connect them with those lawmakers and remind the public about local elections. "Building a civically-engaged community means building new tools to help people engage in a thoughtful and informed way," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said of the new tools in a post. "The starting point is knowing who represents you and how you can make your voice heard on the decisions that affect your life." One of the tools, called "Town Hall," will direct users to their representative's Facebook profiles and allow constituents to call, message or email them directly from the app. Read more here. KUSHNER TO LEAD BUSINESS ADVISORY GROUP: The Washington Post reported that President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will head up a group of business leaders that will advise the administration on how to reform government operations. Among those working with the White House Office of American Innovation are tech titans like Bill Gates, Tesla's Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. "We should have excellence in government," Kushner told the Post. "The government should be run like a great American company.

In the case of the Dell Inspiron 7000, you get a beefy gaming computer that can take whatever game designers throw at it. Unfortunately, its physical design is rife with trade-offs. Indeed, you get a pretty great machine when you spend that $2000 on Dell's budget gaming laptop, but you're never gonna forget it's cheap. And $2000 is pretty cheap for a 15-inch gaming laptop with a 7th-generation Intel i5 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti video card, and a 256GB SSD. (The base $1900 model gives you a slightly slower GTX 1050 video card and a traditional 1TB hard drive.) And for those unfamiliar with specs let me be totally clear: this thing flies. I easily squeaked out a little more than 30 frames per second when I played Rise of the Tomb Raider on High settings. On WebXPRT, a popular synthetic benchmark that tests for browser-based activities like spreadsheets, photo editing, and web page loading, the Inspiron 7000 scored a 412, nearly identical to the score notched by the zippy new 33cm Macbook Pro. And it's much faster than the gaming-focused Razer Stealth Blade. The Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming laptop is a device meant to fly despite its price. Nerds will note that it won't give you 60 frames per second on a graphically intensive game like Battlefield 1 or Rise of the Tomb Raider, but 30fps is more than enough for normal mortals. The cheap machine also gives you a really nice full keyboard with keys backlit by red LEDs. Though the red isn't just reserved for the keys. The vents are covered in a fine red mesh, and the top and sides of the laptop are covered in a pleasant soft touch red. "That's gross," a co-worker opined. "I love it," I responded, clutching the giant laptop to my chest. While most budget laptops are thirteen inches or smaller, the Dell Inspiron 7000 is a 15-inch machine. And it's bulky in more than one way, weighing a solid 2.65kg and measuring an inch thick when closed. It's hefty because to keep the price cheap, Dell is using effective — but space consuming — measures to handle the heat put out by the discrete graphics card and processor. (If you want thin, you'll need to spend a lot more money for something like the 2017 Razer Blade, which starts at $2800, or the MSI GT62VR, which starts at around $2300. To manage heat cheaply and efficiently, Dell uses a set of fans which roar to life when playing games. Running a game as simple as Civilisation VI immediately kicked them into high gear and forced me to turn up the volume of the TV I was watching in the background while I played. But the fans definitely kept the laptop cool, too. A few rounds of Overwatch can make some laptops so hot you don't want to touch them, but I had zero issues keeping the Inspiron 7000 on my lap. To get this laptop to such a cheap price Dell also had to skimp on physical build quality and aesthetics. The 15-inch 1080p display is...not good. It just has awful viewing angles. Stoop forward or lean back and you instant get a completely different visual experience. Which is deeply frustrating. Just like the sharp corners of the chassis that dig into your forearms when you type. Ouch. In the end, the roaring fans and a bad screen are constant reminders that you saved a lot of cash to get this laptop. And you did! There are very few laptops in the $1900-$2000 price range that are as efficient and fast as this one. But when you're saving money, you can't get everything you want. If all you care about is playing some games on a PC, then get the Dell Inspiron 7000 Gaming. If you want something beautifully engineered, then keep saving your money. README It's a $2000 laptop that lets you play the newest games on high settings. The display leaves a lot to be desired, but a full-sized HDMI port means you can always plug it into a nice display. A full-size keyboard is welcome for gamers who rely on a number pad. Sharp corners near the palm rests will bite into your forearms. This thing is f**king huge. And its whirling fans are crazy loud.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Keith Olbermann on Monday railed into the drip, drip, drip of Donald Trump’s ties to Russia, noting the question is “not blowing over,” and instead boils down to one word: “Treason.” “The Russia story continues to grow grimmer and bigger and deadlier,” Olbermann said in his latest installment of “The Resistance.” “The word ‘treason’ has been invoked now by the most unlikely of sources,” he continued, noting even former George Bush ethics lawyer Richard Painter has used that term to describe the Trump-Russia connection. Olbermann added the White House “seems to be setting up [former Gen. Mike] Flynn as its scapegoat,” and that House Intel Committee chairman Devin Nunes, who served on the Trump transition team, seems to be a “spasm of panic.” “Not since Kenn Starr have we seen someone who is in effect the prosecutor panic,” Olbermann said, joked that Nunes is acting like “a guy who’s about to flee the country.” He then chastised the House Intel Chairman for going to Trump with information “like a prosecutor handing over evidence to a defendant” in an effort to validate the president’s “amazingly stupid tweet” about Barack Obama. “This is not blowing over, this has not stopped expanding,” Olbermann said, arguing the question is now whether the person we elected president is “loyal to the United States of America or loyal to the Russian Federation.” Watch the video below, via GQ: NEW VIDEO: As we can infer Flynn (and/or others) may seek a deal, and Nunes panics, feel free to call it TREASON pic.twitter.com/hIecEOP5uG — Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) March 28, 2017 Report typos and corrections to corrections@rawstory.com About the Author Next on Raw Story > Auschwitz survivor issues powerful rebuke of ICE director: ‘Don’t forget, history is not on your side’ By commenting, you agree to our terms of service and to abide by our commenting policy.

Semiconductors -- the microscopically small electrical circuits inside computers -- are going to keep changing the world in ways that can't yet even be imagined, said Thomas Caulfield, GlobalFoundries senior vice president and general manager of Fab 8. "How many people have heard of the internet of things? It's about putting smart technology in about every device you can imagine," Caulfield said Monday evening at Skidmore College. "The only thing that limits this is my imagination, to think of things that can be done." Caulfield delivered the 33rd annual F. William Harder Lecture in Business Administration in the college's Gannett Auditorium. He highlighted the work being done at the GlobalFoundries plant in Malta, one of just a handful of places in the world where the most powerful computer chips are being built. The lecture series brings business leaders to campus to discuss the challenges of changing business environments. With 7-nanometer circuits now being put on chips at Fab 8, Caulfield said the industry again is confronting whether there are limits to Moore's law -- the principle first stated by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that the number of circuits that can be fitted onto a computer chip can be doubled every two years. "The semiconductor industry is at  crossroads," Caulfield said. "Moore's Law is being challenged by complexity. And that's being done 12 miles away from here." gallery_items: SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE PIN EMAIL 1 of 11 - Skidmore College President Philip Glotzbach speaks before introducing guest speaker Thomas Caulfield.

Fab 8, where more than $12 billion has been invested, produced its first commercial chips in 2012. It has about 3,000 employees in Malta, making chips that go into products built by such major computer and electronics companies as AMD, Samsung and Apple. There is the likelihood of more job growth in the future. "Clearly the technologies we will be adding down the road will lead to job growth," Caulfield said. At 7-nanometers -- a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter -- Caulfield said 10 million circuits can be fitted onto a surface the width of a human hair. There are billions of circuits on a modern computer chip. As the chip-making process has become more complex and costly, he said the number of chip makers has shrunk since the year 2000 from about 15 to just four large companiesr: Intel, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor and GlobalFoundries. GlobalFoundries shortly after its 2009 founding bought Chartered Semiconductor in Singapore and then in 2012 bought IBM's two chip-making plants, building the scale to manufacture efficiently, Caulfield said. He said GlobalFoundries spends $1 billion per year on research and development, and that diversity and a world-wide research network are important parts of achieving new technologies. GlobalFoundries has researchers in India working on problems while their counterparts in the United States are sleeping, he noted. "This happens every 10 years or so in the industry. We think we've outlived Moore's Law, but we always find ways to innovate beyond it," Caulfield told an audience of students, facultyand local business leaders. "When you hire talent, you're hiring it for critical thinking and problem-solving." Diversity is essential to the process, he said. About 140 different cultures are represented within Fab 8's workforce. "You need cultural diversity, you need gender diversity, you need experiential diversity," Caulfield said. "It's about perspective, bringing a variety of perspectives to a problem. A variety of perspectives challenges conformity in decision-making." During a question-and-answer period after the lecture, Caulfield acknowledged that GlobalFoundries and the semiconductor industry generally need to do a better job of recruiting and integrating women into scientific and engineering roles. Women hold only about 17 percent of those jobs in the industry, a statistic Caulfield said is reflected at Fab 8. The lecture was co-sponsored by the Saratoga County Prosperity Partnership, one of Saratoga County's business development organizations.

Requested lifting the policy that limits the number of air strike casualties, after U.S. drones killed over 85 in Syria and as many as 200 in Mosul. The Telegraph reported that on Tuesday, a "suspected US air strike on a school being used as a shelter by families displaced from the Isil-held Syrian city of Raqqa killed at least 33 people on Tuesday, in the latest high civilian casualty raid by the coalition." "On Thursday [March 16], a U.S. Reaper drone struck a gathering in a rebel-held village in Aleppo province, killing as many as 49 people. Monitoring groups say most of the dead were civilians who had gathered at a mosque to pray, while the Pentagon claims the gathering was a meeting of al-Qaeda members," Democracy Now reported on Monday. It's also been reported that "the number of civilian casualties in U.S. airstrikes has been escalating since Donald Trump took office two months ago." And in Mosul: "The American-led military coalition in Iraq said Friday that it was investigating reports that scores of civilians — perhaps as many as 200, according to local residents — had been killed in recent American airstrikes in Mosul, the northern Iraqi city where Iraq’s security forces have been waging a monthslong offensive," reported The New York Times. 3.

Devin Nunes, went to the White House grounds to view what he said were classified documents not available to members of Congress, cast new doubt on the independence of investigation under Nunes’ leadership. The old doubt was that Nunes was literally a member of the Trump transition team to the White House, where he was part of a 15-person executive committee that included current Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Trump’s children. If that wasn't bad enough, Nunes’ latest visit to the White House really put the air quotes in the “independent” investigation into Trump’s Russia dealings. After weeks of tip-toeing around the issue, on Monday, the ranking Democratic member on the investigation, Rep. Adam Schiff, had had enough and called for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation: After much consideration, and in light of the Chairman's admission that he met with his source of information at the White House, I believe that the Chairman should recuse himself from any further involvement in the Russia investigation, as well as any involvement in oversight of matters pertaining to any incidental collection of the Trump transition, as he was also a key member of the transition team… I believe the public cannot have the necessary confidence that matters involving the President's campaign or transition team can be objectively investigated or overseen by the Chairman… As to the merits of the Chairman's underlying claim, none of the committee members—Democrats or Republicans—has seen the relevant documents, now almost a week later. Whether the documents support the argument that names were improperly unmasked or distributed, it is impossible to judge, but one thing is very clear: There was no legitimate justification for bringing that information to the White House instead of the committee. That it was also obtained at the White House makes this departure all the more concerning. In the interests of a fair and impartial investigation whose results will be respected by the public, the Chairman's recusal is more than warranted. Elliot Hannon is a writer in New York City.

Brian MacCraith says employers want creative leaders, not first-class honours nerds Tue, Mar 28, 2017, 01:00 Carl O'Brien DCU president Brian MacCraith: “In this post-Brexit, Trumpian world, the most important thing we can do for this nation is talent development.” Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons         Whenever he asks employers about the must-have skills they want in today’s graduates, Dublin City University president Brian MacCraith gets much the same answer. “The head of one of the country’s biggest consultancy firms said to me, ‘It’s as simple as this: the first-class honours nerd is no good for us. It takes us 18 months to get any value from that person – and by then it’s probably too late.’ Employers tell us they want graduates who can solve problems, lead teams, innovate, build relationships and strengthen their organisations”. Creative thinkers and problem-solvers have been buzzwords in education and employment circles for a while now, but MacCraith says newer traits are also in demand. Emotional intelligence is coming up more and more, he says. Digital literacy is also high on the agenda. Still, he says if there is one attribute that looks set to grow in importance over the coming years, it boils down to this: adaptability. “The ability to assess the world around you. To adjust to change. We know the job for life is long gone. The ability to change, and to apply thinking skills to new paradigms, is critically important.” Blurring pace The pace of change is so blurry in some sectors that students start a course, only to find the landscape has fundamentally changed by the time they graduate. This poses real challenges for higher education. To ensure Ireland remains competitive, our education system must react quickly, MacCraith says. For DCU,this means integrating these key skills into the 2,500 modules that underpin the college’s degree programmes. MacCraith says all incoming students are now provided with an e-portfolio that acts as a digital archive of personal development framed around these key attributes.The concept, he says, is a “living degree”, which adapts to the changing environment. ADVERTISEMENT For the university, it means anticipating change coming down the tracks. One plans involves much earlier engagement with employers to see where skills trends are heading, rather than responding when it’s too late to fill gaps in the economy. Another involves crowdsourcing ideas from alumni to inform the future direction of the university. It has built a online platform (DCU Fuse) to help capture these ideas, which will feed into its upcoming strategic plan. DCU Fuse is due to be launched shortly. “Our education system needs to demonstrate, and be allowed to demonstrate, the same adaptability that is expected of our graduates,” MacCraith says. Servicing economy To some, such a relentless focus on meeting the changing needs of big business is a slippery slope. Universities, so the argument goes, are increasingly servicing the needs of the economy rather than focusing on their role as independent centres of critical scholarship. Against this backdrop, some critics say the very meaning of education is mutating from its original focus on human development to being a producer of human capital for the market economy. MacCraith has heard the argument and rejects it on the basis that employers are not calling the shots over any of its courses. He cites a new DCU data analytics degree course, an area in high demand across the globe. The degree was cowritten with key companies in the sector, among them Accenture, IBM and Intel. The course includes “industry pods”, in which industry partners will deliver domain-specific modules from their expertise area. The prospect will doubtless horrify some academics who worry that higher education is increasingly utilitarian in nature. MacCraith, however, is unapologetic. “When you got extremes, of course it is wrong – but that’s not what’s happening. There’s no single company asking what to put into our degree. We ask companies for advice on issues of relevance . . . We’re not changing the fundamentals of the degrees or the analytical mindsets or the understanding of the disciplines. But in terms of focus areas, we’re making sure our graduates are prepared to move straight in. That, to me, is hugely sensible.” Greater contributions So, if employers benefit so much, should they contribute more to higher education? MacCraith endorses the recommendations of last year’s Cassells report into the future of higher education funding, which calls for a greater contribution from employers as well as the State and students. This report envisaged that business would contribute about €150 million extra to the sector through an increase in a payroll levy known as the National Training Fund. Employers have signalled a willingness to contribute more, but only if they are satisfied that any extra funding goes towards meeting their skills needs. Politically, however, the most sensitive issue is whether students – and their families – should be asked to contribute more. MacCraith believes they should, along with the State and employers, if Ireland is serious about building a higher education system to compete with the world’s best. An Australian-style income-contingent loan scheme for students may be the best way of delivering this, he says. Colleges currently receive about €7,000 per student through a combination of student charges, the State contribution and other sources. A €2,000 increase, MacCraith says, it would go a long way to tackling the “funding crisis” facing higher education. If this was split between student and the State, it would work out at €1,000 extra per student, on top of the existing €3,000 registration charge. “It won’t solve everything,he acknowledges, “but we will need proper investment if we are to run universities which can compete at a reasonably equal level internationally.” ADVERTISEMENT Any funding model, he says, must address equity of access. The existing “free fees” system has not narrowed the social divide to any significant degree. An income-contingent loan system, he says, will ensure that higher education is accessible to all, with scope for an enhanced maintenance support system for less well-off students. “A model like this would be free at the point of entry, which is very attractive for families with kids going to college at the same time. Any solution, though, will have to be strong on the issue of support for students from really challenged socioeconomic backgrounds. More debt One of the main arguments against an income-contingent loan system is heaping yet more debt on the shoulders of young people. Another is that debt-averse students from poorer areas will stay well away from higher education. But MacCraith says the facts don’t back up these arguments. “Look at Australia. It didn’t happen. Those arguments don’t stack up. It’s an unusual loan – you only start paying it back when your salary crosses a sensible threshold. “So, if your education doesn’t provide you with a job, you don’t pay at all. For that, and other reasons, that argument about being loan-averse or debt-averse doesn’t stack up. The evidence doesn’t support it.” Most political observers say there is little chance of a minority Government delivering anything as contentious as student loans. MacCraith, however, says broad agreement could be reached on a “sensible” loans system. “It will need a political consensus, particularly across the two main political parties. There are constructive conversations taking place. “This is about it’s about a bravery of decision-making and recognising the pre-eminent importance of talent development for the future of the nation . . . in this post-Brexit, Trumpian world, the most important thing we can do for this nation is talent development.” Panel: Education expansion: Ireland’s fastest growing university It started in 1980 with just 200 students on the grounds of what was the Albert Agricultural College. Today DCU, the country’s fastest-growing university, has grown to accommodate some 17,000 students. Half of that expansion has come in the past five years alone. It now has four campuses within a 1km radius: the original Glasnevin campus, along with its innovation campus close by on the Old Finglas Road, the All Hallows campus , and its new education campus at Drumcondra. The latter incorporates St Patrick’s College, along with the Mater Dei Institute of Education and the Church of Ireland College of Education. There’s talk of an electric bus service linking the campuses together, while the Metro North (assuming it ever gets built) is scheduled to run across the university’s expanded footprint. DCU says further planned developments will see its student population grow beyond 20,000 with the construction of a new student centre, sports facilities, on-campus accommodation and new digital teaching spaces. At a time of a “financial crisis” in higher education and cash-strapped colleges, how on earth can DCU managed to finance this? Simple: through long-term loans from investment funds and the European Investment Bank. Changes everything As well as changing the college’s physical presence, expansion is also changing the profile of students. “We’re Ireland’s university of enterprise, with a strong focus on engaging with enterprise in all forms and developing enterprising and innovative mindsets in our students,” says DCU president Brian MacCraith. “Now, we have the first first faculty of education in a university, north or south. It creates a virtuous circle. We’re educating 21st-century educators in a research-intensive environment, with the full continuum of education taking place in one location.” A longer-term plan, he says, is to expose students to a much broader learning experience by incorporating elements of the arts or humanities into technology, science or other disciplines. ADVERTISEMENT “We want to contribute to students’ awareness of cultural capital and introduce a broader learning experience. It means we can now introduce philosophy or look at exposure to the arts, as part of a richer experience.”       Topics: Brian Maccraith Albert Agricultural College Church of Ireland College of Education Dublin City University Mater Dei Institute Of Education Accenture IBM Intel Drumcondra Glasnevin Read More Time to get moving on technological universities Brexit could lead to increase in CAO points for Irish students School stress: how teachers are helping children cope with anxiety How I got my A1 in Maths How I got my A1 in English Ask Brian: My son in US wants to study arts in Ireland.

By Michael McLaughlin 4.1k 640 Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that he’ll never reveal the source behind his claim that members of Donald Trump’s team had indirectly come under surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies.  “We will never reveal sources and methods,” Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said to ABC News’ Mary Bruce on Tuesday. Even other members of the committee, which is investigating Russian interference in the presidential campaign, will not learn how Nunes obtained information he said indicated that key figures close to Trump were monitored by U.S. intelligence, Nunes said. House Intel chair @DevinNunes tells @marykbruce he will never share source behind surveillance claim, even to other members of his committee pic.twitter.com/DWb3x9ADAO— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) March 28, 2017 Other members of the intelligence committee have not yet seen the materials Nunes cited, and it’s unclear when they’ll be made available to other lawmakers. “My guess is that it’s going to be a slow process,” Nunes said to ABC News.  Nunes has come under fire from Democrats over his ability to lead a credible investigation into the Russian connections to the presidential campaign.  Tuesday he canceled this week’s scheduled meetings of the intelligence committee as pressure mounted for him to step aside. Nunes said that he will not recuse himself. Currently, he has the support of Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has the power to replace him as committee chair, The New York Times said.  Of particular concern to critics is that Nunes briefed Trump on Wednesday about evidence he said he received from an unnamed source Tuesday on the White House grounds. The evidence allegedly shows that people close to Trump came under so-called “incidental” surveillance while the spy agencies carried out monitoring of foreign targets. Trump, in tweets March 4, had claimed without evidence that former President Barack Obama wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower in New York before the November election. Trump had said initially that he’d been “somewhat” vindicated by Nunes’ statements Wednesday about surveillance. Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post? Here’s how.

Reportedly Trying To Sink Russia Investigation Politics 1 0 0 March 28, 2017 Donald Trump Impeachment: W.H. Reportedly Trying To Sink Russia Investigation Nathan Francis Donald Trump’s odds of impeachment could be rising significantly amid reports that the White House may have tried to squash the Russia investigation by demanding that a key insider not testify against Trump. The Trump administration was rocked last week by the revelation that the FBI is investigating possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential election to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances of victory. American intelligence agencies have accused Russia of hacking into the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of Clinton’s campaign chief, John Podesta, which were then leaked to the organization WikiLeaks and released over the course of the campaign. There had been allegations that Trump’s campaign team worked closely with Russian officials on the release of the materials, and claims that Russia had been working for years to cultivate Trump as a candidate, collecting embarrassing information to use as blackmail and dangling lucrative financial deals before Trump. Now there is evidence that Donald Trump may be trying to grind the Russia investigation to a halt. A report from the Washington Post on Tuesday found that the White House tried to forbid former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. Sources told the Washington Post that Yates would have likely uncovered some of the lies the White House has told about links with Russia. “As acting attorney general, Yates played a key part in the investigation surrounding Michael T. Flynn, a Trump campaign aide who became national security adviser before revelations that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the United States in late December led to his ouster. “Yates and another witness at the planned hearing, former CIA director John Brennan, had made clear to government officials by Thursday that their testimony to the committee probably would contradict some statements that White House officials had made, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ken Wainstein, a lawyer for Brennan, declined to comment.” That has led to an angry backlash among Democrats and hints that the Russia investigation is growing more likely to lead to Donald Trump’s impeachment. Just hours after the report was published, commentator Keith Olbermann predicted that Republicans would no longer feel motivated to protect Trump against impeachment. House Intel Dem: Trump is trying to shut down our committee to stop Russia probe https://t.co/wfUMUVszJA pic.twitter.com/3pQ8M3fFNO — The Hill (@thehill) March 28, 2017 Because Republicans hold a majority in both the House and Senate, it would take many GOP members voting for Trump’s impeachment to actually make it happen, but the abrupt failure of the GOP health care reform plan showed that they are not afraid to buck the party and go against Trump. As Olbermann predicted, Republicans skittish about 2018 re-election chances would be more likely to vote to impeach Donald Trump, Raw Story noted. “You think these Republicans are going to defend Donald Trump?” Olbermann said (via Raw Story), adding “there is no Republicans loyalty Trump now. “It will be the Republicans who impeach him,” he added.

Asked whether he'd tell committee members who gave him intelligence reports indicating President Trump's team was incidentally surveilled, Nunes replied, "We will never reveal those sources and methods," according to Reuters. ADVERTISEMENT Nunes stirred controversy last week when he revealed that he had seen evidence that the U.S. intelligence community had incidentally collected information on members of Trump's transition team in the months before he took office. Nunes met with an unidentified source on the White House grounds the night before he made his announcement to view evidence of the surveillance. Democrats have since been furious with Nunes for not discussing the matter with the committee before briefing Trump on the information.

The safety-minded Swedish auto supplier could be a dark horse in the emerging self-driving car industry. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Mar 28, 2017 at 4:05PM Self-driving cars are coming. From this vantage point in 2017, it seems likely that the first fully autonomous vehicles will begin to come to market within the next five years.  The first self-driving vehicles will likely be expensive, and most of them will probably be destined for businesses like ride-hailing fleets and delivery companies. But it doesn't take a big leap of imagination to realize that transformative changes are likely once automated vehicles constitute the majority of traffic in developed countries.  As investors, we know that transformative changes bring opportunities. The question is, where are the opportunities to invest in the emerging business of self-driving cars?  Here's one that's worth a close look.  Autoliv: A leader in advanced auto-safety systems Autoliv (NYSE:ALV) is the world's largest supplier of automotive safety systems, with a client list that includes many of the world's major automakers. Its largest customers last year were the  Nissan-Renault alliance, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Honda Motor (NYSE:HMC). It's a big company, with over 70,000 employees in 27 different countries, and it generated a little over $10 billion in revenue in 2016. "Automotive safety systems" might sound like a very broad category, and it is. It includes everything from airbags and seatbelts to advanced products like adaptive cruise control and automatic forward collision braking systems.  Autoliv's Learning Intelligent Vehicle is a research platform that will help the company develop software for autonomous driving. Image source: Autoliv. Obviously, full-blown self-driving systems would be a logical next step for the "advanced" side of Autoliv's business. That insight hasn't escaped Autoliv's management. In fact, Autoliv's current list of advanced active driver-safety systems already includes several important building blocks for self-driving vehicle systems, including: Radar systems that monitor the vehicle's distance from other cars in traffic. Machine vision systems that use camera inputs to recognize road signs, lane markings, and objects (such as pedestrians).  Brake systems that can automatically apply and modulate a vehicle's brakes when needed. Electronic control units that integrate several different safety systems to provide more comprehensive active driver assistance. Autoliv is now taking the natural next step: A full-blown effort to develop a self-driving system -- with a Swedish partner well-known for automotive safety.  A big move into self-driving with Volvo Cars Last year, Autoliv announced a partnership with Swedish Volvo Cars to develop a full self-driving system. It's structured as a 50-50 joint venture called Zenuity, headquartered in Sweden with additional operations in Munich and Detroit. Autoliv put 1.1 billion Swedish krona (about $125 million) into the venture to get it started.  Zenuity is starting with about 200 employees drawn from both companies, and it expects to grow to about 600 "in the medium term," Autoliv said in a recent statement. Those employees have begun working on a Level 4 self-driving system that will be used in Volvo's vehicles, and that Autoliv will have the right to begin marketing to other automakers in about 2021.  (A Level 4 system provides full self-driving capability within a limited set of circumstances. Most Level 4 systems currently under development rely on highly detailed maps and thus only work within mapped areas.) Autoliv's motivation here is clear: Beyond the obvious profit opportunity, it wants to compete with a similar joint venture announced by rival Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH), machine-vision specialist Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY), and chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) last year. That venture has promised to have a Level 4 system available to automakers by the end of 2019.  Until we see the systems, and see how the market shapes up, it's impossible to tell how well the Autoliv-Volvo system will compete with the Delphi-Intel-Mobileye alternative. But it's likely that there will be room for several players in this space, at least in the near term. Autoliv and Volvo are likely to be serious, credible competitors, and the revenue opportunity in this new space could be significant.  Autoliv as an investment Autoliv has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 15.8, not excessive for its category. It pays a forward dividend yield of about 2.4%, supported by a payout ratio of 35.8%. More to the point, it has a long record of careful capital management that should reward patient shareholders no matter how the autonomous vehicle industry shapes up. Long story short: If you're looking for ways beyond the obvious to invest in the coming wave of self-driving vehicles, Autoliv deserves a closer look.    John Rosevear owns shares of Ford.

The state-backed Tsinghua Unigroup, which has been building up the country’s chip-industry infrastructure, received a 150 billion yuan (US$22 billion) in financing on Tuesday. The funds come from the China Development Bank and a national integrated circuit investment fund, two groups tied to the country’s government. Tsinghua Unigroup hasn’t said what the money will be specifically used for. But it will go toward making it more competitive in the semiconductor space, according to a company statement. Tsinghua Unigroup has lately been on a spending spree. It’s investing $30 billion in a new foundry in Nanjing, China, to produce NAND flash and DRAM chips. In addition, the company has been eyeing investment and acquisition deals with U.S. companies such as Micron Technology and Western Digital, both of which failed to pan out due to U.S. regulatory concerns. China has been trying to wean itself off foreign chip makers, at a time when Intel and Qualcomm have been major players in the country’s market. However, these ambitions are starting to worry the U.S. In January, a report from the outgoing Obama administration warned that China was encroaching on the U.S. semiconductor market with its state-backed policies. One concern is that Chinese subsidies will drive down chip prices, eroding U.S. market share. For now, China’s semiconductor industry is still a generation or two behind the leading producers, according to the U.S. report. However, Tsinghua Unigroup, which is majority owned by a Chinese state company, already claims it’s emerging as a leader in mobile chip production. It owns Spreadtrum Communications, which makes smartphone processors, and RDA Microelectronics, which develops cellular technologies. Tsinghua Unigroup said on Tuesday it's focused on making a breakthrough in China's indigenous chip technology production. The Chinese government has also said it's aiming to become a chip-making powerhouse by 2030. To do so, the country plans on spending $150 billion on its chip industry over the next decade. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Nevertheless, She Persisted by Nancy LeTourneau March 28, 2017 2:40 PM Political Animal Blog U.S. Dept of Labor Donate Subscribe Share Tweet Print Email The words that sparked the resistance movement to rally in support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren when McConnell tried to silence her now apply to Sally Yates. If you remember, she is the woman who served as the Deputy Attorney General in the Obama administration and was initially asked to stay on as the Acting Attorney General for Trump until he fired her for refusing to defend his travel ban. Prior to her firing, she warned the White House that the statements made by Michael Flynn about his contacts with the Russian Ambassador were not true and could potentially be used as blackmail against him, a warning that the White House chose to ignore until the information became public and Flynn was fired. Yates was planning to testify about her knowledge of some of these events to the House Intelligence Committee that is currently chaired by Rep. Devin Nunes. But apparently the White House has been attempting to stop her from doing so. According to letters The Post reviewed, the Justice Department notified Yates earlier this month that the administration considers a great deal of her possible testimony to be barred from discussion in a congressional hearing because the topics are covered by the presidential communication privilege. Jeremy Bash, former Chief of Staff at DOD and the CIA during the Obama administration, had previously suggested that she might have some important information to share with the committee. Interesting—Jeremy Bash implies Sally Yates had revelations for House Intel about when she told WH that Flynn lied. Nunes nixed the hearing. pic.twitter.com/vKCd1jdoc5 — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 28, 2017 As he stated, Nunes cancelled the hearing. Today we learned that happened on the same day that Yates’ lawyer responded to the attempts by the White House to silence her. Yates’ lawyer then sent a letter Friday to the White House lawyer, McGahn, saying that any claim of privilege “has been waived as a result of the multiple public comments of current senior White House officials describing the January 2017 communications. Nevertheless, I am advising the White House of Ms. Yates’ intention to provide information.’’ That same day, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, announced he would not go forward with the public hearing that was to feature Yates’ testimony. One of the cliches to emerge from the Watergate scandal was, “It’s not the crime, it’s the cover-up.” With the recent activities of Rep. Nunes and now this, it is increasingly looking like the White House is engaged in a cover-up. Regardless of what evidence is available for the probe into whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, they are sure acting like they have something to hide. We don’t know how important Yates’ testimony will be. But obviously she is determined to persist, even after being warned. So if or when she is able to testify in an open hearing, the White House just ensured that it will be considered yuuuuuge.

By: Gizbot Bureau Updated: Monday, January 16, 2017, 16:38 [IST] HP Inc. today introduced the world's first mini workstation in India designed for users in Computer Aided Design (CAD) and other compute-intensive industries. The stylish, new P HZ2 Mini Workstation is expected to deliver breakthrough power and versatility and at only 2.3-inches high, the new workstation is 90 percent smaller than a traditional business-class tower. With this new offering, HP is positioned to extend its workstation leadership by delivering a new category of workstations that offers superb performance, elegance, and efficiency. Building off the success of the HP Z240 SFF, the HP Z2 Mini Workstation is supposedly twice as powerful as any commercial mini PC on the market today and is deemed to have the ability to support six displays right out of the box. The HP Z2 Mini has been designed for the millions of CAD users demanding smaller hardware without compromising acoustics and performance and mission-critical reliability. SEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy J7 (2017) will come with Android Nougat "Today designers want sleek, innovative and powerful workstations that enable new experiences. Designed for the workspace of the future, HP Z2 Mini Workstation is remarkably versatile and it showcases next level power by offering twice the power of a business-class mini PC, a key for designers. It is the result of HP engineers and designers reinventing the concept of a workstation by rethinking its shape, size and look while adding functionality to enable new use case." said Ketan Patel, Senior Director - Personal Systems Business, HP Inc. India. "When designing some of the most technically complex architectural forms the need for cutting-edge technology is essential," said Daniel Libeskind, a world-renowned architect and founder of Studio Libeskind. "The speed in which we create, and the complexity of projects have become more intense over the years, but computers like HP Workstations are helping quickly bring the visions of my designers to life." Shorter than a cup of espresso, the new HP Z2 Mini Workstation is capable of designing anything from state-of-the-art electronics to home and office buildings. The workstation, will run Windows 10 Pro or Linux and comes equipped with next generation Intel® Xeon® processors, NVIDIA® professional graphics and there's an availability of HP Z Turbo Drive for handling large files remarkably fast. SEE ALSO: Andy Rubin's smartphone with Snapdragon 835 SoC appears on benchmark listing "The HP Z2 Mini, the world's first mini workstation, delivers breakthrough power and versatility in a small, iconic design," said Jeff Wood, vice president and general manager, Workstations and Thin Clients, HP Inc. "HP redefined the workstation in 2009 with the introduction of the HP Z series, and now once again is disrupting the category with the new HP Z2 Mini Workstation - the ultimate combination of space efficiency and power for our customers and partners." The HP Z2 Mini has been designed considering how workplaces have become more space constrained and that there's a greater business need for the smaller workstations. HP's new ultra-compact and aesthetically pleasing workstation will provide users with numerous versatility options: on/under the desk, behind an HP Z display, or on a wall. AS such, the HP Z2 Mini's design and engineering ingenuity could transform the way people think about workstations and workspaces. HP Z2 Mini Workstation will be available in India from January 25th onwards at a starting price of INR 72,000/-. -Press Release Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Lenovo P2 Huawei Honor 6X 16,999 Specs Extert Review Competitors Images 12,999 Specs Extert Review Competitors Images Gallery   |   10 Photos Lenovo P2 +See All Read More About hp | computers | pcs | laptops | news Story first published: Monday, January 16, 2017, 16:15 [IST] Other articles published on Jan 16, 2017 Please Wait while comments are loading...

The House Intelligence Committee chair was a speaker at an event for public figures and officials held at Donald Trump's hotel in Washington, D.C. 0 CLAIM Did House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes meet with Michael Flynn and the Turkish foreign minister? unproven RATING unproven ORIGIN On 25 March 2017, liberal blogs (including the Palmer Report) posted reports that Rep. Devin Nunes, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, had previously met with the Turkish foreign minister and soon-to-be (now former) National Security Advisor Michael Flynn: It’s not publicly known what was discussed during the Flynn-Nunes-Turkey meeting on January 18th. But confirmation of the meeting has been hiding in plain sight all along. Earlier today respected political pundit T. R. Ramachandran posted a lengthy tweet storm (link) which included a reference to a previously overlooked article from Turkish news publication Daily Sabah (link). The article reports that “[Turkish] Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu met with designated U.S. National Security adviser Rt. Gen. Mike Flynn on Wednesday at Trump Hotel in Washington” and goes on to add that “House Intelligence Committee Congressman Devin Nunes, a Republican heavyweight, also attended the breakfast.” Nunes and Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu both attended a “working breakfast” on 18 January 2017 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. but we found no evidence the two held a private meeting that included Michael Flynn (who served as the first National Security Advisor for the incoming Trump administration but resigned less than a month later after information surfaced indicating he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature and content of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.). Nunes’ spokesman Jack Langer told us in an e-mail that Nunes was one of dozens of guests at a large event, not a part of a small and private meeting: Chairman Nunes was a speaker at that event, but it was a large breakfast event, not a small, private meeting as described in that article. Mr. Cavusoglu was one of about 40 attendees at the event, which included 20-30 ambassadors to the U.S. and about 10 other foreign dignitaries and officials. The attendees heard some remarks from Flynn, Chairman Nunes, and other representatives on national security issues — the discussion topic was not Turkey or any other single country … if [Nunes did speak to Cavusoglu], it would’ve been among all the other ambassadors and officials at the event. There was no separate, private meeting. The information that Nunes was at the event also attended by Cavusoglu seems to have initially been reported by the Daily Sabah, a Turkish publication which offers content in several languages (including English). Their article likewise said that Nunes attended the breakfast but didn’t mention anything about his having met with Cavusoglu: Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu met with designated U.S. National Security adviser Rt. Gen. Mike Flynn at Trump Hotel in Washington. “Met with General Flynn, who will assume the position of National Security Advisor, and other officials at a working breakfast in Washington D.C.,” Çavuşoğlu tweeted. The meeting marks a first direct reachout between the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan administration and the incoming Donald Trump administration, other than a phone call between two leaders last November. House Intelligence Committee Congressman Devin Nunes, a Republican heavyweight, also attended the breakfast. The Daily Sabah seemingly contradicted Langer by reporting that Cavusoglu “was the only foreign leader at the breakfast and the topics on the U.S.-Turkish agenda were discussed by the attendees,” but the newspaper is often described as publishing “pro-government” content and propaganda. The notion that Nunes “met” with the Turkish foreign minister could be controversial if true, because Flynn was forced to register with the Department of Justice as a foreign agent following revelations that his firm, Flynn Intel Group, was paid $530,000 for lobbying work that may have aided the Turkish government. Former CIA chief James Woolsey told the Wall Street Journal that at a separate meeting he attended in the summer of 2016 between Flynn and Cavusoglu, the topic of discussion was a potentially illegal act: abducting Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen and delivering him to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan suspects Gulen of orchestrating a failed coup in 2016 and wants the U.S. government to extradite him to Turkey, as Gulen is a green card holder who lives in Pennsylvania. Woolsey told the Journal that the request to abduct Gulen “seemed to be naive,” adding: “I didn’t put a lot of credibility in it. This is a country of legal process and a Constitution, and you don’t send out folks to haul somebody overseas.” During the week of President Trump’s 20 January 2017 inauguration, Cavusoglu posted several tweets with pictures of him meeting and greeting various American public officials, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker: Met w/Speaker of the House of Representatives Ryan, the new Defense Secretary Mattis and Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin in Washington D.C. pic.twitter.com/QZNWZOJhVA — Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu (@MevlutCavusoglu) January 20, 2017 Müstakbel Ulusal Güvenlik Danışmanı General Flynn ve Winsconsin Valisi Scott Walker’la. pic.twitter.com/5QUoJDzCtF — Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu (@MevlutCavusoglu) January 19, 2017 The meetings between Flynn and Turkish government officials have no doubt been tainted by Flynn’s lobbying activity and an ongoing investigation into his alleged activities on behalf of foreign governments (vis-a-vis his short-lived role as a high-ranking intelligence official with the Trump administration). But we found no evidence supporting the claim that Nunes went alongside Flynn for a discussion on the specific topic of Turkish-U.S. relations with Cavusoglu. The Turkish foreign minister attended an event that Nunes also attended, and the two may have had informal exchanges, but substantive proof that Nunes took part in a secret and private meeting with him is so far lacking.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general, will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about Russian interference in the election. The Obama appointee was blocked from testifying before the House Intelligence Committee after its chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), canceled this week’s hearings, where Yates had been scheduled to appear. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the committee’s vice chairman, told CNN that Yates would testify before a Senate panel even if she did not appear before the House committee. Sen Warner says no invite yet, but "It's obviously my intent that Sally Yates would be one of the people (that testifies before Sen Intel)" — Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) March 28, 2017 The White House reportedly tried to block Yates from testifying after her attorney notified the Trump administration she would discuss her concerns about former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Nunes abruptly canceled this week’s House Intelligence Committee hearings hours after Yates notified the White House through her attorney about her intention to testify about Flynn, who resigned after lying to the vice president about his contact with the Russian ambassador. Yates was fired for refusing to defend President Donald Trump’s travel ban, just days after bringing her concerns about Flynn to White House officials.

Louie Gohmert to investigate John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s election campaign chairman, for his ties to Russia. Gohmert has questioned Podesta’s 2011 role in an investment fund with ties to the Russia government. Former President Bill Clinton received $500,000 in 2010 from a Russian finance corporation called Renaissance Capital, one of many detailed in Peter Schweizer’s book “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.” The latest tweets come after the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, has come under fire for his handling of the investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign during the election. Late Monday, his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Adam Schiff, took the nearly unprecedented step of calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the probe. Members of the House Intel Committee typically avoid partisan politics, but Nunes raised eyebrows when he shared new details of the investigation — specifically that Trump associated may have been surveilled — with the White House and the press before sharing them with his colleagues on the committee. Nunes revealed on Monday that he reviewed sensitive files while on White House grounds. https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/03/27/trump-calls-for-investigation-into-hillary-clinton-russia-connection/22014433/ Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

This list recognizes the most strategically positioned private companies within the Internet security, communications infrastructure and storage industries. JMP Securities included companies in its list that it believes have demonstrated agility to iterate new products and respond to changing technology dynamics, which position companies, like Big Switch, well to take share from market incumbents in the long-term. According to JMP, network requirements are continually evolving, driven by several IT trends, including the migration toward cloud and the need for IT to increase agility and responsiveness to business requirements. JMP Securities believes networks are shifting toward more open and programmable solutions with a broader trend toward subscription pricing models and new architectures, like those offered by Big Switch Networks, that simplify deployment and operations. Additionally, JMP Securities believes companies included in this year's list possess a strong operational foundation and sustainable technological differentiation and it believes the Super 60 are disrupting the technology titans that dominate the traditional landscape, but lack the vision, agility or perseverance to adapt to market trends, resulting in the Super 60 companies being better positioned than ever to dominate global markets in the long-term. "We are honored to be included in JMP Securities' Super 60 list for the third consecutive year, particularly as JMP has recognized the demand by end-users for subscription pricing models and new architectures to simplify operations," said Douglas Murray, CEO, Big Switch Networks. "I'm incredibly proud of our team, who continue to execute on our promise of innovation velocity to disrupt the status quo of networking." Organizations around the world continue to select Big Switch for data center modernization, evidenced by a customer count that more than doubled in 2016 and a rapidly expanding geographical footprint. In Q4 2016 Big Switch established a dedicated presence in EMEA region and in Q3 2016 into China and ANZ regions. In the latest quarter, the company saw more than 100 transactions across 50 of its customers and has more than 10 customers who have purchased $1M+ in recurring software licenses. Customers are located in more than 25 countries, industry verticals include technology, financial services, government, media, telecom and higher education. Big Switch has raised $94M in funding from investors who include: Index Ventures, Silver Lake Waterman, Khosla Ventures, Morgenthaler Ventures, Intel Capital, Greylock Partners, Redpoint, TriplePoint Ventures and more.

As you can see from the image above, there are two different sizes: a full-size tower and a small form factor (SFF) model. Unlike some other VR-ready machines that are geared toward gaming, the ThinkStation P320 is focused on virtual reality being used in design and engineering, as the company thinks that VR will become a "key technology" for those areas in the coming years. Virtualis, a "world-leading VR and advanced visualization company", has already been using the P320 with its VR4CAD software, saying "The ThinkStation P320’s ProVR certification, along with its performance credentials, makes it a perfect match for the Virtalis VR4CAD software. It delivers a superb balance of 3D CAD and VR performance without breaking the bank." As far as processors go, you can choose between Intel's seventh-generation Core i3, i5, and i7 chips, or you can go for the Xeon E3-1200 v6. The SFF model will support dual NVIDIA Quadro P1000 GPUs, and the tower can pack an Nvidia Quadro P4000. RAM and storage options are pretty standard for a desktop, with up to 64GB 2400MHz ECC UDIMM DDR4 memory, and up to 4TB HDD or 2TB SSD. Your choice of operating systems include Ubuntu and RHEL Linux, Windows 7 Pro, and Windows 10 Pro. Note that the option for Windows 7 is interesting, as Microsoft stopped selling licenses for the OS to OEMs on October 31, 2016. We still don't know the pricing of the ThinkStation P320, but they'll be available at the end of April. You can learn more here.
