Matthew Heller April 7, 2017 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* In the second insider trading case arising from the $15.3 billion takeover of Mobileye NV by Intel, two Virginia men have been charged with making $925,000 in illicit profits based on nonpublic information about the pending deal. The U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission accused Lawrence Cluff and Roger Shaoul of “highly suspicious” transactions, alleging they acquired Mobileye shares and call options after the adult children of two Mobileye founders told Shaoul’s adult children, with whom they were friends, about Intel’s interest in the maker of sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles. Recommended Stories: Two CFOs Tell a Tale of Fraud at HealthSouth Former EY Auditor Charged With Insider Trading Former iPayment Execs Charged With $11M Fraud After the takeover was announced on March 13, Mobileye shares rose 28.2% in one day. The charges filed Wednesday against Cluff and Shaoul came nearly two weeks after the SEC brought a similar case against two Israeli residents, Ariel Darvasi and Amir Waldman, who allegedly generated more than $4.9 million in gains by trading illegally in Mobileye stock. According to the SEC, the defendants in both cases were connected to Mobileye through the academic community at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which developed Mobileye technology and where Shaoul, an Israeli citizen, had studied. The SEC said Cluff and Shaoul traded in two accounts held in Cluff’s name, including one that had been dormant for six years and one opened on Jan. 29, 2017, around the time Mobileye and Intel began formal merger talks. On Feb. 1, Cluff allegedly used the new account to acquire 3,782 Mobileye shares at a cost of nearly $161,500. By March 10 — the last trading day before the announcement of the takeover — the account held 3,414 Mobileye shares and 1,209 call options with strike prices between $50 and $55, the SEC said. Mobileye shares closed at $47.27 on March 10. After the announcement of Intel’s $63.54-per-share-offer, Cluff allegedly sold 862 Mobileye call options for proceeds of $617,563 and, according to the SEC, his accounts have unrealized gains of approximately $335,000. The SEC has obtained a court order freezing assets of Cluff and Shaoul.

Twitter Facebook Raspberry Pi 3 gets Microsoft Cortana with Windows 10 Creators Update Users will now be able to make cool devices with Cortana built in Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 11 April, 2017 06:49 - - - - print email Comments You will very soon be able to use Microsoft's Cortana voice assistant with the Raspberry Pi 3 and make cool devices that can accept voice commands. But for that, you'll need to upgrade the popular developer board, which can run Windows 10 IoT Core, to the Creators Update of the OS. You'll be able to use Cortana on Raspberry Pi similar to the way it works on PCs. You'll be able to ask for weather, time, traffic, or stock prices. Users will also able to build smart devices using Raspberry Pi 3 that will be able to accept Cortana's commands. But the devices will need to be based on Windows 10 IoT Core, not Linux-based OSes. Customized commands can be programmed for devices and could be related to reminders, look-ups, mapping, events, news, dictionary, and other "skills." Microsoft mentions one Cortana functionality called "chit chat," which could refer to chatbots. That's a direct attack on Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant voice assistant technologies, which are being programmed into more smart devices. Many enthusiasts are developing smart devices but can't slip in personal assistant features. Microsoft is making that much easier with the Creators Update to Windows 10 IoT Core. Microsoft is pursuing an aggressive smart home strategy via Cortana, and the addition of the personal assistant to Windows 10 IoT Core could be a big piece in the strategy. Outside Raspberry Pi 3, Microsoft's Windows IoT Core also works with other boards and computers. Creators Update adds support for Intel's Compute Sticks and also base support for Intel chips code-named Apollo Lake. The OS already supports boards like Intel's Joule and MinnowBoard. But board enthusiasts will need to take some considerations into account if they want to use Cortana with the Windows 10 IoT Core developer boards. Cortana needs microphones and speakers, and the options there are limited. The Creators Update supports only Logitech's S150 USB speakers, and the microphone options include Microsoft LifeCam HD 3000, Sound Tech CM-1000USB Table Top Conference Meeting Microphone, and Blue Microphones Snowball iCE Condenser Microphone/Cardioid. Other improvements with Creators Update include support for more Adafruit peripherals that are widely used to make smart devices. Additionally, the OS adds supports for autodiscovery of smart devices in which you are logged in, which was considered an issue earlier. This change is likely due to the integration of IoTivity IoT protocols from Open Connectivity Foundation, which helps establish secure connections between IoT devices. The OS adds supports for new ARM PCI bus interconnects. Many low-power smart devices with Windows IoT Core use ARM CPUs but don't use the PCI interconnect, which is used in PCs. This is a feature aimed more at high-powered developer boards that don't operate on battery. You will need to flash Creators Update on the developer boards using the Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard. You will need to provide special permission to activate Cortana, much like when setting up Windows 10 desktop on PCs. Creators Update will roll out starting on Tuesday. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Search Reviews iPhone Android How To Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] 5 Best Chromebooks for 2017 Kevin Purcell04/08/2017 The Chromebook comes of age in 2017 thanks to some beautiful hardware designs and the Android apps available on every Chromebook released this year. We’ve got our list of the five best Chromebooks for 2017 so far. Google surprised the Chromebook market when they quit selling their high-end Chromebook Pixel last year. Fans who want a Chromebook with some high-end hardware had to pick one up on the second-hand market or look elsewhere. Now, in 2017, they have some options that compare favorably to the Chromebook Pixel, but don’t cost nearly as much. Samsung Chromebook Plus and Samsung Chromebook Pro We’re counting these two Chromebooks as one because they resemble each other in every way except for two key details. First, there’s the name difference. Second, the Pro uses an Intel Core m3 processor while the Plus has Samsung’s ARM processor. That makes the Pro faster than the Plus, but it also reduces battery life a little from about 12 hours on the Plus to closer to 9 hours for the Pro. These features add up to make the new Samsung Chromebooks two of the best Chromebooks for 2017. The Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro comes in a beautiful aluminum chassis with a 12.3-inch screen that’s beautifully bright and sharp. It has a 2400 x 1600 resolution and a 3:2 aspect ratio. The aspect ratio makes it a great choice for use as a tablet with the Chromebooks’ convertible design. The system runs at an effective resolution of 1200 x 800 thanks to the scaling handled by ChromeOS, but users can make full use of the higher level if they want. However, text will appear microscopic in many cases. Samsung sets their newest Chromebook apart from the others by giving it the S Pen stylus that used to only come on the Samsung Galaxy Note smart phones and tablets. This makes it the best choice for students, business people, and artists. Students and business people can use it to take notes or draw diagrams while artists can sketch or paint with it. The stereo speakers face down and do not produce as much sound, which becomes a problem in loud rooms. Other key specs include the following: Processor: Hexa-core Dual ARM Cortex A72 or Quad Cortex A52 for Plus and Intel Core m3 for Pro Display: 12.3-inch 2400 x 1600 resolution, touchscreen with active stylus S-Pen feature and 3:2 aspect ratio Memory: 4GB Storage: 32GB eMMC flash storage Graphics: Integrated Sound and Camera: Built-in stereo speakers and 720 webcam, internal mic and a combo audio port Wireless: 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 Ports: 2 USB-C ports, 1 combo audio port, micro-SD card slot Input: S-Pen, Touchscreen, Keyboard and Trackpad Battery Life: Up to 12 hours for Plus and up to 9 hours for Pro Get the Samsung Chromebook Plus now for $449.99 direct from Samsung. The Samsung Chromebook Pro becomes available in April 2017. HP Chromebook 13 HP brings us another high-end Chromebook costing just over $500.  The HP Chromebook 13 with its beautiful brushed aluminum design is slightly larger than the Samsung above at 13-inches. It adds something that aficionados of the best Chromebooks miss in the Samsung, a backlit keyboard. The 13-inch screen doesn’t fold back to use in tablet mode like the others, but it does sport an amazing 3200 x 1800 resolution in even the least expensive version. That’s going to give users some amazingly sharp text and images. Some lower priced models will only ship with a 1920 x 108o, however. HP threw in an Intel Core m7 processor in the high-end model and 16GB of memory for over-the-top performance. The price also jumps to nearly $2000 making the old Chromebook Pixel look like a bargain. Don’t worry, because the models that cost between $500-$700 will run fast, too. You’ll also enjoy a long battery life at over 11 hours (advertised). Check out the rest of the specs below: Processor: Intel Pentium up to and Intel Core m7 processor Memory: 4GB up to 16GB Storage: 32GB eMMC flash storage Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 Ports: 2 USB-C ports, 1 USB 3.1 port, 1 SD-card slot, and 1 combo audio port Audio and Camera: stereo speakers and HD TrueVision Camera Input: Keyboard and Trackpad Acer Chromebook 14 The Acer Chromebook 14 offers one of the best Chromebooks for people on a budget who still want a larger machine. This one costs just $263.99 at CDW and under $300 at the other online stores we checked. In addition to a low price, it also sports a beautiful brushed aluminum design with a nice 14-inch IPS display. Acer advertises this Chromebook’s durability as a primary feature. That makes it a good choice for the road warrior or her child. Thanks to the 12 hours of advertised battery life, the Acer Chromebook 14 should last long enough to get through the day for either of them. The base model ships with an Intel Celeron N3060 dual-core processor, 4GB of RAM and only 16GB of storage. The screen resolution comes in at 1280 x 720, a bit low for a 14-inch display. The keyboard and trackpad should give any touch typist plenty of room. Instead of going with the lower priced model, choose the one with the higher full 1080p resolution screen, faster Intel Celeron 3160 dual-core processor and 32GB of storage. You can find it at Best Buy for only $27 more. You can also head over to Amazon and find it in Gold or Silver for under $300.   Detailed specs on the Acer Chromebook 14: Intel Celeron processors with 3060 or 3160 dual-core available 4GB of RAM 16 or 32GB of storage 14-inch IPS display with resolution of 1280 x 720 or 1920 x 1080 powered by Intel HD Graphics 400 3.42lbs and .7-inches thin, 13.4-inches wide and 9.3-inches deep Bluetooth 4.2 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi HDMI out, headphone mic combo port, 2 USB 3.0 ports 12-hour 3-cell battery ASUS Chromebook Flip C302A Acer updated their popular ASUC Chromebook Flip this year bring us the ASUS Chromebook Flip C302A. It’s a $500 convertible touchscreen device that works well as an Android tablet and a Chromebook laptop for those who don’t mind a tiny screen and keyboard. It has a nice 12.5-inch touchscreen with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. The screen folds back almost 360 degrees to give users a tablet they can hold in their hands. It also functions in tent mode or stand mode for viewing content on the screen. The larger screen, compared to the earlier model, works better in laptop mode. It’s a big improvement over the old one, which felt too small for adults to type on or even view content. ASUS also improved the keyboard. It works better and feels better to type on compared to last year’s Flip. They also gave it a backlight. Detailed specs list: Intel Core M 6Y30, 6Y75 or Pentium 4405Y processors 4 or 8GB of RAM 32, 64 or 128GB of RAM 12.5-inch touchscreen with 1920 x 1080 resolution Backlit chiclet style keyboard 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 2 USB-C ports, 1 micro-SD card slot and 1 audio combo port 2-cell battery with up to 10 hours of life HD webcam 1.2lbs and 304x210x13.7cm dimensions Dell Chromebook 11 (3189 Education 2-in-1) Dell makes the Dell Chromebook 11 3189 model for the education market, but it’s a great option for home users as well. The convertible 2-in-1 design means it behaves as a nice ultra-portable laptop and converts to a tablet when you fold the screen back nearly 360 degrees. 1 – Combo audio port, 2 – Noble Wedge Lock slot, 3 – Activity Light, 4 – AC Power, 5 – USB Card Reader, 6 – HDMI, 7 – USB 3.1 ports The base model, $349 Dell Chromebook 11, has an 11.6-inch touchscreen display with a 1366 x 768 resolution. The screen is made with Corning Gorilla Glass for durability. Dell ships with an Intel Celeron N3060 processor, 4GB of RAM and 16, 32 or 64GB of storage. The jumps in storage add $20 or $60 to the base price.

Mike Lee (R-Utah) WHAT WE KNOW TO BE FACTS: On 4 April 2017, the town of Khan Shaykhun in Syria’s Idlib province, was struck by a heavy airstrike followed by massive civilian chemical (sarin nerve gas) poisoning, including children. At the time of the attack the town was under the control of Tahrir al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Nusra Front — a Sunni Islamist terrorist organization fighting against Syrian Government forces in the Syrian Civil War, with the aim of establishing an Islamist state in the country. President Donald Trump, the U.S. Pentagon, and the UK (in the person of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson) blamed the attack on the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The Russian and Syrian governments said it was caused by the Syrian Air Force’s destruction of a nearby rebel-operated chemical weapons warehouse. In the early morning hours of April 7, 2017, the Trump administration fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from a U.S. destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea, at Shayrat Air Base in Syria,said to be the location from where the Assad government allegedly had launched the April 4 chemical attack. A couple of points to keep in mind: At the time of the alleged chemical attack, things were going well for the Assad government in its efforts to combat the Syrian “rebels,” among whom is the al-Nusra Front. In other words, there was no reason for the Assad government to launch a chemical attack against the “rebels”. From 2013, when Obama and Congress had agitated to attack the Syrian government because of the latter’s alleged deployment of chemical weapons, Assad knows well the U.S. would go berserk if he were to launch a chemical attack. Two former U.S. intelligence officials are speaking out about what they know and believe about the April 4 “chemical attack” on the town in Idlib. They are: Walter Patrick “Pat” Lang, Jr., 76, a former U.S. Army officer who left the army with the rank of Colonel, then worked as a high-level civilian intelligence analyst in the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) at the equivalent rank of a lieutenant general, specializing in the Middle East and South Asia. Lang is now a commentator on the Middle East, private intelligence analyst, and author. Ray McGovern, a retired CIA analyst from the administration of John Kennedy to that of George H.W. Bush, and prepared the President’s Daily Brief for Nixon, Ford, and Reagan. He is a member of the Steering Group of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS). Both Lang and McGovern maintain that: On April 4, the Assad government undertook a conventional (not chemical) air strike at a rebel-held weapons/explosives depot in Idlib. The Assad government had notified the Trump administration of its intended strike. Unbeknown to the Assad government, the weapons depot contained deadly chemicals — of organic phosphates and chlorine (not sarin). The explosion of the depot released the chemicals into the air, which was carried by a strong wind to a nearby town, Khan Shaykhun, and killed civilians. Below are the respective analyses of Lang and McGovern, originally published on Intel Today, a website that is less than a year old, founded last July. My guess is Intel Today is a forum of retired and/or active “white hats” U.S. intelligence officials. ANALYSIS BY FORMER DIA INTELLIGENCE ANALYST COL. PATRICK LANG Donald Trump’s decision to launch cruise missile strikes on a Syrian Air Force Base was based on a lie. In the coming days the American people will learn that the Intelligence Community knew that Syria did not drop a military chemical weapon on innocent civilians in Idlib. Here is what happened. The Russians briefed the United States on the proposed target. This is a process that started more than two months ago. There is a dedicated phone line that is being used to coordinate and deconflict (i.e., prevent US and Russian air assets from shooting at each other) the upcoming operation. The United States was fully briefed on the fact that there was a target in Idlib that the Russians believed was a weapons/explosives depot for Islamic rebels. The Syrian Air Force hit the target with conventional weapons. All involved expected to see a massive secondary explosion. That did not happen. Instead, smoke, chemical smoke, began billowing from the site. It turns out that the Islamic rebels used that site to store chemicals, not sarin, that were deadly. The chemicals included organic phosphates and chlorine and they followed the wind and killed civilians. There was a strong wind blowing that day and the cloud was driven to a nearby village and caused casualties. We know it was not sarin. How? Very simple. The so-called “first responders” handled the victims without gloves. If this had been sarin they would have died. Sarin on the skin will kill you. How do I know? I went through “Live Agent” training at Fort McClellan in Alabama. There are members of the U.S. military who were aware this strike would occur and it was recorded. There is a film record. At least the Defense Intelligence Agency knows that this was not a chemical weapon attack. In fact, Syrian military chemical weapons were destroyed with the help of Russia. This is Gulf of Tonkin 2. How ironic. Donald Trump correctly castigated George W. Bush for launching an unprovoked, unjustified attack on Iraq in 2003. Now we have President Donald Trump doing the same damn thing. Worse in fact. Because the intelligence community had information showing that there was no chemical weapon launched by the Syrian Air Force. Here’s the good news. The Russians and Syrians were informed, or at least were aware, that the attack was coming. They were able to remove a large number of their assets. The base the United States hit was something of a backwater. Donald Trump gets to pretend that he is a tough guy. He is not. He is a fool. This attack was violation of international law. Donald Trump authorized an unjustified attack on a sovereign country. What is even more disturbing is that people like Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, CIA Director Mike Pompeo and NSA Director General McMaster went along with this charade. Front line troops know the truth. These facts will eventually come out. Donald Trump will most likely not finish his term as President. He will be impeached, I believe, once Congress is presented with irrefutable proof that he ignored and rejected intelligence that did not support the myth that Syria attacked with chemical weapons. It should also alarm American taxpayers that we launched $100 million dollars [Note: the cost is more likely $114.5 million, based on the per-unit cost of Tomahawk cruise missile] of missiles to blow up sand and camel shit. The Russians were aware that a strike was coming. I’m hoping that they and the Syrians withdrew their forces and aircraft from the base. Whatever hope I had that Donald Trump would be a new kind of President, that hope is extinguished. He is a child and a moron. He committed an act of war without justification. But the fault is not his alone. Those who sit atop the NSC, the DOD, the CIA, the Department of State should have resigned in protest. They did not. They are complicit in a war crime. ANALYSIS BY FORMER CIA AGENT RAY MCGOVERN Syrian aircraft ‘knew’ there was a weapons cache in this particular rebel-held area.  That was correct, and the Syrian aircraft bombed it. What seems not to have been known was the existence nearby of a large storage facility for chemicals.  That too was damaged, releasing a cloud of chemicals that the wind blew south and poisoned those villagers.

But for that, you'll need to upgrade the popular developer board, which can run Windows 10 IoT Core, to the Creators Update of the OS. You'll be able to use Cortana on Raspberry Pi similar to the way it works on PCs. You'll be able to ask for weather, time, traffic, or stock prices. Users will also able to build smart devices using Raspberry Pi 3 that will be able to accept Cortana's commands. But the devices will need to be based on Windows 10 IoT Core, not Linux-based OSes. Customized commands can be programmed for devices and could be related to reminders, look-ups, mapping, events, news, dictionary, and other "skills." Microsoft mentions one Cortana functionality called "chit chat," which could refer to chatbots. That's a direct attack on Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant voice assistant technologies, which are being programmed into more smart devices. Many enthusiasts are developing smart devices but can't slip in personal assistant features. Microsoft is making that much easier with the Creators Update to Windows 10 IoT Core. Microsoft is pursuing an aggressive smart home strategy via Cortana, and the addition of the personal assistant to Windows 10 IoT Core could be a big piece in the strategy. Outside Raspberry Pi 3, Microsoft's Windows IoT Core also works with other boards and computers. Creators Update adds support for Intel's Compute Sticks and also base support for Intel chips code-named Apollo Lake. The OS already supports boards like Intel's Joule and MinnowBoard. But board enthusiasts will need to take some considerations into account if they want to use Cortana with the Windows 10 IoT Core developer boards. Cortana needs microphones and speakers, and the options there are limited. The Creators Update supports only Logitech's S150 USB speakers, and the microphone options include Microsoft LifeCam HD 3000, Sound Tech CM-1000USB Table Top Conference Meeting Microphone, and Blue Microphones Snowball iCE Condenser Microphone/Cardioid. Other improvements with Creators Update include support for more Adafruit peripherals that are widely used to make smart devices. Additionally, the OS adds supports for autodiscovery of smart devices in which you are logged in, which was considered an issue earlier. This change is likely due to the integration of IoTivity IoT protocols from Open Connectivity Foundation, which helps establish secure connections between IoT devices. The OS adds supports for new ARM PCI bus interconnects. Many low-power smart devices with Windows IoT Core use ARM CPUs but don't use the PCI interconnect, which is used in PCs. This is a feature aimed more at high-powered developer boards that don't operate on battery. You will need to flash Creators Update on the developer boards using the Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard. You will need to provide special permission to activate Cortana, much like when setting up Windows 10 desktop on PCs. Creators Update will roll out starting on Tuesday.

(AP) — The Intel plant in Rio Rancho continues to shed jobs. According to the company's latest annual report to the Sandoval County Commission released Monday, the number of full-time workers directly employed by Intel Corp. at its Rio Rancho plant fell by 37 percent in 2016. The plant has gone from 1,900 salaried workers in 2015 to 1,200 as of last December. About half of the 700 employees who departed from Rio Rancho last year were retirements. The Albuquerque Journal reports Intel still employs about 1,000 contract workers, about half of whom are generally on site daily to work on specific projects. The company announced in April 2016 that it planned to lay off about 12,000 people worldwide, or about 11 percent of its global workforce.

Mike Lee (R-Utah) WHAT WE KNOW TO BE FACTS: On 4 April 2017, the town of Khan Shaykhun in Syria’s Idlib province, was struck by a heavy airstrike followed by massive civilian chemical (sarin nerve gas) poisoning, including children. At the time of the attack the town was under the control of Tahrir al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Nusra Front — a Sunni Islamist terrorist organization fighting against Syrian Government forces in the Syrian Civil War, with the aim of establishing an Islamist state in the country. President Donald Trump, the U.S. Pentagon, and the UK (in the person of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson) blamed the attack on the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The Russian and Syrian governments said it was caused by the Syrian Air Force’s destruction of a nearby rebel-operated chemical weapons warehouse. In the early morning hours of April 7, 2017, the Trump administration fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from a U.S. destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea, at Shayrat Air Base in Syria,said to be the location from where the Assad government allegedly had launched the April 4 chemical attack.

Lang is now a commentator on the Middle East, private intelligence analyst, and author. Ray McGovern, a retired CIA analyst from the administration of John Kennedy to that of George H.W. Bush, and prepared the President’s Daily Brief for Nixon, Ford, and Reagan. He is a member of the Steering Group of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS).

That’s why we suggest you take a hard look at your major and make sure that your laptop of choice can accommodate the tasks at hand. Not sure what those are? Speak to your guidance counselor and email your professor. If they’re an invested educator they’ll be happy to provide guidance around this subject matter. After all, the more prepared you are for the class, the easier the job. Our Top Laptops for College Picks Best for a Computer Science Degree Dell XPS 13 The Dell XPS 13 laptop might be on the pricier side, but with that you get ultrabook performance. Price: $942.39 | Read Full Review: Dell XPS 13 Review | Features: InfinityEdge display, touchscreen, Intel i5-6200U 2.3 GHz Processor WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Dell XPS 13 puts portability and power in a punchy, flexible package. A little on the pricier side – though cheaper than the Surface Book – Dell’s XPS13 is entirely worth it, and is truly one of the best laptops for college students in price and tech specs. With a 13.3-inch Full HD Infinity display, 4GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, the XPS 13 is the perfect mix of power and flexibility that college students need from their daily driver. The Dell XPS 13 will be able to keep up with even the most demanding tasks, whether that’s using tools like Photoshop and AutoDesk 3DS Max, or programming software like Android Studio and Eclipse. The Dell XPS 13 is also the perfect entertainment machine. With its 13.3-inch Infinity display, it has one of the sharpest images you’ll see on a portable machine. It’s perfect for the media professional, but also great for watching movies, TV shows, and even doubles as a halfway decent gaming laptop. View on Amazon – $942.39 Best Creative Arts College Laptop Apple Macbook The Macbook first got cool on college campuses, and it still hasn’t lost its edge Price: $1,269.00 | Features: Force Touch trackpad, Retina display, 10hr battery life WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: No other laptop has the same “cool” factor as a new Macbook. Although Apple and its ubiquitous Macbook line of laptops may not be the dominant force among college students these days, the company still knows how to make a solid machine that goes the distance when it comes to software integration and unique hardware tweaks. Apple still makes the Macbook Pro in both 13″ and 15″ flavors, but unless you know you’ll be doing a lot of heavy rendering or running intensive applications, the regular 12″ model should handle nearly any job you can throw at it with ease. The inclusion of the Force Touch mousepad is perfect for students who need to navigate through a lot of content quickly and easily, while OSX continues to be the operating system of choice among departments dedicated to the creative arts. If you have to run OSX for your particular program, or just want a dependable all-around laptop that’s perfect for any kind of project, the Macbook is still king with college students everywhere. View on Amazon – $1,269.00 Best Durable College Laptop HP Stream 13 The HP Stream 13 is a low-end laptop, intended for basic tasks like paper writing and spreadsheet construction. Price: $219.00 | Features: Durable shell, 32GB of SSD storage, one-year subscription to Office 365 WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The HP Stream 13 wins on its raw ability to take a punch. If there’s one thing parents know about their kids, it’s how clumsy they can be when it comes to keeping their technology in one piece. The HP Stream is definitely the most durable (and colorful) laptop on this list, available in Cobalt Blue, Orchid Magenta, Violet Purple, and Horizon Blue. With a 13.3-inch display, an Intel Celeron N3050, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of SSD storage, the Stream 13 is decidedly low-end, making it one of the cheapest laptops for college on our list. But what makes the HP Stream 13 one of the best laptops for college students? It’s ultra portability and the fact that it comes with a free year of Office 365, something that costs almost as much as the laptop itself. View on Amazon – $219.00 Best for Design/Photoshop Microsoft Surface Book The Microsoft Surface Book is our #1 laptop for college pick. Price: $1,399.99  | Features: Convertible design, touchscreen, 13.5″ display WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: If you’re in creative design, the Surface Book loves to get drawn on. With Microsoft’s Surface Book, you’re in for a treat. Fast, portable, and easy to set up.  The Surface Book also offers two different uses – laptop, and tablet (or “clipboard” mode). This adds to the portability, making it fantastic for the on-the-go student. With the base unit starting with a 13.5-inch display, an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of SSD storage, the Surface Book is perfect for the student that can handle the demands of Graphic Design and/or demanding software tools like CAD and Photoshop. And the ability to transform the Surface Book into a tablet is another great feature because it removes the need for another device.  It’s truly one of the best laptops for college students. View on Amazon – $1,399.99 Best Midrange College Laptop  ASUS X551MA The ASUS X551MA is the perfect blend between low-range and high-end laptops. Price: $315.00 | Features: 4GB RAM, 500GB storage, 15.6″ display WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The X551 is a solid all-around laptop for any class you have on your schedule. ASUS’ X551MA makes our list of the best laptops for college students as its a perfect blend mid-range and is only $50 more than the HP Stream 13. Specs include a 15.6-inch display, an Intel dual-core Celeron N2830, 4GB of RAM, and 500GB of internal storage. It doesn’t have any special technology, but it’s a standard mid-range laptop that’ll handle basic tasks (and some demanding) with ease, whether that be writing papers or playing the occasional game. It’s one of the best affordable laptop for college students too, coming in at well under $300. View on Amazon – $315.00 Best Option for Students On the Go Samsung Chromebook 3 The Samsung Chromebook 2, next to the Acer Chromebook 15, is one of the most powerful Chromebooks on the market. Price: $179.00 | Features: 2.5lbs, Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The ultra-portable Samsung Chromebook 3 fits inside any backpack. College students are known for lugging around backpacks packed to the zipper with textbooks that can sometimes weigh 50lbs or more, which is why sometimes portability is key when looking for your next laptop to take with you to university. Not only does the Samsung Chromebook 3 have an Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and Intel HD Graphics, it does it all at a feather-light 2.5lbs. It also has Google’s suite of apps built-in, allowing you to put together papers, spreadsheets, and presentations online or offline if you’re out of range of the local dorm Wi-Fi connection. It comes with 100GB of free Google Drive storage, removing the need to keep any files on the machine itself. Prospective students should note, however, that with just an 11.6-inch 1366×768 display, the Samsung Chromebook 3 may not the perfect solution for streaming any sort of media content for too long without suffering from eye strain. View on Amazon – $399.99 Best Budget Pick  ASUS C201 The ASUS C201 is a compact and lightweight Chromebook, dedicated to all things Google. Price: $179.00 | Features: 13hr battery life, Rockchip CPU, Chrome OS WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The ASUS C201 is a light, cheap Chromebook for all students out there. This Chromebook is quite the popular buy, and we can see why: it’s a one of the best cheap laptops for students. It weighs a meager 2lbs, sports up to 13-hours of battery life, and has a Rockchip 3288-C quad-core processor, making the ASUS C201 Chromebook one of the most reliable machines you can get your hands on. The aspect that sets this Chromebook apart from everything else is it’s ability to last up to 13-hours on battery. View on Amazon – $179.00 Best Chromebook for College  Acer Chromebook 15 The Acer Chromebook 15 is one of Acer’s most powerful Chromebooks yet. Price: $499.99 | Read Full Review: Acer Chromebook 15 Review | Features: Intel Core i5-5200u CPU, 15.6″ FHD LED screen WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Acer Chromebook 15 is perfect for work or play on campus. Acer’s Chromebook 15 is lightweight for perfect portability, has a 2.16GHz processor, and falls just under $500. Add that to the sleek, modern design and you have a solid all-around machine for any member of the family. Although the Toshiba Chromebook 2 beat the Acer 15 in screen quality, the Acer is still great for college students because it packs in just a few more of the features that kids want like big speakers to share media with their friends, and a slightly roomier display if they need to multitask on multiple projects at once. Whether you need to write a paper or collaborate in Google Drive, the Chromebook 15 will perform without a problem. And, just like any Chromebook, it comes with a free 100GB of Google Drive storage to give you plenty of room to store documents and other files while on the go. View on Amazon – $499.99 How We Chose the Best Laptops for College When looking for the best laptops for college students, we pulled from a wide range of options both in price and features to give you the broadest spectrum of options available. Just like every college student is different, so is the laptop choice that’s right for them. Some don’t need a lot of power and prefer portability over everything else, while others might require a machine that can render 3D models and watch lectures streaming online at the same time. Because laptops go everywhere with their corresponding college student, every choice we’ve made here is durable enough to stand up to punishment for all four years they’re earning their degree, but also light enough to slide into a backpack quickly and easily without any hassle. A laptop for college needs to boot quickly, run smoothly, and be able to run almost any program you can think of (in case next semester you decide you want to pursue VFX design instead of biochemistry). Ultimately the laptop that’s right for you or your kids will combine all the best aspects of a laptop into one complete package at a cost that’s manageable for your expectations. Key Factors to a Top Laptop For College Performance: There’s no need to overbuy in power. Find the right power for your needs. For instance, if you’re just picking up a laptop for writing papers, you might not need something with a large capacity SSD, a hefty processor, and 8GB of RAM..and with it a hefty price tag. Likewise, if you’re buying something for a Graphic Design or CAD class, you’ll likely need something much heftier than just 4GB of RAM and a dual-core processor. Find a laptop that meets your needs and sets you up for success. Portability: Make sure to purchase a thin and lightweight laptop. There’s nothing worse than carrying around a chunky laptop that’s awkward and heavy to lug around campus or to the library. It’s also good practice to make sure your laptop has a small footprint, allowing you to easily put it in most backpacks or carrying bags alongside textbooks and other study materials. Battery: Find a laptop with a good battery, preferably one that’ll last you all day and then some. For instance, the ASUS C201 has a battery that lasts up to 13-hours, giving you plenty of study time during the day and then some. While you might not need that much, it’s good to search for laptops that will last a little over three hours. Who Should Buy a Laptop for College Of course, you don’t have to be straight out of high school to be in the market for a new college laptop. Whether you’re unpacking your bags in a dorm away from home for the first time or returning after a long hiatus to finish up your master’s degree, buying a fresh laptop before classes start in the fall is always a solid investment. What classes you plan on taking, as well as the degree you’re pursuing should have an impact on the laptop you eventually choose to go with. If you need something sleek and powerful that can turn on instantly for rapid-fire notetaking, the Dell XPS 13 or Zenbook UX360AC should suit the job just fine. But, if you’re worried about spending a ton of cash on a laptop that not might last more than a few months without getting beer spilled in the keyboard, the HP Stream 13 and Acer C201 are cheaper, durable options that can weather any alcohol-related storm. Mistakes to Avoid When Buying a College Laptop Don’t make the mistake of buying the wrong operating system. Some school programs will specifically require either a Windows or OSX-based laptop (be sure to check your syllabus) for programs like Photoshop and Gimp. If your learning is strictly reading books, writing papers, and taking quizzes, then you might not need the aforementioned operating systems. In that case opt for a Chromebook, especially if all your activities will be Web based. Another thing to avoid is having too little RAM or hard drive space. The a solid laptop for students will have just enough storage capacity and RAM for studying, completing assignments, and play. If your degree program requires a lot of heavy duty software, find a laptop that has 4GB of RAM or more and a hard drive with 500GB of storage space or more. This will be enough to ensure that any software you throw on your computer runs smoothly without any hiccups.  And keep in mind that an SSD hard drive will increase speeds as well, especially start up time. And never buy at full retails.  As a student always be on the look for those student discounts, even if something already seems cheap! Most Important Features Hard Drive As far as Windows laptops go, and you don’t use many programs, look for a hard drive with a capacity of 256GB or higher. It’ll meet your needs and then some. If you’re a power user, look for 500GB or higher so there’s more than enough space for other content. If most of your activity takes place on the Web, then you might not need a hard drive larger than 32GB, which is just enough space for the operating system and storing a handful of documents offline. If possible, find a solid-state drive over a traditional hard drive. Performance and speeds will increase astronomically. RAM If you need to do anything more demanding than just using a web browser, find a laptop that has at least 4GB of RAM or more, ideally 8GB, especially if you plan on using programs like Photoshop. If you’re just using a web browser, look for a laptop with a minimum of 2GB of RAM. Your computer, whether it be Windows or Chrome OS, won’t even use that much, but it still ensures the speed and responsiveness of your machine. Alternatively, find a machine that you can upgrade the RAM yourself, which can save you money during the initial investment. Operating System It’s important to find the right operating system for your College program. If you’re in Computer Science or something that requires you to use Windows or Mac applications, it’s good to shy away from Chromebooks. If your studying takes place online and doesn’t require you to use any Windows or Mac applications, jump the gun and get a Chromebook. Processor A lower clocked dual-core processor below 2GHz won’t slow down your laptop if you’re using it for minor tasks like writing papers, browsing the web, watching media, and so on. If you’re in a degree program that has some demanding programs (e.g. Photoshop, Autodesk 3DS Max, and medical software), make sure you look for a quad-core processor with a clock speed of 2GHz or higher. Not only will it last you longer running these types of programs, but rendering and general speed will be a lot faster and more efficient than a dual-core CPU below 2GHz. At the same time, don’t overbuy in processor clock speed. For instance, there aren’t many differences between a quad-core 3.7GHz processor and a quad-core 3.9GHz processor. The only real difference is the much higher price tag. There’s little effect as far as processing power and efficiency goes. Display Finding a good display has much to do with the size that you’re comfortable with and need to work with. Whether it be 11-inch or 17-inch displays, they’re all good as long as they have a resolution of 720p or higher. Anything below that is often blurry and has very little clarity. You’ll want to make sure your display has a refresh rate of at least 60Hz to avoid any screen tearing or altered graphics when playing games and watching movies. The display you purchase should have built-in features for reducing eye strain, such as dimming the brightness or even having a feature for night use. This will help a lot as far as eye strain goes. Battery Some lectures can last over four hours in a single sitting, which is why you’ll want a laptop that can at least double up on two of those a day without needing a recharge. Most good quality laptops will have built-in power saving features that can stretch their life to 10 hours or more. You should be able to get a full charge in just two to three hours, allowing you to quickly get back to work whenever needed. Ports The best laptops for college students will have more than a single USB port. More manufacturers are headed towards just including one USB port, but it’s truly a hassle to deal with, as you can’t really plug in any extra peripherals or accessories without connecting a USB hub first. Make sure the laptop you buy has an HDMI, DVI, VGA, or Display Port. You never know when you might need to switch to a bigger screen, and having one of these ports will let you do that, with VGA being the most common for projectors you’d find in the average classroom. Which Best Laptops for College Students are right for you? Need something powerful that can handle the demands from Photoshop and/or CAD? Then the Microsoft Surface Book and Dell XPS 13 are laptops that are right up your alley. Alternatively, if you’re looking for something more humble for doing your everyday tasks at college and maybe a little media consumption when you have some time off, then the ASUS X551MA or HP Stream 13 are both laptops to consider. And, then there are Chromebooks, web-based laptops. Some are hesitant to jump on the Chromebook bandwagon, and might not consider them the best laptops for college students, simply because you can’t use Windows-based software on it. You might be surprised, but more often than not, we just don’t use the programs on Windows, strictly using web browsers like Chrome and Firefox for all of our computer use. Still not sure if these are the best laptops for college students? Then take a look at our laptops for college reviews, as they might just be able to help you make that final decision.

All I want is a 17 inch screen, fast recovery , CAD capable , DVD capable and software to write a book. I surf the net looking at Ancient history and I need the top of the line junk protection. I get so many viruses everyday that I run x2 different scans every day. AVG and Malwarebits. I also work late at night and would like a lighted key board. HP lap tops are a piece of dodo. What do you recommend? Reply Chris Stobing on Hey Les, Unfortunately Windows will always have problems with viruses, and are also the only machines (under $3,000) that can run CAD software effectively. Lighted keyboards generally only come on Dell ultrabooks (which don’t push past 15″ these days), so with all those factors in mind my best recommendation would be the Predator 17 from Acer. It is a gaming laptop, but it will also have enough power to run CAD without any problems! Reply Kristy on Good information! Needing laptop for first year student and this was very helpful!

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Rumour claims Intel has brought forward its Skylake-X and X299 launch Rumour claims Intel has brought forward its Skylake-X and X299 launch Matthew Wilson 14 hours ago CPU, Featured Announcement, Featured Tech News It looks like Intel might be planning to launch its new batch of enthusiast series CPUs earlier than anticipated, with reports this week indicating that the launch has been brought forward to June. Previously, Intel’s X299 and Skylake-X CPUs were expected in August but apparently due to mounting pressure from AMD, the launch will now take place at Computex. This information is coming from Benchlife’s sources, which claim that Intel’s X299 platform will be launching in June. This rumour closely follows last month’s leaks, which detailed AMD’s own upcoming HEDT CPUs and X399 platform. According to the report, manufacturing for Intel’s new CPUs and X299 motherboards will now begin in June, coinciding with Computex. However, it is worth noting that leaks for Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X have been few and far between over the last few months. The most recent thing we heard about Intel’s upcoming HEDT processors was that compatibility has already been added to AIDA64. Beyond that, we don’t have much concrete information. KitGuru Says: Launching new CPUs at Computex makes perfect sense. However, this rumour sits on shaky ground, so it’s hard to put too much stock in it. Either way, if a June launch is planned, then more information should leak out fairly soon.

Read the latest rumours on the 2017 iMac specification, price and UK launch date. New iMacs surely must be coming soon, but will they have Intel or AMD processors? By Marie Brewis | 10 Apr 17 Now that Intel has launched its Kaby Lake processors (rumoured to be the most likely choice of processor in upcoming Apple iMacs) and AMD has released its new Ryzen 7 chips (the outside bet as the more power-efficient of the two), the countdown is on for new iMacs to launch in the UK. But apparently for everyone except Apple. Also see: New MacBook Pro  On 21 March 2017 the Apple Store went down for 'maintenance' and reappeared at midday with a slew of new products of the iOS variety - new iPad and iPhone options, but no new Mac products. Though we had been expecting a proper Spring Event, as Apple has provided in recent years, this time around the product announcements came without the fanfare. (And without the iMacs.) So when can we expect new Apple all-in-ones? According to Apple, new iMacs will be released later this year. Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller said at a roundtable event with a few journalists at its headquarters in Cupertino that these new iMacs may even appeal to previous Mac Pro users. If you are viewing a mobile version of this page click here to view the latest version of this story. When is the 2017 iMac release date? New iMac UK release date: September 2017 (TBC)  This is becoming a theme. In October 2016 Apple was expected to announce new iMacs at a special event. It did not. In March 2017 Apple was expected to announce new iMacs at a special event. It did not. So what's going on? The reality is Apple won't hold another event until June 2017, but this is its WWDC developers conference, and it is unlikely we will see any new Macs here. There should be product announcements in September and October 2017, so it's possible that updated iMacs could appear then. Apple has confirmed that they will be arriving this year. There's little reason to wait so long, though, given that Intel's Kaby Lake processors were announced at CES in January, and more recently have been followed by the more power-efficient AMD Ryzen chips. We'd expect to see the S-Series desktop chips (Core i5-7500 / Core i5-7600 / Core i7-7700K) in the 27in iMac, although there is no clear upgrade path for the 21.5in iMac. The future of the iMac is beginning to look a little uncertain, but there's no need to worry just yet. Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated on an internal Q&A session that "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." How much will the 2017 iMac cost in the UK?  According to a Best Buy leak, which may or may not be accurate, a 27in iMac with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive will cost $3,199.99. This appears to be slightly higher than the current 27in iMac with 32GB RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive, though of course we don’t know exactly what other upgrades this model includes (and whether or not it is merely placeholder text).  Over in the UK the current 21.5in iMac starts at £899 or £1,199 with a 4K display, while the 27in 5K model starts at £1,449, both direct from Apple. We would expect prices to remain roughly the same.  What are the rumoured specifications?  Following that Best Buy leak, it’s highly likely the new iMac will feature a processor upgrade to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake family, with one blog claiming it'll feature an Intel E3-1285 v6 processor. The Best Buy listing also mentioned a 27in 5K display, 32GB of memory and a 2TB Fusion Drive, with the model priced at $3,199.99. It could be placeholder copy, but why bother to update the processor? We’d really like to see this Fusion Drive rolled out as standard across the range.  Apple could well turn to AMD once again for its graphics solution, with Polaris 10 a prime candidate. It offers improved graphics performance (naturally), plus potential reductions in power consumption and waste heat. More exciting, though, is that these new graphics chips would for the first time bring VR potential to the Mac. This is also backed up by Pike's Universum which claims that it'll feature AMD graphics to support VR and Pro users/apps. We’ve seen Apple bring the Pro name to its iPad line-up over the past year, and one rumour circulating online is that the iMac will also get Pro treatment - we could be about to see a sufficiently powerful iMac Pro to replace the Mac Pro.  It is thought that when the new iMac arrives its keyboard will feature the same Touchbar as is found on the most recent revision to the MacBook Pro. Recent patent applications reveal a keyboard with adaptive input row, described by Apple thus: “The adaptive input row may be positioned within an opening of a device and include a cover for receiving a touch and a display that is configured to present an adaptable set of indicia. The adaptive input row may also include one or more sensors for detecting the location of a touch and/or the magnitude of a force of the touch. The adaptive input row may be positioned adjacent or proximate to a keyboard of the electronic device.” The new iMac coming later this year is also expected to feature fast Intel Optane memory and storage.

This is also the launch where the company introduces its first 16 GB memory modules with programmable LED lighting. The Trident Z RGB memory modules feature programmable LED lightbars and can change their colors in accordance with user’s demands (G.Skill offers special software to customize lighting effects), providing the ability to modify the look of a PC on the fly. G.Skill first announced its Trident Z RGB memory modules in late 2016 and started to sell them early in 2017. Initially, G.Skill’s Trident Z RGB dual-channel kits were only focused on Intel’s Z270-based platforms and contained 8 GB DIMMs running at up to DDR4-3866 MT/s. Going forward, G.Skill will offer 16 GB Trident Z RGB modules in both dual-channel and quad-channel kits. Just like the Trident Z RGB 8 GB modules, the Trident Z RGB 16 GB DIMMs are based on Samsung’s 8 Gb B-die memory chips made using 20 nm process technology. The 16 GB modules will run at DDR4-2400 to DDR4-3866 with CL14-18 latencies at 1.2 V or 1.35 V, depending on the kit performance. The Trident Z RGB fully support Intel’s XMP 2.0 as well. G.Skill’s fastest dual-channel Trident Z RGB 32 GB (2×16 GB) kit will run at 3866 MT/s with CL18 18-18-38 timings. RGB commands a premium, so while the company’s fastest DDR4 kits (rated for DDR4-4266) are not RGB, the new modules are still a very high data rate for 16 GB modules. As for the fastest quad-channel kits, G.Skill now offers the Trident Z RGB 64 GB (4×16 GB) rated to operate at 3600 MT/s with CL17 19-19-39 latency settings as well as the Trident Z RGB 128 GB (8×16 GB) DDR4-3333 kit with CL16 18-18-38 timings. G.Skill's New Trident Z RGB Memory for Intel's X99 and Z270 Platforms Speed CL Timing Voltage Kit Configuration Kit Capacity DDR4-2400 CL15 15-15-35 1.2 V 2×16 GB 4×16 GB 8×16 GB 8×8 GB 32 GB 64 GB 128 GB 64 GB DDR4-3000 CL14 14-14-34 1.35 V* DDR4-3200 CL14 14-14-34 CL15 15-15-35 DDR4-3333 CL16 18-18-38 8×16 GB 8×8 GB 128 GB 64 GB DDR4-3466 CL16 18-18-38 2×16 GB 4×16 GB 8×8 GB 32 GB 64 GB 64 GB DDR4-3600 CL17 19-19-39 2×16 GB 4×16 GB 32 GB 64 GB DDR4-3866 CL18 18-18-38 2×16 GB 32 GB *1.35V is the standard high-performance voltage setting for DDR4 While these kits are aimed at Intel systems, we would assume that qualification on Ryzen systems will be an ongoing process. G.Skill has just sent us a 2x8GB DDR4-3200 C14 kit of G.Skill FlareX (non-RGB) modules for our Ryzen testing, so it's clear that G.Skill (and others) will have AMD qualified kits in their roadmaps. Motherboard manufacturers typically have memory qualified validation lists on their websites for each motherboard, showing which modules have been confirmed to work. Initially it was hit and miss on DRAM qualification with the launch of Ryzen 7 due to timing, but most vendors are falling into place with appropriate BIOS updates. G.Skill traditionally does not announce MSRPs for its memory modules, due to the volatility of the DRAM ICs, but given the fact that DRAM pricing is generally increasing, expect the new Trident Z RGB kits to be priced at high levels. Moreover, since it is not easy to handpick 8 Gb chips for high-speed 16 GB DDR4 memory modules, expect the manufacturer to charge a premium for kits that use high-capacity DIMMs. As an example, right now G.Skill offers 32 GB (4×8 GB) DDR4-3600 and DDR4-3866 kits without RGB for $410 and $460, respectively.

For some time now, foundries have named their latest process nodes based on their desired market positioning more than any transparent benchmark. It’s time the shenanigans stop. Intel recently proposed a simple but somewhat self-serving density metric. The response from rival foundries was a deafening silence. I suspect that Intel has an edge in transistor density, something its competitors don’t want to admit. Intel deserves praise for its recent decision to reveal metrics such as fin pitches and heights and minimum metal and gate pitches on its 10-nm node, which has not yet started production. These are the kinds of basic details that all foundries should supply when they first announce a new node. However, such metrics and the transistor density that can be derived from them are only part of the story. If you can’t deliver transistors that support significantly higher speeds or lower power consumption, it doesn’t matter how many of them you can deliver. Back in 2009, ARM’s chief technologist, Mike Muller, coined the term dark silicon. Engineers are packing more transistors on a die but lack the power budget to turn many of them on, he observed. Intel’s density metric is good as far as it goes, but without related formulas for performance and power, it fails to tell the whole story. Over the last few years, the industry has embraced the idea of measuring a process node by PPA — performance, power, and area. The consulting firm International Business Strategies (IBS) suggests using a metric of “effective gates … [that] takes into account available gates, [what Intel’s metric reports, as well as] gate utilization and yields,” said IBS chief executive, Handel Jones. “While available gates are useful … it is only the tip of the iceberg.” The trouble is, “companies are very secretive regarding yields … but cost per gate … is the critical metric and is impacted by D0 as well as parametric and systemic yields” and how long it takes for customers to get chips, he added. Several EE Times readers provided their thoughts on a metric in comments on our story on Intel’s proposal. One reader called for a measure of RC time delay in nanoseconds per mm2 “if we use capacitance and resistance per unit length.” Another reader suggested that Intel’s metric is not useful because it does not include information on standard cell tracks. Another reader said, “The real measure is how well the process plus the libraries work together across a range of design types [and] performance criteria. I would like to see Intel libraries and process vs. ARM/TSMC libraries [and process] compared on real synthesizable designs like a large ARM core complex/SoC and a large x86 core, targeted at the same clock rates.” Several readers agreed that the final roof of the pudding arrives long after the node itself in the competitive stats and sales of chips made in the process. They also observed TSMC and Samsung are ramping chips in what they call 7-nm processes this year as Intel ramps what it calls its 10-nm node. Analyst Linley Gwennap said that Intel’s density metric “must be combined with SRAM cell size to get a full picture of SoC size, particularly for processors that include large amounts of memory” and called on foundries to provide more data on their process nodes. Next page: More options heighten the confusion IBS suggests that chip designers need to consider a table of metrics.(Source: IBS) Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 2 Next > Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank CEO .... realjjj   4/10/2017 1:51:15 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Since design costs are prohibitive on these nodes, it becomes an important knob for foundries.

Rich Duprey, Steve Symington, and Timothy Green (TMFCop) Apr 10, 2017 at 9:31AM The depth and breadth of NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) portfolio has given it a huge competitive advantage over rivals such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), not just in its leading GPU segment, but also as its chips enjoy rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, the cloud, and even self-driving vehicles. Because of its pervasiveness, we've asked three top Motley Fool contributors to weigh in on what investors might want to think about before buying NVIDIA stock. Read on to discover why its price, its competition, and underestimating its potential can lead you to shortchange yourself are three noodle points to factor in. Image source: Getty Images. An expensive stock Tim Green (a high price): There is no company with a better set of buzzwords than graphics-chip developer NVIDIA. Virtual reality? Check. Deep learning? Check. Artificial intelligence? Check. Self-driving cars? Check. All of these represent opportunities for NVIDIA on top of its core gaming business, which has been booming in recent years. But the price of the stock is now so high that there's little room for things to go wrong. NVIDIA's market capitalization is now roughly $60 billion, 8.7 times sales and 36 times earnings. To be fair, NVIDIA's revenue and earnings exploded last year, but that growth was mostly driven by gaming. With competition from Advanced Micro Devices in the form of its high-end Vega graphics cards coming this year, a more sluggish 2017 seems likely. NVIDIA's growth opportunities are vast, but they are just that -- opportunities. When investors begin paying a price that assumes that those opportunities will turn into realities, anything short of complete success becomes a problem for the stock. Will NVIDIA's solution for self-driving cars become the standard? Maybe. Will graphics cards continue to be the go-to for accelerating deep-learning workloads? Perhaps. In the best-case scenario, NVIDIA could end up being worth far more in the future. But there are also a lot of scenarios that will lead to poor results for investors. That's something to think about before you jump in. Image source: NVIDIA. Rising competition thwarting power Rich Duprey (competitive threats): NVIDIA has its fingers in a lot of pies, not only in the gaming market it dominates, but also in the Internet of Things, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the auto market with self-driving cars. That means not only will it face traditional rivals Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, but it will also be squaring off against Qualcomm, ARM, and maybe even the likes of Google, which built its own Tensor Processing Unit. Moreover, established rivals will feel threatened by NVIDIA's rising power and may join together to seek ways to thwart it. There are persistent rumors that Intel and AMD will enter into a licensing deal for graphics processing unit technology since Intel's partnership with NVIDIA expired at the end of March. As NVIDIA dives deeper into other territories, it might spawn other alliances in a bid to thwart it from gaining too much control over emerging technologies. NVIDIA is clearly the front-runner in most of these categories and will probably remain so for some time to come, but when an investor is considering investing in a stock with such dominant characteristics, it's always good to remember that there's always someone trying to take down the leader and to consider who those challengers to the throne might be. NVIDIA is king now, but someone may try to play the part of usurper in the near future. Image source: NVIDIA. A winner that will keep on winning? Steve Symington (don't underestimate NVIDIA): I know our chosen topic of discussion implies caution surrounding the decision to buy NVIDIA. But keep in mind that part of the reason shares have skyrocketed so much over the past couple of years is that Wall Street fundamentally underestimated NVIDIA's potential. So don't rule out further share-price appreciation when you're considering whether to buy. NVIDIA stock popped nearly 30% in a single day this past November, for example, when its fiscal third-quarter 2017 results absolutely crushed analysts' expectations on both the top and bottom lines. It was only natural, then, that the stock deserved to trade at higher multiples as Wall Street readjusted its models. More recently in February, however, shares ticked lower even as NVIDIA significantly exceeded its fiscal Q4 guidance -- revenue climbed 55% year over year, to $2.17 billion, and net income per share nearly tripled, to $0.99. But investors seem to be forgetting that NVIDIA's flagship GPU technology and deep-learning platform both play central roles in disrupting multiple high-growth, early-stage industries. And its results speak for themselves, as NVIDIA enjoyed double-digit percentage growth in four of its five reportable business platforms. Those included gaming (up 66%, to $1.348 billion), data center (up 205%, to $296 million), automotive (up 38%, to $128 million), and professional visualization (up 11%, to $225 million). More than anything, the recent pause seems to be a byproduct of caution surrounding NVIDIA's incredible climb. But it's worth noting that shares trade below 30 times this year's expected earnings -- a reasonable premium given NVIDIA's outsize growth. As the company continues to foster both its core gaming and smaller segments alike, I wouldn't underestimate its ability to continue delivering market-beating returns for patient, long-term shareholders.

I thought it would be useful to summarize what we know now, especially since some of what Intel announced was different than what I previously forecast. Process density Comparing process density keeps getting more and more complex. Many years ago, node names meant something and were related to real process features. As node names became disconnected from actual process dimensions many of us turned to contacted poly pitch (CPP) multiplied by minimum metal pitch (MMP) as a density metric. Standard cells used in logic design have a height that is related to MMP and a width that is related to CPP. Recently companies have begun to push down the number of tracks and since cell height is the number of tracks multiplied by MMP we need to include tracks in our comparisons. Cell width is also getting more complicated, for example Intel discussed single versus dual dummy gates last week and for a two input NAND gate commonly used in logic designs, the cell width is ~4CPP for a dual dummy gate and ~3CPP for a single dummy gate. As I discussed in a previous article Intel has proposed a metric to try to include these factors but the metric has not been adopted by others yet (they just proposed it last week) and all of the information needed to calculate the Intel metric is not available for companies other than Intel. In spite of this I will present my estimates for this metric based on what I consider to be reasonable assumptions. Click here to read more ...

Request a sample copy of ESD Packaging Market Research Report @ https://marketsizeforecasters.com/get-sample/24216 Commenting on the report, an analyst from team said: One trend in market is high adoption of technology in automobiles. The electrification and automation of automobiles have increased the demand for semiconductor wafers. Multiple types of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) are used in automobiles for airbag control, global positioning systems, anti-lock braking systems, car navigation and display, power doors and windows, infotainment, automated driving, and collision detection technology. The emergence of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence will lead to the emergence of self-driving cars in future. Companies such as Intel, Google, Uber, and Tesla are already investing and focusing on self-driving vehicles. In November 2016, for example, Intel announced its new division, Automated Driving Group, which will focus on autonomous driving. Intel has also tied up with automotive firms such as BMW for the division. The listed pricing for this ESD Packaging Market report starts at $ 3500. Request Discount for ESD Packaging Market Research Report @ https://marketsizeforecasters.com/enquire-for-discount/24216 According to the report, one driver in market is increasing miniaturization of electronic devices. There has been an increase in the demand for mobility in electronic devices worldwide. To be portable and cost-effective, devices need to be lightweight and small. Thus, the increased demand for mobility has translated into a trend toward the adoption of smaller devices. The popularity of smaller devices in multiple sectors such as telecommunications and automotive has, in turn, led to the miniaturization of semiconductor ICs. With the advances in technology, such as 3D ICs and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), as well as the changes in the designs of ICs such as finer patterning, electronic devices are becoming more compact and user-friendly. However, smaller and densely-built semiconductors, ICs, and PCBs have more chances of tribocharging, and thus require anti-static packaging. Further, the report states that one challenge in market is high dependence on electronics industry. The ESD packaging market is heavily dependent on the global performance of the electronics industry. In the case of a global economic meltdown, the sales of electronic products are impacted adversely because these products are capital intensive. The ripple effect is felt in the semiconductor equipment market as semiconductors comprise major components in electronic products. As semiconductor sales go down, the sales of semiconductor packaging materials also go down. The global recession of 2009, for example, was one of the most harrowing periods for companies across the semiconductor value chain because of the global economic meltdown. At present, the slow growth of China is a concern for the global electronics market. China’s growth rate fell from 9.6% in 2011 to 6.9% in 2015. It has reduced further during the first three quarters of 2016 to around 6.7%. China consumes and produces more than 50% of the raw materials, such as semiconductors. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News Students Compete to Keep Astronauts Comfortable, Fit, and Fed in Outer Space by Sarah Murry, HP Newsroom Managing Editor SOURCE: HP, Inc. DESCRIPTION: When HP declared its mission was to make life better for everyone, everywhere, no one likely considered that “everywhere” might extend past boundaries of the Earth’s atmosphere. But HP’s lineup of high-performance ZBook mobile workstations are among the technology tools that are present in both the International Space Station (ISS), and on the ground at Mission Control. Now, HP and Intel are joining forces on an innovative new contest, called the “Life in Space” Design Challenge. The contest will tap some of the brightest engineering minds at universities across the US to develop a product that can improve the lives of astronauts in space.  Undergraduate student teams from prestigious engineering schools across the country will be outfitted with HP ZBook Studio Mobile Workstations, powered by Intel® Core i7® processors, to help them design a manufacture-able product to improve life in space for astronauts. Maintaining relatively comfortable living and working conditions while on the ISS is something NASA’s been grappling with ever since the first crew arrived in 2000. Questions from how to help astronauts maintain their physical and mental health to the quality and variety of the vacuum-sealed food they subsist upon might spark a revolutionary new product idea. “We’re looking to the country’s brightest engineering minds to put HP’s ZBook technology to work by designing and prototyping a product that will make life better for the astronauts on the ISS,” said Lisa Baker, Director, Business & Personal Systems Marketing at HP. “ZBook Studio Mobile Workstations will enable their imaginations to soar, while offering the high-performance specs to make their creations come to fruition.” Tapping the Brightest Engineering Minds to Create Better Space Experiences HP and Intel are engaging with student teams from Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Tech, Ohio State, University of Texas, Oregon State University, Arizona State University, Virginia Tech University, and Clemson University for the challenge. During the first phase of the contest, teams of five students from each school will determine their design and provide a conceptual sketch showcasing their idea as well as a brief team video. They’ll then submit a work-in-progress CAD (computer assisted design) file of their idea.  In the next and final phase in mid-March, the teams will submit fully-rendered CAD files and a video that explains the design overview and finer points of their product vision. In late March, a judging panel made up of representatives from HP and Intel will narrow down the participant list to three finalists—and then open up the voting to the public via social media. Winners will be announced in early April. See full contest rules here, and stay tuned to vote on these innovative projects soon.  Tweet me: #EngineeringStudents Compete to Keep Astronauts Comfortable, Fit + Fed in #LifeInSpace http://bit.ly/2nFHjlj via @GlblCtzn @HP @Intel KEYWORDS: Innovation & Technology, Responsible Business & Employee Engagement, HP Inc, Intel, International Space Station, LIfe in space design challenge, Technology CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Ayubowan Cap Ltd (AYYBF: Grey Market) | Halted Security Next PostNext Dr. Harry Poulos of Coffey, A Tetra Tech Company, Wins ASCE OPAL Award Search Recent Posts United States Smart Glass in Automotive Market Growth Factors, Applications, Product Types and Trend Analysis to 2021 United States Multi-Conductor Cables Market Status, Key Player Analysis Upcoming Trends to 2021 United States Menadione (Vitamin K3) Market Supply-Demand, Research and End User Analysis to 2021 Global Cloud API Market : APEJ Region to Rise at 23.7% CAGR by 2026 United States L-Serine Market Dynamics, Forecasts to 2021, Sales and Revenue Analysis Report Business Directory Business Contacts Proudly powered by WordPress

It would seem that the company will be unveiling a new line of high-end desktop processors really soon. What is more, it looks like Intel has decided to launch its X299 HEDT motherboard ahead of original plans. The X299 HEDT motherboard, codenamed “Basin Falls,” was originally reported for a Gamescom release in August. However, according to Benchlife, Intel has pushed the release a little bit earlier. Now, the report claims that the new series of motherboards will be launched in the first week of June. In fact, the X299 HEDT motherboards will be introduced to the public during this year’s Computex event in Taiwan. X299 HEDT motherboard specs The newest line of motherboard from Intel will support four upcoming HEDT processors, three of which will belong to the Skylake-X family while the other one from the Kaby Lake-X. The X299 HEDT motherboard will support a maximum of ten cores per die and quad channel DDR memory of up to 2667Mhz. Intel Basic Falls platform (via benchlife.info) In terms of communication lines, the X299 motherboard will have a maximum of 66 PCIe lanes. The system can have as much as ten USB 3.0 lanes, eight SATA 3.0 lanes, and 24 third generation PCIe buses. Intel HEDT processor lineup At the moment, the X299 motherboard will be able to accommodate a maximum of ten cores per die. The Skylake-X line of processors will start at six cores and work its way to ten. On the other hand, the Kaby Lake-X platform will be limited to four cores for the time being. Both platforms will be based on the new LGA2066, the same socket design used by the new Kaby Lake desktop processors. The Skylake-X version will have a maximum TDP of 140W while the Kaby Lake-X line is set to 112W TDP. Skylake-X vs Kaby Lake-X The main difference between the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X is the maximum number of cores per die. As mentioned earlier, the Skylake-X line will have a maximum of ten cores per die. Meanwhile, the Kaby Lake-X will have a maximum of four cores. Because of the disparity in core counts, the Kaby Lake-X line of HEDT processors will only have a maximum of 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes. Furthermore, there will only be support for dual channel memories instead for quad channels. Obviously, due to core count, the Skylake-X line of processors will be sold for a much higher price. Market analysts believe that it will cost somewhere between $1,300 to $1,500. On the other hand, the Kaby Lake-X will be a sort of “entry level” offering and may be priced around $350 or higher. Intel vs AMD There have been a lot of talks about AMD’s efforts to gain its CPU market share since the start of the year. So far, the company has been successful at launching its latest AMD Ryzen processors. While its top-of-the-line AMD Ryzen 7 1800X processor is more than up to the challenge compared to the current Intel HEDT, it will surely be left behind when Intel announces the newer HEDT processor. Because of this, AMD is rumored to release its own version of HEDT processors. Only this time, instead of ten cores, it will have a maximum of 16 cores. Rumor has it that AMD intends to announce its HEDT processors within the next couple of months. New Intel roadmap (via benchlife.info) Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X schedule The report from Benchlife also stated that Intel mode started its production schedule ahead of original plans. Initially, the Skylake-X production is set to start sometime in the 31st week of 2017. Now, both Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors will be produced as early as the 25th week of 2017. This means that release date is also pushed ahead of schedule. It would seem that the new release date schedule for both processors will now happen between the third and fourth quarter of the year.

We explain the risks and guide you through the process. We explain the risks and steps involved in overclocking By Chris Martin | 10 Apr 17 If you're looking to speed up your PC, but can't afford new components for your PC then you can still improve the performance without spending any money at all. Here's how to overclock your CPU whether it's an Intel or AMD processor. See also: AMD vs Intel. Overclocking a CPU can make it run faster, but you should be aware of the dangers  Overclock an Intel processor using the Extreme Tuning Utility  Overclock an AMD processor using OverDrive You can use your motherboard's auto overclocking feature  Overclocking is the process of making your processor (CPU) run faster. The performance is already there, but by default, the manufacturer (Intel and AMD) restricts the CPU's performance to a 'safe' level to ensure it's reliable for a longer time. You can choose to make your CPU work faster by changing a few settings, but there are risks - see below. Depending on your chipset, for example having a Devil Canyon versus Ivy Bridge chipset, they will have different ways of overclocking. Therefore, if you're looking to achieve the highest possible overclock on a specific chipset, it would be best if you followed a dedicated guide for your chipset and processor. You'll only be able to overclock a processor if it's 'unlocked'. For example, Intel has a 'non-K' Intel Core i7 which has a locked clock speed, preventing you from overlocking it and a unlocked-K version of its Intel Core i7, allowing you to overclock the processor. In order to make this guide relevant for all readers, we will not concentrate on a specific chipset, but rather look at the tools and auto overclocking methods available to you. If you're looking to fine-tune and get the maximum performance out of your processor, you'll need to fully understand the process of overclocking and also sacrifice several weeks to overclocking, as it's a lengthy process through trial and error.  Achieving the best overclock is no simple task and often requires a good 'silicone lottery'. The lottery comes from various different processors having different voltage requirements to reach a certain clock rate. For example, looking at the same model Intel Core i7 3770K processor, on CPU will need 1.35 Volts for a 4.5Ghz overclock, whilst another will do 1.15 Volts for the same clock speed. Due to the complications you might run into with overclocking a laptop, we've chosen to stick to desktop computers. If you're looking to overclock a laptop you have to be extremely cautious, given that their heat dessipation is limited. Find out how to build a PC. Warnings, risks and understanding the art of overclocking Before jumping into doing this, there are some risks to consider. For starters, overclocking will almost certainly void any warranty on your machine – although some are built with overclocking in mind. You may also damage your CPU or even other components by overclocking. In this guide we'll try to make it as fail-safe as possible, whereby you shouldn't ever run into problems nor run the risk of damaging any components. However, if you are going to overclock your processor, you should be aware that you can damage your components by ramping up your BCLK too high, whereby the BCLK determines your motherboard's overclock. Without getting too technical, a BCLK overclock boosts the performance of your whole motherboard, meaning anything directly connected to your motherboard will be overclocked. Yes that also includes your wireless card! BCLK overclocking is therefore a little dangerous, but if done properly, you'll be able to achieve fantastic results. We would suggest only doing a BCLK overclock, if you know the ins and outs of your motherboard chipset and processor. Multiplier overclocking can also be dangerous, but is often a lot easier to understand. In order to achieve a faster processor speed, you need to increase its multiplier. In order for your processor to cope with the faster speed, you need to pump more power (volts) to it - this is known as increasing the Vcore. When you increase the Vcore, your CPU temperatures also increase as there are more volts going in and out of your processor at a ridiculously fast speed. Imagine it as a motor, the quicker the motor spins, the hotter it gets. More VCore means more cycles within your CPU and thus more heat. Read next: Best gaming headsets 2016. Before you start Since overclocking involves pushing your CPU beyond its factory settings, you should monitor it.  A processors maximum temperature, also known as the TJ Max is arguably the most important figure to track when overclocking, as every processor has a thermal threshold. If you exceed that temperature, your PC will have a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD); if this happens regularly you could face data loss and more importantly hardware damage with your CPU frying. If you're going to be going above and beyond with your overclocking, we would suggest buying an after-market cooler; something like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo or Arctic Freezer 7 Pro are popular choices for low-moderate overclocks. If you're serious about overclocking, a Noctua NH-D15 or a Corsair H115i liquid cooler is what you'll need to adequately cool your processor. In order to be safe and always be in the know about your processor's temperature, we suggest you download Core Temp, Real Temp or HW Monitor. This will inform you of the core temperatures of your processor and also inform you of the maximum temperature your processor can handle before it shuts off. To test an overclock, a lot of users trust the results of Prime95, Aida64 and Cinebench, these programs put a max load on your processor and stress your processor. If it fails, you often have an un-stable overclock, whereby adjusting the Vcore is needed. We would only suggest using these programs if you're going for a non-factory overclock. In this article we will only be covering overclocks that should be fully stable at the click of a few buttons, meaning a stress test will often not be needed as your components should be capable of coping with the low overclock you will set out to achieve. We would also recommend downloading CPU Z, as it will display a real time measurement of each processor core's internal frequency, your memory frequency and even your motherboard's details. See also: Guide to BSOD codes. Which processors can I overclock? As a general rule of thumb, the higher-end processors are approved for overclocking. Not every CPU can be overclocked so you'll need to have one which is unlocked in order to manipulate the base clock rate or multiplier. If you're not sure then Intel has detailed specs here or you can simply attempt to overclock and you'll soon find out. AMD's FX range of processors come unlocked and generally most modern AMD chips can be overclocked.

Using software to overclock Overclocking an Intel processor If you're trying to overclock an Intel processor you can download the Extreme Tuning Utility (Intel XTU) software. It provides access to the settings you need to overclock such as power, voltage, core, and memory. The software is easy to use and often safe for all types of overclockers. Again, remember that you should be constantly monitoring your CPU temperatures and maybe running a stress test like Prime95 for a few hours to ensure stability. Image credits: Guru3D Overclocking an AMD processor On AMD you'll need to download OverDrive which is effectively the same thing as Intel XTU. It includes automatic tuning if you're unsure of what you're doing, control over your fans, monitoring and also stability tests. It's a decent package which makes overclocking more accessible and doesn't require multiple reboots as the changes are done in real-time. Again, just like on Intel, you should ensure you've got the right monitoring tools set in place, so that you can ensure you're not frying anything. Using the BIOS for Intel and AMD Most overclockers, especially the experienced ones will tell you to overclock through the BIOS. This is often recommended as you won't have any software conflicts and more so, have total control over all the settings your motherboard and processor can offer. You can often enter the BIOS by pressing the Delete (DEL) key on your keyboard, as the PC boots up. If you're unsure on how to access the BIOS, make sure to check our dedicate guide on entering the BIOS. Depending on your motherboard, there should be a one-click option to overclock. For example, on mid-range and high-end Asus motherboards you should have the option to enable Ai Overclock Tuner, which will automatically provide you with a low-moderate overclock. If you understand the BIOS and feel confident with what you're doing, you can achieve your maximum overclock through the BIOS' settings. Do lots of reading around your motherboard and processor and then proceed. Being over-prepared is never a bad thing! Read next: Best PC Mouse.

The company is shipping us a new unit for testing. We'll update this article as soon as possible.  Lots of laptops can run Linux, but it’s hard to come by laptops that offer Linux as a pre-installed operating system. Dell has been the biggest name to offer penguin-friendly portables, specifically with its XPS 13 Developer Edition. While the XPS 13 offers great power in a compact size, some people might want something a little more powerful. Enter the Precision 5520. The Precision 5520 (which starts at $1,399 but is $2,765.50 as configured here) offers a wonderful amount of power for those looking to do some workstation tasks on the Linux desktop. However, there were a few major hangups that really held the Precision back from realizing its full potential. [ Further reading: 4 Linux projects for newbies and intermediate users ] The good The Precision 5520 is a different class of laptop than the XPS 13, and it shows. The device is physically bigger, looking more like an XPS 15, with Dell’s aluminum and smooth matte-black touches all around. Alex Campbell The Dell Precision 5520 running Ubuntu 16.04. Of course, most of your time with the PC will be spent looking at the screen, and it doesn't disappoint. It's a bright 3840x2160 (4K) touchscreen that keeps things sharp in its 15 diagonal inches of real estate.The screen's bezel is slim, meaning that more of that expanse is taken up with actual pixels. To that end, Dell has placed the webcam near the hinge, allowing the screen to extend further up top.  The Precision 5520’s hardware compared to the 2015 XPS 13’s hardware. The palm-rest area features something many users won't be accustomed to: an Intel Xeon logo (in place of the more common Core i5 or Core i7 branding), which indicates right away that this machine is all about the cores—of which there are eight—and not necessarily the clocks (although the 2.9GHz clock speed isn't shabby). In fact, the Precision’s Xeon demolished the Core-grade CPU in the 2015 XPS 13 Developer Edition I used for comparison. The extra cores and higher clocks really paid off in CPU-intensive tasks like kernel compilation and file compression. The PC also comes with a hefty helping of RAM, to the tune of 32GB. That’s a lot more than the average user will need, but for workstation loads, users will see a big advantage from not having to hit the swap space (virtual memory) on their storage drives. Alex Campbell The Dell Precision 5520’s USB 3.0, USB-C and HDMI ports. For connectivity, the laptop comes with three USB ports: one USB-C and two USB 3.0. You also get an HDMI out, an SD card reader, and a Kensington lock. For those who prefer using a mouse, you’ll probably want to go with a Bluetooth option in order to save the two USB 3.0 ports for other stuff. The bad There’s a lot to love about this PC’s hardware, for sure. But when it comes to software, the laptop falls flat on its face. There are a number of issues with the Precision 5520 that directly stem from the fact that it ships with Ubuntu 16.04, which in itself is a perfectly fine OS. First, the Intel Wi-Fi card in the laptop is supported by Linux kernel 4.6 and later, while Ubuntu 16.04 comes with kernal 4.4. That means that in order to get the Wi-Fi to work on the PC, you have to upgrade Ubuntu to 16.10 (or the upcoming 17.04) or install a 4.6 kernel from Ubuntu’s kernel mainline repository. The Intel wireless device isn’t supported under kernel 4.4, which is what Ubuntu 16.04 runs on. To update the software and install Phoronix Test Suite for benchmarking, I ended up tethering the laptop to my Android phone to use my home Wi-Fi. I did this after trying an Asus 802.11ac USB dongle (which actually claims Linux compatibility on the box), but the 4.4. kernel didn’t pick up that either. It was only after this that I realized the laptop comes with an ethernet-to-USB-C dongle. While that would have been far easier to use, it still doesn't solve the glaring problem that Wi-Fi doesn’t work out of the box. Wireless compatibility has been a running joke among both Linux users and Linux detractors, and this laptop supports the stereotype. Another issue I noticed was a lack of hardware controls, specifically for screen brightness. For the battery rundown test, I like to keep the screen at about half brightness, or around 200 nits. When I tried pressing the screen brightness keys, there was no response, even while running kernel 4.6. Nor did the power and screen options in Ubuntu feature a slider for brightness. Many of the other hardware control keys, besides the audio controls, also appeared to have no effect. The benchmarks Once I ran the tests, the Precision 5520 proved that it has the brawn to back up its exterior beauty. In nearly every test in the Phoronix Test Suite, the Precision stood head and shoulders above the XPS 13. Thanks to the faster SSD, read performance using a 1MB record size showed an improvement of nearly 18 percent. Write performance was about the same as the XPS 13 for all the storage I/O tests in the IOZone phase of the test suite. Alex Campbell Alex Campbell In the Unigine Heaven test, the graphics performance showed nearly 40 percent improvement over the XPS 13. However, that improvement comes with a caveat: The FPS score for the graphics test topped out at 9.07 frames per second, far below any threshold you’d need for a decent gaming experience. Keep in mind though, this is using the default Intel display drivers available in kernel 4.4. Kernel 4.10 includes some improvements for more recent Intel CPUs and graphics. As for the CPU tasks, the Xeon really smacked around the Core i7 in the XPS 13. For H.264 playback, CPU utilization was around 2.6 percent, compared to the Core i7’s 7.9 percent. In number-crunching tasks, the Xeon shined as well. When encoding H.264 video, the Precision managed a whopping 202 frames percent, compared to the XPS 13’s 93 frames. Kernel compilation time also showed an amazing improvement. The XPS 13 took 255 seconds to compile a Linux kernel. The Precision took only 101 seconds. That’s an improvement of over 60 percent, which is nothing to sneer at. Similarly, the time to encode FLAC audio from a WAV source file took only 5.06 seconds compared to the XPS 13’s 7.65 seconds. That’s and improvement of over 33 percent. Less impressive was the battery life: While playing an H.264 movie on loop using VLC at full-screen, the Precision lasted a scant 2 hours, 2 minutes. I didn’t expect fabulous battery life from a mobile workstation, but I would have liked to see more than two hours. Of course, given the lack of control over screen brightness and limited power management, the Precision was essentially set up to fail in this area. I should note here that while I ran the system tests with kernel 4.4, I ran the battery rundown on kernel 4.6. I needed kernel 4.6 in order to ping the network card from another PC as the test was run—as soon as the pings fail to reach the host, the timer stops and returns the time. The takeaway Alex Campbell The presence of the Windows sticker is a sign that Linux was an afterthought. Again, a lot of these shortfalls aren’t the fault of Ubuntu 16.04. Dell chose to go with the latest and greatest Intel Wi-Fi components, which perform quite well in a pure hardware sense. Unfortunately, Dell shipped the laptop with a kernel that doesn’t support the hardware. What does this mean? If you use the laptop as-is out of the box, you don’t get some critical features: Wi-Fi, screen brightness control, advanced ACPI (power) management, hardware control via function keys, or a desktop UI that’s appropriately scaled for the resolution. It's these shortfalls that cripple otherwise outstanding hardware, and for no other reason than a lack of testing on Dell and Canonical’s part. Had Dell or Canonical tested Ubuntu 16.04 on the Precision 5520, a fix would have been relatively simple. Dell could have shipped with a later version of Ubuntu, like 16.10, which comes with kernel 4.8 (though this would not have the long-term support of the LTS version). Or Dell could have shipped the laptop with Ubuntu 16.04 but with an appropriate kernel preloaded. The 4.10 kernel added support for Kaby Lake features that the Precision 5520 could have taken advantage of.  Alternatively, Dell could have shipped the laptop with another Linux OS that makes it easier to upgrade the kernel, or has a newer kernel. Both Fedora and openSUSE have stable offerings that could have solved some of these issues. Indeed, a different Linux distro would have also made more sense given the Precision's 4K display. While the 4K screen is beautiful, it really doesn’t play nice with Ubuntu’s Unity desktop running the X.org server. Fedora 25, for instance, shipped with Wayland. Wayland plays much nicer with HiDPI displays than X.org, which had to be twisted and forced into compliance in order to feel right. Instead, it feels like Dell penguin-washed the Precision 5520, which is plain enough to see upon opening the box: The quick-start guide includes instructions for Windows 10, and the underside of the laptop sports a Windows Pro sticker. Ultimately, a Linux user might get a better experience from the 5520 by wiping it and installing a more recent Linux distribution, which makes it barely any different from a Windows version of the same laptop. Long story short, this is a fine laptop—and its hardware makes it a far better choice than the Dell XPS 13 for video encoding, compiling code, or other heavy computing tasks. But the OS it comes with is not optimized for the hardware. Hell, it’s not a stretch to say that the OS keeps this PC from being the workstation it's supposed to be. If anything, this PC is a case study in why PC makers who want to ship desktop Linux should pay attention to what they are doing before they push a product to market. The whole idea of buying a Linux laptop is to avoid these types of troubles, after all. In that respect, the Precision 5520 feels like a step back from the great platform we saw in the 2016 XPS 13. If you install your own updated Linux distribution on the Precision 5520, it will be a fine portable workstation. But out of the box, the Precision 5520 provides a painful experience that takes a fair amount of technical know-how just to get the basics to work.

Quelle: PC Games Hardware 10.04.2017 um 12:15 Uhr Intel soll die Produktion und damit die Veröffentlichung seiner Skylake-X- und Kaby-Lake-X-CPUs vorverschoben haben. Statt zur Gamescom im August könnte es jetzt schon zur Computex Ende Mai so weit sein. Denkbar wäre eine Reaktion auf AMDs Ryzen-Prozessoren, die mit Intels Kaby Lake-S und Broadwell-E konkurrenzfähig sind. Bisher ging man davon aus, dass Intel seine neue High-End-Plattform mit Sockel 2066 im Rahmen der Gamescom vorstellen werde. Die Spielermesse hatte der Chiphersteller bereits mit Skylake-S für sich entdeckt und dort die Vierkerner-Topmodelle Core i7-6700K sowie i5-6600K veröffentlicht. Laut der für gewöhnlich gut informierten Webseite benchlife.info (maschinelle Übersetzung) sollen sich Intels Pläne jedoch geändert haben. Gezeigt werden angebliche Intel-Dokumente mit alten und neuen Terminen für Qualification Samples und den Produktionsstarts. Im Falle von Skylake-X geht es ausschließlich um den "Low Core Count"-Die, bei dem sich benchlife.info immer noch sicher ist, dass er mit zehn und nicht 12 Rechenkernen daherkomme. Die größeren Dies werden für den Server-Bereich gebraucht. Für Skylake-X-basierte Qualification Samples habe Intel ursprünglich ein Zeitfenster von Ende Mai bis Anfang Juni angesetzt. Jetzt soll es fest Ende Mai sein. QS-Modelle entsprechen im Normalfall den finalen Versionen, wenn Intel keine groben Fehler mehr entdeckt, und werden aus der frühen Produktion Partnern zum Testen geschickt. Die Serienproduktion habe Ende Juli, spätestens Anfang August beginnen sollen und sei jetzt auf Mitte bis Ende Juni vorgezogen worden. Das gleiche gilt für Kaby Lake-X, dessen Qualification Samples sich bereits seit Jahresanfang im Umlauf befinden - technisch handelt es sich um Kaby Lake-S auf einem größeren Package, das in den Sockel 2066 passt. Intel muss bloß die GPU deaktivieren, was einen weiteren Fertigungsschritt mit sich bringt. Die Platform Controller Hubs des Typs X299 (Codename: Basin Falls) sollen sich ab Ende Mai in Serienproduktion befinden. Mit Mustern dürften die Mainboard-Hersteller schon lange versorgt werden, um ihre Sockel-2066-Platinen zu entwerfen. Letztendlich könnte Intel die Computex (30.05. - 03.06.) nutzen, um Skylake-X und Kaby Lake-X offiziell anzukündigen und so etwa Druck auf AMD auszuüben, die kürzlich Ryzen 7 veröffentlicht haben und morgen Ryzen 5 nachschieben werden. Der Verkauf könnte gegen Ende Juni beginnen. Ziemlich sicher wäre, dass die Partner ihre Mainboards ausstellen werden, sofern die Vorverschiebungen stimmen - eventuell bloß ohne die X299-Plattform beim Namen zu nennen.   angebliche bisherige Planung angebliche neue Planung Skylake-X Qualificiation Samples Ende Mai, Anfang Juni Ende Mai Skylake-X Produktion Ende Juli, Anfang August Mitte/Ende Juni Kaby Lake-X Produktion Ende Juli, Anfang August Mitte/Ende Juni X299-PCH Mitte Juni bis Mitte Juli Ende Mai Werbefrei auf PCGH.de und im Forum surfen - jetzt informieren. 01:44 Intel: Video zur Fertigung soll Überlegenheit dokumentieren Embed-Code <object id="flowplayer" width="768" height="458" class="playerStyle" data="http://www.pcgameshardware.de/commoncfm/flowneu/flowplayer/flowplayer.unlimited-3.2.15.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="movie" value="http://www.pcgameshardware.de/commoncfm/flowneu/flowplayer/flowplayer.unlimited-3.2.15.swf" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="flashvars" value="config=http://www.pcgameshardware.de/commoncfm/flowneu/config_emb_js.cfm%3Fvid%3D73443%26a%5FicategoryId%3D7%26article%5Fid%3D1225315%26product%5Fid%3D259478%26sAdSetCategory%3Ddefault" /></object> Für die Verwendung in unseren Foren: [ctecvideo]73443[/ctecvideo] Dieses Video bequem und kostenlos in unserer App Games TV 24 sehen.

Plattform ist überfällig und das ist sicher. Allerdings, Mann, hat doch alles auf dem X99 was man braucht und das noch immer für Jahre. Quadchanel, M2, USB 3.0 , PCIE Anbindung 2x16, usw. 40 Lanes .... genug Kerne/Threads. Was soll ein neuer Chipsatz schneller oder besser machen? Welche Vorteile hast du dann ? Wenn ich heute eine neue Plattform bräuchte würde mir auch AMD Ryzen genügen wenn Quadchanel, M2 ! bzw. das was ich jetzt habe auch hätte. Allerdings dann ausgereift und für 35% weniger Kosten. Hoffe ich Higend-Plattformen werden immer benötigt, von wem auch immer und der Kundenkreis ist vorhanden. Aber Intel wird meiner Meinung in der Masse der Kunden zu kämpfen haben. Gut für Uns hoffe ich. Gruss Antworten Zitieren Von KnSN PC-Selbstbauer(in) 11.04.2017 04:16 Uhr @The_Searcher Geiles Avatar von Kanzaki H. Aria! ^^ Antworten Zitieren Von INU.ID Moderator 11.04.2017 03:10 Uhr Zitat von Threshold Die RAM Bandbreite ist sowieso völlig Wumpe. Merkst du ja eben daran, dass du keinen Unterschied merkst. Naja, ich merke schon einen Unterschied in manchen Spielen (ggü. aktueller QuadCore-Plattform). Ich kann lediglich nicht sagen, ob es an den zusätzlichen Kernen, dem größeren Cache, oder der höheren RAM-Bandbreite meiner alten X79-Plattform liegt. Und das RAM-Bandbreite nicht "Wumpe" ist, zeigen die ganzen Tests/Userberichte, die mit schnellerem RAM in vielen Spielen auch "bessere" FPS bekommen. Zitat Was interessiert mich die Rechenleistung? Die ist heute Wumpe, da immer ausreichend vorhanden. Ich rede von der Plattform. Irgendwie ist alles "Wumpe" bei dir, oder? Was bietet denn die aktuellste Plattform so relevantes, was mir selbst meine X79-Plattform (also noch älter als X99) aus 2011/2012 nicht bietet? Ich kann dir sagen was ich vermisse, und das ist lediglich ein M.2-Slot. Mehr als 40 PCIe3.0-Lanes gibts auch heute noch nicht, selbst mein schnellster USB-Stick/USB-Festplatte wird noch nicht vom USB3 meines alten P9X79 Mobos ausgebremst, schnelleres SATA als das SATA3 auf meinem alten Mobo gibt es heute auch noch nicht, und 1GBit-LAN (mit Netto ca. 120MB/s) ist auch heute noch Standard (bzw. 10GBit-LAN hat sich immer noch nicht durchgesetzt). Und wenn ich statt DDR3L-1866 noch schnelleren DDR3-2400 (was mein Mobo max. unterstützt) verbaut hätte, dann hätte ich mit ca. 80GB/s sogar noch ca. 16GB/s mehr Bandbreite, als ein aktuelles 2017er Dual-Channel-System mit DDR4-4000 bieten würde. Ich habe mit 32GB RAM mehr als die meisten User verbaut, und mein altes Mobo unterstützt sogar bis 128GB. Und mein Mobo hat sowohl normale als auch "Power" eSATA3 Ports. Und obwohl es von allen Anschlüssen/Steckplätzen (außer M.2 wie erwähnt) mehr als genug bietet, wird bei keiner einzigen Schnittstelle meines alten Mobos Lane-Sharing betrieben (ich kann bzw. könnte alles gleichzeitig nutzen). Also was genau, außer dem erwähnten M.2-Steckplatz, bietet mir die neuste Plattform denn so Wichtiges, was die fast 6 Jahre alte "Schrott-Plattform" mir nicht bietet? Edit: Zitat von Threshold Mir ist der Schrott zu alt. Sorry, hab dieses Posting von dir erst später gesehen. Dann solltest du vielleicht deine Aussagen etwas präziser formulieren. Es macht schließlich einen Unterschied ob du sagst das etwas Schrott ist (allgemeine Aussage), oder das es lediglich für dich Schrott ist. Deine Aussage ist zwar objektiv betrachtet auch dann noch unsinnig (überspitzt), aber zumindest für dich vielleicht zutreffend. Antworten Zitieren Von ChrisX84 Komplett-PC-Aufrüster(in) 11.04.2017 00:20 Uhr Ich bin auch gespannt, wo sich die 6-Kerner Preis/Leistung-mäßig einordnen können und was die 4-Kerner drauf haben.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IMac: Rumors, Features, Release, Price And Everything You Need To Know Posted: Mar 27 2017, 1:22am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Apr 10 2017, 2:31am CDT, in News | Apple     Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017. The last time Apple updated the iMac was in 2015. Apple executives have confirmed that a new iMac will be released later this year. The 2017 iMac could to unveiled early as the WWDC 2017 in June. On April 4, Apple's Phil Schiller told a small group of journalists that a new iMac is coming and will also appeal to professional users. Don't Miss: This is How to Find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Apple has been under fire for neglecting the desktop for a while now. The official confirmation that a 2017 iMac helps to give iMac users confidence again that new hardware is coming. Microsoft used Apple's moment of weakness in a perfect way. The Surface Studio makes the iMac look like ancient technology. Microsoft in a way is helping Apple iMac fans to get a new iMac sooner than later. The new 2017 iMac needs to be innovative in design and functionality to match Microsoft's stunning device. 2017 iMac Features We can take some pointers from the new MacBook Pro that Apple release end of 2016. Apple might introduce the Touch Bar in the 2017 iMac. Apple has patented the integration of the OLED touch screen on standalone keyboards. LG already said in 2015 that Apple is coming out with an iMac featuring an Retina 8K display. This of course did not happen. One thing that Apple is fond of is though resolution. An iMac Retina 8K is technically possible. The 8K resolution would also allow Apple to give the iMac a bigger screen option. How does a 34" iMac with 8K Display, Core i7 sound? The new iMac will adopt USB-C like the MacBook Pro. This change requires to get new adapters for your peripherals and has already caused a ruckus at the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro.  The are some rumors floating around that Apple would adopt the new AMD CPU Ryzon, replacing Intel. This is not very likely, but possible as Apple uses AMD GPUs in the iMac. Intel started to ship the new 7th Generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core i7 (i7-7700) Processors. The new iMac could adopt the new top of the line Intel Desktop CPUs. A new rumor says that the iMac will adopt Intel Xeon CPUs. 3D is exploding in a big way on Windows 10 this spring. Virtual Reality is driving 3D creation, but Apple has so far no solution for this new big trend. The next iMac is according to a rumor featuring powerful AMD graphics to drive a virtual reality headset. Right now creative companies have to get a Windows Gaming PC to use an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Apple is rumored to work on an augmented reality solution. That is though likely only for the iPhone. 2017 iMac Release Date At this point it is just guessing. April is a possibility for Apple's first event in 2017. Another option is the WWDC 2017, kicking off on June 5. The WWDC kicks off with a keynote that usually brings new Apple hardware. The new iMac requires a media event. WWDC 2017 is the perfect stage for a new iMac reveal. Another rumor puts the iMac 2017 release into October. Apple just unveiled a bunch of new products including a new iPad and iPhone SE on March 21. The iPhone Plus Red went on sale on March 24. 2017 iMac Price The Microsoft Surface Studio is $800 more expensive in the top configuration than any iMac currently available. The new iMac prices could match Microsoft's prices for the top configuration. The lower end iMac models will likely be priced the same or drop slightly. The 2015 iMac starts at $1,099. The most expensive iMac configurable on apple.com has a price of $3,999. iMac deals are available on amazon.com. Should I Wait to Buy a new iMac? We recommend to hold off with the purchase of a new iMac until at least WWDC 2017. If Apple is not releasing the 2017 iMac in June, the release will be in fall. Apple will not launch the new iMac during the summer. Registration for the WWDC 2017 tickets opens Monday, March 27 at 10:00 a.m. PDT. The opportunity to buy tickets to WWDC17 will be offered by random selection. To register, you must be a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program. What is the iMac? In Apple's words: "The idea behind iMac has never wavered: to craft the ultimate desktop experience. The best display, paired with high-performance processors, graphics, and storage — all within an incredibly thin, seamless enclosure. And that commitment continues with the all-new 21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display. Like the revolutionary 27‑inch 5K model, it delivers such spectacular image quality that everything else around you seems to disappear. Adding up to the most immersive iMac experience yet — and another big, beautiful step forward." The iMac is the perfect desktop machine, but it is time for new power, new design, and bigger and better screen. Read the latest Apple News. This story may contain affiliate links.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Chuwi Hi10 Plus Review JC Torres - Apr 9, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 6/10 Pros Extremely affordable price tag Dual boot (Windows 10, Android 5.1) micro USB and USB-C ports Solid build Cons No Remix OS, No Android Nougat Active but not pressure sensitive stylus Moderate but not poor performance Once upon a time, the big names in the device market tried to put Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows side by side on the same machine. Neither platform maker was happy and the likes of Samsung and ASUS backed out for fear of earning their ire. This gave other smaller players, like Chuwi here, to thrive in a market very few dared. The Chuwi Hi10 Plus represents one of the latest of such devices, combining the power of Windows 10 with the mobility of Android in one affordable package. But how does that tempting promise perform in practice? We take the Chuwi Hi10 Plus for a whirlwind tour to find out. Taming expectations Let’s address the elephant in the room from the start. This is no Microsoft Surface 3. It is almost too easy to compare the two, especially considering how similar they are underneath. But one is a $499 device and the other is $199. And while there could be some miracles like that in the smartphone world, it’s admittedly harder to pull off when talking about tablets, especially 2-in-1 PCs. When you put your price that low, something has to give. That being said, you will have to take the Hi10 Plus for what it is: a dual boot Windows and Android tablet with a dirt cheap price tag. It is going to be comparable to some Intel Atom tablets, yes even the Surface 3, but it is its own beast. Keep that in mind and you might be in for a surprise. Hard numbers Disclaimer aside, let’s get down to business. And by that, I mean those specs that no tech review would be complete without. Here is a quick rundown of those hardware bits that make up the brain and muscles of the Hi10 Plus. • Operating System: Windows 10, Android 5.1 • CPU: Intel Atom x5-Z8350, 1.44 GHz quad-core • RAM: 4 GB • Storage: 64 GB, microSD up to 128 GB • Display: 10.8 inches, 1920×1280 • Main Camera: 2 MP • Secondary Camera: 2 MP • Connectivity: 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth, USB-C, micro USB, micro HDMI, • Battery: 8,400 mAh • Dimensions: 276.4 x 184.8 x 8.8 mm • Weight: 686 g Those who keep tabs on all kinds of tablets might see some familiar figures here. The Intel Atom x5 series seems to be favorite of budget Windows 10, and some Android, tablet makers. In fact, the Hi10 Plus’ x5-Z8350 is just a notch lower than the x5-Z8550 found inside the Lenovo Yoga Book. It is, sadly, a class below the Intel Atom x7 series, like what the now practically obsolete Surface 3 has. And speaking of the Surface 3, this is where it’s hard not to make comparisons. In almost every aspect except one or two, the Chuwi tablet has something comparable. 10.8-inch 1920×1280 3:2 screen? Check. Nearly the same dimensions? Check. One key difference is that the Hi10 Plus comes with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage. On the Surface 3, the 4 GB RAM configuration is paired with 128 GB of storage. The other difference is that the Chuwi 2-in-1 has 2 megapixel cameras, front and back, that are not worth writing home about. The display is clear but isn’t exactly the brightest. That, plus the very reflective surface, makes it painful to use outdoors. The speakers aren’t any better. They sound rather flat and volume levels won’t be enough to fill a small room. You’ll most likely prefer to reach for headphones for all but the shortest sound clips or videos. Design In terms of form factor, the Chuwi Hi10 Plus is more like the ASUS Transformer than a Microsoft Surface. But still, unlike the ASUS 2-in-1s, the price only covers the device itself and doesn’t include any keyboard cover or dock. In essence, the Hi10 Plus is really just a tablet that happens to be designed with a keyboard attachment in mind. The Hi10 Plus definitely looks premium and its solid and rather hefty build reinforces that impression. The back is plastic though painted with a metal finish to make it look more premium than it really. The sides, however, are metal and the chamfered edges might cut into your palm if you hold it long enough. Not that you will want to, given its weight. On the back, you have nothing but the required brand and legal markings. While there technically is no camera bump, the way the back curves towards the edges leaves apart of the camera sticking out. And odd design and an accident waiting to happen. Most of the sides are bare. The right (or bottom, depending on how you hold it) has a lone speaker grille. The top (or right) has the power button and volume rocker only. In stark contrast, the left edge is very busy. You have all the physical ports and slots there, in addition to the second speaker grille. You have a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a micro HDMI port, a microSD card slot, a micro USB port and, surprisingly, a USB-C port. The last is where the Hi10 Plus draws power and the micro USB is used solely for data. It’s reassuring to know that you can charge the device while still have room for any external storage or peripheral. A full USB port would have been nice, but at this size, it would have been nearly impossible. On the bottom edge lies the only proof that the Hi10 Plus is meant to more than just a tablet. There you have pogo pins and magnetic holes where keyboard accessories can snugly fit in. Unlike with the Surface, however, a keyboard isn’t really an integral part of the tablet’s experience Dual boot There have been cheap Windows 10 tablets bearing these specs, and some odd Intel-powered Android tablets, too. What makes the Chuwi Hi10 Plus special, of course, is that it combines both for the low, low price of one. On one side, you have Windows 10 Home. On the other, you have a pretty vanilla Android 5.1. If you’ve ever used a dual boot Windows/Android device before, you’ll be familiar with how this works. From Windows, you click on an icon on the desktop to start the process, which will reboot the tablet straight into Android. On Android, the action to boot into Windows is in the Quick Toggles menu. Sadly, the dream of a near seamless way to run Windows and Android side by side died with the Samsung ATIV Q. Rebooting from one OS to another takes anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds. And that depends on whether Windows won’t be stuck with installing an update before rebooting. Suffice it to say, don’t rely on it too much when you’re in a hurry. This fine mutual co-existence, however, has some caveats. As mentioned, the device only has 64 GB of storage which has to be shared between the two platforms. And Windows is not known to be efficient when it comes to storage space. Fortunately, Chuwi did the sensible thing and give most of that space to Windows. Even then, of the roughly 45 GB of space, only half of that is available to the user. That leaves Android with a little over 10 GB of room, only 6 GB of which can be used by the user. It definitely feels rather suffocating. You can expand the storage with a microSD card, but be warned. While the Hi10 Plus can, in theory, support a 128 GB card, you have to be careful how you format it. Android is very picky and won’t read cards formatted as NTFS. Even those using exFAT might be rejected. Your best bet would be to reformat the card (after backing it up, of course) using Android’s own service. This all raises the question of what benefit a dual boot system has, given the constraints above. There will always be those who find both Windows and Android to be inadequate for certain use cases and wished they had both without really needing to have two devices. Chuwi’s Hi10 Plus and its other tablets are the answers to that with. Although improving, Windows still isn’t great at touch screens and mobile apps while Android, at least version 5.1 Lollipop, has a long way to go in productivity. There is one rather unfortunate note about this dual boot setup that would have addressed that last bit about Android. Earlier units of the Hi10 Plus actually used Remix OS, a custom Android experience that has been fine-tuned for desktops, laptops, and mini PCs, with its movable windows and desktop interface. In short, it’s perfect for the Hi10 Plus. It seemed, however, that stability issues forced Chuwi to revert to a plain Android ROM. While some might prefer a “pure” Android experience, Android 5.1 is woefully old and lacks Nougat’s split-screen multi-tasking. As such, while the Android side might be great for a touch screen tablet experience, it might fall short in laptop form. Performance Remember that part about taming expectations? This is where it might be needed the most. Intel’s Atom platform has never been about performance. It was supposed to be Intel’s response to ARM’s dominance in the mobile market, offering a “power efficient” SoC for Intel phones and tablets. In practice, however, it failed to deliver even on that. The one things that Atom had going for it was that it opened the doors for fanless and cheap mobile devices. Not that the Atom x5-z8350 is terrible, mind. It has enough power and “energy efficiency” for going beyond menial computing tasks. Document editing, web browsing, and the like are easy peasy. So, too, are videos, since you won’t be going beyond FHD quality anyway. With some careful planning and configuration, you can do even more taxing productivity tasks. The x5-z8350 can even handle some very constrained programming on the sides. You can, however, forget about most PC or Android gaming, unless they’re on the casual side. Or unless you’re willing to dial down your game’s settings to low. Multi-tasking is helped by the 4 GB RAM. Strangely, Chuwi clocked that down to 1066 MHz, even if it’s capable of 1600 MHz. That is part of its power-saving measures but at the expense of performance. You can clock it back up in the BIOS settings and most users who have done so have reported no negative consequences other than a shorter battery life. Despite the 8,400 mAh battery, Chuwi can only promise 4 to 6 hours of battery life on average. Again, Windows isn’t exactly known for being a battery saver. Android might fare a bit better in this regard. Chuwi advertises quick charging, though that is mostly thanks to the use of USB-C and not through any technology on Intel’s or Chuwi’s end. And even then, 5 hours to fully charge the giant battery might not sound so quick. Accessories Because the Chuwi Hi10 Plus is at a low, low price of $200, you might end up with enough room in the budget for extras. Depending on what you want to use the tablet for, these may or may not be essential to your overall experience. The good news is that they are also at the fraction of the price of comparable accessories for other tablets. That said, some of them might disappoint you. The $20 Active Stylus, for example, is advertised to allow you to write or draw on the tablet like on paper. If you presume this would be like the Microsoft Surface Pen or the Samsung S-Pen, you’d be dead wrong. This stylus would be more like an Adonit Jot Dash that has a very fine and solid tip for more precise input. It isn’t, however, pressure sensitive, just like Adonit’s stylus. It needs to be recharged as well, but any micro USB cable would do. Thankfully, no silly stylus jutting out of your tablet. You have to press a button on the clip to turn it on and press and hold to turn it off. A helpful LED light tells you if it’s on. And in case you forget to turn it off, it will do so by itself in a few minutes. Then there’s the $57 Docking Keyboard, which is exactly just that, a docking keyboard. It has two full-sized USB ports to extend the Hi10 Plus’ connections, LED indicators for power and Caps Lock, and that’s pretty much it. There is no backlighting here. No extra battery or storage either. At 635 g, it weighs nearly as much as the tablet itself but has barely anything to show for it. It does keep the tablet turned laptop from toppling over, but it would have been nice if it had a battery inside as well. Despite the wide space, the chiclet keys are small and cramped. They do have a good amount of travel that typists look for. The touchpad is plastic with a matte texture. You can click on the left or right area for mouse clicks but the touchpad also supports multi-finger gestures as well. There’s also a Keyboard Cover that mimics the functionality of the Surface Type Cover but uses a tri-fold ala the Apple Smart Keyboard to prop up the tablet in a single angle. It also connects magnetically to the Hi10 Plus, so there’s no need for charging and no need to worry about Bluetooth. This case costs $37. Wrap-up It might be too easy to say “you get what you pay for”, but too often that’s used pejoratively. In the case of the Chuwi Hi10 Plus, however, that is far from the whole picture. You’d be hard pressed to find a $200 tablet that has “good enough” specs and ran Windows 10 and Android side by side. It has the combination of hardware and software to get you through your day, be it work or play, and, with the right accessories, you can turn what is a consumption device into a creation device. Within limits, of course. Sure, Chuwi could have perhaps done better in some regards, but that would have changed the entire message of the Hi10 Plus. One of the great things about Chuwi is that it actually has a product for almost any tier and budget. And it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. There are more capable devices, even dual boot 2-in-1 tablets, but for a higher price as well. But if you’re strapped or cash and need a single device that performs both simple Windows and Android duties, the Chuwi Hi10 Plus isn’t going to disappoint you that much.

Using any of these methods, you can rotate your desktop screen easily. In the following list, I have added few methods which rely on third party software, while some of them can do that using Windows native features. Using all of these methods, you can rotate your desktop screen in 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. I don’t know why you will want to rotate your desktop screen, but the methods that can help you do that are mentioned below. Sponsored Links 5 Methods To Rotate Windows Desktop Screen Method 1: Rotate Windows Desktop Screen using Windows 10 Display Settings The very first method in my list to rotate Window desktop screen uses  the native Display settings. And in Windows 10 you an easily find them and use to change the orientation of you monitor. Using this method, you can easily rotate your desktop screen in all the four rotations. You can rotate your desktop screen in Portrait, Landscape, Portrait flipped, and Landscape flipped. Using this method to rotate Windows desktop screen is very easy. Just right click on the desktop and then choose Display Setting option. After that, Settings windows will pop up. Navigate to the Orientation drop-down and choose the rotation method that you want. Now, hit the Apply button and your desktop will be rotated according to the rotation you chose. You can see the above screenshot. Method 2: Rotate Windows Desktop Screen using Intel Graphics Options You may be aware of Intel Graphics as it is the most common display driver software for PCs. If you thought that it can only make the computer display better, then now you need to know that it can do much more than that. Using Intel Graphics options, you can easily change various settings of your PC monitor including rotation. And also there are some hotkeys predefined in the software to do that. If you already have Intel Graphics software installed on your PC, then you can easily rotate windows desktop. Intel Graphics drivers are model specific so I cannot provide a download link to that. So, yo will have to download them from your computer manufacturer website. I am assuming that there is already Intel Graphics software available on your PC. To rotate Windows desktop screen using Intel Graphics options, use the desktop’s right-click menu and then choose Graphics options from it. After that, from the main Interface choose the rotation that you like to have on your PC. Method 3: Rotate Windows Desktop Screen using a GUI based Software Till now, I have shown you methods to rotate desktop screen which don’t need any third party software. But, now I will tell you about a freeware known as iRotate that can do the same. iRotate can rotate your desktop screen all the four possible orientations and by just a single click or via hotkey. Download and install iRotate from the above link and then launch it. You will see that it will place its icon in the system tray. Right-click on its icon and it will show the four rotation options in it. Choose any rotation option and the selected rotation will be applied to your desktop screen. Also, you can use the hotkeys (Ctrl +Alt + arrow keys) to do the same while the software is running. Method 4: Rotate Windows Desktop Screen using another software EeeRotate is another free software to rotate Windows desktop screen. The software is quite unique among all the software as it operates by hotkeys rather than a GUI or commands. In order to make it work , you just have to keep it running in the system background. And use various hotkeys to rotate desktop screen. It adds its icon in the system tray. Getting started with EeeRotate is pretty simple. Download the setup file of EeeRotate from the above link and then install it on your PC. Do note that, the software will not appear in the Start Menu or Desktop. You will have to run it by double clicking on its EXE file which can be found at C:\Program Files (x86)\EeeRotate folder of your PC. After running the software, you can use Ctrl+Alt+ arrow keys to rotate you desktop by 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. But make sure that the software is running in the background. Method 5: Rotate Windows Desktop Screen using a Command line software. Apart from using a GUI based software, there is a command line software known as Display, that lets you rotate display from command prompt. To rotate Windows desktop using this command line tool, you will have to run certain commands. Alternatively, you can make the batch file for each rotation and execute it whenever you want to rotate your desktop. Apart from rotating the desktop screen, you can also do various other tasks such as change brightness, contrast (Display adapter dependent), display properties, turn off the monitor, etc. To get started with Desktop, grab its EXE file from the above link and then copy it to the C:\Windows folder. After that, you can run display commands from any location of your PC. To change the rotation of your desktop using Display software, run the following command. display /rotate:90 After running the above command, you desktop will be rotated by 90 degrees. You can replace 90 with 180, 270 to rotate and put 0 for normal orientation. Final Words These were some pretty cool methods to rotate Windows desktop screen. All of these method do what they say and you can apply them on your PC to rotate your desktop. By the way, why are you trying to rotate your desktop? Do let me know in the comments below.

Ltd, AT&T Inc., and NETCOM On-Line Communication Services, Inc. among others. IoT combines hardware, embedded software, communication services, and IT services. IoT helps create smart communication environments such as smart shopping, smart homes, smart healthcare, and smart transportation. The major components of IoT include WSN (Wireless Sensor Network), RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), cloud services, NFC (Near Field Communication), gateways, data storage & analytics, and visualization elements. IoT helps in effective management and monitoring of the multiple interconnected. IoT security can be addressed through network powered technology. The Internet of Things has access to organizations existing operational technology (OT) networks and information technology in addition to multiple devices, sensors and other smart objects. Increasing dependence on the existing network connectivity gives rise to challenges including security threats. The priority and focus of the IT network is to protect data confidentially and secure access, ensuring operational and employee safety. Thus, there is an increased demand for IoT security solutions at workplace. The companies such as Cisco systems are trying to develop the approach that combines physical and cyber security components for employee safety and protection of the entire system. Request to view table of content @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/4982 To ensure the efficient functioning of devices such as smartphones, tablets, and PDAs at workplace, it is crucial to maintain network infrastructure security.

The researchers report that the massive increase is the result of adware bundling. McAfee catalogued more than 450,000 malware incidents in the fourth-quarter of 2016 compared with just over 50,000 in the same quarter of 2015. Vincent Weafer, a McAfee Labs vice-president, told Dark Reading that the main driver of the increase was OSX/Bundlore, an installer program that combines legitimate apps with offers from third-party apps that users may not want but that are installed by default and may be difficult to find and remove. While the volume of malware found on Mac OS shot higher in the fourth quarter, the volume is minuscule compared to the “tens of millions” of attacks launched against PCs running Microsoft Windows. Weafer expects the number of attacks against Mac OS to drop, but overall the attacks continue to grow against Macs, PCs, Android devices and iOS devices. The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices takes the security threats to even higher levels. In connection with the additional threat from the explosive growth of IoT devices, McAfee Labs noted that there were more than 15 billion internet-connected devices in operation at the end of last year and that the number will rise to 200 billion by 2020. The report also contains a detailed history and examination of the Mirai botnet that caused the largest-ever distributed denial of service attack ever last October.

Peter Bright - Apr 10, 2017 9:40 pm UTC Enlarge / What's all this gaming blather about Ryzen? Let us explain. Mark Walton reader comments 64 Share this story While AMD's new Ryzen processors offer impressive performance to workloads such as software compilation, media encoding, 3D rendering, and indeed, anything that can take advantage of the 8 cores and 16 simultaneous threads, certain aspects of its gaming performance were uneven. It's still a very strong performer in games, especially for those who like to stream their gameplay to Twitch, but not consistently so. Some games that were expected to perform well on Ryzen didn't. Testers also observed that there were some troublesome interactions with both power management and Ryzen's simultaneous multithreading (SMT), with certain titles showing unexpectedly high performance drop-offs from having these features enabled. There was widespread hope that some combination of game patches and perhaps even operating system changes would go some way toward boosting Ryzen's gaming performance, or at least, making Ryzen perform in a more consistent way. The last few weeks have seen the release of a couple of game patches designed to address certain Ryzen issues. AMD has also released guidance to game developers on how best to use its processor, as well as a new power management profile for Windows 10. Together, we can gain some insight into some of the complexities of developing game software for modern processors and get some understanding of what kind of performance gains gamers might hope to see. Patches make everything better The first big Ryzen patch was for Ashes of the Singularity. Ryzen's performance in Ashes was arguably one of the more surprising findings in the initial benchmarking. The game has been widely used as a kind of showcase for the advantages of DirectX 12 and the multithreaded scaling that it shows. We spoke to the game's developers, and they told us that its engine splits up the work it has to do between multiple cores automatically. In general, the Ryzen 1800X performed at about the same level as Intel's Broadwell-E 6900K. Both parts are 8-core, 16-thread chips, and while Broadwell-E has a modest instructions-per-cycle advantage in most workloads, Ryzen's higher clock speed is enough to make up for that deficit. But in Ashes of the Singularity under DirectX 12, the 6900K had average frame rates about 25 percent better than the AMD chip. In late March, Oxide/Stardock released a Ryzen performance update for Ashes, and it has gone a long way toward closing that gap. PC Perspective tested the update, and depending on graphics settings and memory clock speeds, Ryzen's average frame rate went up by between 17 and 31 percent. The 1800X still trails the 6900K, but now the gap is about 9 percent, or even less with overclocked memory (but we'll talk more about memory later on). PC Perspective tested Ashes of the Singularity before and after the patch. PC Perspective It's not entirely known what Oxide and Stardock changed in the patch (we've asked but are still waiting on an answer), but there is some credible speculation that there were two issues (possibly intertwined) at play, both related to how data is loaded and stored in memory. Out-of-order execution is a complicated thing While much has been made of Ryzen's cache layout, and in particular its large, split level 3 cache, the Ashes changes aren't believed to be around cache, but instead relate to a processor's load and store queues. The processor does not simply read and write directly from and to cache or memory. Instead, reads (loads) and writes (stores) are buffered. The reason for this is that the processor executes instructions speculatively and out of order, but the results of that execution—the actual reads and writes to memory—need to occur in the order that the program specifies, and speculative writes that don't actually occur need to be cancelled. The buffers are where this all happens. For example, branch prediction means that the processor might start executing a set of instructions without knowing for certain if it should skip over them instead. If those instructions perform writes to memory, the write is put into the store buffer. If the processor subsequently determines that the branch predictor was correct, the store can be retired and written to memory. But if it discovers that the branch predictor was wrong, and the instructions should never have been executed at all, it can invalidate the store in the store buffer, canceling the write to memory before any other core can see it. The processor can use the store buffer to fulfill load requests, too; if a store in the buffer should come before a load, the buffered store can be used to provide the value that would otherwise be read from memory, a process called store forwarding. Managing these buffers and their interactions with out-of-order execution is complex. The processor has to make sure that, for example, writes to the same location are handled properly and that the writes show up in the correct order. Certain sequences of instructions can cause performance problems. Intel's optimization guides contain tables showing which combinations can forward and which cannot; the exact results depend not just on the architecture of the chip but on the size of the store and the memory addresses being used. The patterns are not always simple. For example, with a 32-byte store, a 4-byte load can be forwarded if the memory address divided by 32 has a remainder of 0 to 4, 8 to 12, 16 to 20, or 24 to 28. But if the remainder is 5 to 7, 13 to 15, 21 to 23, or 29 to 31, the load won't be forwarded. Optimizing compilers should know the rules about things like store forwarding and should strive to produce code that follows the rules as best it can. If it gets things wrong, the result can be bad performance. Sometimes this can be unavoidable, but often the compiler has several options for how it could generate equivalent code, and it needs to figure out which one is best. Reportedly, the Visual C++ compiler from Visual C++ 2015 could produce sequences of two stores followed by a load in such a way as to stall the store queue, blocking writes to memory until the processor can flush its outstanding instructions. Visual C++ 2017 has a new optimizer, and that apparently avoids the bad sequence of instructions, and hence the performance problem. Bypassing the cache; sometimes it's good, sometimes it's awful Enlarge col_adamson The other suggestion about the Ashes patch is about the use of a set of instructions called non-temporal instructions. These are a series of load and store instructions that are designed to bypass the cache. For most data, the cache is a wonderful thing, because the cache is so much faster than main memory. But sometimes, the programmer knows that after reading to or writing from a particular memory address, the data won't be used any time soon, and so there's no point in caching it. In fact, caching the data would be a waste of cache space; caching that data will simply mean displacing something else from the cache, something else that might actually be needed. The non-temporal instructions allow the processor to store data to main memory bypassing the cache on the way out. They also have some other properties. Non-temporal stores are write combining: multiple writes to the same 64 bytes of memory are combined into a single 64 byte write operation. They're write collapsing: multiple writes to the same byte are collapsed into a single write (so only the last value written is ever visible to other applications). They're also weakly ordered: non-temporal writes don't interact with the normal store and load buffers and so may appear in memory in an order that doesn't correspond with the program's write order. Used correctly, these can provide some of the fastest writes to memory, 64 bytes at a time, without disturbing any valuable cached data. But if you use them incorrectly, performance can drop off a cliff. The non-temporal writes are buffered in buffers the size of a cache line, and there's a limited number of these buffers. If a program tries to perform non-temporal writes to too many different cache lines simultaneously, the processor ends up having to perform a bunch of partial cache line writes instead of nice big 64-byte writes, and performance drops. If a program mixes regular and non-temporal stores to the same cache line, the performance drops. If the program mixes loads with non-temporal stores to the same cache line, the performance drops. Although the writes are meant to be collapsed, on at least some processors, if a byte on a cache line is written more than once, performance drops. The nature of the performance hit will also tend to vary on a processor-by-processor basis. A penalty that may be negligible on one chip could be substantial on another. The belief is that Ashes of the Singularity did something with non-temporal instructions that was harmless, or perhaps even desirable, on other chips but particularly detrimental on Ryzen. The performance update changes how the instructions are used to avoid the problem. Most non-temporal instructions control stores, but there's also a non-temporal load instruction and a set of prefetching instructions that include a non-temporal variant. These are supposed to load data into some levels of cache, without requiring it to be loaded into other levels of cache. The precise meaning of the prefetch instructions varies from processor to processor—at best it is a hint rather than well-defined instruction. Placing the prefetch instructions in the right place is tricky; do it too early, and the prefetched data will be discarded by the time it's needed anyway. Do it too late, and the prefetched data still won't have been loaded by the time you need it. Worse, prefetched data can displace data that would be used from cache, causing performance degradation.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / Memory / SK Hynix introduces 72-layer 3D NAND SK Hynix introduces 72-layer 3D NAND Matthew Wilson 13 hours ago Memory, SSD Drives There has been a lot of innovation in the memory market recently. First Intel launched its 3D XPoint technology and now, SK Hynix is introducing the industry’s first 72-layer 256 gigabit 3D NAND flash based on TLC arrays. By moving up to 72-layers, SK Hynix is able to stack 1.5 times more cells than it currently can on 48-layer 3D NAND. A single 256 Gigabit NAND Flash chip can represent 32GB of storage- an upgrade over 48-layer 3D NAND, which has only been in mass production since November 2016. According to SK Hynix, the jump to 72-layer paves the way for around 30 percent more manufacturing productivity. This is achieved by stacking more cells and utilising current mass production facilities. Image Source: SK Hynix SK Hynix Vice President, Jong Ho Kim, noted that this new 3D NAND will be mass produced in the second half of 2017: “With the introduction of this industry’s highest productivity 3D NAND, SK Hynix will mass produce the 256Gb 3D NAND in the second half of this year to provide this to worldwide business clients for optimum use in storage solutions. The company plans to expand the usage of the product to SSDs and mobile gadgets such as smart phones to further improve its business structure weighted towards DRAM”. KitGuru Says: It certainly is impressive that SK Hynix has managed to jump to 72-layer 3D NAND already, given that its 48-layer memory chips only began shipping in November last year.

The folks over at BenchLife have some juicy tidbits about Intel's purported X299 platform, along with a little data on the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs that will supposedly go with it. According to the site's sources, the new chipset and its accompanying processors have been rescheduled to launch more than a month before their original launch date. Source: BenchLife If this new data is accurate, Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X are set to launch at some point between the 25th and 27th weeks of 2017. That's toward the end of June or the beginning of July, quite a step forward from what BenchLife believes was originally an August launch window. Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X are expected to be Intel's next offerings in its high-end desktop line, and they'll share the same (and as-yet-unannounced) LGA2066 socket. According to the rumors, Skylake-X CPUs should arrive in varieties ranging from six to ten cores with quad-channel DDR4 memory and oodles of PCIe connectivity. Source: BenchLife Meanwhile, the more mysterious Kaby Lake-X is purportedly a quad-core design with dual-channel memory and up to 16 lanes of PCI Express from the CPU—numbers that sound an awful lot like Intel might repackage mainstream Kaby Lake quad-core CPUs for the new socket. We'll probably learn more about these processors in the coming weeks, as BenchLife thinks Intel will showcase the new platform and its CPUs at Computex starting on May 30.

Following the recent launch of its enterprise-focused Optane SSD devices, Intel unveiled its M.2 Optane memory modules aimed at consumers. The devices will be available with 16GB and 32GB storage capacities, and can turn your computer into a lighting-fast machine. Technology and Performance Optane storage technology is based on a non-volatile memory technology called 3D Xpoint, which is being developed by Intel and Micron. The basic premise of 3D XPoint involves stacking thin layers of memory in a cross point structure to optimise density and reduce size. Unlike solid state drives, 3D Xpoint storage devices do not degrade due to continuous operation. Intel has leveraged the increased speed and durability of this technology to provide consumers with lightning-fast storage cache solutions in the form of its Optane drives. The 16GB and 32GB drives are used as cache for applications, meaning you will not notice any performance increase the first time you start an application. After running an application, however, it is saved in cache and will start up much faster when you next access it. This means that professional users will experience faster load times and data processing speeds in frequently-used applications, while gamers will enjoy shorter load times. Due to the increasing size of game files, Intel recommends gamers opt for the 32GB Optane drive in order to maximise accelerated gaming performance. Requirements Users will need the following hardware in order to use Intel’s Optane memory chips: Intel 7th-generation Core processor Intel Z270 series chipset M.2 type 2280-S1 B-M connector PCH Remapped PCIe Controller with x2/x4 PCIe lanes NVMe 1.1 B-M keys Windows 10 64-bit The specifications above may seem daunting, but most ready-built systems will state if they are Optane-ready. Desktop builders should consult their motherboard manufacturer to ensure their board can support an Intel Optane drive. After physically installing an Optane drive, Intel’s Rapid Storage Technology driver will begin using the memory as cache for the system’s slower, primary storage. The caching system is automatically configured to speed up the programs you access the most. Intel Optane memory will begin shipping on 24 April, with OEM systems sporting the memory modules launching later this year. Future applications These Optane products are only the beginning of the change 3D Xpoint technology will bring to modern computing. While the technology is still in its infancy, it already has the potential to scale greatly and could replace slower SSDs and HDDs as primary storage. Intel previously made bold claims regarding the performance and low latency of 3D Xpoint memory, and the memory has been touted to potentially replace DRAM as a low-latency, high-speed memory using a DIMM form factor.

Strong performance improved with Kaby Lake processor. Even longer battery life than before. Supports VR. Cons Expensive. Light on storage. Fans can get loud when gaming. Bottom Line The minimally updated Razer Blade shares last year's design and most of its components, but the upgraded processor and improved battery life make it the best ultraportable gaming laptop you can buy. By Matthew Buzzi Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors and Nvidia's new Pascal graphics means that we've seen scores of laptop updates in recent months. The Early 2017 Razer Blade ($1,899.99), a Kaby Lake-based version of the late 2016 Blade is one such laptop. Our test configuration includes the same display, storage, and graphics hardware as the Editors' Choice Blade we reviewed last December, with modestly improved performance and a longer-lasting battery. The upgrades aren't monumental (but neither is the price increase of $100), and given that the Blade was already our top pick for gamers who value both portability and performance, this model is an easy pick as our Editors' Choice for ultraportable gaming laptops. //Compare Similar Products Compare Razer Blade (Late 2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Alienware 13   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo Legion Y520   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Omen 17   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming (7567)   %displayPrice%%seller% Razer Blade Pro (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% MSI GT62VR Dominator Pro-005   %displayPrice%%seller% Origin EON17-X 10 Series   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Predator 15 (G9-593-72VT)   %displayPrice%%seller% Gigabyte P37X v6   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus ROG G752VS-XB78K Overclocked Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Petite, Packed With Power Since this version of the Blade is a mere component upgrade on the previous model, the laptop is physically unchanged on the outside. It weighs 4.16 pounds 0.7 by 13.6 by 9.3 inches (HWD), exactly the same as the Skylake model. The Alienware 13 measures 0.87 by 13 by 10.6 inches and weighs 5.43 pounds, thicker and heavier despite having a smaller screen than the Blade. The MSI GT62VR Dominator Pro-005 is a 15-inch laptop that offers more power for around the same price, but the form factor isn't nearly as sleek at 1.56 by 15.36 by 10.47 inches and 6.45 pounds. If you like the build and want something even more portable, the 11-inch Razer Blade Stealth is a non-gaming ultraportable with the same design that weighs just 2.91 pounds. On the other end of the spectrum, the premium Razer Blade Pro is a more powerful 17-inch, 7.72-pound version of the Blade with high-end features. The excellent-feeling keyboard and smooth touchpad are maintained here, and connectivity options are untouched. That means two USB 3.0 ports, and a headphone jack on the left, while the right panel holds another USB 3.0 port (all the USB ports are green to match the lid logo), an HDMI port, and a USB-C port with Thunderbolt 3. For wireless connections you get Killer-branded 802.11ac as well as Bluetooth 4.1, and the laptop covered by a one-year warranty. View All 7 Photos in Gallery Since the design is identical, you can read more details and impressions of the keyboard, key lighting, touchpad, and overall build in our review of the Late 2016 Blade. The $1,899.99 starting price for the refreshed Blade gets you 256GB of solid-state storage and a Full HD display (the configuration I'm reviewing here). You can ramp up to a 512GB SSD for $2,099.99, or max out at 1TB for $2,499.99, both with the same 1080p screen. 4K screen options with 512GB ($2,399.99) or 1TB ($2,799.99) have been announced, but are not yet available. Though speedy SSD storage, the 256GB capacity in our unit isn't a lot for gaming, and the drive will fill up pretty quickly. Only 225GB is useable from the start after accounting for the operating system and other essential software, so it will only fit a few modern games alongside other media and files given contemporary install sizes. Jumping up to 512GB is appealing, but it's an extra $200, so you'll have to make a personal judgment call on whether it's worth it for you. The Alienware 13 can also be configured with 512GB for $2,099.99, so the Blade isn't abnormal in this regard—SSD storage is just expensive. As for the 14-inch display, its high picture quality is as strong as on the previous model thanks to In-Plane Switching technology and vibrant colors. The 1080p resolution is a good match for the graphics hardware, since the GTX 1060 inside is solid, but not a high-end card, so going beyond HD will result in frame rate drops. 1080p is the sweet spot for these components, as you'll be able to keep most games at maximum settings at HD. The Alienware 13 opts for a QHD (2,560-by-1,440 resolution) touch display on a smaller 13.3-inch screen, but since it also uses a GTX 1060, you'll see more dropped frames at high settings. If you don't truly need the portability of the Blade (much of its high price can be attributed to its slim build), the excellent, though large, 17-inch HP Omen 17 packs a GTX 1070, a 4K screen, and lot more storage for $1,799. If you choose to wait for the 4K Blade, know that you can only opt for GTX 1060 graphics. Of course, you be able to view native 4K content, so that's not to say the additional screen resolution will be useless, but don't expect to play games at 4K. The 1060 is capable of smooth VR gaming, however, so you hook up your favorite VR headset without worry. Slim, Style, Speed The processor jump is the main attraction here, from a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7-6700HQ in last year's Blade to a 2.8GHz i7-7700HQ. The 16GB of memory remains the same. Due to Intel's relatively new rollout structure of incremental improvements between bigger CPU shifts, the move from Skylake to the newest Kaby Lake generation isn't as pronounced as that between some past iterations, but there are modest improvements in benchmark scores nonetheless. The Blade's PCMark 8 Work Conventional score, which measures general productivity, eked up a few hundred points over the Late 2016 Blade, and put more distance between it and the Alienware 13. The same can be said of the multimedia tests: You can see the new hardware shaves time off the Photoshop and Handbrake tests, and moderately improve the CineBench score. 3D and gaming performance are obviously the big points of interest, and the GTX 1060 performs admirably. The Early 2017 Blade comfortably reached over 60 frames per second (fps) on the Heaven and Valley benchmark test at Ultra settings in HD, an improvement on the Skylake edition which stayed in the low to mid 50fps range on average. As mentioned, the QHD resolution caused the Alienware 13 struggle a bit more on the tests despite also using a GTX 1060—it averaged 39fps on Heaven and 45fps on Valley at the same settings. If you want an option that might not be as flashy or quite as powerful, but still portable and reliable, the Lenovo Legion Y520 is a solid contender with entry-level pricing. In testing, the fans revved up loudly at times, and they were really revving under heavy strain, enough to be a bit distracting. I noticed that in Power Saving mode the fans were limited from whirring at top speeds, but there were corresponding frame rate drops, so that's probably not a worthwhile compromise for most people. The Blade also gets quite hot during gaming sessions, but it's nothing out of the ordinary for a system under load. See How We Test Laptops Battery results on our rundown test notably improve on the newest Blade, jumping to 10 hours and 36 minutes from the Late 2016 Blade's 7:23 time. The first Blade released in 2016 lasted for 5:04 on the same test, demonstrating how Razer has continually improved battery life in a relatively short span of time. The Alienware 13 lasted just 4:56 (the QHD resolution again playing a part), the Legion Y520 for 5:45, and the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming (our Editors' Choice budget gaming laptop) for 11:01. The Best Blade The Early 2017 Razer Blade is a modest upgrade with a more powerful processor, faster performance, and measurably improved battery life in the same compact, high-quality design. It's not worth upgrading if you already own a Late 2016 Blade, but if you're on an older version or less a powerful non-Razer system, this is the Blade to buy. It easily replaces its predecessor as our top gaming ultraportable. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

Share twitter linkedin facebook google+ email Mike Jennings Reviews 10 Apr, 2017 4 Price  £1,675 exc VAT Pros  Fast processor; Professional GPU; Decent screen quality; Solid ergonomics and design Cons  Expensive – especially if more hardware is added Verdict  Huge power and versatility inside a small and smart design – but you’ll pay for it The new Dell Precision 5520 banishes memories of blank and bulky workstations by cramming the latest Intel processors and Nvidia Quadro GPUs inside a sleek metal and carbon fibre frame. This level of extravagance means the Dell isn't cheap, but the £1,675 model we've reviewed is still a little cheaper than its key rival - the Apple MacBook Pro 15. Screen, Keyboard and Trackpad The Precision has a 15.6in screen inside a 14in chassis, with three bezels slimmed down to cram the hardware inside. The panel impresses elsewhere, too: it uses IPS technology, and the screen is sturdy despite its slim 4mm-thick frame. The screen's benchmark results are also solid. The 1,718:1 contrast ratio is excellent, and it remained at 1.666:1 when we dialled the brightness back from its retina-searing level of 378cd/m2 to a reasonable 150cd/m2. Those superb ratios combine with stonking black levels, which mean colours are rendered with subtlety and depth. The average Delta E of 2.21 is decent, and it improved to 0.78 when we dropped the brightness. In other areas, however, the panel is more ordinary. The colour temperature of 7,627K is cool, and it means the screen feels pallid. It's not too uniform, either: backlight strength swung by 13% across the bottom row and 12% across the middle. Those more middling measurements mean this screen is less capable with colour-sensitive work. And, as if to confirm that, the Precision rendered 91.8% of the sRGB gamut but only 66.8% of the Adobe RGB spectrum. Those figures are a little underwhelming for a workstation, especially when Dell boasts of the Precision's 100% Adobe RGB coverage. That disconnect occurs because two different panels are available for this machine. The entry-level model reviewed here has a 1080p screen, but that Adobe RGB designation is only available on the machine's 4K panel - an option that costs an extra £211 but also offers an IGZO touchscreen and Dell Premier Color's professional presets. The 1080p screen has great contrast, black levels and colour accuracy, which means it's solid for most work tasks - but the colour temperature and gamut coverage means it slips behind the superb colours of Apple's Retina display. It also has less real estate than the MacBook, which has a sharper 2,880 x 1,800 resolution. We have few qualms about the Precision's ergonomics. The keyboard is backlit with large buttons, and they depress with a shallow and consistent action that encourages fast, precise typing - and with more travel than the MacBook's butterfly mechanism. The only problem is minor, with larger buttons like the space bar and enter key feeling a little wobbly. The trackpad is one of Dell's gesture-heavy Precision units, and its smooth surface offers pin-sharp operation and two satisfyingly clicky buttons. The MacBook's trackpad is larger though, and offers similar quality. Design & Features The gunmetal lid extends to the Precision's bevelled edges, and the interior is coated with dark carbon fibre. It looks different from the MacBook, with its glossy black and smooth metal, but no worse - and that's no surprise, considering this machine shares its design with the excellent XPS 15. The good-looking exterior offers more versatility than Apple's notebook, with USB 3 and Thunderbolt, a battery indicator and a card reader. The downside, though, is that Dell's machine is chunkier: the Dell's 22mm body is thicker than the 15.5mm MacBook, and both weigh around 1.8kg. This may not be much of a problem, however, as many workstation laptops tend to spend most of their time at a desk. Dell has also loaded this machine up with useful software: the Power Manager serves up battery and power options, while the Precision Optimizer has monitoring information alongside profiles for work applications like CAD tools and graphic design utilities. It's ISV-certified, too. Hardware and Specs The Dell arrives with Intel's Kaby Lake architecture, and its choice of chip outpaces the older Skylake part inside the MacBook. The entry-level Precision includes an i5-7300HQ processor, which has four 2.5GHz cores that Turbo to 3.5GHz, but no Hyper-Threading. Apple's entry-level machine comes with a Core i7-6700HQ that starts at 2.6GHz and Turbo Boosts to 3.6GHz, and it does have Hyper-Threading - but it also uses an older architecture. Graphical grunt comes from the Nvidia Quadro M1200. It's a mid-range mobile chip tuned to the needs of work software, and it has 640 stream processors alongside a 1,093MHz core - a solid specification that also has 4GB of memory. Those specifications are marginally better than the AMD Radeon Pro 450 inside the MacBook, which has 640 stream processors but a slower 800MHz core and just 2GB of dedicated RAM. The Dell has 2,400MHz memory, which is faster than Apple, but its 8GB allocation is half as much as the MacBook offers. Apple fights back in storage, too: the Precision has a 256GB Toshiba XG3 SSD that delivers speeds of 1.4GB/s and 1.1GB/s, but the MacBook's PCI drive delivered speeds of 3.1GB/s and 1.4GB/s - a blazing pace that we've yet to see anyone come close to matching. There's very little to choose between the two machines in benchmarks: the Dell has a newer processor and slightly better GPU, but the MacBook has Hyper-Threading and better storage. They're both exceptionally quick machines with solid benchmark scores - the Dell's overall score of 90 in our application tests isn't far short of the powerful desktop chip we used as our reference result. The Precision has the grunt to run intensive tasks, and its SPECviewperf 12 scores further demonstrated its ability: it returned a solid score of 44.8 in the 3DSMax test, and 61.38 in the SW-03 benchmark. Impressively, Dell's machine produced this level of performance while remaining chilled - the fan noise was modest, and the Precision's exterior only became a little warmer during benchmarks and stress-tests. The processor's peak temperature of 91°C is a tad high, but the clock speed never throttled and the silicon never became unstable. The Precision's three-cell battery lasted for eight hours and 56 minutes in our standard test - a good result that's almost identical to the MacBook. Alternative Specifications Dell's machine is littered with potential upgrades, but this versatility makes it even pricier than the MacBook Pro. Upgrading to a Core i7 costs £151, and deploying a beefy Xeon E3-1505M v6 costs £226. The 4K screen is £211, and doubling the memory costs £93. Upgrading to a 512GB SSD is £327, and doubling the battery capacity costs £31. Fitting a Core i7 CPU, 4K screen and 16GB of memory increases the price to £2,034, which is more than the entry-level MacBook Pro 15. The standard three-year warranty is a generous next-business-day deal, but upgrading to ProSupport costs £193 - and extending that deal is more expensive still. Conclusion The Precision 5520 is a superb laptop that crams huge functionality into a small, attractive exterior. The Kaby Lake processor is fast, and the Nvidia Quadro GPU means this machine will handle graphical tasks with aplomb. Even the entry-level machine is expensive, though, and it's still hindered by its 1080p screen and middling SSD. To fix those problems, you'll need to spend a lot more - which makes the MacBook's Retina display all the more tempting. Regardless of the specification, though, the Precision remains a top-quality choice for workstation power in an impressively small package - the entry-level specification is cheaper than the MacBook, and its customisable components help it become more versatile than the Apple.

"It's unnecessary". "It's too big". "It doesn't have all the features of a watch a quarter of the price". The arguments against the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 are many and varied. What we see, however, is a fashion-forward and quite excellent smartwatch with a genuine twist: modularity of body, lugs and strap choices. It's desirable, a status symbol, and for many perhaps the only kind of decoration that will always be worn. The Modular 45 is unashamedly plush, reflecting the luxury brand to which it belongs. That's something that some people will never understand or accept, in the same way that some would argue buying an Audi isn't worth the money over buying a Skoda. Brands have value and when the world of tech meets the world of fashion, it ruffles feathers - in both good and bad ways. Sure, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is big, it's expensive and, yes, there are cheaper smartwatches that do more. But this is hands down the most attractive Android Wear watch on the market right now. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: Design brilliance Modular design: choose body, lugs and strap Premium metal body and metal backplate 45mm diameter, 13.5mm thick Waterproof to 50m The second iteration of Tag Heuer's Connected smartwatch brings with it a twist, but offers much the same visual appeal as the original model. We loved the chunky and sporty looks of the Connected and the Modular 45 repeats that Carrera-apeing design. Pocket-lint Unlike many of the other Android Wear watches, it's in design that Tag really makes a statement. There isn't a sense of "that'll do" or compromise about it, it feels as though it has been designed and considered by a watch maker - which is perhaps no surprise, seeing as it has been.  Everything from the bodywork to the strap is superior to those cheaper rivals. That's the definition of luxury: being better is what it's all about. While the Modular 45 doesn't have all the technical abilities that some other smartwatches offer, it's the design that makes this watch. It wears well, it looks good and it feels good. It's a watch you want to wear and a watch you want to be seen in. It doesn't feel like an unnecessary gadget and there's no qualm about the choice of materials. Sure, some might baulk at the 45mm body, but that's the same as the analogue Carrera that this watch is based on. It's not a big smartwatch, it's a big watch full stop. Pocket-lint Design improvements over the original Tag Heuer Connected (now called the Connected 46) include the metal backplate: this is even more substantial in the body than the slightly older model, but the big design twist is modularity, which takes this watch into a totally different league. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: Modular marvel Huge number of colour combinations Choose your body, lugs and strap Easy switch modularity If the Connected Modular 45 is a toy for kids who don't want to grow up, then its modularity is only part of the appeal. First of all, the 45 presents you with choices. You can choose the strap which is a fairly common option. Being able to choose the lugs is something else entirely. So is having the option to choose the body materials and bezel colour. Pocket-lint Sure, there are some limitations, but you're not limited to silver or rose gold here: there's titanium, aluminium or gold, there are even diamond bezels. There are matte black bodies with blue bezels, a rainbow of coloured aluminium bezels on a titanium body, or, as pictured here, black ceramic bezel on titanium body and many more. The price will vary depending on what you choose. Being able to choose the lugs is a big point of differentiation too. This is the part that connects the strap to the watch and, with the press of a button, separates from the main body. There are matte black ceramic, diamond crusted, gold or the classic satin titanium lugs.  The important take-away point is that you can buy the watch you want. If you're a gadget fan and you have plenty of cash, you can decide exactly what you want your Tag to look like. There's even the option to buy an analogue watch module, so that you can leave the smartwatch at home, and walk out wearing a mechanical chronograph instead. There's also another consideration: this is Tag Heuer classic design and we suspect that in future there could be the option to buy a different smartwatch as technology evolves. Pocket-lint We've found it easy to break down our test watch into its main component pieces. Separating body, lugs and strap is simple, as is detaching the buckle from the strap. Important if you intend to have various options for different days, meetings, events, moods or whatever else suits you. The one negative is that this modularity does present a natural failure point: there's some movement between the lugs and the body and we have no idea how the mechanism will wear over time. For us using the watch over a short period of time there's been no sign of it, but after a year, we simply can't say. We are also left wondering whether modularisation is a big sell: will people wanted to change parts of their watch repeatedly, or is this play for differentiation only going to be used to buy a unique watch and thereafter be ignored? Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: Hardware and specifications Intel Atom Z34XX, 512GB RAM, 4GB storage GPS, NFC, motion sensors  Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Android Wear 2.0 operating system Behind that premium design the technology doesn't throw up too many surprises, except that this is an Intel powered watch when many are Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100. The Intel Atom Z34XX chipset sits at the heart of this watch as it did the previous model. There's 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage, which you can use to store music on your phone, connecting to Bluetooth headphones, so you can have music without the need for your phone. Pocket-lint Our experience is that this watch is every bit as fast and powerful as other Android Wear watches we've used. It's perhaps more difficult to quantify that as we're not roaming around playing games on the watch - but it reacts to the touch and does what we ask of it without any problems.  There's Wi-Fi on board to let it connect independently to networks, something that's more pertinent in Android Wear 2.0, which now runs much more independently than previous software versions.  The Modular 45 has GPS, NFC (for Android Pay) and motion sensors, as well as a microphone and ambient light sensors. The GPS means it's a better device for tracking location independently, but it lacks the autonomy that comes from having its own 4G connection. There's no such thing here, meaning it's often dependent on your phone for more data, unlike something such as the LG Watch Sport. Pocket-lint There's no heart-rate sensor, so this Tag isn't an out-and-out sports watch. You can use a compatible Bluetooth heart-rate sensor, although we didn't test this ourselves, so we can't comment on performance or compatibility. We don't think that the lack of a heart-rate sensor is a huge deal here: although it offers 50m waterproofing, we can't see that anyone is going to seriously choose it as a sports device. There are plenty of other options, like the Polar V800 or the Garmin Forerunner 920XT, that will happily give you a premium sports experience. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: Display and watch faces 1.39-inch AMOLED display 400 x 400 pixels (287ppi) Sapphire glass The Modular 45 hosts a 1.39-inch fully round display. There are no flat tyres here, like with the Moto legacy watches (which Fossil persists in running with). The Tag offers a 400 x 400 pixel resolution, resulting in 287ppi, which is typical of such a device. Just because it's Tag doesn't mean you'll get more resolution. However, Tag has used an AMOLED panel for rich blacks and covered it with a 2.5mm thick sapphire crystal cover for protection.  Display-wise, we think the Apple Watch S2 looks better, with deeper blacks and more vibrancy. The Apple display also looks closer to the surface, whereas the Connected Modular 45's deep glass - while great that it's sapphire crystal - looks a little deeper set into the body than we'd like. While that means it maintains some of the character of a watch display, it doesn't have that brilliance that some digital displays offer where they appear right on the surface. Pocket-lint There's plenty of brightness, as well as an ambient light sensor, but this Tag isn't strong in bright conditions, partly because the default watch faces are rather conservative and lack contrast. Metal-looking hands rotating over a metal-looking backgrounds don't really standout when in direct sunlight. Still, you can still read the time which is the main point - so we can't complain too much. Watch faces have greater prominence in Android Wear 2.0 than they did in the earlier version, easily changed on the watch with a deliberate swipe across. To help you create your own design Tag gives you a few options with the Tag Heuer Studio or interactive themes. Studio gives you a wide range of options and is best used in conjunction with the Connected app; the interactive themes version limits your options of colours, but will let you add your own complications, such as steps, appointments or battery life for example. Interactive themes perhaps best showcases one of Android Wear's new features, but it doesn't feel fully embraced by Tag: we want a dazzling blue display with those complications, not just the choice of black or white. Pocket-lint Fiddle about and you can again come up with something unique and if you want more then you'll have to reach to the Play Store for a little more.  Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: Android Wear 2.0 software Google Assistant voice control NFC for Android Pay The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is one of the first devices to land with Google's new take on watch software. It's a refreshing change, adding a range of tweaks to make things more exciting throughout. AW2.0 is more mature, it looks better and it's easier to get to the things that matter. One of the exciting elements is that Android Wear is now better at working without a connected phone, or rather, that it's less dependent on the phone it's connected to. The Tag lacks its own 4G connection as we mentioned, but once connected to Wi-Fi, you can download apps directly to the watch, rather than via the phone. Greater independence should mean a better experience for iPhone users who want to pair Apple's device with this watch. Android Wear 2.0: What's new in the major software update for watches? Adding payment support is a popular option as you will simply have to tap to pay in supported locations, while GPS means better tracking for your activities - be that walking or other sports. You'll need to opt for an app that supports that, of course, and unlike many others, Tag isn't pushing a bespoke workout app on you, so select Google Fit, Strava or download something else that suits. Pocket-lint Disappointingly there's no support for one of Android Wear's most interesting additions: rotational input. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 only has one button, which is used for everything from opening the apps menu to triggering Google Assistant. We can't help feeling that more buttons, giving you another plunger to set to, say, a favourite app would have been a nice touch.  Google Assistant, however, works with the microphone, letting you dictate various commands and requests. With Assistant getting more and more connected, you can use it to control your smart home devices, put in a navigation request or to reply to messages. It works well enough, although if there's one software element that's likely to fail, it seems to be Google Assistant, and we found it sometimes slow to get going. There's now also an on-screen keyboard so you can input text directly. It's a little fiddly, but it works well enough if you have the patience and necessity to use it. Pocket-lint Then there's the general crossover with things like Spotify or Netflix, giving you control on your wrist. Or navigation through Google Maps - so you can glance at your watch rather than needing to look at your phone - or through Citymapper, where you can plot the route and follow it on your wrist rather than needing your phone all the time. Overall, it's a much better experience than Android Wear was before, but with the Tag Heuer Connected 46 also updating to Android Wear 2.0, there are only going to be a few minor differences between these two watches. That said, there's still room to make the software slicker, but that's on Google, not Tag.  Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: Battery life 410mAh battery 24 hour life at a push Magnetic charging plate  Battery life is the bane of many mobile devices, none more so than smartwatches. The Modular 45 has a 410mAh battery, charged via a magnetic contact plate that attaches to the rear (which, in turn, needs to connect to a Micro-USB power source). The battery life isn't substantial. It will make it through the day, but don't be fooled into thinking you'll get more life here than you do on other smartwatches. With minimal use you might get into a second day - but more often than not, you'll need to charge this Tag every night. Pocket-lint We've managed, in average use, to end the day with 30 per cent battery, but you typically then lose 15 per cent overnight while you're not wearing it. Should you choose to use the Connected Modular 45 for a GPS event, too, or perhaps play some Bluetooth music, then you'll find things deplete a lot faster. That's pretty much par for course for smartwatches - so Tag Heuer is very much in the same position as everyone else. Verdict The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a lovely smartwatch - the best looking you can buy today. Its focus is firmly seated in fashion, reflecting the brand's Carrera watches with an added emphasis on personalisation. The Connected Modular 45, as its name suggests, not only offers watch face customisation, but physical customisation too - and there is a huge range of options so you can get exactly what you want... if you can afford it. Armed with the credentials to be a wear anywhere premium smartwatch, the 45 also brings GPS and NFC to boost its digital skills, although it's not as fully-loaded as some rival devices. That fits its lofty position, but this isn't a smartwatch that sees a boost in battery or other technical skills: modularly and physical customisation is its forte, ticking every box on the spec sheet isn't. The Connected Modular 45 is an example of what Android Wear has enabled. While the new software is better, it's still brand new and some of that is reflected in the experience of living with this watch, the most obvious being stuttery Google Assistant performance. That will get better as Google and app developers continue to refine things, so we'll give Tag the benefit of the doubt there. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 vs Tag Heuer Connected: What's the difference? What's most important is that this premium smartwatch feels like a premium smartwatch. While others will ape its style and design, there's really nothing that matches its luxury position - and the modular approach is unique. With that said, there's a closeness to the Connected 46 in terms of design and function. That older watch is now cheaper by some £300, and although it lacks some sensors, it might be all the Tag Heuer smartwatch you need. The alternatives to consider... Pocket-lint Tag Heuer Connected 46 It might not be modular by design, but with Android Wear 2.0 incoming the differences between this and its follow-up aren't really that significant.

Others have ARM-based processors. But soon there may be another option. Over the past few months, there have been signs that AMD-powered Chromebooks are on the way. In December, Chrome Unboxed spotted mentions of an AMD-powered board codenamed “Jadeite” in the Chromium repositories. In March, the website spotted another AMD-powered board codenamed “Kahlee.” And now Phoronix notes that Kahlee has also been added to Coreboot code review, giving us a few more details about that particular machine. The board features two M.2 slots (possibly one for solid state storage and another for a wireless card) and an AMD Stoney Ridge processor. While Stoney Ridge isn’t exactly the most exciting tech, it was probably unrealistic to expect an AMD Ryzen chip at this point. While Ryzen chips offer significantly better performance than previous AMD processors, so far AMD has only released Ryzen chips for desktop computers. The lowest-power models are 65 are 65 watt chips that aren’t exactly appropriate for laptop use. But it is still intriguing to see that there’s at least some work underway to get Chrome OS up and running on AMD hardware. Maybe that means when AMD does release Ryzen chips for mobile devices later this year we’ll see Chromebooks as well as Windows computers featuring the chip maker’s latest tech.       Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 2 Comments on "AMD Chromebooks on the way?"

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IMac Aimed At Professionals Says Apple Posted: Apr 10 2017, 10:00am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple     This is exciting. Apple executive confirm new iMac for this Fall that will appeal to Pro users. It totally makes sense to change the target market for the iMac towards professional users. Average consumers do their digital tasks on laptops, tablets and smartphones and do not need desktop computers anymore. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock Lots of professional users like though to work on a big screen with an all-in-one design to avoid clutter. Apple executives have confirmed that the 2017 iMac comes later this year. Speaking to a small group of journalists last week,  Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller said according to TechCrunch that the improved iMacs will appeal to a segment of Pro users, as well. Apple did not give any specifics about the new 2017 iMac with pro appeal. A blog focused on Apple updates, followed up with a rumor what the new iMac would run on unreleased Intel Xeon Intel E3-1285 v6 processor. Customers could opt to upgrade the RAM to 64GB of ECC memory. Xeon CPUs are Intel's chips for small business servers, entry workstations, powerful mobile workstations, storage servers, cloud workstations/media transcode, and edge computing/IoT. The 2017 iMac is also supposed to feature faster NVMe SSD’s, up to 2TB. The AMD graphics to support would enable virtual reality. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C gen 2 are the new ports on the iMac. As rumored before the new iMac could come with new keyboard with touch bar. Pike's Alpha's iMac 2017 specs rumor sounds a bit too like wishful thinking. An iMac with 64GB that has the graphics power to run a HTC Vive definitely sounds what I would buy. The blog report also mentions that the release of the 2017 iMac is in October. The report did not mention the screen resolution of the 2017 iMac. While 8K displays are available now, the prices are still extremely high. It is likely that the new iMac sticks to 5K Retina displays. Read the 2017 iMac report to find out everything that is known so far about the next iMac. The main topic of the small press conference was the Mac Pro. Apple tried to explained why it failed and that they work on a new Mac Pro that will coming 2018. Apple also confirmed to offer again a stand alone Apple Display.  Apple's Federighi spelled out again to journalists that Apple keeps on focusing on the Mac. "The Mac is — we say it over and over, we’re saying it again here — a huge part of our future, we’re deeply invested in it." Read more Apple News. This story may contain affiliate links.

Qualcomm countersuit claims Apple ‘refuses to acknowledge’ the value of its technology Posted 3 hours ago by Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber isn’t welcome in Italy anymore | Crunch Report Apple filed a billion-dollar royalty lawsuit against Qualcomm in January and today the chipmaker hit back with a legal case of its own against the iPhone maker which, it claims, has refused to acknowledge the value of its technology. In the original suit, Apple claimed that Qualcomm — which makes money from licensing its patents to technology makers — was charging it for patents “they have nothing to do with.” That, Apple said, included TouchID, display panels and camera components. Apple also accused Qualcomm of inflating prices through its licensing model. “Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies,” Qualcomm executive VP and general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. In more specific details, Qualcomm claimed Apple had “breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm,” adding that the phone maker “interfered” with its manufacturing partners that build the iPhone and iPad and use Qualcomm licenses. Things get more dramatic with the iPhone 7. There are different versions of the device in the U.S. running modem chips from both Intel and Qualcomm. Apple had previously suggested that the Intel-powered devices were superior and were therefore being pared back to ensure that customers had the same quality regardless of the internals. Qualcomm has, unsurprisingly, not taken too keenly to that. The firm said that Apple “chose not to utilize the full performance” and then “misrepresented the performance disparity” between it and Intel’s tech. Further, Qualcomm claimed Apple threatened it from going public to explain that its tech was actually behind the superior iPhone. “[Apple] has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry,” Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, added. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Qualcomm Founded 1985 Overview Qualcomm is an American fabless semiconductor company that designs, manufactures, and markets digital wireless telecommunications products and services.

On the topic of Everend’s unique artistic style, team member Megan Daniels explains that “We had three to four strong digital painters on our team, so we really wanted to play that up with a very painterly style.” With its earthy colors and interesting textures, Everend boasts an abundance of beautiful landscapes, the likes of which invite players to explore and discover. Along with stunning visuals, Everend has an intriguing storyline as well. Telling the story of a young, injured owl lost in a cave, players have to help the owl find her way home. . . with some twists involved. To get an idea of what the game is like, a player’s initial experience will be as follows: “You awake with a start, only to find yourself in a dark and dreary cavern, all alone and feeling very confused. Your last recollection is of being in the loving embrace of your mother, but she is now simply nowhere to be found. You rack your brains for anything, anything that might explain how you may have found yourself in a place like this, but fall short in this attempt, for nothing will come to mind. But wait . . . oh yes, that’s right – the volcano. It erupted. And now you are here. All alone. “You quickly decide that the first order of business is to pick a direction and start walking (after all, doing something must be better than doing nothing). This soon proves to be a more difficult task than you initially had thought, for all too frequently you find yourself struggling to avoid the protruding stalagmites that scatter the puddle-ridden ground of the cave. Fortunately, this task does not prove impossible, for your way is dimly lit by the glow cast by the luminescent mushrooms that speckle the cavern walls. “You turn the corner and gasp with discomfort as a blinding flash of white light assaults your unprepared eyes. Squinting, you can just make out the form of a large shimmering owl towering over you, enticing you to come near. . .” Sound interesting?

With the device’s release date rumored to be approaching, the first reliable rumor about the upcoming 2-in-1 hybrid device has been released. Interestingly, the new rumor states that the Surface Pro 5 would not be as game-changing as previously thought. Initial speculations regarding the Surface Pro 5 pointed to the device being equipped with all the bells and whistles that the computing industry currently offers. According to noted tech journalist and reliable source Paul Thurrott, however, the upcoming Surface Pro 5 would most likely be a minor upgrade over the Surface Pro 4. The reporter stated that the while the 2017 flagship hybrid device would indeed be equipped with an Intel Kaby Lake processor, it would retain most of the features of the Surface Pro 4. Even the device’s long-rumored departure from its proprietary connector to USB-C would also not be happening, according to Thurrott. #SurfacePro5 Is Not Expected to Feature Dramatic Changes When Compared to Surface Pro 4 – No Thunderbolt 3 Then? https://t.co/FdxqmSCLTh pic.twitter.com/uYpufatuHs — G.O.O.P. (@GamingOOPlanets) April 7, 2017 Rumors of a Surface Pro 5 rocking a USB-C connector have been emerging over the past few months. With industry leaders such as Apple and HP releasing flagship machines that exclusively utilize the reversible connector, speculations were high that Microsoft would be following suit. After all, the Surface Pro series’ proprietary charger, which Microsoft had been utilizing for years, appears to be due for an update. Nevertheless, the absence of USB-C in the Surface Pro 5 has actually been received fairly well by fans of the device. In the comment section of Thurrott’s post alone, many Surface users actually stated that they appreciate the fact that Microsoft would be keeping the device’s special magnetic charging connector. Others even indicated that it is simply far too early for Microsoft to jump into the USB-C bandwagon. Considering that the Surface Pro 5 is one of its most critical devices, it makes perfect sense for Microsoft to avoid risks as much as possible. Thus, its decision to not feature USB-C in the Surface Pro 5 might not be such a bad idea after all. If Microsoft does end up simply updating the Surface Pro 4’s processor, however, there is a good chance that the upcoming device might not make as much of an impact in the portable computing market as initially expected. After all, the Surface Pro 4 remains a capable machine to this day. If the Surface Pro 5 retains its predecessor’ design, display and most of its internals, users of the current flagship hybrid might not find the new device compelling enough to warrant a purchase. #MicrosoftSurface #SurfacePro5 – Surface Pro 5 might not be launching in April : While there have been reports… https://t.co/cuylgw5ZHI pic.twitter.com/vU82gTV496 — Afif Rakhman C S (@MrCunz) April 4, 2017 While initial details about the Surface Pro 5 remain scarce, however, persistent rumors about the device have continued to emerge nonetheless. Currently, speculations remain high that the Surface Pro 5 would still have a few tricks up its sleeve, despite its lack of significant design changes, according to a TechRadar report. Among these is the rumored addition of an LTE version of the device that would be powered by an ARM-based processor. Microsoft has already released a demo of Windows 10 running on an ARM chip. Thus, there is still a good chance that the first cellular-capable Surface Pro device would still make it this year. Speculations are also high that the upcoming flagship would be equipped with some useful tools that would significantly boost its users’ productivity. Among these are an improved rechargeable Surface Pen and the addition of a smaller Surface Dial, which would most likely benefit users who rely on their Surface Pro devices for graphics-intensive creative tasks. The Surface Pro 5’s release date remains unknown as of date, though speculations are high that the upcoming flagship hybrid device would make a debut within the next few months. Pricing for the Surface Pro 5 has also not been leaked, though rumors are high that the machine would be priced starting at around $899 for the base model.

Industry Perspectives Bye-bye, Big Box: Hyper-converged Infrastructure Waking Up Storage Market by Industry Perspectives  on April 10, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Lee Caswell VMware Lee Caswell is Vice President of Products, Storage & Availability Business Unit, for VMware Enterprise storage has been the sleepy part of IT. While servers and networks have been completely reimagined over the past ten years, big-box storage has changed relatively little and is more often viewed as a necessary evil than a business driver. But there is reason to be excited about storage today as Moore’s Law rouses storage in the same way that it revolutionized servers a decade ago. What’s driving the storage revolution is the advent of hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI), a new approach to data center IT that consolidates software-defined storage services with virtual servers. The HCI approach is being championed by VMware and a growing set of startups now that fast flash drives and cheap servers provide a powerful, converged hardware base that can be “software-defined.” We’re still in the early phases of HCI adoption, but we can expect the compelling management and TCO benefits to push HCI into mainstream market adoption. The disaggregation of custom storage systems will look familiar to industry veterans who tracked UNIX server market fortunes following the advent of x86 servers. In many ways, HCI market adoption is an exact parallel where expensive, complex RISC architectures and custom local area networks were abandoned for cost-effective, industry-standard servers.  In fact, if you examine the market trends that shook up the server market back then, what is beginning to happen now in the storage market seems almost inevitable. Big Servers, Big Price Tags Back in the UNIX server days, when you needed to expand compute capacity, “scale up” was the norm. When your workloads began to outpace the performance of your hardware, you bought bigger boxes – typically big, proprietary RISC-based servers from the likes of DEC, HP, IBM or Sun Microsystems. Over time, however, the economics of this model began to break down as industry-standard x86 hardware designed for high-volume desktops became redeployed as server engines for the data center.  The rapid increase in performance of x86 processors from Intel and AMD was an important driver. But equally important was the availability of enterprise-ready operating systems for the x86 architecture including Microsoft Windows NT and Linux. What really put the nail in the coffin of the custom, proprietary model of server infrastructure, however, was the rise of virtualization. Once high-quality hypervisors became available on industry-standard server platforms, creating unprecedented efficiencies in resource utilization, it was increasingly difficult to justify huge capital expenditures on proprietary servers that locked in customers to a single vendor’s platform. HCI similarly repurposes high-volume hardware, in this case industry-standard x86 platforms with local storage, from the server market to the storage market using a natural extension of virtualization software.  By aggregating, protecting and accelerating the storage across server nodes, new HCI software converges compute and scale-out shared storage in a single platform.  “Scale out,” rather than “scale up,” becomes the new normal ­– a lesson learned from hyperscale public cloud providers like AWS, Azure and Google, who all deploy x86 servers in their approach to public cloud storage. Why the Storage Market Needs HCI The storage component of the infrastructure is ready for a wake-up call. Adding storage capacity often means investing in expensive, proprietary SAN appliances, with proprietary Fibre Channel interconnects. Procurement is a lengthy and risky process because of the massive up-front costs and complexity in configuration.  The big-box approach requires the expertise of dedicated storage professionals. HCI blows that model wide open. Hyper-converged storage, such as VMware vSAN, replaces those costly, siloed storage boxes with flexible, scale-out storage appliances based on industry standard x86 servers. Customers are free to start small and purchase new storage incrementally as performance or capacity needs grows. Capital expenditures are kept to a minimum and guesswork is all but eliminated from storage capacity planning. Equally important, HCI allows the entire IT organization to be more agile and responsive to shifting business objectives. With storage hosted on the same servers as power compute and networking, resource planning is no longer constrained by the availability of storage specialists. For the first time, IT generalists are able to manage the entire data center and can manage storage using a software-defined approach where changes are accomplished through the user interface rather than with hardware changes. Will traditional enterprise storage disappear altogether? The UNIX experience would indicate that big-box storage will not disappear but that these expensive, proprietary systems will occupy a very small market niche in terms of unit volume.  Proprietary enterprise storage will become increasingly difficult to justify, particularly as more organizations embrace modern development practices such as continuous delivery, continuous integration and DevOps. HCI is the perfect implementation for these new ideas and practices. Storage customers looking at HCI solutions have a lot to smile about these days. We’re on the verge of a genuine watershed moment in the storage market, and it will be exciting to see what the next 12 months will bring.

AT&T Inc. agreed to buy embattled spectrum-license holder Straight Path Communications Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $1.6 billion as the phone giant seeks to take the lead in the 5G network race. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of 28 gigahertz and 39 GHz millimeter-wave spectrum -- frequencies the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has already approved to power the fifth-generation of wireless services, or 5G. With 5G, faster connections and greater capacity will help carriers like AT&T offer internet speeds competitive with cable-TV operators while relieving congestion created by consumers who demand Netflix video and live sports streamed directly to their phones. The carriers and gear-makers like Ericsson, Nokia Oyj, Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. are projected to invest a collective $200 billion a year on 5G, according to IHS estimates, and AT&T is planning to build a 5G network using so-called millimeter-wave spectrum. The deal marks the second acquisition of high-frequency airwaves by AT&T this year. In January, the Dallas-based telecom behemoth purchased FiberTower Corp., which holds licenses for 24 GHz and 39 GHz bands of airwaves. Straight Path’s spectrum licenses will allow AT&T to better compete with Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. as 5G networks roll out over the next several years. Straight Path has billed itself as a leader in providing high-frequency airwaves for carrying traffic that will grow as the 5G and the so-called Internet of things blossoms: The company is the third-largest owner of spectrum licenses for airwaves that have been approved by the FCC for flexible use with an eye toward 5G. Verizon still has a wide lead against rivals in coverage with 28 GHz spectrum. Wireless carriers use a measurement called megahertz-POP -- the amount of bandwidth multiplied by the potential number of people covered by the airwaves. Verizon owns almost 200 billion Mhz-POP of 28 GHz spectrum, more than 600 MHz on average nationally. T-Mobile controls 97.4 billion and Straight Path has 39.7 billion, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. “Many believe this ultra-high band spectrum will be key in a 5G world,” Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche wrote in a note. “This spectrum is for fixed wireless and is the basis of Verizon’s 5G strategy.” Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Straight Path had a big incentive to sell following a settlement earlier this year with the FCC. After finding the company had misrepresented the progress of putting its spectrum to use, the commission imposed a $15 million fine and ordered Straight Path to transfer its 28 GHz and 39 GHz spectrum licenses by January 2018 and pay 20 percent of the proceeds from the sales. If it doesn’t, the company would have to fork over an additional $85 million or relinquish those airwaves back to the agency. Straight Path’s airwaves were originally purchased in 2001 from Winstar Communications Inc., a wireless service provider that went bust at the tail end of the internet and telecommunications bubble. The buyer, IDT Corp., spun off its spectrum holdings into the new company, Straight Path, a dozen years later. 204% Premium AT&T will acquire Straight Path for $95.63 a share in an all-stock merger designed to be a tax-free reorganization, according to a statement Monday. That’s a 204 percent premium to Straight Path’s closing price of $31.41 on Jan. 11, the day before the company entered into a settlement with the FCC, and a 162 percent premium to its closing price of $36.48 Friday. Shares of Straight Path soared to as high as $92 following the announcement, their highest price ever. AT&T stock was little changed Monday. Howard Jonas, who has retained control of Straight Path, agreed to vote his Class A shares that are held through a trust in support of the transaction, according to the statement. The total value of the deal includes liabilities and the amounts owed to the FCC. The transaction needs clearance from the FCC. Mark Wigfield, an agency spokesman, declined to comment. Evercore served as exclusive financial adviser to Straight Path. Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP served as company counsel on the deal. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News After Reported Federal Finding Of „Extreme” Gender Disparity, Google To Face Shareholder Vote In June BOSTON, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — In 2016, seven of nine top US tech companies bowed to shareholder pressure, disclosing their gender pay gaps and making major progress to improve pay equity.  Alphabet – the parent of search engine Google – was one of the two holdouts to the campaign led by shareholder advocate Arjuna Capital.  New reports that the U.S. Department of Labor has cited the company for engaging in „extreme” and „systemic” gender pay equity disparities makes it clear why the tech giant was a holdout among its peers. But even with its lopsided management control of shares, Google (via its parent Alphabet) can’t escape continued shareholder pressure in 2017. An Arjuna Capital resolution is scheduled to be voted on for the second time when the Alphabet annual meeting takes place on June 7, 2017.  The Alphabet shareholder vote on gender pay disparity will be a challenge since an unusually high percentage of the shares are controlled by the company’s predominantly white male managers and founders. Natasha Lamb, managing director, lead filer of gender pay resolutions, Arjuna Capital, said: „Now we get why Google broke with other top tech companies in 2016 in making major progress on gender pay equity. 2016 was the year in which nearly all of the tech world responded to concerned shareholders by addressing gender disparity issues.  If Google thinks that its massive size and influence somehow makes it invulnerable to shareholder pressure, it needs to think again. Federal litigation, fines, and the risk of resulting civil suits show why shareholders have every right to be concerned.  Investors long-term wealth is under threat when companies flout the rules on how women are treated in the workplace.” Arjuna Capital led the successful shareholder fight last year in getting seven of nine targeted tech companies — eBay, Intel, Apple, Amazon, Expedia, Microsoft and Adobe — to upgrade their standards and transparency on gender pay disparity in the workplace.  Now, Arjuna Capital is taking the same campaign to six top banks and credit card companies:  Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America (in partnership with Baldwin Brothers Inc.), JP Morgan, MasterCard, and American Express.  Arjuna has also refiled their gender pay proposal at Facebook.  Lamb added: „It seems safe to assume that only companies with something to hide are refusing to come clean on gender pay parity.  So, as we turn our focus to big banks in 2017, the logical question is:  Which major US financial institutions are trying to hide the fact that they are the Googles of banking when it comes to gender pay disparity?  Wall Street needs to know what Silicon Valley already knows:  Shareholders expect gender pay disparity at major corporations to become a thing of the past.” Barring major progress in the next few weeks, annual meeting votes on the Arjuna Capital bank-related resolutions will take place in late April at Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America. The other three bank shareholder resolutions and the Facebook resolution are expected to come to votes in May and June. Arjuna Capital worked with co-filers on technology and the bank/credit card company resolutions.  They included:  Alphabet—Baldwin Brothers Inc., Proxy Impact; Facebook—Baldwin Brothers Inc.; Bank of America—Baldwin Brothers (co-lead); JP Morgan—Baldwin Brothers; MasterCard—Baldwin Brothers, Clean Yield Asset Management, Pax World Investments;  and American Express—Clean Yield, Walden Asset Management.

The time between process shrinks seems to grow with every node, even at big research spenders like Intel. With these two limitations in mind, one way to increase the capacity and performance of NAND flash chips is to stack more layers on each die. This is the approach SK Hynix has taken with its latest 256 Gb (or 32 GB) 72-layer 3D NAND chips. SK Hynix says that it has rapidly increased the number of layers in its 3D NAND chips, moving from 128 Gb 36-layer chips in April of last year to 256 Gb 48-layer dies last November, all the way up to 256 Gb 72-layer chips today. The company says the 72-layer design stacks 50% more cells into the same area compared to its previous offerings, all the while using existing mass production facilities. That large increase in cell count at the same capacity suggests the increase in layers may have been spurred at least in part by a need to increase chip yields. According to the manufacturer, the new chips read and write 20% faster than the previous-generation units of the same capacity, too. We reported about SK Hynix's ₩3.15 trillion ($2.6 billion) investment into additional manufacturing facilities last December. At that time, we mentioned the chipmaker's expectation that chip output per area of floor space would decrease, and the escalating number of layers in 3D NAND chips is likely one element of this trend. The company says it will begin manufacturing the 72-layer chips in the second half of this year. Tags: Storage Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

However, if you’re also a hardcore motorcyclists and a Ducati aficionado, this Monster build might be what you’re looking for. Built by Juggapat Thonglue from Sign Buir in Thailand, this astonishing piece of gaming equipment is something every other Ducati fan wants on his/her desktop when weather conditions don’t allow for a pleasant ride. The build is inspired by Ducati’s signature trellis frame, but whereas on the real bike it basically supports the engine and rider, here its only for show, whit the red bars only contributing for a catchy visual aspect. The computer also comes with an Intel Core i7-3770s CPU, Cougar CMX 700 W PSU, and a Gigabyte GTX 970 Extreme graphics card. Now, I’m not a computer geek, but it sounds to have the right equipment to at least play Ride 2 on ultra settings. All the components plus some extra bits have been neatly arranged to remind of the beautiful shapes of the Ducati Monster. There are even some bits of carbon fiber that imitate a gas tank, windshield and belly pan. Plus some LED strips to make sure this awesome thing can be admired during an all-night gaming session too. There is little information about this Monster PC, and everything we’ve been able to find about it suggests it is a unique build with no chance of seeing it on the store shelf too soon. Who knows, maybe Ducati sees this and decides to partner with Juggapat and some PC case maker for a limited series production. Or, there’s also the possibility to contact the guy and pay him for a similar or exact build. However, the price for such a custom thing could easily match the one of an entry-level Ducati Monster. bike life ducati motorcycles custom motorcycle win bike tech cool   On Electric Harleys and New Generations BMW Winter Driving Tip: Eco Pro On, Coasting Off Headwave TAG Helmet Music and Navigation System Reviewed Mercedes-Benz Model Nomenclature is Getting Ridiculous How to Get Rid of Gasoline Odor in Your Car 10 Debuts To Look Forward To At The 2017 Geneva Motor Show If Peugeot Citroen Buys Opel it's all Downhill for Volkswagen How To Update BMW's Phone Cradle Firmware - A Brief Guide Platform Sharing - When Expensive Cars Get Cheaper Platforms And Viceversa Has Ford Pulled a Prank on Everyone With the 2017 GT?

In his interview with Sputnik China, he said that "the information, including facts about foreign spies bribing public servants, can be transmitted through a telephone hotline, by mail or in person by visiting an office of the Chinese Ministry of State Security." China opens hotline for reporting "foreign spies" to authorities. Can receive award of b/t $7k and $70k. https://t.co/o1DpgAoeA9 — Kevin Slaten (@KevinSlaten) 10 апреля 2017 г. Karneev quoted the Ministry's regulations as saying that "with China's policy of reforms and openness under way, foreign intelligence and other hostile forces gained more opportunities for espionage and subversive activity." "The scale of such activities is constantly expanding, with the  forms becoming more diverse, the methods — more secretive and the actions – more outrageous; the capital Beijing has become the main target of foreign spies," according to the document. Karneev also cited experts as saying that Beijing's decision to pay citizens for foreign spying-related information indicates China's drive to turn to ordinary citizens in a bid to contain foreign intelligence activity. In this vein, analysts point to the fact that the Chinese State Security Ministry's regulations came shortly after the arrest in the US of a State Department employee accused of developing contacts with Chinese intelligence services. "As for the regulations, they could mean a new round of espionage war between the two countries," Karneev quoted the analysts as saying. In the past few years, Chinese authorities have made more efforts to counter intelligence activities than in the past. © AP Photo/ Zha Chunming/Xinhua Chinese Military Commissions New Intelligence Gathering ShipFirst and foremost, new legislation defining the activity of special services is being introduced in China, where the Law on Fighting Espionage was adopted in 2014. Notably, the Chinese State Security Ministry used this legislative act to issue its regulations on awarding citizens for foreign espionage-related information. Additionally, in order to grapple with foreign intelligence services, the Chinese State Security Ministry is turning to the mass media to adjust public opinion by releasing information about high profile espionage cases.

Problem with the spies is, that unlike before they used to be openly declared, but now countries are trying to be masters of covert operations. Some even sell that as service for others. It is a huge business for some. Personally, think it would need some kind of regulation and rules.

Forums Join   Arris Sued Over SB6190 Surfboard Modem Latency Flaw by Karl Bode Monday Apr 10 2017 10:00 EDTTipped by xymox1 Arris has been sued for a Surfboard modem flaw that resulted in unexpected latency and connectivity problems for customers. Late last year we noted how problems in the Surfboard SB6190 modem were caused by a flaw in the Intel Puma 6 chipset. While the SB6190 was advertised as a cutting edge device that supported 32 x 8 channel bonding, owners kept reporting latency and latency jitter in DNS lookups that resulted in unexplainable connectivity issues. By December Arris had told us they were looking into the bug, and more recently, ISPs like Cox began testing solution. But Arris is now facing a California lawsuit (pdf) claiming the hardware vendor "failed to disclose that the Modem contains a serious defect that prevents it from operating properly." "By shipping Modems with this defect, Arris sold consumer goods that were substantially below the quality generally available in the market, were not fit for the for the Internet connectivity for which they were generally used, and were not adequately packaged and labeled," claims the plaintiff. "Arris, therefore, has breached its implied warranty of merchantability in violation of the California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act." The lawsuit proclaims that the root of the problem is Arris's decision to swap out the Broadcom chipset found in other variants of the company's Surfboard modems with the Intel Puma 6 chipset specifically embedded in the SB6190. The law firm behind the lawsuit, Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP, said in a statement it was investigating if the chipset had caused similar latency and connectivity issues with other hardware. "Intel is providing a firmware fix to correct the condition, and we will issue it as soon as it is available," the company told DSLReports.com last year. "We remain committed to providing the best broadband experience for all users of ARRIS devices and regret any inconvenience this issue caused."The full complaint (pdf) and the law firm's full statement both have additional detail. There's also some additional information for users looking to join the suit over at the class action's website. There also ongoing discussion about the flaw in our Cox forum. tags: legal · business · hardware · cable · networking · consumers News Jump Optimum To Unveil 400 Mbps Broadband Tier Tomorrow FCC to Return to Banning In-Flight Phone CallsCharter Subscribers Could Lose Access to Fox Channels»Arris Sued Over SB6190 Surfboard Modem Latency FlawMonday Morning Links AT&T Significantly Streamlines Its VDSL2 Broadband TiersCharter Conducting 28 GHz Band 5G Wireless Trials in FloridaYet More Executives Leave Google FiberBroadcom Chip Flaw Opens Android Devices to WiFi AttackGet Ready: FCC Boss Tells ISPs He'll Kill Net Neutrality Soon----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 47 comments kdwycha join:2003-01-30 Riverview, FL kdwycha Member Yesterday 10:06 am Interesting I was thinking about this yesterday when there was a post about Cox trying to mitigate the flaw with firmware updates. From a service provider standpoint think of the countless hours of wasted resources trying to troubleshoot latency spikes on peoples lines. Multiple truck rolls, countless hours of technical support time lost to the issue. And in the end it turns out to be a hardware flaw by the vendor. I surely have no love for greedy service providers but I sure as hell would be litigating this with the vendor to try to get some sort of compensation for all the lost revenue. · actions · Yesterday 10:06 am · BimmerE38FN join:2002-09-15 Boise, ID115.1 2.9 ·CableOne 1 edit BimmerE38FN Member Yesterday 10:08 am May not happen... Probably wont see the light of day since Arris is actively working on a fix, has a possible fix which they are beta testing in certain ISP arenas and some users. Also this was an Intel flaw, however Arris and other Mfrs are responsible for testing and QA on there branded products which incorporate any Intel designs. Arris isn't the only one using the Puma chip set with this flaw. · actions · Yesterday 10:08 am · sgip2000 join:2004-05-05 Hillsboro, OR sgip2000 Member Yesterday 2:10 pm Intel's fault I bet Arris won't be using Intel anymore. · actions · Yesterday 2:10 pm · maartena Elmo Premium Member join:2002-05-10 Orange, CA969.4 0.9 maartena Premium Member Yesterday 10:15 am Not an Arris problem! This problem is within the Intel Puma 6 chipset, which is also used by other modem manufacturers such as Netgear and UBEE. All this lawsuit can do is drag Intel into it so Arris can sue THEM for damages when the court decides all Puma based modems are to be replaced free of charge with a non-puma one. · actions · Yesterday 10:15 am · marinemaster join:2004-04-12 Suwanee, GA marinemaster Member Yesterday 12:16 pm This is what happens when you go after a new market segment Intel has been building PC and Servers processors and motherboards for many decades.

The latest rumors about the new tablet claim that it will use Intel Kaby Lake processors inside. That should mean better performance and more importantly for some users, better power efficiency. Another rumor making the rounds also claims that there will be some changes to the keyboard cover for the tablet. Microsoft is tipped to be changing the stylus to be thinner than it is now and to connect to a magnetic dock that also acts as a charger to keep the stylus charged up. As of now there are few other details about the tablet. We have no idea if Microsoft will change the ports and connectivity options on the tablet. Past rumors have suggested that the Surface Connect power adapter will continue on rather than moving to a USB-C port for charging reports Latin Post. As for pricing, the Surface Pro line have never been considered cheap. The tablet will carry a price of $899 when the Pro 5 version launched according to sources. Presumably that price will be for the base model unit, but that it unclear. Launch could come as early as October for the tablet. The big driver for Microsoft for this tablet update is to put the focus on software-innovation and cloud-services rather than a full revamp of the tablet. Other than hardware changes, the design of the tablet is expected to carry on. This isn’t exactly bad news considering that Microsoft has earned high marks and lots of praise from users for the design of the Surface Pro 4 tablets. In fact, Microsoft recently beat Apple in the J.D. Power tablet survey for the first time thanks in large part to the design and performance of the tablet.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News Global Visual Processing Unit Market Report 2017 – Research and Markets DUBLIN–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Research and Markets has announced the addition of the „The Visual Processing Unit Report” newsletter to their offering. This report covers Vision Processing Units (VPUs) but what makes a processor a – vision – processor? In many regards „You’ll know one when you see one” covers the situation but there are some things that can be specified. Included in the definition are IP blocks such as a GPU (think Qualcomm or Nvidia) or a wideSIMD DSP (like Ceva or Tensilica), or a programmable camera pipeline (Apical or Intel). The term also includes full SoCs that combine one or more of the characteristics of the above IP blocks along with other functions such as Movidius and Inuitive which both add hardware acceleration of specific functions to their DSP-based blocks. Lastly, novel architectures such as Wave Computing which target a wider range of functions but are also well suited to acceleration of vision tasks are included. The purpose and intent of this report is to progressively summarize the available hardware solutions for vision processing in a way that identifies their fundamental characteristics and capabilities without overloading the reader with too much technical detail. Engineers may want more but marketers and executives will find enough to keep them abreast of the field along with, hopefully, insightful and though-provoking commentary to help them develop a rounded view of the industry. Each chapter of the report summarizes the vision technology offerings of one company, with a brief company description and a closing commentary that includes sections on market focus and penetration as well as the technologies themselves. This study covers the technologies involved in machine vision (MV) systems, such as components that constitute a workable MV system, recent advances in the technologies involved, various traditional and new applications and global markets for these technologies and applications.

Hendrix Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, LLP Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm U.S. technology companies often design products in the United States and then manufacture and sell those products overseas. In the semiconductor and integrated-circuits arena, in particular, companies frequently design chips and components in technology hubs like Silicon Valley, and then manufacture and sell them overseas to end-product manufacturers who incorporate them into consumer products like phones, tablets, and computers. One area in which this business model can clash with U.S. law is in the field of patents. As explained in this article, chief technology officers and others on the design and product documentation side can play a key role in mitigating the risk of patent infringement should some of those consumer end products eventually be imported into the United States. Whether a company may be liable for patent infringement based on products manufactured overseas hinges on what happens post-manufacture. If the company imports the product into the U.S., it could be liable for direct infringement. On the other hand, if the company sells the product overseas and it remains there, there's no infringement. That's because, under U.S. patent law, infringement occurs only when someone, without permission from the patent owner, makes, uses, offers to sell, sells, or imports the patented invention within the United States.1 A more difficult scenario arises when, as is frequently the case with ICs and components, the product is sold to an end-product manufacturer overseas and it's incorporated into a consumer product that's then imported into the United States. The design company may not be liable for direct infringement because sale of the IC or component occurred overseas. But it could be liable for indirect infringement, namely, inducing the end-product manufacturer to infringe. Induced Infringement Under a theory of induced infringement, a tech company that sells products overseas could be liable for U.S. patent infringement where, for example, an end-product manufacturer imports the company's product into the United States and directly infringes a U.S. patent. To be liable for the end-product manufacturer's infringement under an induced-infringement theory, the tech company must have known of the patent, known that its actions would result in infringement, and have intended to cause the infringement.2 When litigated in court, the dispute often centers on the intent requirement; namely, whether the tech company intended for the infringement to occur. Rarely will one find a smoking gun that shows a company's intent to infringe. Patent owners asserting infringement, therefore, often look to circumstantial evidence of intent that might exist in items such as datasheets, user manuals, and product guides. Even if a tech company believes it did not intend to infringe, if the product documentation suggests otherwise, there may still be a finding of induced infringement. By considering recent examples in which tech companies faced this situation, CTOs and others responsible for product design and documentation can be mindful of ways to mitigate the risk of liability for induced infringement if third parties import the company's overseas products into the United States. Technical Documents/Support as Proof of Intent to Induce Infringement In a case involving LED driver products sold overseas, the court considered whether technical documentation for the products showed intent to induce infringement in the United States.3 The drivers provided functionality for, among other things, LED backlighting in devices such as phones. According to the patent owner, the supplier for the LED drivers, Kinetic Technologies, induced Samsung to infringe by providing Samsung with the LED drivers that were incorporated into phones manufactured overseas and then later sold in the United States. In evaluating whether Kinetic Technologies intended Samsung to infringe, and was therefore liable for the infringement, the court looked to product datasheets and the technical support Kinetic offered Samsung. The court found that the datasheets did not show intent to induce infringement because, first, they did not show any encouragement or desire for Samsung to import its phones into the United States. Second, the court explained that the datasheets did not contain instructions on how to use the accused products in an infringing manner. Regarding the technical support that Kinetic had provided to Samsung, the court found that the support was not specifically directed to inducing Samsung to infringe. In other words, neither the datasheets nor the technical support provided a sufficient link between the LED drivers and Samsung's alleged infringement to conclude that Kinetic intended for Samsung to infringe. In a case involving cache management, the court similarly found that product manuals, datasheets, and product instructions did not show intent to induce infringement.4 There, the patent owner had accused Intel of inducing its customers to infringe by selling them processors that were designed with mechanisms for cache coherence. When a product can be used both in an infringing way and a non-infringing way, the court explained, the evidence showing that the accused party teaches the infringing use would show intent. Although the technical documents described how Intel's processors worked, the court found those documents did not teach customers how to use the processors in an infringing manner. Further, the court explained, the documents did not recommend, encourage, or promote using the processors in an infringing manner. Simply describing the processor's functionality, the court concluded, is not enough to demonstrate intent to induce infringement. Insight into OEM Supply Chain as Proof of Intent to Induce Infringement Whether a company intends to induce infringement may also hinge on whether it knew products that it initially sold overseas were later imported into the United States. At issue in one recent case was a global supply chain involving lenses made by Genius Electronic Optical for use in digital cameras in smartphones and tablets.5 As part of the supply chain, Genius sold lenses to module integrators overseas who incorporated the lenses into cameras. The module integrators then sold the cameras to system integrators overseas, who subsequently incorporated the cameras into phones and tablets. Apple and Motorola then sold the final products, including some in the United States. Genius did not dispute that its lenses infringed the patents at issue, but argued that it had no insight into Apple's and Motorola's supply chains, and had no idea whether its lenses were incorporated into products that were later sold in the United States. Because the phones and tablets had more than one supplier for the lenses, for all it knew, none of its lenses ever entered the United States. The court agreed. As the court explained, because it was plausible that none of Genius' lenses entered the United States, Genius could not have knowledge of infringement by any Apple and Motorola products in the United States, and thus could not have induced infringement. Further, the court explained, Genius was not willfully blind to whether its lenses entered the U.S., which might have supported a finding of intent. To show willful blindness, the court explained, Genius must have subjectively believed a high probability existed that its lenses entered the United States and must have taken deliberate actions to avoid learning the truth. But Genius was at best deliberately indifferent to whether its lenses entered the U.S., the court concluded, and such indifference does not rise to the level of intent needed to induce infringement. Takeaways These cases provide examples of how to mitigate the risk of liability for induced infringement if you manufacture and sell your products overseas, but third parties eventually import some of those products into the United States. As these examples reveal, merely describing the functionality of a product might not show intent to induce infringement. But if the companies had recommended or encouraged others to use the products in a certain way, or had promoted using the products in a certain way by touting the benefits and results of such use, a different result might have occurred. If you do not need to recommend or promote using your products in a certain way, describing only the functionality of your product in the datasheets and product guides can help mitigate the risk of liability for induced infringement. In addition, as with the company in the last example, putting products into a supply chain overseas without knowledge of where those products are eventually sold might buffer you from liability for induced infringement.

Earlier report suggested that the processor would draw less power and it would result in delivering longer battery life. Thurrott further says there won't be any dramatic change in the tablet. Other rumoured hardware features are 4K display, Nvidia Pascal or AMD Polaris graphics unit for better viewing, artwork and gaming experience, microSD card slot for storage expansion and fingerprint scanner. However, the Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2 might not come until spring 2017. Same is the case with Microsoft's long rumoured Surface phone. Last month ZDNet reported Microsoft was planning to hold a hardware launch event in spring, where it might not unveil the Surface Book 2. It's unclear if the Pro 5 tablet would debut at the event. While the question remains that what new hardware Microsoft would announce at its spring 2017 event, DigiTimes claims the company was working on a new 13.5in Surface Book laptop featuring a clamshell design instead of traditional 2-in-1 form factor, that would cost around $1,000. Surface Pro 5 will not change the Surface Connect power connector, I was just told. Kaby Lake, nothing dramatic.— Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) April 6, 2017 More from IBTimes UK Microsoft zero-day attacks see hackers target Word users with new bug Windows 10 Creators Update: Cortana voice assistant to help user set up a new PC Microsoft bans game emulators from the Windows and Xbox Store Related topics : Microsoft Share More Stay up to date with our daily newsletter YOU MIGHT LIKE THISSponsored Content by Taboola IBT Video Close How F1 team McLaren is using 3D printing in 2017 car Columnists Kate Allen “Brexit Britain has turned a blind eye to the death penalty – we're busy trading morals for money READ MORE Is 3D printing the future of F1 racing?

Within the smart factory, software-defined automation allows manufacturers to link all stages of the value chain, rapidly adapt to changing markets, and create highly personalised products on a mass scale. These machines communicate their health and status in real time, increasing efficiency and throughput and minimizing downtime. The opportunities presented by this revolution are incredible. According to McKinsey, the economic impact of smart factories could reach up to $2.3 trillion per year by 2025. At the heart of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the Internet of Things (IoT), which uses digital technology to connect sensors, actuators, and machines to each other and to factory workers. The IoT enables a broad swath of transformational opportunities, including open-standards-based automation solutions, IT and operational technology (OT) convergence, and vastly enhanced business intelligence. These opportunities flow from the IoT’s ability to handle enormous variety, velocity and volumes of data. Many manufacturers are already feeling the benefits of this access to industrial IoT (IIoT) data. In an Economist Intelligence Unit study of senior factory executives, 86% reported major increases in shop floor data collection over the past two years, and two-thirds said data insights have led to annual quality and efficiency savings of 10% or more. But all of these advances are dependent upon collaboration – no single organisation can deliver the benefits of IIoT alone. That is why computing juggernaut Intel has partnered with technology leaders like ADLINK, Dell, IBM, PrismTech (an ADLINK company), and SAS. Together these companies are powering smart factories with solutions that generate value from industrial data. See also: Free ebook download – Challenges and Opportunities in the Fourth Industrial Revolution IoT growth Manufacturers compete in a marketplace that has grown increasingly global, with fast-changing requirements and ever-greater demands for profitability. To keep pace, companies need to improve their processes through better visibility into their production status, equipment condition and other vital facets of operation. The IIoT is already providing a compelling answer to this need. The market for the IIoT was valued at $94 billion in 2014 and is expected to reach $151 billion by 2020, a CAGR of 8.03% between 2015 and 2020, according to a research report by MarketsandMarkets. This rapid growth represents huge opportunities for the industrial sector, but it is also triggering an unprecedented spike in data volumes. Manufacturers face numerous challenges in not only capitalising on the value of smart factories, but also dealing with issues such as interoperability, standardisation, scalability, and security. On the standards front, many industrial devices are based on inflexible, fixed-function proprietary designs that use non-standard communications protocols. These industrial settings are held back by silos of data and islands of sensors and machines. Many companies have custom-built software that limits communication within the organisation, and complicates software updates and maintenance. This is just one factor that makes it difficult to scale. Clear return on investment (ROI) on technology and solutions requires infrastructure and capabilities that can scale as manufacturing operations become increasingly complex. Given their attributes of scaling and elasticity, the cloud and standardized IoT gateways designed to connect sensors to the cloud are integral to the IIoT. As connected devices and data grows, the ability to scale with gateways and expand storage and networking assets, as well as compute resources, becomes a key enabler for the development of IIoT systems. And of course security cannot be overlooked. Protecting industrial environments and critical infrastructure from the threat of cyber attacks is a challenge that keeps CIOs around the world up at night. While the IIoT presents a plethora of new opportunities for manufacturers, having more things connected to the internet and a diversity of equipment in smart factories amounts to a complex environment that requires a multi-layered security approach. Companies must reduce platform vulnerabilities, protect data and incorporate device and network security intelligence. Overcoming the challenges of smart factories will only be achieved through collaboration between industry leaders like the ones forged by Intel, ADLINK, Dell, IBM, PrismTech, and SAS where each provides best-in-class technologies and expertise. Such partnerships enable development of solutions that maximise smart factory benefits and investment, while minimising complexity and risk. These partners are also participating in broader industry efforts around open-standards-based industrial solutions that promote easy connectivity and interoperability between devices. Efforts to make the IoT more open and cohesive have led to the creation of consortia such as the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) and Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC), promoting a standards-based and inclusive development environment. Manufactures that leverage the public APIs and open standards from these groups will achieve greater success in the long run.

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT START-UPS Which are the fastest-growing companies in Europe? by Gordon Hunt 3 hours ago4 Shares Image: timyee/Shutterstock Growth drives investor interest in start-ups everywhere, but the same is true of established companies. So which ones are growing the fastest? Big business deals in the billions. For example, in its Q1 earnings guidance, Samsung is predicting an operating profit of around 9.9trn won ($8.7bn). Seven years after it was acquired by Intel for $7.6bn, McAfee is being spun out as a stand-alone business and is enjoying an early predicted valuation of $4.2bn. Tesla made headlines last week after its valuation of $48.2bn was revealed to be greater than that of Ford ($45bn), despite the latter proving to be historically profitable and the former being a gambler of sorts. However, that’s at the top end, and Samsung’s mega-profit represents little when compared to its overall revenues – 50trn won ($44bn). Growth, at the top end, is marginal. This is why so few mainstream, household-name companies are represented in the top 25 companies in Europe, in terms of growth rate. Last week, the Financial Times teamed up with Statista for the FT1000, with the cream of the crop featured in this infographic. Infographic: The FT1000: Europe’s fastest-growing companies | Statista The list comprises companies from 24 European countries, led by Germany and the UK, which are represented most prominently (23.6pc and 23.5pc respectively), followed by Italy (18.6pc), France (13.9pc) and Spain (10.2pc). One of the more interesting businesses on the list is iZettle, which appeared in a Siliconrepublic.com ‘Future of Banking’ feature last year.

The UK-based is one of the new breed of services that are starting to come on-stream, having seen the trials and tribulations of the many that have come and gone before it. It combines the traditional recommendation-type engine with practical tools such as accommodation and flight search to produce an itinerary for the user. The company’s founders have a fair amount of pedigree between them, having with the CEO having worked in senior roles at Intel and its chief commercial officer working as a country manager at both Skyscanner and Hotelscombined. Video clip: Q&A with CEO and co-founder, Igor Kaloshin: What problem does your business solve? IQPlanner connects personal trip recommendations from savvy travellers, local experts and travel bloggers with travel services. A marriage of inspiration through user built itineraries with powerful trip planning technology. We believe that there isn’t a service out there yet where a traveller would find the right reason to travel, build a perfect itinerary and find the best price. Consumers are still visiting a double-digit number of websites according to Google to read reviews, find inspiration and research prices. Besides, our own research shows that for collaborative trip planning, especially when building complex itineraries consumers are using multiple formats – from emails to social networks, calendars and messengers. IQPlanner aims to address this problem. Anyone coming to our website can become a contributor and post their travel story, IQplanner simply “dresses” that story into a bookable itinerary.We also help our contributors to monetize their content by rewarding them every time a booking is made.

Igor Kaloshin (CEO), Dmitrijus Konovalovas (chief commercial officer), plus a team of seven developers, one community manager and a head of content. Funding arrangements? Private investors in seed funding. Following the proof of concept – growth of registered contributor accounts, both private and business, we have recently closed a top up round. Revenue model? IQPlanner works on a referral-based model. We have partnered with online travel agents for both flights and hotels, and are growing our coverage by signing up new partnerships such as Booking.com and Skyscanner. We are also integrating transfers and activities through selected partners. Additional revenue streams (forthcoming): sponsored content and display advertising. Why do you think the pain point you’re solving is painful enough that customers are willing to pay for your solution? Trip planning is a big part of the travel cycle, it’s also a big challenge for traditional online players to give customers a clear answer to the question why should they travel to a particular destination, and provide the right tool how to get there with a day-by-day activity plan. IQPlanner addresses these issues by working together with the community of travel experts and comprehensive coverage booking and search partners. We are a team of savvy travellers ourselves with different interests and have built the tool to suit everyone. External validation? (Examples: The incubators/accelerators you have been accepted to, the mentors who are advising you, the number of customers you’ve signed, the marketing partner deals you’ve made, the skills/connections of your founders, etc.) We have made our launch announcement last month and today IQPlanner has 300+ contributor accounts, 200+ stories have been supplied by contributors (either live or in moderation), we have also agreed four pilot projects with Destination Marketing Organizations for sponsored content. IQPlanner has been shortlisted for Phocuswright Startup battlefield Europe (Amsterdam, May 2017). Tnooz view: There have been more than a few high-profile failures (and dozens of smaller ones) in the world of trip planning over the years. The core problem has always been getting enough users in the front door in order to generate both the community feel that such services need and money to grow and improve. Hopefully the founders have observed this tricky corner of the market and planned accordingly. Still, there is no doubt that IQPlanner has a slick interface and the content is very good. Furthermore, the logisitics end of the site (flights and accommodation) is laid out well and, interestingly, behaves in the same way as many of the more up-to-date airline or accommodation sites. Where the company will perhaps need to broaden its horizons with how to make money (as there is no guarantee that it will attract the volume of users required as a consumer-facing brand) is through white labelling the technology into other sites.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Kevin May Kevin is senior editor and a co-founder at Tnooz.

By: Bloomberg | San Francisco | Updated: April 10, 2017 4:53 pm The industry is making its way into new markets as an increasing number of devices are hooked up to the internet and given brains. (Source: Bloomberg)When a sector has as big a run as chip stocks over the last year, the temptation is to take money off the table. Maybe not this time. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, composed of 30 chip-related companies, has gained 47 percent since last April, fueled by an unprecedented flood of mergers and orders for products that make up the guts of gadgets like refrigerators to smartphones. That’s made the $300 billion industry look expensive relative to earnings as growth is expected to moderate. What it hasn’t done is make a seller out of Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which manages $2 billion and owns Intel Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc. Bear cases on semiconductors miss that the industry is making its way into new markets as an increasing number of devices are hooked up to the internet and given brains, she said. “The number of products that these things go into has expanded,” said Forrest, who thinks the rally will continue while cautioning that expansion from new demand will be lumpy. “Cars are getting smarter.” The price-earnings ratio for the semiconductor index is 28, compared with an average of 22 over the last seven years and 22 currently in the S&P 500 Index. Chip stocks are trading at records after a rally that exceeds every industry but financials over the last 12 months. Also Read:  Samsung posts $25 billion in profits owing to chips, semiconductors business in 2016 It’s no use comparing today’s valuations to historical norms, said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst with Loop Capital Markets in San Francisco. Consolidation has helped many acquirers add scale, reduce costs, raise prices and improve profitability. Earnings are rising to justify the gains in stock prices, she said. “Old valuation guidelines don’t apply,” Van Hees said. “We’re entering into a different era for the industry.” While the road to destitution is paved with claims that this time it’s different, look at a company like Micron Technology Inc., the third-best performer in the benchmark chip index over the last 12 months. On March 23, the company forecast third-quarter revenue of as much as $5.6 billion. That compared with an average analyst estimate of $4.8 billion. Concern Ahead Still, the two highest fliers in the Philadelphia index over the last year, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp., are starting to look a little more pedestrian. Also  Read:  Foreign bidders said to be more aggressive in Toshiba chip unit sale AMD, after gaining more than fivefold in the last 12 months, has seen its short interest as a percentage of the free float rise to 13.7 percent compared with a multiyear low of 4.9 percent in September, according to Markit data. Its return to regular profitability depends on the popularity of its new Ryzen processor, which went on sale in early March. Some reviewers have criticized its gaming performance. And last month, AMD’s largest shareholder, Mubadala Development, sold almost a third of its stake. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Toshiya Hari initiated coverage of the stock on April 6 with a sell rating, saying that even if those new chips are successful, the company’s competitors are likely to fight back with price cuts, hurting its future profitability. Nvidia, which added more than $40 billion to its market capitalization in the same period, fell below its 50-day moving average on Feb. 17 for the first time in more than a year. The company’s shares have been downgraded to the equivalent of sell by at least three analysts since February. Among the bearish arguments against the company are its high valuation, declining fundamentals and increasing competition. Nvidia surged last year as investors bet on its ability to become the main provider of chips that power self-driving cars and artificial intelligence systems. Changing Conditions Some of the issues that increased industry sales and the boost in shares may be slowing. The market for chips will expand by a double-digit percentage in the first half of 2017 and slow in the second, according to Srini Pajjuri, an analyst with Macquarie in San Francisco. Most of that expansion will probably come from the memory market, benefiting companies like Micron. Consolidation also is drying up. There have been only two chip-related acquisitions valued at $1 billion or more announced in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 13 last year. Also Read:China’s largest chipmaker secures $22 billion to expand globally “As M&A slows and as revenue momentum slows, the upside potential is definitely limited,” Pajjuri said. He expects some stocks like Broadcom Corp., Intel and Micron to outperform and the industry as a whole to be “range bound.” Fort Pitt’s Forrest said the push by companies to own technological capabilities that will be at the heart of things like self-driving cars is such that acquisitions could continue, despite the higher prices. That said, investors need to be more choosy and not bet on across-the-board gains by chip companies unless the economy picks up. “If you’re going to invest in this sector, you really have to do your homework and understand which ones grow with the total addressable market and most importantly is this a winning technology,” she said. “You have to understand that not all of the technology will survive.” For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Intel Corp No Comments.

View All Pages If a Z270 Kaby Lake upgrade is on the horizon then a compact mini-ITX motherboard unlikely to be the first port of call in a market dominated by ATX. However, buyers need not be so hasty to dismiss mini-ITX motherboards of the Z270 generation since most are very well equipped, even for a power user. MSI’s Z270i Gaming Pro Carbon AC illustrates this point well and is an interesting proposition for anyone looking to down-size their PC. What constitutes a high-end PC these days? A subjective question but key items on the agenda would undoubtedly be a powerful CPU, high-end graphics card, high-performance memory and PCIe storage. MSI’s Z270i Gaming Pro Carbon AC meets all these criteria with support for Intel’s latest Kaby Lake CPUs, high-speed memory, PCIe graphics cards and NVMe-ready M.2 drives. There are obvious limitations of the mini-ITX form factor but for users with a typical amount of hardware – one graphics card, two memory modules, a couple of SSDs and a couple of HDDs – mini-ITX has what it takes. Perhaps it delivers even more than you might expect since MSI’s mini-ITX solution also includes USB 3.1, Gigabit LAN, onboard 802.11ac WiFi, four SATA ports, an overclocking-capable power delivery system, RGB LEDs and audio based on Realtek’s ALC1220 codec, the current best available on motherboards. Even from the most critical perspective the only hardware that’s missing is supplementary – additional PCIe lanes, memory slots, USB ports and so on. MSI isn’t without competition and the majority of what’s been written thus far applies to most rival Z270 mini-ITX motherboards from ASUS, ASRock, EVGA and Gigabyte. Even more interesting for consumers is the fact that motherboard vendors are clustering around a similar price point, around £160-180, meaning most mini-ITX models for Z270 are in direct competition. MSI’s unique selling point with the Z270i Gaming Pro Carbon AC isn’t immediately obvious since virtually all Z270 mini-ITX motherboards have 802.11ac WiFi, support RGB LEDs and have NVMe M.2 support. However, there’s no absolutely no shaming in being the perfect all-rounder – so let’s see how MSI’s motherboard gets on through our testing.

UPDATE: 5pm ET: Today, in a letter sent to clients and first reported by VRM Intel, the company said it is shutting up shop. “While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations…. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off” (See reader comment, below, for the full letter.) LeisureLink’s closure strands several resort/hotel type managers as well as traditional vacation rental managers. Back to our original story: Earlier this year, the company said it had received a $17 million round of funding, with investors Clearstone Ventures, Kinderhook Industries and Escalate Capital Partners participating. Since its founding in 2007, it has raised more than $34 million. On Friday, SoCal Tech reported that the company has been sending email messages to clients that say: “We’ve been working aggressively to complete a corporate transaction. Regardless of what you may have heard we are still in that process and anticipate a positive outcome.” Tnooz’s voice and email messages to top-level executives this morning have not been returned, as of this afternoon. The only executive we could reach on the phone has declined to comment. In August, Utah-based LeisureLink sold several of its consumer-facing websites to Aspen-based Ski.com. Earlier this year, an official had told Tnooz that the company was working on releasing new, public APIs for distributors and suppliers. The goal was to enable LeisureLink rates and inventory to be passed over to Airbnb, HomeAway’s Escapia software, and Seekda’s Regatta booking engine. In 2014, LeisureLink was bought by VacationRoost, which changed its group name to LeisureLink. LeisureLink’s online chat system for customer service was closed today. When Tnooz contacted an account manager by phone, he was telling customers that all he could say was that “the company is going through a corporate transaction and they are hoping to get the business details resolved quickly.” Apparently any such potential deal fell through.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill had roles as a reporter and editor-in-chief at Tnooz between July 2012 and January 2017.   Tags LeisureLink Comments Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Gave leisurelink 50% deposit. I was never contacted or notified of their bk until last week receiving an email from RealVoice that they bought it. They said they would honor my deposit and I would be responsible for balance. My concern is I no longer can find the rental property on any rental websites even Hawaiian beach rental which supposedly RealVoice bought from leisurelink. How can I find out if this is legitimate before I hand over thousands of dollars and get to Maui without a home to stay. Thanks for any advice Reply 3 months ago   Rhonda Hi Sue I feel your pain. I’m still waiting to see if we’ll be receiving our $1000. deposit from our August 2016 stay. Same place your headed. I guess I should be grateful the house was really there! It was my fear the entire time as we drove up the road & this was BEFORE we were swindled. We didn’t know what was going on behind the scenes until we returned from your trip & tried to get our security deposit back. We noticed the name of the Company seemed to change names a few times but we were assured they were one in the same. VERY misleading. Not sure I’ll book this way again. I hope you get what you pay for. Reply 1 month ago   Mike Harrison Found out the guy to,contact is named Erik Hovanec and this is a California company..or was.

The address was Utah. I just left a message with the Atty General’s office. I believe that under the law notices were suppose to have been sent to all creditors within 30 days of the closure which I believe was Sept 23rd. So it’s possible that those have been sent but I have not received anything yet. In the long run, I’m sure no one will see any money. This is essentially a bankruptcy and I’m sure the assets will not cover what it owed. If anything is paid out it will be pennies on the dollar. If anyone knows anything else, please post Reply 6 months ago   Cote Property Management I did get a letter from the Utah Atty General’s office, they said it falls under California law. They suggested contacting an attorney there. Reply 5 months ago   Geri Hauck We have yet to receive any forms or paperwork as stipulated in their notice of closure.

Reply 6 months ago   Cote Property Management I heard back from the Utah Attorney Generals office, they said to file a complaint with California, which I did. They also suggested contacting an attorney. I think there needs to be a class action suit. I know there are places that suffered must larger losses then me and wonder if any of them have started anything? Reply 6 months ago   paul tateo Cote any response from CA about this closing with Leisurelink? anyone start any legal action yet? what I think happened is the venture capital in the firm sold the sites to Ski.com and pulled as much of its investment back as it could recover, including prepaid reservation rents from companies and people, took the funds and stranded the company. Reply 1 month ago   Peter in Colorado Every vacation rental manager should know that Advance Deposits paid by guests must be kept in separate bank accounts until those funds are earned. How was LL able to bypass this basic obligation and use Advance Deposit payments to fund their operations without committing fraud? If fraud has been committed, who is being held culpable? I would like to be able to tell my staff and my clients (who are all losing money on this!) that someone is being held to account for this fiasco! Reply 6 months ago   Cote Property Management So, since there are so many of us who have lost substantial funds due to the mismanagement of Leisure Link, aren’t there legal steps that can be taken? I have sent a message to the Attorney General’s office in California and Utah but wonder what we can do as a group. Perhaps if everyone sends a complaint to the Utah Attorney Generals office, it’s online, easy to fill out, maybe someone will look at the seriousness of this issue.

That’s a negative, we tried that, Chase declined it. But thank you for responding. We paid in good faith & in full using our debit card. I should clarify, we got our vacation, but not our security deposit back. I was thankful the house existed & the key worked in the door knowing now what was going on behind-the-scenes! I will be VERY Leary next time around. Who can you trust today, there’s a scammer on every corner. Reply 6 months ago   Kristen Cherry The difficult part of the merchant of record solution is no OTA has a great system for managing payment or declined cards, which for some of the OTA channels can be a significant percentage, add in the process of making changes and modifications to existing reservations and the business of “handing this over” becomes the easy and necessary solution. Nobody could have foreseen this ending….the theory and vision were there…the execution fell flat. Property managers already have 10 jobs from managing homeowner expectations, wowing guests, maintenance -you name it. Managing the OTA channels from allotment, content, pricing, payments, and promos is just to daunting and unrealistic. Other intermediaries will gain market share – but established infrastructure will be critical. Reply 6 months ago   Displaced Worker from LL Please forgive me as I shamelessly use this platform to solicit employment. Desperate times call for desperate measures! I am among the many blindsided employees of LeisureLink who were left jobless. Are any of you competitors hiring? I was with Hawaiian Beach Rentals before VacationRoost bought them out, then worked with VacationRoost prior to their acquisition of LeisureLink, finally settling in a comfortable position with LeisureLink. Therefore, I have experience in many different sectors of the business. I worked remotely for my entire time with the company- over 5 years in total. I am located in Southern California (Inland Empire). I see that many of you are outside the US. Maybe a remote US employee is just what you need! 😉 However, I have come to terms with the unlikelihood of finding another remote position, so hopefully some of you are local enough to utilize my eagerness to work with you. If at all possible, I would love to stay within the same (or similar) industry. Thanks for your consideration. Reply 6 months ago   Alex Aydin Send me your resume. We are hiring. Reply 6 months ago   Richard Vaughton I have to follow up on Alex’s comment here and is a common discussion point amongst managers and is well placed. Offering up full cash management to a third party is a risky situation. Managers are responsible to owners and this third party cash managament can cascade problems significantly. Look at Vacasol another “mid agent” sitting between contratctors, self marketing and creative channel distribution, now in bankcruptcy procedings and with clients possibly out of pocket. Any technology partner should be that, a conduit to booking success, with a means of transacting money seamlessly through secure, ring fenced bank accounts. Even UK banks will only secure £75K, so collect direct and manage efficiently. Its also not just the question of the being way out of pocket, its the lack of dynamic access to OTA’s on which many now rely. As for the $17m or $34m of however much was involved, it would be interesting to see the full story at some point.. Reply 6 months ago   Leisurelink Employee Alex if Leisurelink posed such a credit risk why did you try to buy them? Reply 6 months ago   Alex Aydin I think any company’s greatest assets is their employees. Leisurelink had very good, hard working and dedicated staff. It is a shame that they ended up in this situation. Reply 6 months ago   Former LL Employee It is a shame @AlexAydin. We busted our humps and it’s sad and disappointing that it ended like this. No severance either unfortunately. I don’t hold any grudges though. I’m grateful for the opportunity and the experience. Any former competitors out there that are looking to hire, I’d love to send you my resume! I have 3+ years experience working for an Online Travel Distributor as an Account Support Specialist troubleshooting software and listing issues for out clients. I would be a very worthy addition to your team ! Reply 6 months ago   Alex Aydin Send us your resume. We are looking to expand our support team. https://www.mybookingpal.com/sub-careers/applyform?id=2 6 months ago   Alex Aydin Lesson to be learned from Leisurelink   With the situation that former LeisureLink clinets and suppliers find themselves in, it can be a frightening time for property managers. We are hoping that all LeisureLink suppliers receive some, if not all, of the funds that are still owed to them. If, and when, suppliers receive their funds, they are still dealt with the daunting task of searching for another channel manager while the risk of another LeisureLink situation looms in their mind. To avert another LeisureLink situation, property managers must first understand why the situation occurred in the first place. The epicenter of the LeisureLink failure revolved around credit risk and business continuity. Credit risk was due to the model LeisureLink used where they operated as Merchant of Record. In that model, LeisureLink collected the funds given from guests and OTAs and would then transfer the funds owed to the supplier typically after guest departure from the property. This is where the property management risk comes into play. If the channel manager, as the Merchant of Record fails, then the supplier runs the risk of not getting paid. To avoid this as a supplier of properties, choose a channel manager that allows the property manager to act as Merchant of Record. This will allow property managers to receive payments directly from guests or OTAs. As Merchant of Record, property manager eliminates any possibility of credit risk on behalf of the channel manager. Reply 6 months ago   Steve Sherlock @Sean – perhaps Tnooz can discuss this internally, though for those folks making pretty serious accusations and who aren’t prepared to put their name to the accusation, then perhaps those comments should be removed. For all you know those making the accusations are competitors of those they accuse. Bit of a sordid affair all round. Reply 6 months ago   Matthew Gurley This is completely incorrect. I would truly appreciate it if you would stop trolling our company online. This is completely unprofessional and considered defamation. BookingPal is a separate entity and competitor of LeisureLink. If you took 20 minutes with me to look at our platform you would realize it’s completely different. Contact me for more details. Reply 6 months ago   BookingPAL is not your pal All the way at the top, the former President of Leisurelink, Richard Barajas, is now an adviser for BookingPal. I dont believe I would want anyone that helped steer a company into despair advising me on a damn thing. whether he was a current executive or not is irrelevant. A company doesn’t go down in five minutes…its an evolution of piss poor decision making and that very well goes back to the tenure of Richard Barajas and many other idiotic people. He was the President in December 2013 Reply 6 months ago   Matthew Gurley Again. Defamation and incorrect. I advice Tnooz admins to please remove this user from your pages. Our board of directors can be found directly on our website. 1 member used to work with LeisureLink. We are an American built company and only 3 years old in the space, and completely different from LeisureLink. Do some research. Our integrations are different, products are different, channel support is different. BookingPal only supports a fraction of channels LeisureLink did. If this was remotely true we would have the exact same connections right? Please act professional and join us to help LeisureLink users regain access to distribution in a way where they cannot possibly lose money. A key difference between us and Leisurelink is the ability to allow the PM to be merchant of record (something LeisureLink tried and failed to repeat consistently). This way a PM can use us, remain merchant of record, and not have the chance to lose funds in a situation like LeisureLink’s ever again. Reply 6 months ago   Richard Barajas I hesitate to respond to a nameless, non-specific post but I feel compelled to do so until Tnooz recognizes this as defamation and a defenseless position that should be removed. The most important things I’d like to communicate are 1) I’m saddened to see this outcome for LeisureLink. All the employees, including myself, worked hard and did our best for our customers and our company. 2) BookingPal is a top-notch, professional organization with great technology and people. They have built a solid integrated infrastructure from day 1 targeted to serve the Vacation Rental marketplace. I encourage you to contact them and decide for yourself. Reply 6 months ago   Erica We are customers of a property that got screwed over by Leisure Link and guess what? When we arrived to the property they made us pay twice for the room we had already paid for in full, because Leisure Link hadn’t paid them. So guess who really got screwed here? Me the guest and you know what? $500 extra is a lot to me whereas I’m guessing it’s nothing to you Richard Barajas. So now we have paid twice for a room because you and your company.

Reply 7 months ago   Jane Doe Just received this from them: Dear Valued Partner, LeisureLink has been helping suppliers of vacation rentals generate bookings through third party channels for over nine years, and has experienced accelerated growth for the past several quarters. Supporting this growth and building the technology solutions for the industry has been a capital intensive process. LeisureLink is privately-owned and has historically met these capital needs with investments from its owners. For the last 12 months, LeisureLink has been working with an investment bank to raise additional equity capital to fund the Company’s growth for the future. The Company expected this process would yield an infusion of needed capital this summer. While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations. As a result, we have no choice but to stop operations and not process any new bookings as of September 27, 2016. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off. LeisureLink values the working relationships built over these last 9 years and appreciates the loyalty of its employees, vendors, customers and partners and is trying to cease operations as smoothly and orderly as possible, given the circumstances. To that end, the Company has agreed to undertake an Assignment for Benefit of Creditors (“Assignment”), which is a process designed to manage an orderly disposition of the Company’s assets and to distribute those proceeds to creditors according to their legal rights and priorities. As required by law, the Assignee will be mailing notices of the Assignment to all creditors in the next 30 days, providing further information about the Assignment and providing creditors with a proof of claim form through which creditors can file a claim for any obligations due.

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT INNOVATION Ireland risks sending a dangerous message to its innovators by John Kennedy 1 hour ago1 Share The Old Library at Trinity College Dublin. Image: EQRoy/Shutterstock In the 21st century, it will be the innovators that generate the jobs and wealth. They need to be encouraged, writes John Kennedy. On a sun-showery spring day in 1999, I had a conversation with an academic at UCD Business School in Blackrock. It started pleasantly enough, but set alarm bells off in my mind. He said that “tech transfer” – the conversion of academic research into industry and, ultimately, businesses that create jobs – at that time in Ireland was virtually non-existent and that most research projects just gathered dust on professors’ shelves. This contrasted with the US where tech giants such as Cisco had emerged as campus companies, only to become industry giants laying the plumbing of the internet. Around this time, people were starting to use Google for the first time. The company was founded on the campus at Stanford University in California by two PhD students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, just a year previously in 1998. ‘The world is changing and higher education is facing a disruptive revolution, and we need to make sure that we are ready by pushing the boundaries and creating an integrated ecosystem, where civil society, industry and academia collectively participate in the process of economic development’ – PROF WILLIE DONNELLY It was a surprise revelation by the professor because at that very time, Iona Technologies – a company founded on the campus of Trinity College Dublin that bootstrapped itself most of the way –was the darling of Nasdaq, and inspired other tech founders to pursue the IPO dream. Remember, this was four years before Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) was created and given a war chest of around €1bn to correct the anomaly, whereby the Irish academic landscape was a cosy, sleepy career path for lecturers, and PhDs pushing boundaries were in the minority. In 2003, SFI came onto the scene and laid the foundations for a turnaround that can only described as miraculous, if such a word can be used in the scientific community. In the intervening years, thousands of PhDs have been created in Ireland. Proof of the pudding, if there were such metrics, can be seen in the continuous cycle of breakthroughs from various research centres around Ireland. Another way of examining how battle-fit Irish PhDs have become is the €80bn Horizon 2020 programme from the EU. Irish research organisations had been aiming to secure a total of €1.2bn over the six-year period of the programme and so far, 588 Irish research projects have secured €251m in funding. According to Enterprise Ireland, the higher education system accounted for €157m of the total funding, while companies based in Ireland made up a further €72m. The key thing is that in just 14 years, Irish researchers have been conditioned to be among the best in Europe, vying with the world leaders in the industry. From every corner of Ireland, good science should be celebrated For students to become academics and achieve a PhD qualification, it requires extraordinary commitment and personal sacrifice. It is a long road fuelled by the passion of discovery and the love of science and technology. It is one that ultimately leads to rewards, either in the form of peer recognition, or the successful sale or spin-out of a company. For the local economy and the academic institution itself, the birth of companies that scale and are either acquired or go public leads to recognition and the creation of local jobs. In the case of Stanford University, a 2012 study noted that companies founded by the university’s alumni generate $3trn in economic impact every year, credited with creating 5.4m jobs. It might seem like news to some, but in the south-eastern corner of Ireland, Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) and its TSSG research campus were working to emulate Stanford and other celebrated innovation hubs such as MIT in their own way. And it has been succeeding. The campus has spawned numerous spin-out companies such as Immersive VR Education, which just raised €1m in funding. In the wider hinterland, businesses formed by graduates such as NearForm are creating 100 jobs in Tramore. The jewel in the crown was the sale of FeedHenry, a company originally created by professors at WIT, to open source software giant Red Hat for €63.5m in cash in 2014. FeedHenry, which makes software used by mobile networks, recently announced a €12.7m investment in Waterford that will result in 60 new jobs. This is in addition to the 100 people already employed at FeedHenry’s Waterford and Dublin offices. I have remarked in the past how the WIT/TSSG model has become a kind of template for academic and start-up success, and ought to be emulated in other regions in Ireland to boost reputation and create jobs. According to WIT, the research and innovation model has contributed €600m to the local economy over the last 10 years. WIT has signed 34 intellectual property (IP) licenses; works with more than 200 multinationals, start-ups and SMEs every year; has spun out 10 companies so far; and supports 600 jobs in the local region. Diamonds in the coal Traditionally, academia and business are like oil and water. But when someone builds the right engine, it purrs. And when it purrs, jobs are created. Any Stanford university professor worth his or her salt would recognise the model at WIT and TSSG as one not too dissimilar from their own way of working. The key here is understanding the knowledge economies of the 21st century and how IP translates into business success. So, it was a surprise recently to see the fracas that emerged following the sale of FeedHenry, which resulted in the president of WIT, Prof Willie Donnelly, being hauled before the Dáil’s Committee of Public Accounts. Local Sinn Féin politician David Cullinane, TD, was only doing his job when he asked why, out of the almost €64m sale price of FeedHenry, just €1.3m was returned to WIT. It transpired that at the time of the acquisition, WIT held just a 3.1pc share of the company. Donnelly, one of the company’s founders who created the IP through the course of his academic research, held a 2pc share of the company. By 2014, FeedHenry had five investors: ACT Venture Capital, Enterprise Ireland, Kernel Capital, VMware and Intel. Just a year previously, in May 2013, Intel led a $9m Series A round investment in FeedHenry. The key here is to understand how start-ups businesses are built and how, ultimately, shareholding gets diluted as more investors are brought on board. It would surprise people how little founders of companies actually get, despite the high-profile, high-octane amounts that they have sold for in Ireland in recent months. Cullinane also questioned if academics or the staff of colleges should be commercially involved in the founding of companies at all and would it not be a conflict of interest? Such a question would be dismissed in Silicon Valley as naïve, but it is clear that Cullinane is acting in the public interest and Ireland, being a no-show or late to such parties as the industrial revolution, is playing catch-up. He is right to ask such questions. If any good has come of this, it is the airing of a necessary debate and an important education in how business of the future will be conducted. We need to encourage our scientists to reach for the stars, not hide in labs However, it also risks sending the wrong signals to PhD students and other would-be innovators who actually want to build world-beating companies. Are they going to be penalised for starting businesses? Perish the thought that they should be allowed to gain from their creations. If WIT is guilty of anything, it is catching up too fast for politicians to grasp, putting Ireland on the international stage, and boosting the reputation and prowess of our researchers and the south-eastern region as a place to build tech companies. At the Committee on Public Accounts, Dr Graham Love, CEO of the Higher Education Authority, pointed out that there are national protocols on commercialisation of research in third-level colleges. He said that it is not unusual for a college’s shareholding in a spin-out to be diluted over time as external money is invested. A shareholding, he said, could typically fall from 10pc or 15pc down to 1pc or 2pc, indicating that WIT was actually above the average. In an interview with The Irish Times two weeks ago, Donnelly spoke candidly of the situation, stating that he fully declared his interest in FeedHenry and was not involved in decisions over the commercialisation of the research. “In research-driven, third-level institutions, conflicts of interest do occur. The important thing is that an institute has a framework in place to manage those conflicts.” In a democracy, it is only fitting that when an issue regarding the public interest emerges, it is fully investigated and debated. In an Ireland made weary by corruption, Cullinane was right to probe about any potential wrongdoing or to see if taxpayers were getting a return on their investment. If public representatives had been similarly motivated to tackle a raft of glaring issues in banking and health, then Ireland might be a very different place today. But it is important to remember that Donnelly and his colleagues were doing their jobs too. They are academics and therefore, they are science whizzes. WIT has the 388th-fastest supercomputer on the planet and its name is Fionn, for God’s sake. Their success should be emulated and used to inspire others. Since the acquisition, FeedHenry has announced 60 new jobs. If you use the logic that each tech job is responsible for creating an additional two jobs locally, then the impact is manifold. Politicians in the region ought to be appreciative of the achievement. But Cullinane has hit on on an interesting issue. In the UK, awkward questions are being asked about what happens to IP that emerges from academia and how it can be turned into commercial success or not. The Financial Times recently reported examples of squandered potential including Humira, the rheumatoid arthritis drug, which had its origins in research by the UK Medical Research Council but was commercialised in the US. It is now the world’s best-selling medicine with annual sales of $13bn for AbbVie. If the FeedHenry case does anything, it will educate the public and clarify rules about how research can be commercialised, and properly exploited, and how those who create and invent can expect to be rewarded. We should also consider the reputational win, not only for the colleges but the wider region, too. Ireland’s south-east is gaining a reputation for software excellence due to the emergence of companies such as FeedHenry and NearForm. Immersive VR Education has the potential to become a globally recognised game brand thanks to its Titanic and Apollo 11 VR creations. The acquisition of FeedHenry resulted in the arrival of a multinational to Waterford. And that is something that matters in a region that often complains about being overlooked when it comes to foreign direct investment. If the matter spirals, it is a dangerous line that Ireland will be walking. We want those who look at the stars to dream, and go further to lay the paths. The last thing we want to do is diminish what has been achieved in just 14 years, or discourage people from turning IP created in Irish colleges or businesses into global brand names. Remember: it is up to politicians, ministers and civil servants to create policy. It is then up to the innovators and entrepreneurs to interpret that policy and turn it into something positive. The last words are from a recent statement by Donnelly: “WIT has created an ecosystem of research and innovation, which is all about collaboration, knowledge transfer, sustainability and impact. We do this by involving industry, funders and policymakers in the process, and this has been demonstrably very successful for the region. “However, the world is changing and higher education is facing a disruptive revolution, and we need to make sure that we are ready by pushing the boundaries and creating an integrated ecosystem, where civil society, industry and academia collectively participate in the process of economic development. “This requires new, agile and responsive academic structures based on entrepreneurship, creativity and global connectivity.” The Old Library at Trinity College Dublin.

It is a four-five hour drive from Chicago, 200 km west of Indianapolis in Indiana and home to approximately 85,000 people as per the 2014 census. The University of Illinois with its sprawling grounds is a significant landmark in the campus town. Many of its alumni have settled in the vicinity, founded start-ups and also triggered off Fortune 500 companies like Dow Chemicals, IBM, State Farm, Sony and Intel. The city is also known for the Art Theatre Co-op which since its inception in 1913 has been screening critically acclaimed independent and foreign films. There's also the historic Virginia Theatre, a 1525-seat theatre dating back to the 1920s, with ornate, Spanish Renaissance-influenced interiors, an opera stage and an elaborate Wurlitzer pipe organ. Every year, between March and May, the theatre hosts late author-critic Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival aka Ebertfest. For the rest of the year, it doesn't have a daily show schedule, but several special screenings and live performances every month. After his death, on April 4, 2013, a life-size bronze statue of Ebert was unveiled in front of the theatre during the Ebertfest on April 24, 2014. Nawazuddin Siddiqui to rap for his next film After putting on dancing shoes on his two left feet, the actor will now wield a mic. In April 2012, Nawazuddin Siddiqui visited Champaign on Ebert's invitation and stayed with him and his wife, Chaz, for eight days. "And that was my greatest international affair," he reminisces. Over to Nawaz: Come, live with me I've travelled the world because my films have been screened at international film festivals and it's been wonderful walking the red carpet abroad. But my most cherished memories from my journeys has not been in big, buzzing city, but in a small village called Champaign, wohi peena wala... Interesting name, isn't it? Every year, Roger Ebert (winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Film Criticism) would hand-pick twelve films from across the globe for his Ebertfest, which continues to take place every summer in Champaign. He would pick up the phone and call the who's who of Hollywood to speak at the festival and no matter how big the star, he would immediately fly out for Roger saab. He was the greatest film critic in the world and he was the man who had introduced the thumbs-up for film reviews. Many Indian critics try to copy his style even today. For the 14th edition of the Ebertfest, he had especially selected -Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi's drama 'A Separation', and Prashant Bhargava's debut film, 'Patang', in which I had acted. Giving the film the rare rating of four stars, he had described it as, "'Patang' flies as free and colourful as a kite". He did not review Bollywood movies but he was an updated man, in sync with every film coming out of India and touring the festival circuit. Indian films were constantly on his radar. He loved 'Patang' so much that he invited me to come and live with him for a few days. He said I was 'a natural' and I still think it was the greatest compliment ever. He lip-synced pre-recorded speeches on stage. In one he spoke about 'Patang' at length. I still smile when I think of all the wonderful memories I have with him. Look, who's talking There is not much to see in Champaign. It is a chhota sa gaanv and I went to university for a walk. I also walked around the city and met a lot of new people. At one particular lunch at Roger saab's home, there were other guests too, -Michael Shanon (actor-musician from Revolutionary Road) and Paul Cox (prolific Dutch-Australian filmmaker). We only discussed movies. Since Roger saab had throat cancer, he could not speak or eat food. There was a steel plate in his neck. He would write on a piece of paper and a machine would say it in a voice. We spoke a lot like this, but not once did I feel like he was impaired. In fact, I was more comfortable talking to him than I have ever felt. His wife would often join us, and they were very hospitable. A summer to remember I watched Citizen Kane with Roger saab and it felt like watching it for the first time. I had watched it years ago in drama school and wanted to become an actor. Roger saab and I decoded the film for four hours. He'd done a voice-over for the film, it was magical. We watched another film too and I learnt how to really criticise and appreciate a film. Roger saab explained the layered and nonlinear narrative forms, uses of lighting, how a chair suddenly becomes too big, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. I understood everything. There were no language barriers. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device. RELATED From around the web Remember Hurley?

REUTERS/Toru Hanai 2/3 left right Renesas Electronics Corp's logo is seen at the company's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, April 10, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai 3/3 TOKYO Japanese automotive chip maker Renesas Electronics Corp is hungry for more acquisitions amid a wave of megamergers in the industry and may need to issue equity shares sometime in the future to build its warchest, its CEO said on Monday. "The fragmented (automotive chip) market will be eventually consolidated into some dominant players" posing a long-term threat to Renesas, currently the world's No. 3, Renesas chief executive Bunsei Kure told reporters. NXP Semiconductors NV, the industry leader, has agreed to be acquired by Qualcomm Inc in a $47 billion deal to retain its lead in the fast-growing automotive chips market. And more recently, Intel Corp agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion. Kure said Renesas, which bought U.S. chipmaker Intersil Corp for $3.2 billion this year, is constantly reviewing its list of potential acquisition targets, comprising around several dozen names in fields such as sensors and security. To be ready for major acquisitions, Kure said the company would probably need to raise capital by issuing shares "at some point" in the future. "We want to be prepared to move when necessary," he said. According to data research firm IHS, Renesas had an automotive chip market share of 9.0 percent in 2016, ranking after NXP with 12.6 percent and Infineon Technologies with 9.5 percent.

Fidelity Labs, the innovation arm of asset manager Fidelity, will be a member of IC3 along with Cornell University, University of California at Berkeley, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, the Technion, IBM Corp <IBM.N> and Intel Corp <INTC.O>, the company said in a statement. The Boston-based fund manager will collaborate with the group to develop blockchain programmes to help make financial systems more efficient and secure. Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a distributed record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers, rather than a centralised authority. Over the past two years, financial institutions have been ramping up their investments in the technology in the hopes that it can help the make some of its processes simpler and cheaper. Potential use cases range from systems to manage international payments, to programs to settle securities trades. In a bid to accelerate development and adoption of blockchain, companies have been joining forces in several industry consortia and groups. Banks have been more vocal about their efforts than asset managers, with most large lenders having joined a group led by New York-based startup R3. Most recently a group of 30 companies, including several banks, launched a new blockchain consortium called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. “What IC3 brings is that academic computer science legacy that can help us explore how this technology can be applied,” said Hadley Stern, senior vice president at Fidelity Labs, explaining why the asset manager had chosen the group. Use cases the asset manager is interested include the settlement of repurchase agreements transactions, Stern said. Despite the excitement around blockchain, the technology is still in its early days and proponents warn that it may take years before financial institutions can fully reap its benefits. IC3, which is based at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech in New York City, conducts research aimed at developing blockchain that meets the standards needed to be deployed by businesses. “Expected outcomes of our work include new blockchain and smart contract technologies that are secure, incrementally deployable, and efficient to meet the industry’s needs,” said Emin Gün Sirer, co-director of IC3 and a professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York (Reporting by Anna Irrera; Editing by Lisa Shumaker) Share this article: euronews provides breaking news articles from reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.

This means we should see it fully unveiled during Computex in late-May/early-June, with the new CPUs arriving on the LGA2066 socket (Socket R4) - without integrated graphics.   The difference between Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X is that Kaby Lake-X will offer 4 cores, while Skylake-X offers up to 10 cores.

Tiny trams crept around a metal track, about 1/12 scale size, as students explained the technology behind the effort. “We want people to see this can happen,” said Derick Wong, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering. “This will happen.” The student engineers were part of more than a dozen teams of San Jose State students showing off prototypes for improving society — from better transportation to environmental preservation — at the Paseo Public Prototyping Festival. Shivani Aurora, a graduate student and associate student director of the festival, said the goal is to have students engage with social issues and the world around them. “It’s good for the students, and it’s good for the community,” she said. The goal was to bring together artists, engineers and designers to support student teams and find innovation solutions to urban issues. Organizers surveyed San Jose residents about their city’s most pressing priorities – and homelessness, housing and crime topped the list. Students worked on the projects for a year before Saturday’s festival at the Hammer Theatre Center. The event also featured lectures and workshops on design and community building. Backers include the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the city of San Jose, and a handful of tech companies, including Intel, Microsoft and Autodesk. Despite off-and-on rain Saturday, students showed off their electronic prototypes under a canopy of white tents. The best prototypes were eligible for $10,000 in prizes. The Solar Walk proposed a pathway of solar panel-powered lights embedded in sidewalks. The idea was to illuminate streets for safety, but also as a fun way to engage people on their way to work or school, said Phung Tran, a senior digital media arts major at San Jose State. Tran originally wanted to design sidewalks that could also wirelessly charge phones and other devices. After adding an engineer to the project team, he realized it wasn’t such a great idea. “It turns out that’s quite dangerous,” he said with a laugh. The team, which continued to develop and refine the project, now envisions blinking walkways that could light up in team colors outside arenas or create displays in other public spaces. “It’s mainly an art project,” said team member Thomas Shu, a graduate student in aerospace engineering. Other students took on practical, contemporary problems. The Sweet Spot project looked for ways to help scientists collect more data on bee populations threatened by disease and chemicals. The team engineered a box filled with holes for insects to place around plants. As bees pass through the holes, a video camera captures their flight and flower preferences. “We went with bees because it’s a problem everywhere,” said team member John Scheckel. “Anything we learn here will be practical.”   Tags:  San Jose State University Louis Hansen Louis Hansen covers Tesla and renewable energy for the Bay Area News Group and is based at The Mercury News.

A team of Dutch scientists has built a supercomputer the size of four pizza boxes. The Little Green Machine II has the computing power of 10,000 PCs and will be used by researchers in oceanography, computer science, artificial intelligence, financial modeling and astronomy. The computer is based at Leiden University (the Netherlands) and developed with help from IBM. The supercomputer has a computing power of more than 0.2 Petaflops. That's 200,000,000,000,000 calculations per second. Thereby this supercomputer equals the computing power of more than 10,000 ordinary PCs. The researchers constructed their supercomputer from four servers with four special graphics cards each. They connected the PCs via a high-speed network. Project leader Simon Portegies Zwart (Leiden University): "Our design is very compact. You could transport it with a carrier bicycle. Besides that we only use about 1% of the electricity of a similar large supercomputer." Unlike its predecessor Little Green Machine I the new supercomputer uses professionalized graphics cards that are made for big scientific calculations, and no longer the default video cards from gaming computers. The machine isn't based on the x86 architecture from Intel anymore either, but uses the much faster OpenPower architecture developed by IBM. Astronomer Jeroen Bedorf (Leiden University): "We greatly improved the communication between the graphic cards in the last six months. Therefore we could connect several cards together to form a whole. This technology is essential for the construction of a supercomputer, but not very useful for playing video games." To test the little supercomputer the researchers simulated the collision between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy that will occur in about four billion years from now. Just a few years ago the researchers performed the same simulation at the huge Titan Computer (17.6 petaflops) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (USA). "Now we can do this calculation at home," Jeroen Bedorf says, "That's so convenient." Little Green Machine II is the successor of Little Green Machine I that was built in 2010. The new small supercomputer is about ten times faster than its predecessor which is retiring as of today. The name Little Green Machine was chosen because of its small size and low power consumption. In addition, it is a nod to Jocelyn Bell Burnell who discovered the first radio pulsar in 1967. That pulsar, the first ever discovered, got nicknamed LGM-1 where LGM stands for Little Green Men. The construction of the small supercomputer cost about 200,000 euros and is financially supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). The machine is developed by: Joost Batenburg (Centrum Wiskunde and Informatica, Amsterdam), Gerard Barkema (Utrecht University), Jeroen Bedorf (Leiden University), Rob Bisseling (Utrecht University), Arjen Doelman (Leiden University), Henk Dijkstra (Utrecht University) Barry Koren (TU Eindhoven), Kees Oosterlee (Centrum Wiskunde and Informatica, Amsterdam), Aske Plaat (Leiden University), Simon Portegies Zwart (Leiden University), Kees Vuik (TU Delft) and Harry Wijshoff (Leiden University).

Love visual aspect of news?: Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! By Ian King and Susan Decker Qualcomm Inc. accused Apple Inc. of lying to regulators to spur investigations of the chipmaker, and threatening it to cover up the use of inferior parts in some iPhones. The world’s largest maker of phone semiconductors responded to a January lawsuit from Apple with counterclaims for damages late Monday, alleging the iPhone maker breached contractual pledges, mischaracterized their agreements and misrepresented facts. “We were really stunned by some of the things that they included in their suit,” said Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg,. “This is our attempt to respond to some disturbing elements in their complaint.” At the heart of the worsening standoff is a commercial dispute over how much Qualcomm is entitled to charge phone makers to use its patented technology, whether or not they use its chips. The San Diego, California-based company gets the majority of its profit from licensing technology that covers the fundamentals of all modern mobile phone systems. Qualcomm shares are down 12 percent since Apple sued Jan. 20, wiping more than $10 billion off the chipmaker’s market value. Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock declined to comment on the filing, saying the company’s January suit explains its position on the matter. Apple is alone among major handset makers in not paying Qualcomm directly and has instead paid through contract manufacturers in Asia who build the iPhone. It’s now meddling in the legal agreements Qualcomm has with those suppliers, including Foxconn Technology Co. as it pressures the chipmaker to cut a more favorable deal on licensing fees, Rosenberg said. According to Qualcomm, Apple is behind regulatory investigations of its business practices worldwide. Cupertino, California-based Apple has lobbied with “false and misleading statements to induce regulators to take action against us because it would be in their commercial interests,” Rosenberg said. Record Fine In December South Korea’s antitrust regulator slapped a record 1.03 trillion won ($902 million) fine on Qualcomm for violating antitrust laws. Then, in January, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission accused it in a lawsuit of forcing Apple to use its chips exclusively in return for lower licensing fees and unfairly cutting out competitors. It’s also facing investigations in Europe and Taiwan. Apple filed its antitrust complaint Jan. 20 in Qualcomm’s hometown of San Diego, accusing the chipmaker of illegally trying to control the market for chips and improperly withholding more than $1 billion in “rebates” to punish the iPhone-maker for talking to Korean regulators. Apple sought to have its case joined with one filed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in Northern California. The FTC has also accused Qualcomm of illegally maintaining a monopoly for semiconductors in mobile phones. Apple’s request was denied April 5. Qualcomm is now trying to have the FTC case dismissed. Past Overcharges In addition to the $1 billion in withheld fees, Apple is seeking billions more in compensation for what it calls past overcharges, and lower royalties going forward. Qualcomm says Apple has soured a decade worth of working together and has threatened Qualcomm, to try to prevent it from publicly speaking about the performance of the iPhone 7. Some models of that device rely on Intel Corp. modems for their connections to phone networks and, according to Qualcomm, aren’t as good as the ones that use its modems. “We didn’t ask for this fight. Apple is a customer,” said Rosenberg. “We, of course, would like to continue to and will continue to do business with Apple.” While Apple’s iPhone revolutionized the smartphone industry in 2007 with its sleek design and user-friendly apps, none of them would have worked without the foundational technology developed by Qualcomm and other companies, Rosenberg said. He said Qualcomm gets “a small fraction” of the price of an iPhone, and contrasted that with the more than $1 billion Apple sought from rival Samsung Electronics Co. over the use of patented features like a pinching motion to expand or contract images. Qualcomm said it’s been the biggest contributor to the standardized technology that forms the foundation of all modern telecommunications. All companies that developed the standards pledged to license patents on those standards on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Regulators and courts worldwide have been struggling with how to interpret that pledge, including how to calculate royalties and what rights the patent owners retain when it comes to recalcitrant would-be licensees. Qualcomm is seeking court rulings that it complied with its obligations and that its agreements with contractors follow licensing commitments. It also wants the court to rule that it’s Apple who’s been in breach of contract and that it’s engaged in unfair competition. The case is Apple Inc. v. Qualcomm Inc., 17-00108, U.S. District Court, Southern District of California (San Diego).

Image Credit: Reuters / Mike Blake Qualcomm fired back at Apple in court on Monday, saying the iPhone maker’s January lawsuit should be rejected. Qualcomm also made its own claims seeking damages, accusing Apple of harming its business and breaching deals between the two companies. Apple’s lawsuit accused Qualcomm, one of the leading developers of cellular communications technologies, of abusing its dominant position by forcing phone makers to pay excessive royalties, even when they used modem chips from Qualcomm rivals. But Qualcomm responded that its royalties were consistent with laws around the world and had been adopted by companies for decades. It denied blocking Apple’s ability to use competitors’ products, and said Apple had interfered with its business relationships with companies that manufacture the iPhone and other smartphones. “We have negotiated hundreds of bilateral license agreements over the last two plus decades,” Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg tells Fortune in an interview. “And those have clearly established a clear market value for the tens of thousand, now of patents that we hold in the whole area of cell technology.” The Apple lawsuit, and other antitrust legal challenges against Qualomm filed worldwide, threaten the most lucrative part of the company’s business. In addition to the Apple case, regulators in South Korea, home of top phone maker Samsung Electronics, have issued a nearly $1 billion fine against Qualcomm in a similar case. The large smartphone makers appear to have seen an opening to hit the Qualcomm model after China cracked down on the chipmaker’s allegedly monopolistic practices two years ago, imposing a $975 million fine and forcing new negotiations with device makers. Apple’s lawsuit goes to the heart of Qualcomm’s licensing model, which charges phone makers a percentage of the value of every phone, not just a cut of the price of specific modem chips used in phones. Last year, Qualcomm’s royalty licensing division reported $6.5 billion of pretax profit on $7.6 billion of revenue. Meanwhile, the company’s own chip business itself only made $1.8 billion in pretax profit on $15.4 billion of sales. The threat has spooked investors in Qualcomm. The company’s share price has lost 12% since the day before Apple filed suit. Counterclaims against Apple In its lengthy response to Apple’s lawsuit on Monday, Qualcomm made a series of claims of its own against Apple for which is seeking unspecified damages. Apple interfered with Qualcomm’s agreements negotiated with Asian contract manufacturers, Qualcomm charged. Also, after Apple opted to use a modem made by Intel in about half of the new iPhone 7 line, the company sought to forbid Qualcomm from publicly discussing the superior capabilities in Qualcomm’s similar modem. “Our chips had capabilities that Apple chose not to use in the iPhone 7, in my belief, because they wanted to basically employ a lowest common denominator approach,” Rosenberg says. “Intel’s modem chip couldn’t do, didn’t have the capabilities that our our chips had.” Qualcomm also said Apple violated a cooperation agreement between the two companies. Apple claimed in its lawsuit that Qualcomm had long paid it quarterly “rebates” on royalties through the agreement, but stopped making the payments last year, prompting Apple’s litigation. Qualcomm denies that the payments were rebates on the royalties. Instead, Qualcomm says it paid Apple in return for cooperating with engineering and development of chips and other technologies used in the iPhone. The agreements also prohibited the two companies from suing each other over patents or otherwise attacking each other directly or via government regulators, Qualcomm says.

Ian KingSusan Decker Qualcomm shares are down 12% since Apple sued it on 20 January, wiping more than $10 billion off the chipmaker’s market value. AP San Francisco/ Washington: Qualcomm Inc. accused Apple Inc. of lying to regulators to spur investigations of the chipmaker, and threatening it to cover up the use of inferior parts in some iPhones. The world’s largest maker of phone semiconductors responded to a January lawsuit from Apple with counterclaims for damages late Monday, alleging the iPhone maker breached contractual pledges, mischaracterized their agreements and misrepresented facts. “We were really stunned by some of the things that they included in their suit,” said Qualcomm’s General Counsel, Don Rosenberg. “This is our attempt to respond to some disturbing elements in their complaint.” At the heart of the worsening standoff is a commercial dispute over how much Qualcomm is entitled to charge phone makers to use its patented technology, whether or not they use its chips. The San Diego, California-based company gets the majority of its profit from licensing technology that covers the fundamentals of all modern mobile phone systems. Qualcomm shares are down 12% since Apple sued 20 January, wiping more than $10 billion off the chipmaker’s market value. Apple is alone among major handset makers in not paying Qualcomm directly and has instead paid through contract manufacturers in Asia who build the iPhone. It’s now meddling in the legal agreements Qualcomm has with those suppliers, including Foxconn Technology Co. as it pressures the chipmaker to cut a more favourable deal on licensing fees, Rosenberg said. According to Qualcomm, Apple is behind regulatory investigations of its business practices worldwide. Cupertino, California-based Apple has lobbied with “false and misleading statements to induce regulators to take action against us because it would be in their commercial interests,” Rosenberg said. In December South Korea’s antitrust regulator slapped a record 1.03 trillion won ($902 million) fine on Qualcomm for violating antitrust laws. Then, in January, the US Federal Trade Commission accused it in a lawsuit of forcing Apple to use its chips exclusively in return for lower licensing fees and unfairly cutting out competitors. It’s also facing investigations in Europe and Taiwan. Apple filed its antitrust complaint 20 January in Qualcomm’s hometown of San Diego, accusing the chipmaker of illegally trying to control the market for chips and improperly withholding more than $1 billion in “rebates” to punish the iPhone-maker for talking to Korean regulators. Apple sought to have its case joined with one filed by the US Federal Trade Commission in Northern California. The FTC has also accused Qualcomm of illegally maintaining a monopoly for semiconductors in mobile phones. Apple’s request was denied 5 April. Qualcomm is now trying to have the FTC case dismissed. In addition to the $1 billion in withheld fees, Apple is seeking billions more in compensation for what it calls past overcharges, and lower royalties going forward. Qualcomm says Apple has soured a decade worth of working together and has threatened Qualcomm, to try to prevent it from publicly speaking about the performance of the iPhone 7. Some models of that device rely on Intel Corp. modems for their connections to phone networks and, according to Qualcomm, aren’t as good as the ones that use its modems. “We didn’t ask for this fight. Apple is a customer,” said Rosenberg. “We, of course, would like to continue to and will continue to do business with Apple.” While Apple’s iPhone revolutionised the smartphone industry in 2007 with its sleek design and user-friendly apps, none of them would have worked without the foundational technology developed by Qualcomm and other companies, Rosenberg said. He said Qualcomm gets “a small fraction” of the price of an iPhone, and contrasted that with the more than $1 billion Apple sought from rival Samsung Electronics Co. over the use of patented features like a pinching motion to expand or contract images. Qualcomm said it’s been the biggest contributor to the standardized technology that forms the foundation of all modern telecommunications. All companies that developed the standards pledged to license patents on those standards on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Regulators and courts worldwide have been struggling with how to interpret that pledge, including how to calculate royalties and what rights the patent owners retain when it comes to recalcitrant would-be licensees. Qualcomm is seeking court rulings that it complied with its obligations and that its agreements with contractors follow licensing commitments. It also wants the court to rule that it’s Apple who’s been in breach of contract and that it’s engaged in unfair competition.

Qualcomm shares are down 12% since Apple sued Jan 20, wiping more than $10 billion off the chipmaker’s market value.  Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock declined to comment on the filing, saying the company’s January suit explains its position on the matter.  Apple is alone among major handset makers in not paying Qualcomm directly and has instead paid through contract manufacturers in Asia who build the iPhone.

Apply for leniency Calls for tenders and proposals Public consultations Legislation and case law Cases In this section: Overview Did you find what you wanted?  Yes No What were you looking for? (Leave your email address if you want a reply) Any suggestions? Consumer goods Overview Consumer goods are items you buy for yourself or your home. This means products like clothing and footwear; detergents, cosmetics and perfumes; household appliances; watches and clocks; furniture; musical instruments; sports goods; toys and tools. If competition in the consumer goods sector is weak, people are directly affected through reduced choice, higher prices and limited innovation. So, the European Commission aims to safeguard competition for the benefit of consumers. The Commission's Directorate-General for Competition has investigated a range of cases involving various products in this sector, both under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (restrictive business practices) and Article 102 TFEU (abuse of dominant position). Because these goods are typically products that are sold through a long, vertical supply chain with many actors (manufacturer – importer – distributor – retailer), the Commission is often called upon to ensure that the ways in which these goods finally find their way to the consumer, adhere to the principles of free competition. Restrictions on actors in the supply chain at any level (such as exclusive dealing obligations or the imposition of resale prices) may limit competition in an unjustifiable way and may therefore infringe Article 101 TFEU. For more details, see our page on restrictions in vertical agreements. In other cases, an actor in the supply chain may have a dominant position and seek to abuse that dominant position by hindering competitors or by imposing unreasonable obligations on suppliers or customers. In such cases, that actor may be infringing Article 102 TFEU. See for instance the cases of Intel and of Motorola. In recent years the Commission has also taken on several cartels covering consumer goods, such as rechargeable batteries and paper envelopes. See also the speech "Competition for a Fairer Society", delivered by Commissioner Vestager and the speech "Tackling the issues that matter to consumers", delivered by Director General Johannes Laitenberger on behalf of Commissioner Vestager in 2016.         Last update: 23.03.2017   •  Home  •  Contact  •  Sitemap  •  Top

While it had been previously reported that Qualcomm was considering legal action, the company made it official today in a 134-page filing… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In the filing, Qualcomm firmly denied the allegations made by Apple. The chip maker stated that Apple is trying to use its power to force Qualcomm into lowering royalties for its own sake (via CNET): “Apple’s goal is clear — to leverage its immense power to force Qualcomm into accepting less than fair value for the patented technologies that have led innovation in cellular technology and helped Apple generate more than $760 billion in iPhone sales,” Qualcomm said in its filing. Additionally, Qualcomm accused Apple of breach of contract and interfering with agreements and relationships Qualcomm has with other companies. The company also accuses Apple of withholding payments that are part of a previously agreed upon relationship for high-speed technology. Furthermore, Apple is being accused of deliberately making false statements to the government relating to Qualcomm’s business. While Apple argued in its lawsuit that Qualcomm had caused damages to its business, Qualcomm states in its lawsuit that “to the extent that Apple has suffered damages, if at all, all damages were caused by Apple’s own actions.” Perhaps most notably, Qualcomm alleges in its lawsuit that Apple knowingly under-clocked the Qualcomm LTE chip in the iPhone 7 to get of rid of discrepancy between models with the Intel chip. Apple also allegedly threatened Qualcomm to prevent it from making public comparisons that unearthed the “superior performance of Qualcomm-powered iPhones.” Apple originally sued Qualcomm earlier this year for $1 billion over patent royalties. Apple’s lawsuit followed an FTC complaint that alleged Qualcomm engaged in monopolistic practices to prevent Apple from sourcing key components from competitors. For its part, Qualcomm responded and explained that Apple “intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations.” Originally, it had been reported that Qualcomm was mulling retaliatory legal action against Apple, but that it hoped the business relationship between the two would go unaffected. Qualcomm, in its legal filing toady, spoke fondly of Apple and its effect on consumer technology: “Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies,” Qualcomm said. “Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies.” When asked for comment, Apple referred back to the comment it made in January: “For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations.” Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

By Omar Sohail Apr 7, 2017 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Microsoft did not announce its Surface Pro 5 last year, so it was believed that the company was working on some radical changes to really help consumers jump to the 2-in-1 computing club. Unfortunately, the new word on the street is that the company might not incorporate those changes to warrant a purchase from you because it appears that the Surface Pro 5 could be just an iterative update over its predecessor. Surface Pro 5 Power Connector to Remain the Same Meaning no Thunderbolt 3 Support According to Paul Thurrott, Microsoft’s upcoming Surface Pro 5 is expected to retain the Surface Connect power connector just like the Surface Pro 4. What this could mean is that Microsoft will have to rely on other display outputs such as DisplayPort to allow users to connect a secondary display to the 2-in-1. To be honest, a Thunderbolt 3 port via Type-C USB does sound like a much better option because its small size will also allow Microsoft to reduce the thickness of the upcoming Windows 10 tablet, making it even more portable that its predecessors. Related Microsoft’s Surface Lineup Beats Apple’s iPad in Latest J.D. Power Tablet Survey Sadly, the words of Paul Thurott mean that the only thing consumers can hope to see is Intel’s Kaby Lake series of processors coupled with possibly more RAM and internal flash if Microsoft is feeling generous. The only possible benefit of the Surface Pro 5 announcement after hearing about this rumor will be that the price of the Surface Pro 4 will drop considerably if the company does not decide to abandon support for it. Surface Pro 5 will not change the Surface Connect power connector, I was just told. Kaby Lake, nothing dramatic. Advertisement — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) April 6, 2017 It has also been reported before that the Surface Pro 5 is going to be announced during Spring, and that could also be the time when we get to see the Surface Book 2 in action. If the Surface Pro 5 does not feel like a great purchase to you, then you can always check out the prowess of the Surface Book 2 if you’re looking for a premium notebook that’s running Windows 10.

Creative Commons Zero In part one of this series, What Is Kubernetes?, and in part two, Why Choose Kubernetes to Manage Containerized Applications?, we learned what Kubernetes does, its architecture, and how it compares to similar container orchestrators. Now we'll learn how Kubernetes was descended from the secret Google Borg project. The Borg Heritage Kubernetes is distinguished from similar container orchestration systems, such as Apache Mesos and Google Swarm, by its Google heritage. Kubernetes was inspired by Borg, the very advanced internal datacenter management system used by Google for a decade. Nearly all of Google's services run in containers, both internal and external services such as Gmail, Google search, Google Maps, MapReduce, Google File System, and Google Compute Engine. Think of Borg as the giant brain that manages Google's datacenters as a single pool of resources to fuel Google's giant fleet of services, and manages them so efficiently it saves Google the cost of an entire datacenter. Google still owns Borg, and is building the next version, codenamed Omega, which is not nearly as cool a name as Borg. Kubernetes was founded as an open source project in 2014, and several of Borg's top contributors also work on Kubernetes. Google donated Kubernetes to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which is hosted at the Linux Foundation and supported by a number of big companies (including Google, Cisco, Docker, IBM, and Intel). The idea is to create a reference architecture for cloud technologies that anyone can use. Borg was a closely held secret until 2015, when Google published the Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg paper. This reveals a lot of fascinating details and bold claims such as "We are not sure where the ultimate scalability limit to Borg's centralized architecture will come from; so far, every time we have approached a limit, we've managed to eliminate it." fig-1.jpg Figure 1: How Borg has inspired current datacenter systems. Used with permission Kubernetes Lineage Figure 1 shows how Borg has inspired current datacenter systems, and the underlying technologies used in container runtimes today. Google contributed cgroups to the Linux kernel in 2007, which limits the resources used by collections of processes. cgroupsand Linux namespaces are at the heart of containers today, including Docker. Mesos was inspired by discussions with Google when Borg was still a secret. The Cloud Foundry Foundation embraces The Twelve-Factor Application principles. These principles provide guidance for building Web applications that scale easily, are deployed in the Cloud, and have automated build system. Borg and Kubernetes both address these principles. To sum up, the modern datacenter owes a lot to Google, and Kubernetes is built on over a decade of research and production use in one of the most demanding environments on Earth.

Great presentation and personality. Action that is both creative and accessible. Free with purchase of Oculus Touch controllers. Cons Repetitive level design. Replay value reliant on grinding for in-game rewards. Very brief single player experience. Bottom Line Well-executed action and native mod support shine in this great looking, if brief, shooter that is sometimes mired by repetition. By Alice D. Newcome-Beill Many Oculus Rift games allow you to point a gun and shoot stuff with a reasonable level of competency and effect. This is not a novel concept, so Robo Recall is reliant on other merits to set itself apart from its competition. The game's biggest draw, besides its fun and accessible robot-shooting action, is its built-in mod support, a feature that has been absent from native Oculus Rift titles. The native mod support, combined with the accessibility of the tools provided by Robo Recall's developer, Epic Games, make creating additional content not only easy, but encouraged, as well. The action-packed Robo Recall is available on the Oculus store for $29.99, but it's free for anyone who has purchased the Oculus Touch controllers. //Compare Similar Products Compare Mass Effect: Andromeda (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Superhot VR (for Oculus Rift)   %displayPrice%%seller% Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% For Honor (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Halo Wars 2 (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Disc Jam (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Double Dragon IV (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Dead Rising 4 (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Employee of the Month Robo Recall puts you in the shoes of an employee of the Robo Ready Corporation, a person tasked with recalling formerly obedient robotic servants that have recently revolted against their former masters. In this case, when you think robot uprising, don't think bleak future with mountains of skulls being crushed under the weight of our mechanical overlords. Robo Recall's mechanical adversaries have a personality best described as snarky, or shade throwing, rather than spiteful, titanium death machines from some post-nuclear dystopia. This witty and irreverent tone prevails throughout the game and lends some much needed personality to what would otherwise be another shooting gallery experience. Robo Recall's gameplay is divided into a series of levels that task you with tackling a variety of objectives. This includes capturing robots without destroying them, protecting an important piece of hardware, or simply wrecking as many enemies as you can within an allotted time. Each level can take anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes to complete, but with a total of only 9 levels, this makes for a very brief single-player experience. However, the levels are intended to be played multiple times to improve your score and complete in-game challenges as you aim to top the leaderboard. Batch Recall Robo Recall's combat encourages creativity, improvisation, and occasionally a little sadism, not unlike Superhot VR. The shooting feels good and works remarkably well, but your bare hands can be just as deadly. Shooting an enemy mid-air and throwing its lifeless shell into the face of a charging bot is a feeling that never gets old. You can also add insult to injury by tearing off an enemy's arm and beating them with it. A versatile teleportation mechanic, while sometimes a little disorienting, offers some of the most dynamic mobility in a VR shooter. These experiments in violence ultimately impact your final score, which reflects how creatively you dispatched your enemies and how efficiently you accomplished your objectives. How well you do ties into the progression system which unlocks new weapons and upgrades. While the game rarely surprises you with new mechanics, you may surprise yourself from time to time as you come up with increasingly interesting ways to dismantle enemies. Robo Recall's gameplay may come across as slightly derivative to anyone who has played a VR shooter, but the game's production values and personality set it apart from the crowd. This familiarity also has the added benefit of making the game remarkably accessible. Overall, the spontaneity and irreverence of the combat combined with dopamine-fueled combo chains evoke a style reminiscent of Hotline Miami, but without the punishing difficulty. In fact, it's difficult to recall a time when I felt legitimately challenged by Robo Recall. Once you have an understanding of your full range of abilities, the game has a difficult time stopping you. Still, this is exactly what made my fleeting experience with Robo recall so much fun. Performance Review Epic Games' first-hand experience in developing the Unreal Engine software framework really shines through in Robo Recall, resulting in one of the best looking titles available on the Oculus Platform—a game that runs at a smooth and steady 90 frames per second. I ran Robo Recall on the Razer Blade Pro gaming laptop, and rarely experienced any dropped frames, even while running the game at max settings. There are some flexible graphics options for lower end machines, but Oculus recommends at least an Intel i5 processor and a Nvidia GTX 970 GPU (or equivalent). Robo Recall hits another keynote for VR by being the first title with built-in mod support. While some VR titles are able to cooperate to some extent with user created content, Robo Recall makes creating and implementing mods remarkably easy with the Robo Recall Mod Kit that is made available on the Epic Games site. The Robo Recall Mod Kit is built around the Unreal Engine's Blueprints Visual Scripting System, which means that all of the tools developers used to make Robo Recall are made available to users. This gives anyone the freedom to make new content. This can range from simply tweaking the numerical values associated with different assets, to creating completely new levels with custom enemies and weapon models. The mods currently available do little to fundamentally change the core gameplay experience, but free content regularly produced by the Robo Recall community promises that the game will likely expand well beyond its original design. Ultimately, it will be interesting to see how Robo Recall's community-based content develops. The VR community's attention span has remained notoriously short, but perhaps a lack of community support is what was missing from the equation. Summary of Benefits None of these minor shortcomings detract from the veritable buffet of violence that Robo Recall serves up. Sure, other shooters have done what Robo Recall does, but rarely has it felt this good. The brevity of the Robo Recall experience does lend itself to becoming repetitive as you grind for unlocks. However, these small setbacks are handily countered by mod support that adds fresh, new wrinkles to gameplay that feels great and is immensely gratifying.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Justice and Public Safety Earthquake Warning System Extends to Washington Though the ShakeAlert system is not yet ready for public use, it could offer as much as two or three minutes’ warning to the Puget Sound region for a quake offshore. by Sandi Doughton, The Seattle Times / April 10, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- Dan Ervin knew this day would come. He just didn’t think it would be so soon. “I never thought I would actually see this in my career,” said Ervin, chairman of the board of a Bothell engineering firm that’s the first company in Washington to begin using earthquake early warning. The breakthrough came last week, when the prototype ShakeAlert system in California was fully extended to include Washington and Oregon. RELATEDMyShake Earthquake-Detection App Could Save LivesFracking Earthquakes Cause Headache in Oklahoma   That means all three states are now operating with the same technology, said Doug Given, project coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey. And while the system isn’t yet ready for public use, organizations like Ervin’s can start figuring out to what to do with a few seconds or minutes of warning before the ground starts shaking. For Ervin, whose company RH2 Engineering designs municipal water and sewage plants, the answer is clear: Close valves. When water mains break in earthquakes, the water in storage tanks can drain away at a time when it’s most needed, he explained. RH2, which designed water systems in Renton and Kirkland, already installs special tank valves that can be closed remotely and are designed to shut automatically when the ground shakes. “But there’s no guarantee you can get the valve fully closed before the shaking causes damage,” Ervin said. “The advantage of earthquake early warning is that it gives us forewarning that the shaking will occur, and we can be sure the valve is fully closed by the time the shaking starts.” The ShakeAlert system relies on a dense network of seismometers and the fact that the initial seismic waves from an earthquake travel quickly through the ground but don’t cause much damage. The first sensors to detect those waves can beam warnings to populated areas before the dangerous seismic waves arrive. For nearby earthquakes, the warning may be only seconds. But for a quake on the offshore Cascadia Subduction Zone, the Puget Sound region could get as much as two or three minutes’ warning. The technology is widely used in Japan, where people receive warnings on their cellphones and bullet trains are wired to come to a stop. “We’re talking about literally saving lives here,” said U.S. Rep. Derek Kilmer, whose district includes Tacoma and the Olympic Peninsula. A surgeon performing an operation could put down her scalpel, while a longshoreman hauling containers could get to a safe spot, said Kilmer, who along with other members of Washington’s congressional delegation has strongly advocated for ShakeAlert. But future funding is uncertain, with President Donald Trump’s proposed budget calling for a 15 percent cut for agencies like the USGS, Kilmer pointed out. “I hope that once we can make the case for how these investments will pay off, they will understand the importance of maintaining support for this important program,” he said.   The USGS hopes to roll out a limited, public version of ShakeAlert next year, Given said. But the agency estimates it will take $38 million more to add enough instruments for a highly reliable network. For example, several more sensors are needed around the Seattle Fault, said John Vidale, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. California recently allocated $10 million to strengthen its network. Oregon is spending $1 million for new instruments. Washington hasn’t earmarked any money for the project. Organizations in California, from school districts to amusement parks, have already been testing the alerts, Given said. NBC Universal is programming fire-station doors at its studio lots and theme park to open automatically. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab is exploring ways to quickly secure large telecommunications dishes. In the Northwest, Boeing, Intel and many public agencies are all trying to figure out how they might use the warnings, Given said. Since the project is still a prototype, companies that want to participate must sign “pilot user” agreements with the USGS. “We’re not quite ready to go full throttle with an operational mode,” Given said. “But we are pursuing these specific pilot applications to show the proof of concept and develop the technology.” One of the top concerns is the possibility of false alarms. That’s not an issue for the types of applications RH2 is interested in, Ervin said. A valve that’s needlessly closed can be quickly reopened with no harm done. As the regional pioneer, the company already is working on software and hardware to process the warning signals and automatically close valves. They’ve developed a virtual water system to practice with. The company also wants to shut down power to pump stations before a quake, to prevent electrical damage that could spark fires. “For the last 30 years, we have been anticipating that someday this technology would be available,” Ervin said. “This is pretty exciting for us.” ©2017 The Seattle Times Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

(AAPL), Facebook Inc (FB) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Options activity provides a look at expectations on AAPL, FB and BABA By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 10, 2017, 9:21 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Is Headed to the Teens After Earnings Can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(AAPL), Facebook Inc (FB) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Nvidia Stock Is Ready to Bounce (NVDA) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are trading slightly higher this morning, as geopolitical concerns weigh heavily on traders. Escalation in rhetoric from Russia and Iran followed on the heels of the U.S.’s airstrike in Syria last week, and oil prices are rising this morning as a result. Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will speak after the close of trading this afternoon, and will take part in a Q&A session at the University of Michigan. Against this volatile backdrop, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.04%, S&P 500 futures have gained 0.1% and Nasdaq-100 futures have gained 0.06% lower. On the options front, volume came in average heading into the weekend, as about 13.2 million calls and 12.9 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked higher to 0.67, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.61. Driving Friday’s options volume, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw mixed volume despite the leak of rumored specifications for the next-generation iMacs. Meanwhile, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is preparing a set of “call-to-action” features for news partners to promote signups, and Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE:BABA) was bolstered by bullish commentary from Raymond James. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Rumors about the specs for the latest Apple iMac hit the Street on Friday, but AAPL stock options traders showed little interest. The biggest shocker among the list provided from MacRumors was that Apple was moving away from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i7 chips and into Intel Xeon E3 chips — a move that analysts speculate will allow new iMac to take advantage of ECC (error correcting code) memory utilized by more professional and business model desktop PCs. It’s unusual for AAPL stock to not be moved by product rumors, and even more so for options traders to essentially “sigh.” Total volume on AAPL on Friday was respectable at 733,000 contracts, but puts and calls were split right down the middle, hinting at a rather inordinate indifference from this typically speculative crowd. Looking out to May options, we find more of the same, with the back-month’s put/call open interest ratio arriving at 1.03. In fact, AAPL may not see an uptick in options sentiment until the shares seriously put in a challenge to overhead resistance at $145.

AT&T revealed plans today to purchase Straight Path Communications, a company with an extensive background in millimeter wave spectrum licenses covering the entire US, not just its top 40 markets. According to AT&T, Straight Path's bandwidth portfolio, in addition to the wireless giant's acquisition of FiberTower earlier this year, will result in a 5G-capable infrastructure with up to 10 gigabits-per-second uploads and 20Gbps downloads. 5G for all AT&T isn't the only company making moves to bring 5G coverage to US customers. Verizon announced in February that it's testing its newly built 5G network with the help of partners like Samsung, Ericsson, Intel and others. Mobile device manufacturers are also all over 5G, with Qualcomm already planning Snapdragon modems capable of gigabit-level wireless service and ZTE showing off a 5G-ready, not-really-smartphone early in the game at MWC 2017. While AT&T's latest purchase is still under FCC review, which by the way has some thoughts of its own regarding 5G, consider us excited at the possibility of getting our hands on those high-speed upload times.

Then tread with caution, as it's easy to get carried away and find yourself spending in excess of £100 on a seemingly trivial component. Today's best liquid coolers demand sizeable premiums, as do top-end air solutions from the likes of Noctua, but such lavish cooling is overkill for most users, and it's easy to tame an overclocked chip on a much smaller budget. With cost effectiveness very much in mind, Cooler Master has introduced a new range of CPU coolers under the MasterAir umbrella. Designed to slot-in above the firm's popular range of mainstream Hyper coolers, MasterAir is initially available in a choice of three flavours; triple-heatpipe Pro 3; quad-heatpipe Pro 4; and range-topping octo-heatpipe Maker 8. Prices start at £30 for the Pro 3, but it's the larger MasterAir Pro 4, at £40, that is under the microscope today. First impressions are favourable, as pricing is acceptable, packaging is adequate, build quality is sturdy and the entire unit is backed by a generous five-year warranty as standard. There is no shortage of options in this mid-range segment, yet Cooler Master's offering puts forth a good mix of features and performance. Adopting a classic tower form factor, MasterAir Pro 4 measures 159mm (H) x 129mm (L) x 85mm (W) and the heatsink itself tips the scales at 472g. A single 120mm, four-pin Air Balance PWM fan is included as part of the bundle, along with easy-to-assemble fan brackets and anti-vibration mounting pads. Four heatpipes navigate through the aluminium fins, and Cooler Master reckons its Continuous Direct Contact (CDC) 2.0 technology - through which heatpipes are compressed together - provides a 45 per cent increase in surface area for heat dissipation. All sounds well and good, but from a purely aesthetic point of view it's a shame the heatpipes haven't been nickel-plated for a streamlined look. Silver protruding tips would, we feel, be a better match for the black finish on the top of the heatsink. Still, it's a heatsink tower and most users will be more interested in the way it works rather than how trendy it looks. If that sounds like you, you'll be pleased to hear that there are no gaudy LEDs to contend with, and installation is straight forward on any modern socket. The only caveat is AMD AM4, which requires an optional upgrade kit - Cooler Master is providing these free of charge, though you may need to pay for postage costs depending on region. Installation is simple enough on our Intel Z170 platform, and there are actually two different ways of mounting the cooler. Option one is to use quick and convenient push-pin attachments similar to a stock Intel cooler, but option two - a dedicated securing bracket - is described by Cooler Master as 'sturdier' and will be the preferred option for most. We opted for the latter and the installation process entails securing a metal backplate to the rear of the motherboard using standoffs and bolts, and then securing the heatsink with an x-bracket outfitted with spring-loaded screws. Getting up and running shouldn't take longer than 10 minutes, and we like the fact that Cooler Master has put some thought and consideration into the bundle. The small tube of thermal paste is good for at least a few installations, and there's a spare set of fan mounts, making it easy to add another blower in a push-pull configuration. There's no y-splitter cable to cater for such scenarios, yet for £40 the MasterAir Pro 4 has the makings of a capable mid-range solution. Let's see if the benchmarks agree.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 10, 2017 12:51 PM PT Credit: AMD More like this Android's next destination: Untethered VR headsets with the Snapdragon 835 Virtual reality, one year out: What went right, what didn't Microsoft's first tethered Windows 10 VR headsets to ship in March Video Hardcore Hardware: Asus' new Four Dot One PC gives you 4K gaming in your pocket In AMD's world, a virtual reality headset that wires you to a PC isn't fun. So the chip company has acquired Nitero, which provides technology for VR headsets to be wirelessly connected to PCs or mobile devices. Nitero's technology will help device makers build VR headsets that wirelessly connect to devices in the multi-gigabit throughput range, according to AMD. [ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ] With the technology, users will be able to take advantage of powerful graphics processors on PCs. At the same time, users will be able to move freely. Wireless headsets are widely considered to be the future of VR. Wired headsets like the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive provide great graphics but limit movement. Some wireless all-in-one VR headsets like Microsoft's HoloLens are available, but they have limited battery life and graphics capabilities. A headset called Sulon Q with AMD's FX-8800P and eight integrated Radeon R7 graphics cores was shown at last year's CES but hasn't shipped yet. Nitero's intellectual property will be used to allow other vendors to build wireless headsets, Drew Prairie, an AMD spokesman, said in an email.  AMD won't build its own head-mounted displays but will serve as a one-stop shop for other vendors developing virtual reality products because it has the CPU, GPU, and now Nitero's high-bandwidth wireless technology, Prairie said. Nitero in the past has introduced products based on WiGig, a high-speed wireless communications technology that can transfer data at multi-gigabit speeds. Intel's wire-free PC plans are also based on WiGig, which can wirelessly connect external displays and external hard drives to PCs. Nitero holds many patents that are based on establishing stable wireless connections using WiGig technology. To implement Nitero technology, chipsets would be required in both the device running VR applications and the wirelessly connected headsets. By tying VR headsets to PCs wirelessly, AMD could sell more PC chips and graphics cards. However, it's not yet known how the company will implement Nitero's technology. AMD declined to comment on how much it paid for Nitero. But the acquisition plays into AMD's aggressive pursuit of VR.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Tesla's new China backer: A tech giant with hundreds of millions of users by Sherisse Pham   @Sherisse March 29, 2017: 7:16 AM ET Elon Musk in 90 Seconds Elon Musk has a new friend in China. Tech and gaming giant Tencent (TCEHY) just ponied up $1.8 billion for a 5% stake in Tesla (TSLA). Led by its media shy CEO, "Pony" Ma Huateng, Tencent is huge. It has a market value of more than $275 billion, eclipsing that of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Tech30). Tencent owns messaging app WeChat, which boasts 889 million active users and is used for texting, paying bills, gaming and even booking karaoke sessions. Tencent is also China's largest video game developer and publisher, holding a big piece of the global market. It acquired Finnish company Supercell last year, the maker of popular mobile games Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. Tencent's online game revenues topped $10 billion in 2016. Related: Tesla looks to raise $1.15 billion as it preps for Model 3 So what's a company known for games and messaging apps doing investing in a popular electric vehicle start up? Tech companies always want to get in on the next big thing. Right now, that means artificial intelligence and the so-called internet of things, which will play huge roles in the development of driverless and connected cars. "The gaming industry is really advanced in terms of artificial intelligence," said Kitty Fok, a Beijing-based analyst with research firm IDC. "Having Tencent invest in Tesla can help it integrate artificial intelligence and behavior," she said. Testing Tesla's handsfree driving Connected cars will be the next big innovation in the auto industry, said Ka Leong Lo, an auto analyst at Maybank. In the near future, "there will be many connections between vehicles, infrastructure and people," Lo said. "This is why Tencent is interested in Tesla." Related: Intel buys Israeli self-driving car firm for $15 billion The Chinese tech giant is also seeking a bigger global presence. "There are a lot more people in the United States who know Alibaba," said Fok. Tencent's investment in Tesla "is good for their global brand." This isn't Tencent's first bet on a big U.S. tech name. It quietly invested in Snapchat (SNAP) years ago, according to TechCrunch. Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel has even praised Tencent as a role model. Tencent didn't say much about the thinking behind its Tesla investment. "We share Tesla's vision in creating a better future for the planet," tweeted Tencent President Martin Lau, saying the Chinese company was "looking forward to working together as a supportive shareholder."

The Good Fast, highly configurable and relatively easy to upgrade, the Origin PC Omni offers a 34-inch curved display for less than it would cost to buy a decent external model. The Bad Prone to overheating when you drive it hard, and the display -- typical of its class of panel -- isn't terrific enough that you won't mind being stuck with it for years. The Bottom Line Origin PC's Omni custom build gaming all-in-one is a great idea that feels a little ahead of its time; it's fast, upgradable and fits a ton of components, but the chassis needs a better layout. 8.1 Overall Design 7.0 Features 8.0 Performance 9.0 Review Sections Review Prices User Reviews CNET Computers Desktops Origin PC Omni There's no denying that Origin PC's Omni custom-build all-in-one is fast, or that with its 34-inch curved display it delivers a great gaming experience. It's expensive, but doesn't seem overpriced when compared to similarly equipped systems. And because it's almost fully upgradable, at least given the present state of components, it's not a bad investment. And I can see some advantages. For instance, if you want the power of a high-end gaming system but a bit more elegant look than you typically find from a market segment with a design aesthetic that tends more towards letting it all hang out than hiding it away. (I kind of want it to have a transparent back, though.) But you can't really consider it a space saver thanks to that 34-inch display, unless you plan to hang it on the wall. Yes, you can. So... why? A warm reception Origin PC takes Loop International's LP-3400 AIO chassis and stuffs it to the gills with components you won't find in most all-in-ones. And it's not alone: Velocity Micro will do it for you as well. Here's the thing: When you cram high-end hardware behind a big display and then max out the processors with complex calculations and memory access (that 3,440x1,440 display requires a lot of pixel pushing), you're going to generate a lot of heat in a small space. There's a reason why most all-in-ones tend use notebook parts. This was not our first rodeo with the Omni. We had a previous system that would simply die in No Man's Sky. The first time it happened with our second unit was while attempting to take out terrorists in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. Run, jump, fire, die. And not in a I-should-have-used-a-grenade way. I admit, I crank up the quality settings, at least occasionally, to see how it looks. I dial them back for testing actual play. I'm not positive heat caused the issues on both of our test systems with the settings at max, but at times the fans in it spin up like jet engines and hot air shoots out of the bottom and the back. Death or reboot would occur during this spin fest. As it is, the system uses liquid cooling and has a reservoir you have to refill every 6 to 12 months -- I think it would require liquid nitrogen for some configurations. After some trial and error, I was able to max out all the quality settings for the Nvidia Titan X with vertical sync set to "on" in the Nvidia control panel; that, of course caps the frame rate at the display's 60Hz refresh, but at some higher frame rates -- especially around 90fps -- there was some tearing and a lot of not-explosion-related judder in the Metro Last Light benchmark test I was using to diagnose the issues. It looked a lot smoother at roughly 60fps, and the system didn't even break a sweat or spin a fan. There's probably a setting that offers a better compromise. The folks at Origin PC will work tirelessly with you to get a system running smoothly, but I'm not sure that the desire to constantly tinker is in the DNA of someone who wants an AIO. Origin PC Omni Price as reviewed $4,130 Display size/resolution 34-inch 3,440 x 1,440 display PC CPU 4.2GHz Intel Core i7-7700K PC Memory 16GB DDR4 SDRAM Graphics 12GB Nvidia GeForce Titan X Storage 500GB SSD + 2TB HDD Networking 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 4.0 Operating system Windows 10 Home (64-bit) Our $4,130 test configuration is relatively midrange given the available options. The MSI Intel Z270-chipset-based motherboard in ours takes quad-core seventh-generation Intel Core processors, but for about $500 more you can get it with an Intel X99-based motherboard and 8- or 10-core processors. The most powerful configuration I specced out came to almost $8,000, sans accessories. (And might possibly melt the chassis.) I won't go into all the options -- play "how much can I spend" for yourself. You can also play it in Australia, but the company doesn't have a UK-specific site. It's a TARDIS and a mullet I'm tempted to call this the TARDIS of all-in-one chassis. It fits as much gear as a standard desktop (though only a single graphics card): a full-size current-generation Nvidia or AMD card, up to 32GB of memory, two drives of either the spinning or solid-state variety, and a sound card. It's all laid out neatly and easy to get to for swapping hardware. To get inside, you have to unscrew about 9 or 10 screws and the back snaps off. In this respect, it's pretty nice.

He just didn’t think it would be so soon. “I never thought I would actually see this in my career,” said Ervin, chairman of the board of a Bothell engineering firm that’s the first company in Washington to begin using earthquake early warning. The breakthrough came last week, when the prototype ShakeAlert system in California was fully extended to include Washington and Oregon. That means all three states are now operating with the same technology, said Doug Given, project coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey. And while the system isn’t yet ready for public use, organizations like Ervin’s can start figuring out to what to do with a few seconds or minutes of warning before the ground starts shaking. For Ervin, whose company RH2 Engineering designs municipal water and sewage plants, the answer is clear: Close valves. When water mains break in earthquakes, the water in storage tanks can drain away at a time when it’s most needed, he explained. RH2, which designed water systems in Renton and Kirkland, already installs special tank valves that can be closed remotely and are designed to shut automatically when the ground shakes. “But there’s no guarantee you can get the valve fully closed before the shaking causes damage,” Ervin said. “The advantage of earthquake early warning is that it gives us forewarning that the shaking will occur, and we can be sure the valve is fully closed by the time the shaking starts.” The ShakeAlert system relies on a dense network of seismometers and the fact that the initial seismic waves from an earthquake travel quickly through the ground but don’t cause much damage. The first sensors to detect those waves can beam warnings to populated areas before the dangerous seismic waves arrive. For nearby earthquakes, the warning may be only seconds. But for a quake on the offshore Cascadia Subduction Zone, the Puget Sound region could get as much as two or three minutes’ warning. The technology is widely used in Japan, where people receive warnings on their cellphones and bullet trains are wired to come to a stop. “We’re talking about literally saving lives here,” said U.S. Rep. Derek Kilmer, whose district includes Tacoma and the Olympic Peninsula. A surgeon performing an operation could put down her scalpel, while a longshoreman hauling containers could get to a safe spot, said Kilmer, who along with other members of Washington’s congressional delegation has strongly advocated for ShakeAlert. But future funding is uncertain, with President Donald Trump’s proposed budget calling for a 15 percent cut for agencies like the USGS, Kilmer pointed out. “I hope that once we can make the case for how these investments will pay off, they will understand the importance of maintaining support for this important program,” he said. The USGS hopes to roll out a limited, public version of ShakeAlert next year, Given said. But the agency estimates it will take $38 million more to add enough instruments for a highly reliable network. For example, several more sensors are needed around the Seattle Fault, said John Vidale, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. California recently allocated $10 million to strengthen its network. Oregon is spending $1 million for new instruments. Washington hasn’t earmarked any money for the project. Organizations in California, from school districts to amusement parks, have already been testing the alerts, Given said. NBC Universal is programming fire-station doors at its studio lots and theme park to open automatically. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab is exploring ways to quickly secure large telecommunications dishes. In the Northwest, Boeing, Intel and many public agencies are all trying to figure out how they might use the warnings, Given said. Since the project is still a prototype, companies that want to participate must sign “pilot user” agreements with the USGS. “We’re not quite ready to go full throttle with an operational mode,” Given said. “But we are pursuing these specific pilot applications to show the proof of concept and develop the technology.” One of the top concerns is the possibility of false alarms. That’s not an issue for the types of applications RH2 is interested in, Ervin said. A valve that’s needlessly closed can be quickly reopened with no harm done. As the regional pioneer, the company already is working on software and hardware to process the warning signals and automatically close valves. They’ve developed a virtual water system to practice with. The company also wants to shut down power to pump stations before a quake, to prevent electrical damage that could spark fires. “For the last 30 years, we have been anticipating that someday this technology would be available,” Ervin said. “This is pretty exciting for us.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump.However, bank stocks have retreated of late as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.56 percent, dragged down by Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. "The financial sector has been a darling performer since the election and we've seen some of that performance retreat in the last couple of weeks," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis."So, what the banks report and what their guidance is will be the primary driver for equity prices over the next week or two." Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Geopolitical tensions added to investor unease. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger.At 12:12 p.m. ET (1612 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 33.22 points, or 0.16 percent, at 20,622.88, the S&P 500 was down 2.98 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,352.56. The Nasdaq Composite was down 7.95 points, or 0.14 percent, at 5,869.86. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with energy leading with a 0.94 percent gain, supported by higher oil prices. [O/R]Technology was off 0.13 percent, led by declines in Intel and Nvidia. Shares of Amazon.com was the top stock on the S&P and the Nasdaq, rising 1.2 percent to $905.92. The world's largest online retailer was upgraded to "buy" at Needham, according to a trader. Straight Path Communications surged nearly two-fold to $89.71 after AT&T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. Swift Transportation jumped 21.7 percent to $24.36 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 12 percent.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,665 to 1,141. On the Nasdaq, 1,433 issues fell and 1,281 advanced.The S&P 500 index showed seven 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 55 highs and 25 lows.

Prof. B S Satyanarayana, Vice Chancellor, BMU said all these students are from the above 90 percent marks category and it showcases how good students prefer universities that offer more than just the prescribed curriculum. The 30 month old university has creaed a niche for itself with hands-on learning component in its engineering programs. Prof. Satyanarayana said collaborations with renowned universities such as Imperial College London (which is BMU’s academic mentor), Singapore Management University, Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland (USA), and corporates such as Axis Bank, Intel, IBM, KPMG, Siemens and Shell have allowed students to get a perspective on global trends in education and the contemporary professional world. The University has reiterated its focus on cross - disciplinary learning, R&D, and innovation, along with specialised courses in Engineering, Data Analytics and Forensic Accounting. A dedicated counselling centre takes care of students’ pressures and tries to ease them with professional counsellors, and help them cope with living away from home, often for the very first time. The engineering course fee per year is Rs 2 lakhs plus the hostel fee that varies from Rs. 75,000 to Rs. 1.25 lakhs per year.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks ended a choppy session slightly higher on Monday as gains in energy shares offset losses in financials ahead of quarterly corporate earnings later this week. Geopolitical tensions added to the choppiness. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. With trading slow at the beginning of a holiday-shortened week, volume was the lightest of the year so far. The S&P energy index , up 0.8 percent, was the day's best-performing S&P 500 sector, following gains in oil prices. Investors prepared for the start of quarterly profit reports, with earnings of S&P 500 companies estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Energy companies, hit by a selloff in oil prices last year, are expected to show the greatest strength with a 600 percent year-over-year earnings increase. "The key will be oil stocks given how volatile oil has been since the election," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has about US$50 million in assets under management. The energy index is down 6 percent for the year to date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.92 points, or 0.01 percent, to 20,658.02, the S&P 500 gained 1.62 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,357.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.11 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,880.93. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Just 5.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday. The daily average for the past 20 trading days is 6.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. JPMorgan , Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. Bank stocks have retreated recently as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.3 percent. Traders attributed a stock dip around noon to unverified rumors stemming from weekend news related to North Korea. "You've had a lot of geopolitical news that could have driven this market a lot lower, and I think it's a huge relief that the market has held up so well," Dollarhide said. Whole Foods Market was the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer on the day, rising 10 percent after activist investor Jana Partners LLC disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in the company as it looks to shake up the company's board. Swift Transportation jumped 23.7 percent to US$24.77 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation . Knight's shares were up 13.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 68 new highs and 38 new lows.

We'll see. Andrew Cunningham - Apr 10, 2017 5:00 pm UTC Enlarge / Apple's Phil Schiller takes the wraps off the new Mac Pro at WWDC in 2013. Apple reader comments 189 Share this story Last week, Apple did something it never does—it spoke to journalists and pundits on the record about a product that was so far from being released that the company didn't even have prototypes to show off. Further ReadingExplaining the battery life problems with the new MacBook Pros That's the state of the Mac desktop right now. After the October 2016 product came and went with no mention of the rumored desktops, complaints and anxiety about the state of Apple’s high-end computers reached a fever pitch (my barometer for this sort of thing is what John Siracusa, Marco Arment, and a handful of developers I follow say on their podcasts and Twitter feeds, which is highly unscientific, but I don't think that makes it inaccurate). Apple appeared to be pulling out of the external display business, and its new pro laptops offered less RAM and had worse battery life than some people were happy with. It had been a year since the iMac got an update, two years since the Mac Mini was updated, and more than three years since we heard a single peep about the Mac Pro. In an internal memo a couple of months later, CEO Tim Cook said the company had “great desktops in his roadmap,” but that’s the stock boilerplate response to any questions about future products. Credible reports around the same time that suggested Apple had de-emphasized and slowed down Mac development internally only added fuel to the fire. So, the unusual amount of uncertainty about desktops prompted an unusual response: a sit-down conversation about products that won’t be announced or released until later this year or next (or possibly even later than that). Apple declined to get very specific about its plans, but let’s sift through some tea leaves and suss out some possible directions that Apple’s desktops could take from here. The Mac Pro, and admitting your mistakes Enlarge / The "thermal core" concept the 2013 Mac Pro was designed around ended up being insufficiently flexible for future upgrades. Apple When Phil “can’t-innovate-my-ass” Schiller unveiled that new Mac Pro in mid-2013, surely the plan was not to let it sit and rot for three years before pledging to replace it with something completely different. At the time, Schiller said that Apple had wanted to build a new Mac Pro design that would last for "another ten years." But that’s not what happened, and Apple is willing to admit that it was because of engineering problems based on a poor prediction of where high-end computing was headed. From Craig Federighi: “I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will. We designed a system that we thought with the kind of GPUs that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we could well serve with a two GPU architecture… that that was the thermal limit we needed, or the thermal capacity we needed. But workloads didn’t materialize to fit that as broadly as we hoped. Being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate. So it became fairly difficult to adjust.” Specifically, the way the 2013 Pro was designed, each of the three boards on the inside (one with a CPU, two with dedicated GPUs) were meant to have roughly similar heat output and cooling needs. If you were to throw that balance off—by adding, say, a single more powerful GPU instead of two midrange ones—the fan wouldn’t be able to cool it off well enough. Further ReadingApple is completely redesigning the Mac Pro… again The design assumed that GPU compute via APIs like OpenCL and Metal would be transformative, and it even defined APIs within macOS to make it possible to dedicate a single GPU solely to either OpenCL or OpenGL. Certainly, there are workloads for which that sort of thing is useful, but GPUs haven’t removed the need for fast multi-core CPUs. This is especially true of software developers, an audience Apple says is rapidly growing. The 2013 Mac Pro was a one-size-fits-all mini computer that replaced a hulking but enormously flexible PC tower. The older Mac Pro towers could accept multiple high-end GPUs, they had two CPU sockets, they had a bunch of internal drive bays, they had internal PCI Express expansion slots. Thunderbolt can replace some of that with external drive caddies and other accessories, but it can’t let you fundamentally alter the system’s performance the way more CPU and GPU horsepower can (and Thunderbolt accessories are habitually rarer and more expensive than their standardized internal counterparts). Apple acknowledges all of this. Read a transcript of the interview, and it’s clear that the company understands the key shortcomings of the trashcan Mac Pro design. Pros have many, many different needs. Pros need regular, consistent updates. Pros need modularity and flexibility and expandability. Imagining what a new Mac Pro looks like The new Mac Pro is one-eighth the volume of the old one, but it comes at a high price for pros. Apple Check out the inside of this thing: four 3.5-inch drive bays, room for two CPUs and eight sticks of RAM, and lots of expansion slots. There's... not much space inside the 2013 Pro. Surely we can find a happy medium. iFixit We won’t see this new Mac Pro until at least next year, and computing still moves quickly enough that it’s hard to predict exactly what Apple is going to settle on. But looking at what Apple acknowledged about the old Mac Pro design alongside its goals for the new one allows you to make some educated guesses. Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that Apple is still going to want to build something relatively small and unobtrusive, because this is Apple we’re talking about. There’s a whole bunch of space in the old cheese grater-style Mac Pro that could be saved if you were trying to modernize it: start by removing the 5.25-inch optical drive bays and also the internal 3.5-inch drive bays, both of which can easily be replaced by external USB or Thunderbolt or network-attached accessories. The small SSD cards that Apple already uses in the 2013 Mac Pros also save you from needing any internal storage bays; just make a little room on the motherboard (some PC motherboards even tuck the M.2 SSD slot away on the back of the board to save space on the front). Further ReadingIntel’s new Broadwell Xeon server CPUs offer up to 22 cores per socket On the same note, I’d also bet against Apple including multiple processor sockets. This is both because of the amount of extra cooling and board space these configurations need (another socket plus four more RAM slots), and because technological advancements have made this less necessary than it was in the old days. The old dual-socket Mac Pros maxed out at 12 cores, or two CPUs with six cores apiece. By the time the 2013 Mac Pro had come out, Intel offered a single-socket CPU with 12 cores. Now Intel offers as many as 22 cores in a single CPU within a similar TDP; next-generation Xeons are said to be bumping that up to 28 or even 32. Those processors cost many pretty pennies, but the Mac Pro is hardly the most frugal of desktop computers. The same thing is true of RAM slots, more or less. If you were using two processors, the old Mac Pro could handle up to 128GB using third-party RAM modules; the 2013 Mac Pro can do the same with four slots, and any new Mac Pro would likely be able to do at least that well depending on what CPU support and memory density looks like when it’s released. GPUs are perhaps the biggest wildcard. Based on all of Apple’s talk about its dual-GPU system being the wrong move, I’d say the new Mac Pro will have the space and the cooling to accommodate at least one top-end 250W GPU. The question is whether Apple would use a proprietary card design like it does in the 2013 Mac Pro, or if it would return to using standard PCI Express cards. The former is more flexible but the latter requires less development work on Apple’s part, which I’d say is a plus if I was trying to keep a high-end computer up to date to satisfy a fraction of a fraction of my userbase. On the Accidental Tech Podcast, John Siracusa suggests that Apple could use standard PCI Express cards with custom cooling apparatuses installed, which seems like a good compromise. Even if it does use standard GPUs, I wouldn’t hold my breath for much more internal expandability. Adding things like NICs and storage capacity is a place where Thunderbolt excels, and I’d guess that Thunderbolt 3’s wider adoption in the rest of the PC industry will lead to a more diverse, competitive accessory ecosystem. Adding, say, 10 gigabit Ethernet to a 2013 Mac Pro via Thunderbolt costs a few hundred bucks, while adding it via PCI Express can be done for less than half that price. If you can close that gap, lack of internal expandability for peripherals won’t be such a huge deal. Put all of this stuff—one CPU socket that can scale from 4 to over 20 cores, four RAM slots, a top-end GPU, a fast SSD card, and plenty of Thunderbolt 3 ports for additional expansion—inside a relatively small, sleek case, and then make it pretty easy for users to open up and work on themselves, and you’ve got a Mac Pro that should serve a wider base of users than the 2013 model while still keeping people who liked that model’s size and unobtrusiveness reasonably happy. Apple could choose to go another way—it could definitely choose to make a larger, more expandable system than I’m assuming here—and none of my calculus takes bleeding-edge technology like DDR5 or Intel’s Optane into account. But if the old Mac Pro was designed to be as flexible as possible and the 2013 Mac Pro was engineered in part to make a statement about innovation at Apple, a computer like this could find a way to do both.

JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. However, bank stocks have retreated of late as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.56 percent, dragged down by Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. "The financial sector has been a darling performer since the election and we've seen some of that performance retreat in the last couple of weeks," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "So, what the banks report and what their guidance is will be the primary driver for equity prices over the next week or two." Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Geopolitical tensions added to investor unease. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. At 12:12 p.m. ET (1612 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 33.22 points, or 0.16 percent, at 20,622.88, the S&P 500 was down 2.98 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,352.56. The Nasdaq Composite was down 7.95 points, or 0.14 percent, at 5,869.86. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with energy leading with a 0.94 percent gain, supported by higher oil prices. Technology was off 0.13 percent, led by declines in Intel and Nvidia. Shares of Amazon.com was the top stock on the S&P and the Nasdaq, rising 1.2 percent to $905.92. The world's largest online retailer was upgraded to "buy" at Needham, according to a trader. Straight Path Communications surged nearly two-fold to $89.71 after AT&T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. Swift Transportation jumped 21.7 percent to $24.36 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 12 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,665 to 1,141. On the Nasdaq, 1,433 issues fell and 1,281 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed seven 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 55 highs and 25 lows.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kulbhushan Jadhav Malcolm Turnbull Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Arvind Kejriwal Home Money US STOCKS-Wall St in the red as banks slip ahead of earnings Shares1 Mon, 10 Apr 2017-10:16pm , Reuters U.S. stocks reversed course to trade lower on Monday as losses in financial stocks, ahead of quarterly earnings later this week, offset a boost from energy shares. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. However, bank stocks have retreated of late as investors question lofty valuations and Trump's ability to swiftly introduce simpler regulations and other policies following the failure of a healthcare reform bill. The S&P 500 financial sector was off 0.56 percent, dragged down by Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. "The financial sector has been a darling performer since the election and we've seen some of that performance retreat in the last couple of weeks," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "So, what the banks report and what their guidance is will be the primary driver for equity prices over the next week or two." Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Geopolitical tensions added to investor unease. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons were a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that "a response is likely" if they pose a danger. At 12:12 p.m. ET (1612 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 33.22 points, or 0.16 percent, at 20,622.88, the S&P 500 was down 2.98 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,352.56. The Nasdaq Composite was down 7.95 points, or 0.14 percent, at 5,869.86. Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Four of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with energy leading with a 0.94 percent gain, supported by higher oil prices. Technology was off 0.13 percent, led by declines in Intel and Nvidia. Shares of Amazon.com was the top stock on the S&P and the Nasdaq, rising 1.2 percent to $905.92. The world's largest online retailer was upgraded to "buy" at Needham, according to a trader. Straight Path Communications surged nearly two-fold to $89.71 after AT&T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. Swift Transportation jumped 21.7 percent to $24.36 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation. Knight's shares were up 12 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,665 to 1,141. On the Nasdaq, 1,433 issues fell and 1,281 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed seven 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 55 highs and 25 lows.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Editorials Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Editorials Tue, Apr 11, 2017 - Page 9　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Your car may soon be able to read your expressions The applications of such technology is numerous, from choosing soothing music to calm an irate driver to customization for valets or passengers. However, not everyone is excited about the direction of car tech By John Quain  /  NY Times News Service Illustration: Yusha When you shop for cat food online, Amazon knows who you are. When you look for the best airfares for summer vacation, Google knows who you are. Soon, when you get behind the wheel, your car might recognize you, too. Using cameras with facial recognition software and other biometric indicators, automakers are looking to personalize the driving experience with cars that stare back at you, quietly adjusting seats and driving modes. They might even anticipate your wants and desires by playing your favorite music based on your mood. However, it is not only about convenience, but also about the possibility of improving safety and security. “It’s not just about personalization,” Continental Automotive Group systems and technology engineer Zachary Bolton said, explaining the sophistication of such systems. “We can use the gleam, the twinkle in your eye to determine precisely where you’re looking.” Engineers can then dynamically adjust the so-called “human machine interface,” putting critical information about a stalled car ahead, or the fact that you are about to exceed the speed limit, directly in a driver’s line of sight on the dashboard or in a display on the windshield. Conversely, by tracking downward eye movements, the car could “see” that a driver was distracted and sound a warning. Continental has already demonstrated in-car systems that allow drivers to register their faces using something as simple as a driver’s license picture. An interior infrared camera is used to overcome potential obstacles like sunglasses, which would stymie a conventional video camera. Putting the camera in the center instrument cluster also helps to pinpoint the driver’s eyes, even if they are wearing a hat. The biggest technical challenge — glare caused by sunlight — can be filtered out using machine learning, Bolton said. Once the car knows who you are, systems in vehicles like the Chrysler Portal concept car would automatically adjust the seat for maximum comfort, select a driving mode (for example, one driver likes to let the car do most of the work; another likes taking control in sport mode) and suggest a destination based on the owner’s past behavior. Watching a driver’s face could also give a car important clues about that person’s state of mind. For several years, automakers like Ford and tech companies like Intel have been interested in determining whether a driver is happy or sad. Depending on your mood, a car could change its tune, playing a bouncy Beach Boys song and changing the interior lighting to improve your attitude. For example, Honda’s NeuV concept car has a large customizable LCD dashboard and a cloud-connected, onboard computer that uses artificial intelligence to interact with drivers. NeuV employs what the company coyly refers to as an “emotion engine” to grease the wheels of the conversation, and its automated personal assistant can read “facial skin vibrations” to help it isolate the driver’s voice and better understand spoken commands. There are practical reasons as well, designers say, for detecting a driver’s emotional state: A calm driver is a safer driver. So cars that recognize when a driver is becoming angry and thus prone to road rage could potentially quell annoying bells and chimes in the car and play some soothing mellow jazz. By replacing keys and remote-control fobs, biometrics like facial recognition could also make cars more difficult to steal. 1 2 3 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1315 times.

Smart Home by Jennifer Bisset April 10, 2017 9:00 AM PDT "Jarvis, remind me to develop a personality for you later." Jarvis is the quintessential artificial intelligence of film ("Iron Man", "The Avengers"), and now Mark Zuckerberg has used his Stark-like fortunes to build his own. So is film invading your smart home or is it vice versa? Voice assistants, learning thermostats, smart security, connected light bulbs -- it sounds like a dream, but judging by the clever ideas dominating CES, our film fantasies could soon enter the mainstream. We've moved beyond the tacky smart home horror films of the past (a smart home impregnates a woman in "Demon Seed", and of course it's from the '70s). But given how technologically prescient film has been (looking at you "Minority Report"), these penetrating ideas (pun absolutely intended) make disturbing viewing. The hackable homes of 'Mr. Robot' New technology brings new threats: even tech titans like Zuckerberg put tape over their laptop webcams. In a world where cars can be hacked, what does this mean for the smart home? If "Mr. Robot" is anything to go by, there's reason to be wary. The techno-thriller follows hacker group fsociety, who acquires a new base of operations by forcing Susan Jacobs, part of fsociety's nemesis E Corp, to vacate her smart home. That's right, fsociety hacks a house. Spoiler: This is what happens to Susan Jacobs. USA Network Alarms activate, lights flash, the shower water scalds, the house thermostat chills. "Grand Designs" take heed for a tech home special. By the end of her ordeal, Jacobs, tightly wrapped in a winter coat, yells at phone tech support to sort out her "smart house package". Should we prepare for our own smart house wreck-oning? Yes, according to a recent study by Japanese researchers. The lab at Yokohama National University found that 1.3 million internet-connected devices around the world, from personal video recorders to security cameras, are under the control of cybercriminals. IoT devices (connected devices that talk to each other, known collectively as the Internet of Things) are gateways to hackers -- your toasters and fridges included. Fortunately, companies looking at security measures have found ways to protect you and your (internet of) things. Butterfleye, known for smart home security cameras, make devices that don't rely on your home network. Instead, they use two forms of encryption and information stored in the cloud, not the device. Mesh Wi-Fi companies such as Amped Wireless (who make the Ally Plus Whole Home Smart Wi-Fi System) protect your home network from malware and phishing scams by monitoring it constantly, in real time. The perfect AI of 'Her' She composes music, organises emails and falls in love. She's not Alexa, the Amazon Echo's voice assistant, but maybe she's what Alexa could become. Her name's Samantha and she's the utterly charming and powerful AI that organises Theodore Twombly's life in "Her". While Alexa is stationary, Samantha will always be there for you. She talks to you from an earpiece and is primed to work with the smart listening earbuds of today that deliver noise-cancelling and Bluetooth music streaming. Sony has just announced its "Open-Style Concept", which integrates a hands-free personal assistant, using bone conduction to transmit sound to your ears. There's also Motorola's VerveOnes+, which support Siri and Google Now. Utterly charming. Warner Bros. Sadly, present voice assistants can't philosophise about existence, or help you with your relationships or seamlessly hold a conversation. But if we're lucky (and very smart), they could be well on their way. AI is one of the hottest areas of computing. Google's AlphaGo can beat you in Go, one of the world's most complicated strategy games; Intel recently announced its commitment to future AI products like its Nervana Engine chip; and Samsung has launched "Bixby", its own AI assistant, with the new Galaxy S8 phone. If we do have Samantha organising our lives one day, a warning (and a spoiler): At the end of the film, Samantha abandons Theodore for a "life" on a higher plane with other AIs. The smart home of 'Black Mirror' that knows you too well Now this probably won't come true. Probably. The smart home in "Black Mirror" episode "White Christmas" is controlled by an AI whose name fits right in with Alexa's squad. Cookie knows exactly how to make her homeowner Greta's house perfect. Exactly. To the point of browning Greta's toast to her favoured slightly undercooked hue. That's because Cookie is a digital copy of Greta's consciousness. A special tech doctor implants a "cookie" in Greta's brain so it can learn to mimic her personality. He then surgically removes the chip and uploads the information into a portable electronic device. Embroiled in a hard situation. Channel 4 This device looks like an egg -- it looks like the Amazon Echo or the Google Home. But don't peek inside, because it's disturbing (although if you watch this show, you're probably into that). We see a miniature copy of Greta in a simulation of a white control room, much like Star Trek. Through torture, the doctor completely breaks Cookie's spirit so all she has to live for is controlling the house: browning toast, lifting the blinds and playing peppy music for her homeowner to wake up and go-go. Safe to say, Cookie isn't happy. Luckily for Alexa, she isn't in the same egg. The ordinary smart apartment of 'The Expanse' "The Expanse" is set in a far future, 200 years away, yet it's surprisingly grounded in its depiction of our homes. Notice I've dropped "smart" -- there are ways you can fool these homes, once or even twice. In order to infiltrate a smart apartment and collect clues, Detective Miller uses voice-morphing technology to make his voice sound like its owner, Julie Mao. This way he can access all the voice-activated devices she's left in her apartment, 5151-I on Ceres Station. Voice imitation tech. Syfy Julie has a mechanical hamster and a voicemail machine that displays a hologram of her face. Aside from that, her apartment looks familiar. Even the corridor carpet is patterned with the tacky brown motel stripes we know and cringe at. From an exterior shot, we see the building has the rundown aesthetic of an average apartment block or estate of today, with New York-style fire escapes and grey metal materials. Julie's apartment looks like a reasonable version of what our smart homes might become: homes for the average person. They have neither the spaceship shine of an Apple product, nor AIs to control them. Still, another security threat presents itself. Adobe's "Photoshop of speech" software (not yet released) can manipulate an audio recording to include words and phrases, imitating the recorded voice. So, potentially, you could fool someone's smart home into not being so smart and opening its doors. Amazon and Apple save voice data from Echo and Siri recordings; data which is supposed to help improve the tech and instead presents both a privacy question and a potential investigative tool. Police obtained a warrant for recordings from Amazon over a murder in 2015, involving an Echo that was found at the crime scene. The device had been triggered and was playing music; police hoped background noises would provide clues. Amazon declined to hand over the recordings, because users' queries to Alexa are protected under the First Amendment. The future of the smart home If these filmmakers aim to comment on anything, it's that you won't be able to escape the smart home. One day our very own Jarvis will leave the baby crib, go to university, then come back and take care of us. "Sir, the more you struggle the more this is going to hurt."

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Daimler-Bosch alliance aims at self-driving taxis by early 2020s Daimler-Bosch alliance aims at self-driving taxis by early 2020s By Bill Howard on April 10, 2017 at 10:32 am Comment Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, and Bosch announced a joint agreement to work toward building self-driving vehicles that would come to market early next decade. The just-announced project aims at “robo-taxis” and application-based shared ride services. With the announcement, Daimler, one of the most technologically respected automakers, appears to be acknowledging it will launch an autonomous vehicle faster if it partners with others in the industry and pools the expertise. What the agreement says Bosch is a supplier of components to most every automaker, ranging from wiper blades through radars and vision systems. The working agreement with Daimler is that any Bosch-developed products used in Mercedes autonomous vehicles would be exclusive to Mercedes for two years. Bosch autonomous-driving engineers will be separated from co-workers, working at technical centers in Stuttgart, Germany, headquarters of Daimler, or in Silicon Valley, headquarters to all high technology. Prior to the hookup, Mercedes-Benz reportedly had two engineering teams totaling 500 people working on autonomous driving. The project was split between those working on an evolutionary upgrade from the driver assist systems now available versus a more radical approach that involved more cameras, radars, and other sensors. What some others are up to Google first showed an autonomous car in 2012, developed in part with help from Bosch. Mercedes-Benz in 2013 showed the current S-Class sedan’s semi-autonomous capabilities by driving – with the driver hands-off – for 64 miles or 103 kilometers between Mannheim and Pforzheimm, Germany. The S-Class is capable of so-called Level 2 driving, or partial automation, where the car can control steering, acceleration and braking, or both. Level 3, conditional automation, is self-driving on many roads, but the driver must remain vigilant and ready to take over on a moment’s notice, something that may be hard to do in the real world. So some automakers are talking about skipping from Level 3 to Level 4 or Level 5. Level 4 is conditional automation and works even the driver doesn’t intervene; there may be some circumstances or roads the car would not attempt. Level 5 is full autonomy, all conditions, no steering wheel needed; effectively it can drive any road under any condition where a human could. BMW, a direct competitor of Mercedes, joined forces with vision company Mobileye and Intel in 2016 with a goal of shipping autonomous cars by 2021. Intel has since bought MobileEye. Separately, Bosch entered an alliance with Nvidia to create a self-driving computer. Meanwhile, Mercedes has its own pact with Nvidia, as does ZF, a German company best known for transmissions that is working on autonomous driving, too. For certain, the maps for the Daimler-Bosch car will come from Here (originally called Navteq), the digital maps company purchased in 2015 by Audi, BMW, and Daimler; Intel took a stake in Here this year. All of this suggests the self-driving car, when it first comes to market, will reflect the work of an automaker and suppliers working hand-in-hand.

Page 1 of 4. 23 Comments Last week when posting an eight-way BSD/Linux OS comparison there were a few premium members who requested seeing Solus results side-by-side. For those interested, here are some fresh benchmarks of this promising Linux distribution. So for some Monday benchmark viewing pleasure are results of Solus Linux compared to Antergos, Clear Linux, Scientific Linux 7, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 17.04 daily. Each operating system was compared out-of-the-box following a fresh install. All tests happened on the same Intel Core i7 6800K + MSI X99A WORKSTATION + 16GB DDR4 + Samsung 850 EVO 120GB SSD + GeForce GTX TITAN X configuration. Solus Linux at the moment up to the Linux 4.9 kernel, GCC 6.3, Mesa 17.0.1, and other modern components along with its Budgie desktop. All of these benchmarks were done in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News After Reported Federal Finding Of “Extreme” Gender Disparity, Google To Face Shareholder Vote In June Lamb: "Now We Know Why Google Broke With Other Top Tech Companies Making Major Progress on Gender Pay Equity"; With Major Shareholder Focus Now on Banks, Question: Which Institutions Are "Googles of Banking" on Gender Disparities? BOSTON, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- In 2016, seven of nine top US tech companies bowed to shareholder pressure, disclosing their gender pay gaps and making major progress to improve pay equity.  Alphabet – the parent of search engine Google – was one of the two holdouts to the campaign led by shareholder advocate Arjuna Capital.  New reports that the U.S. Department of Labor has cited the company for engaging in "extreme" and "systemic" gender pay equity disparities makes it clear why the tech giant was a holdout among its peers. But even with its lopsided management control of shares, Google (via its parent Alphabet) can't escape continued shareholder pressure in 2017. An Arjuna Capital resolution is scheduled to be voted on for the second time when the Alphabet annual meeting takes place on June 7, 2017.  The Alphabet shareholder vote on gender pay disparity will be a challenge since an unusually high percentage of the shares are controlled by the company's predominantly white male managers and founders. Natasha Lamb, managing director, lead filer of gender pay resolutions, Arjuna Capital, said: "Now we get why Google broke with other top tech companies in 2016 in making major progress on gender pay equity. 2016 was the year in which nearly all of the tech world responded to concerned shareholders by addressing gender disparity issues.  If Google thinks that its massive size and influence somehow makes it invulnerable to shareholder pressure, it needs to think again. Federal litigation, fines, and the risk of resulting civil suits show why shareholders have every right to be concerned.  Investors long-term wealth is under threat when companies flout the rules on how women are treated in the workplace." Arjuna Capital led the successful shareholder fight last year in getting seven of nine targeted tech companies -- eBay, Intel, Apple, Amazon, Expedia, Microsoft and Adobe -- to upgrade their standards and transparency on gender pay disparity in the workplace.  Now, Arjuna Capital is taking the same campaign to six top banks and credit card companies:  Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America (in partnership with Baldwin Brothers Inc.), JP Morgan, MasterCard, and American Express.  Arjuna has also refiled their gender pay proposal at Facebook.  Lamb added: "It seems safe to assume that only companies with something to hide are refusing to come clean on gender pay parity.  So, as we turn our focus to big banks in 2017, the logical question is:  Which major US financial institutions are trying to hide the fact that they are the Googles of banking when it comes to gender pay disparity?  Wall Street needs to know what Silicon Valley already knows:  Shareholders expect gender pay disparity at major corporations to become a thing of the past." Barring major progress in the next few weeks, annual meeting votes on the Arjuna Capital bank-related resolutions will take place in late April at Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America. The other three bank shareholder resolutions and the Facebook resolution are expected to come to votes in May and June. Arjuna Capital worked with co-filers on technology and the bank/credit card company resolutions.  They included:  Alphabet—Baldwin Brothers Inc., Proxy Impact; Facebook—Baldwin Brothers Inc.; Bank of America—Baldwin Brothers (co-lead); JP Morgan—Baldwin Brothers; MasterCard—Baldwin Brothers, Clean Yield Asset Management, Pax World Investments;  and American Express—Clean Yield, Walden Asset Management. Arjuna Capital is an investment firm focused on sustainable and impact investing.  For more information, visit www.Arjuna-Capital.com.

It's for play videogames, 1080p60fps will be enough, or even 720p60fps, don't need to play with the highest settings possible, the main thing I want is smoothness, I don't care about graphics. CPU, MB, GPU, PSU, RAM, SSD, HDD, PC-Case + set up from the shop, since I don't know... 500-850. SSD with 128 enough for me for SO+programs, and with 1TB of HDD enough as well. I got a good experience with Intel CPU and bad with ATi GPU drivers but I don't know how this works. Since I wrote too much the important things are in bold. If any of you know any guide for start to learn about hardware... feel bad asking about a computer to people I don't know... Thanks.     Checheck View Public Profile Find all posts by Checheck     (#2) sverek Maha Guru     Videocard: MSI GTX970 4G Processor: i5 2500k Mainboard: P8Z68-V Memory: Corsair Ven. 8GB Soundcard: XonarDG+HD595 PSU: Corsair HX850 Yesterday, 13:22 | posts: 2,541 | Location: Ibaraki, Japan You gonna need solid CPU to push frames on lower resolutions and video settings. For smoothest gameplay, you might want 144hz monitor. Tomorrow, Ryzen 6 cores reviews will be published. This might be exactly CPU you want. It's cheaper than 7700K, and yet might provide close performance.     sverek View Public Profile Find all posts by sverek   (#3) Geryboy Maha Guru     Videocard: 1080 GameRock 2088/11000 Processor: i7 6700k 4.6GHz @ 1.29V Mainboard: MSI Z170A M7 Memory: RipjawsV 3G 2x8 GB Soundcard: SBZ->TV_Adap.3.0->OPN1 PSU: Seasonic SS-1250XM Yesterday, 15:11 | posts: 2,300 | Location: Munich go with an i5 and a 1060, not sure whether 4570k, or 6600k fit in that budget, obviously a newer one would be better. something like this edit you can also take a look at the 130 motherboards to save some money, you would need a cpu cooler though I think.

A decent midrange GPU like a 470-480X or a 1060 (6gb, don't go for the cut down 3gb) should also fit into that budget with the other requirements. A good 600-700w PSU from the likes of EVGA, Superflower, Seasonic etc should fit the bill with a build built around the above hardware. Also try to get 16gb of the fastest RAM you can afford. I'm not massively clued into the new AMD motherboards, so maybe someone else can help you there. A case is a more personal thing, if you don't care about aesthetics something like a Corsair 200R is cheap as chips and has great functionality. If I were building right of this moment with the intent of keeping my hardware for 4-5 years, I would not buy a current Intel i5. I don't think straight up quads (without HT) are going to cut it as we go forward.

His 60 fps target can easily be achieved and saying without 6 cores no 60 fps in the future is rubbish.     Geryboy View Public Profile Find all posts by Geryboy   (#6) Darkest Ancient Guru     Videocard: HD7950 Processor: i5 3570k @ 4.4GHz Mainboard: Gigabyte Z77 D3H Memory: HyperX Beast 16GB 2133 Soundcard: Aune T1 + HD650/DT990 Pro PSU: OCZ ZS 550w Yesterday, 16:27 | posts: 9,866 He's currently using a Core 2 Duo, if he keeps his new system for a similar length of time he has a high chance of running into issues in the future. As for the "hardly slower" -- it's slower. Its also got noticeably less VRAM, which even at 1080p will become an issue. It's problematic in some games already. You're suggesting building a rig which is already partially out-dated simply to suit your own personal hardware biases. The best argument you have for this is calling a statement rubbish? Right back at you. http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages...review,29.html Quote: Conclusion The 3GB version of the Geforce GTX 1060 is an interesting edition towards the 1060 line-up, it should be good notch cheaper in the stores saving you ~30 bucks. However if you want my advice, please do spend the extra money on a 6GB version. Not only does it offer slightly more rendering performance, with modern games you are going to need that extra memory as 3 GB isn't really going to cut it anymore. Especially if you plan to game in the 2560x1440 resolution. For 1080P (and lower resolutions) things are a little different, but even there that 3 GB is cutting it close with modern titles and upcoming games versus proper quality settings. But hey, don't just take my word on the matter. The above is a quote from the linked article, written by Hilbert Hagedoorn.

I forgot to say I have a 144hz monitor, I know it's weird with the kind of computer I have, but was a gift (the previous one was from 2004). I'm using an Acer GN246HL I will check the review! I don't know about that stuff as I said but I need to start to learn about this. All about Ryzen looks good and I will check, but honestly since this is a unknown world for me I have to say that I'm a little "scared" of buy things that just has been release or will be release pretty soon, because haven't tested at all. But I will keep my eye on it! Thanks sverek Quote: Originally Posted by Geryboy go with an i5 and a 1060, not sure whether 4570k, or 6600k fit in that budget, obviously a newer one would be better.

A good 600-700w PSU from the likes of EVGA, Superflower, Seasonic etc should fit the bill with a build built around the above hardware. Also try to get 16gb of the fastest RAM you can afford. I'm not massively clued into the new AMD motherboards, so maybe someone else can help you there. A case is a more personal thing, if you don't care about aesthetics something like a Corsair 200R is cheap as chips and has great functionality. If I were building right of this moment with the intent of keeping my hardware for 4-5 years, I would not buy a current Intel i5. I don't think straight up quads (without HT) are going to cut it as we go forward. You noticed how many time I'm with this hardware XD Yeah... You both are agree in 1060, looks like the GPU I need. I don't care about aesthetics so I will check the case you said. What CPU will you recommend in my situation?

Is pretty wide you are right, I want to pay as minimum as possible, but at the other hand I want to keep the new PC for a long time as Darkest said, so (can't afford so much)... I'm confused, because I guess is impossible to buy good hardware for +-5 years and save money at the same time Maybe 650-850...? 700-850, spend 850 will hurt me XD I'm planning to buy the computer here: pccomponentes Is not close to me, it's all via internet, but I think is one of the best of my country, the shop near where I live are very expensive, even without the shipping.

So you disagree with the owner of this website? I'm not going to go into the rest, you're just arguing for the sake of it at this point. Nobody is talking about ultra settings, we're talking about longevity since the OP by his own admission keeps hardware for very long periods of time. @OP: Since you keep your hardware for a long period of time, I'd recommend looking into the current (aka Ryzen) AMD 4-6 core variants, they should fit into your budget while offering a better long term solution compared to Intel i5's. If you can afford a current Intel I7 it might be worth taking into account. Anyone that tries to tell you it's a good idea to buy a 4c4t CPU for long term use at this point in time is either delusional or incredibly biased. The same stands for the above GPU discussion. If you do get a 1060 buy the 6gb version. You'll find the same recommendation from almost every major hardware review website on the internet. That includes the website you're currently posting on.

I think you'll get by with 3gb VRAM and 4 cores just fine the next years, and I see no trends that conflict with that. if the op wants to spend another 50  fine, could still save them, sell the 1060 later on and add that safed 50 for another card, don't think he'll have regrets with that i5. I know you 8 core is the future cultist have a different mindset, doesn't really reflect current trends and reality.

So why are you wasting our time? You're on the website of someone you disagree with. Pretty much all data disagrees with you. You're sat there trying to tell someone to buy a Haswell i5 and a low memory mid range GPU when you know they keep hardware over long periods. You're not just delusional, you're outright insane. Edit: I see you edited out the Haswell recommendation. Your still offering piss poor advice, though. So there's that. PS: Who is talking about 8 cores here? You're literally the only person to mention it. Current trends have what exactly to do with advice regarding the future? Someone who might still be using the same hardware in half a decade or more?

And he said he aims for medium to high preset basically.

I'm attacking you? I've seen you post in the past, you have clear issues with bias. I usually ignore them because you're generally dealing with people that know better. This is a newcomer to the forum who you're giving poor advice. You're the one that's full of yourself. I'm not the one claiming the highly experienced owner of a major computer hardware website is wrong. Do you even read the tripe you write before you post it? You also don't get to move the goalposts as you see fit. You're talking about 3-4 years regarding a user still using a Core 2 Duo. Again, do you actually read things and at least try to comprehend them before you post? You're suggesting buying a cut down GPU when you could spend a small price more, for someone that keeps (read this bit, it's important) their hardware for LONG PERIODS OF TIME. Jesus Christ are you for real?

I'm not the one claiming the highly experienced owner of a major computer hardware website is wrong. Do you even read the tripe you write before you post it? yep I do, and I've read 1080p 60 fps and he doesn't want ultra preset. And I still try to figure out what your problem is. Surely it is a psychological issue, you just don't like me and try to pick of fight with me. The 6 GB goes for roughly 50more and doesn't help him with his goal right now. it's at least 25% more expensive, and why would he have to need 6GB for 1080p 60 fps? if he was at 1440p I would say you're right. You're just being a little ass right now. And what's the future plz? The card will be too slow before he'll get a VRAM issue, that "cut down" is 5% performance for 25% more money. How can you say spending now 25% more money on a gpu will even out the cost in 4 years? How can you say that? Why will 3 GB not be enough for a medium to high mix? And the way you try to argue about that is sooo childish get some space plz. You're pathetic.

Try looking at your attitude to my first response in here. I'm pointing out your ill advice for the benefit of a new member on the forum. That said, I'm done with you -- as stated you're either trolling or deluded. Honestly, you're telling someone to buy hardware that barely meets his current requirements let alone his long term. Still, at least you had the sense to retract the suggestion of a Haswell i5, so I suppose there's at least some self awareness. I apologise to the OP for the derailment. If you intend to keep your hardware for as long as your current, ignore Geryboy. He does not understand the concept of longevity, his advice is awful. He's suggesting hardware to you based upon his personal experience while being incapable of estimating the needs of others.

By that same measure, how do you deem 3GB as enough? High-end is now shipping with 8-11GB of VRAM, with 12GB for the Titan Xp. 2.5 years ago, 4GB for the 900 series, 12GB for the Titan X. 4-5 years ago, 3GB was for high-end, 6GB for the Titan. History tells us that high-end amounts of VRAM usually become the baseline in about 5 years time. That means it's time for 3GB. 3GB is too low to buy into these days, whatever you're doing. VRAM is not as flexible as shader performance. There is a baseline and if you run into that, the card cannot run the game. Plain and simple. The SSD would never even be in the same league as this VRAM upgrade, given this is a gaming machine. Faster loading times and perhaps smoother texture streaming vs. single-digit FPS due to insufficient RAM.     yasamoka View Public Profile Find all posts by yasamoka   (#24) Geryboy Maha Guru     Videocard: 1080 GameRock 2088/11000 Processor: i7 6700k 4.6GHz @ 1.29V Mainboard: MSI Z170A M7 Memory: RipjawsV 3G 2x8 GB Soundcard: SBZ->TV_Adap.3.0->OPN1 PSU: Seasonic SS-1250XM Yesterday, 21:27 | posts: 2,300 | Location: Munich I had a 980 a year ago, with afterburner I hardly ever saw more than 2 GB of VRAM used, I never used more than 2 x MSAA and had 1440p.

I have had a 7970 since August 2012, and 7970 CrossFire since late 2013 up till October 2016. I have seen in excess of 2GB VRAM being used easily. I'm running 1440p 110Hz. For the last year or two, at the high-end, I have not been able to run Shadow of Mordor at highest quality settings, or Rise of the Tomb Raider with Very High textures. Even if this is currently the case only at the high-end, it is and will be trickling down to the midrange. This is why 3GB is currently cutting it, and 4GB+ is where it's at. Anyway, RX480 > GTX1060 and that starts at 4GB so it's a moot point. I'd still go for the 8GB version of the RX480 though, it's not much more expensive.     yasamoka View Public Profile Find all posts by yasamoka Page 1 of 2 1 2 > « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

By that time Ryzen will get all its fixes, and hopefully fine wine will be fine. So this year June / July we will see if Intel has something good to offer at a reasonable price or Ryzen is still the best price/performance ratio for 8/16.

It will most likely be very high price, but it's the first time in recent Intel history that a single platform will be able to operate with all available desktop CPU classes. EDIT: It also shows what kind of marketing gimmick a of the rest has been. We know what kind of performance we'll get out of it. Skylake isn't that memory bandwidth sensitive, so my only question is how well it scales with 8 cores. Since Intel keeps using the ring bus, don't expect reasonable prices yet. As for the quads, it's kind of a bad move in the face of their clients who went for quad over octo with Ryzen, and now there's finally a broader platform, yet they are already committed.

I can see those being a huge seller. /s No, I get that it is the cheap way to get on the Socket 2066 platform for later upgrades, but it's still pretty silly to basically throw away that kind of money on a CPU to get onto a platform so you can spend 2x-3x that much money later. Getting an x270 board with a Pentium on it so you can upgrade later makes sense, because they're under $100, but spending what will almost certainly be $300+ to do the same on x299 just seems dumb.     illrigger View Public Profile Find all posts by illrigger   (#15) Agent-A01 Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980Ti SLI H20 Processor: i7 5930k 4.7GHz H20 Mainboard: ASUS X99-A Memory: G.Skill 4x8GB 3200C12 Soundcard: Xonar Phoebus-PC360/HD598 PSU: EVGA P2-1200W Yesterday, 17:41 | posts: 9,034 | Location: USA Quote: Originally Posted by PrMinisterGR Their chipsets only lack if you go for the 40-lane X99 CPUs, most of which are almost double in price than the 1700, so I wouldn't call that "lacking". The AM4 platform is going against the mainstream Intel series anyways. Of course not everyone needs 40 CPU lanes but even compared to mainstream it's lacking in a few areas. Only 4 sata3(argument is 3rd party one's are junk compared to native except in pure throughput) Only provides 8x Gen 2 PCIe from chipset whereas Z270 has 24 Gen 3 lanes. On Z270 M.2 4x SSDs don't have to use CPU lanes so that's a plus as well.

Most motherboards come with 8x "native" SATA3 ports, and the more premium ones usually offer two more via a 3rd party chipset, exactly like with Intel. In addition to that, the AM4 platform has native USB 3.1 support, while the Z270 has none. Quote: Originally Posted by Agent-A01 Only provides 8x Gen 2 PCIe from chipset whereas Z270 has 24 Gen 3 lanes. It is true that the Z270 offers 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, but its connection to the CPU itself is exactly the same speed as the x370. PCIe 3.0 x4. This would tell me that under most stressing circumstances (a lot of expansion cards working at the same time etc), the AMD platform will behave closer to what is expected of it, since the Z270 has a connection to the CPU that is six times slower than the maximum bandwidth it can provide to devices connected to it. It's nice to see the "24 PCIe 3.0 lanes", if they can mean anything tangible. Quote: Originally Posted by Agent-A01 On Z270 M.2 4x SSDs don't have to use CPU lanes so that's a plus as well. Granted Ryzen is cheaper so that will be the argument of having less. Yeah, they hobble the 4x PCIe connection to it, along with everything else coming from the chipset. You can say that X99 has more features (and it does have more), but Z270 is an inferior platform, feature-wise, with the exception of Optane.     PrMinisterGR View Public Profile Find all posts by PrMinisterGR   (#17) nevcairiel Member Guru   Videocard: MSI 1080 Gaming X Processor: Intel Core i7-6850K Mainboard: MSI X99 Gaming Pro Carbon Memory: G.Skill 32GB DDR4 3200Mhz Soundcard: PSU: Corsair AX860 Yesterday, 20:05 | posts: 55 Quote: Originally Posted by Fyew-jit-tiv this is pants from intel. 4core only 16 lanes.... are you kidding me and still 14nm.

This^. Having quad cores in an expensive platform like this is one the dumbest moves i have ever seen regarding CPUs... Intel has to clearly define their products/platforms: a mainstream for normal users and gamers with dual memory channel and cpus with a max of 6 or 8 cores and a high end/professional platform for professionals that need all the processing power, available with all the features, and for crazy gamers who have more money than sense...

Buried in their announcement of the NVIDIA Titan Xp, NVIDIA has also made a rather surprising revelation: that they will be releasing macOS drivers for their Pascal architecture GPUs. This comes despite the fact that Apple hasn’t sold a Mac Pro that can officially accept a PCIe video card in almost half a decade. When Apple released the trash can shaped and highly customized Mac Pro design in 2013 – one, coincidentally enough, they’ll be walking away from for the next iteration – Apple also sealed the fate for end-user video card upgrades on the Macintosh platform. Every Mac now uses a customized, integrated video card of some kind, from the soldered-on MacBook Pro up to the custom format cards of the Mac Pro. This has meant that as the old, Westmere-based Mac Pro towers have aged into retirement, so has the market for Mac video card upgrades. For NVIDIA, this is a bit of a double-whammy. NVIDIA owns the bulk of the discrete video card market, and at the same time, Apple hasn’t integrated an NVIDIA GPU in some time now; the last NVIDIA-equipped Mac was the 2014 MacBook Pro, which included an NVIDIA Kepler GPU. As a result, NVIDIA has been locked out of the Mac video card market entirely for the last couple of years, and consequently makes NVIDIA’s announcement so surprising. So why is NVIDIA releasing a Mac driver to a market that, officially speaking, is essentially dead? It’s telling that this is a question NVIDIA doesn’t even bother to address, simply stating that they’re “making the new TITAN Xp open to the Mac community with new Pascal drivers” in order to give “Mac users access to the immense horsepower delivered by our award-winning Pascal-powered GPUs.” At best, the official market is the remaining handful of Mac Pro Tower owners. Instead it’s the off-label use that makes this announcement interesting, and indeed gives NVIDIA any reason whatsoever to make a Pascal driver release. Within the Mac community there are small but none the less vocal user groups based around both unsupported external GPUs and not-even-Apple-hardware Hackintoshes. In the case of the former, while macOS doesn’t support external GPUs (and isn’t certified as eGFX complaint by Intel), it’s possible to use Macs with Thunderbolt eGFX chassis with a bit of OS patching. Meanwhile with a bit more hacking, it’s entirely possible to get macOS running on a custom-built PC, leading to the now long-running Hackintosh space. The fact of the matter is that neither of these groups is very big relative to the much bigger Mac user base – who wants to do real professional work on an unsupported video card setup? – but they are vocal, and they do need increasingly powerful video cards, like the rest of the PC market. But more to the point, given Apple’s announcement that they’re going to eventually fix the Mac Pro’s GPU woes, but not for at least another year, this is a chance for NVIDIA to take a low-risk pot shot at Apple for their dGPU follies. At a minimum, it’s a nice gesture to Mac users (whom tend to spend big on hardware), and perhaps, it makes for the start of a grassroots campaign to get an NVIDIA GPU in the next iMac or Mac Pro. And while only NVIDIA knows for sure if they planned this before this week’s Mac Pro announcement or they just got lucky, it comes across as a clever move by the company. Otherwise, from a technical perspective, there’s little reason for NVIDIA not to do this. The company needs to keep Mac driver development for new architectures alive regardless so that they can compete for future GPU contracts, meaning NVIDIA already has the drivers in-house, though perhaps not in an end-user ready state. Given how the whole endeavor is essentially unsupported from the Apple side of matters, this may make for a bumpy ride at the start. But I think it will be interesting to see where the NV-GPU equipped Mac user base stands in a year or two when Apple readies their next Mac Pro, and if NVIDIA’s gesture has any real impact on the number of NVIDIA users out there.

Last I heard you had to hack one of the MacOS modules to get this to work over thunderbolt and it was much simpler to use a windows installation. Maybe this could solve that problem.

I'm really surprised how long this model has endured due to Apple's missteps. Considering that on the CPU side, the 2013 model of the Mac Pro only bests my model in AVX based code, my system is still state-of-the-art on the Mac side. With my GPU and SSD upgrades, I've got a machine faster than what Apple is currently selling in several aspects. I also have greater memory capacity (128 GB).

The Microsoft operating system that millions of devices and machines are running, typically with a custom application or skin running on top of it so that users don't automatically notice the OS. The operating system that underpins hundreds of thousands of medical devices, automatic teller machines, kiosks at airports and other crowded public places, industrial machinery and control planes, set top boxes, game consoles. Windows Embedded is a relatively unheralded version of Windows whose existence might surprise you. But it seems like Windows Embedded's existence might also surprise a lot of folks up in Redmond. Here, at the Microsoft campus, despite all of the hullabaloo about Windows 10 and device updates -- and the new Creators Update and Redstone versions that will be coming down the pike at an almost breakneck speed -- Windows Embedded suffers from an opposite problem. It appears unfortunately stuck in a place where no future has clearly been laid out for it. [ Further reading: GE and Microsoft team on IoT platform ] One indication that Windows Embedded may be on its way out is the introduction of Windows 10 IoT, which Microsoft has started pushing as a replacement. However, first, a bit of background of Windows Embedded. A brief history of Windows Embedded to date How has Windows Embedded worked in the past? Most vendors chose Windows Embedded because, unlike the traditional desktop operating system, it was modular: You could choose which features to install or not install, both to reduce the supportability burden on the vendor (you don't need Solitaire on an ATM, for example) and to reduce the potential attack surface, since laser cutting machines do not generally need IIS web serving capabilities, for instance. The modularity also included the ability to customize some parts of the OS that were not open to modification in the full version, like splash screens and filters, so you could insert your own branding or the branding of the machine directly into the OS. Essentially, you wanted a stripped-down operating system so you can fully customize both the hardware and the software in a system, as well as save space on often limited storage media in devices. These were the most recent Windows Embedded versions: Windows Embedded Standard 7 (WES7): Windows Embedded Standard 7 was essentially Windows 7 with different parts ripped out and different levels of customization ability. There were three "notches," called, C, E, and P, each of which denoted different additions of features to the base image of Windows Embedded and had correspondingly different prices. P was the most expensive and was essentially identical to Windows 7 from a features perspective. Windows Embedded 8 Standard (WE8S): This took Microsoft's embedded operating system but pulled it up to Windows 8. It also got rid of all of the C, E, and P versioning so if you bought WE8S, then you received authorization to run all of WE8S -- and you paid for all of it, too. You did not have to use all of the features and you could still carve out parts and do any required customization, but you could not opt out of some of the features and pay a cheaper price, either. There were also versions that came with a full pre-built image of Windows Embedded and were mainly for use in otherwise full computers that were deployed in appliance-like settings, such as point-of-sale devices and cash registers, digital signage, or thin clients that booted only to connect to a full user session running on some other machine. Embedded into the internet of things Now Microsoft has decided that if you want to build devices and large machines out of discrete components, what you're really building is a Thing. The naming is a nod to the internet of things (IoT) phenomenon, where the reflectors in the roadway and sensors in your refrigerator are all connected to the internet and possess "smart" capabilities. The fact of the matter is that the IoT versions of Windows 10 are replacements for the line of Windows Embedded SKUs that have existed before now. There are now three editions of the IoT version of Windows 10, and they are each designed for different device form factors, as follows: Windows 10 IoT Core, for small devices: This version of Windows 10 has no shell and essentially supports only universal apps -- those coded to run in the managed environment of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and not traditional x86 or x64 apps. This OS version has a maximum of 256MB of RAM and 2GB of device storage, and can run on the x86 chip platform or the ARM platform for low-power devices. Currently, this is the only edition of Windows 10 IoT that can be obtained directly by end users. Windows 10 IoT Mobile Enterprise, for mobile devices: This version of Windows 10 adds the "tablet" shell -- the skin that you run apps from the Windows Store in -- and also supports universal apps and drivers. Storage and memory support are doubled, but you can run this version of Windows 10 only on ARM-based devices; there is no x86 chip support. Windows 10 IoT Mobile Enterprise is specifically intended for use with mobile point-of-sale and handheld systems with display sizes less than eight inches. Think bar-code scanners, automotive testers, control pads, and the like. This edition of Windows 10 IoT is available to OEMs and system builders only. Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, for industry devices: This version of Windows 10 brings the traditional desktop shell back to the fray, doubles the memory and quadruples the RAM supported by the OS. It also adds x86 chip platform support, but it removes ARM support. This edition of Windows 10 IoT is available to OEMs and system builders only. The lifecycle of Windows 10 IoT Enterprise is: Give five years of regular production support plus another five years after that of extended, security update only-style support. For those familiar with the branches of Windows 10, this is the Long Term Servicing Branch, or LTSB, choice. This edition also includes deferred online activation, the Unified Write Filter, Embedded Boot Experience and Logon (the customizable splash screens and boot sequence), and the Windows Shell Launcher. One interesting note: according to Direct Insight, Microsoft has created three levels of license pricing for Windows 10 IoT Enterprise: (a) Entry, which targets lower performance processors like the Atom and Celeron, and provides a 75% reduction in cost; (b) Value, which targets the Intel Core i3, Core i5, and Core M processors, with a 50% reduction in cost; and (c) High End, targeting the Core i7 and Xeon, with no cost reduction. The consequences of these divides between editions of Windows 10 IoT are pretty clear. If you want to use Windows on an ARM-based device, you can only use the "small devices" or "mobile devices" editions, since the full edition is not yet ready to run on the ARM platform. If you want to build mobile devices with more than 256MB of RAM, they had better support the ARM platform, because there is no x86 chip support in an edition that supports more RAM than that. If you want more than 4GB of storage, you are dealing with x86 chips, insofar as embedded Windows goes. If you are looking to provide an operating system for single-board solutions or very small embedded devices, then the Windows 10 IoT Core edition could be suitable. The most frequent target for this type of development seems to be hobbyists working with the Raspberry Pi and other single-board devices -- these "makers" are really whom Core is aimed at, although there is little preventing its use in other applications and scenarios. It also appears that users have lost the option of purchasing a "license-only" version of Windows 10 IoT, something that was possible for Windows 7 Professional for Embedded Systems and Windows Embedded 8.1 Pro. This was essentially a feature that allowed you to license a full installation of Windows on a system that was part of a larger device. The operating system itself could be standard, an identical copy of Windows 7 or 8, but since it was a component of a larger system or machine, you could assign a less expensive license to it. No such option appears to exist for Windows 10 IoT, although nothing is preventing Microsoft from putting this old practice back into availability at any time. What changes? The implications For applications that currently run on Windows Embedded that are not Universal Windows applications, but that are instead standard x86 apps, it's difficult to see any advantage for the IoT editions of Windows 10, save maybe the Enterprise version. The other editions are essentially just stub operating systems that can run limited applications that understand how to make Windows API calls and interpret the results. While developers can target each of the IoT editions of Windows 10 easily within Visual Studio, porting existing x86 apps to the Universal Windows platform is another project entirely. And recreating existing apps from scratch just to meld to Microsoft's new vision of what embedded operating systems should look like is an entirely different question -- one that would require some justification, and some return on the time and money invested in the porting effort. The best that could be said about these IoT editions of Windows 10 is that they are additions, augmentations, and extensions of the Windows Embedded platform, and that they make new applications possible. It seems unlikely that Chase Bank or American Airlines is going to rewrite their ATM or kiosk software to target Universal Windows Platform-capable operating systems, especially when, at this point, UWP apps have capabilities that are a subset of full x86 apps (which is likely what these companies are currently running). These apps also will not generally run on the ARM platform, so these companies will most likely stay with what they know and what works well, at least for their existing applications. For that reason, it is unlikely that Windows 10 IoT is going to replace Windows Embedded 7 and 8. Instead, we might see Chase Bank developing a new payment machine using Windows 10 APIs or American Airlines deploying new RFID bag tags that run Windows 10 IoT. The question then becomes: Is this more than an IoT play? Is Windows 10 IoT a play to get Windows back on ARM? Shades of the ill-fated Windows RT operating system and Surface RT immediately come into mind, but it's hard not to draw the comparison. Windows has been for decades exclusively x86. Linux, on the other hand, has a vibrant community around the ARM chipset and has pretty much a complete repository of software and packages available to run on ARM. Microsoft is just getting started in ARM and its single entry into ARM did not end well (can you say billion-dollar writedown?). Is this another trip to nowhere? Another question: What is the roadmap for those currently running Windows Embedded? Confusingly, this statement from Microsoft seems to hint at an end of support coming: "Through July 17, 2017, Skylake devices running Windows Embedded 7, 8 and 8.1 will be supported according to the lifecycle support policy for those products. During the 18-month support period, these systems should be upgraded to Windows 10 to continue receiving support after the period ends. After July 2017, the most critical security updates will be addressed for these configurations, and will be released if the update does not risk the reliability or compatibility of the Windows Embedded 7/8/8.1 platform on other devices." Much is still unclear. But there are tons of devices and systems bigger than a Raspberry Pi but different than a full desktop that a typical knowledge worker would use, and these Windows 10 IoT editions do not seem to be full replacements for the Windows Embedded versions you would have chosen for these applications until now.

But it was so much more. As a preamble, let’s start with the famous quote from Benjamin Disraeli, prime minister of the UK from 1874 to 1880. “There are lies, damned lies, and statistics” and that is what many people and businesses still think. But if we fast forward to 2017 we see the opposite – enterprise and government see big data and analytics as the single most trusted source of truth and a vital element of almost everything we do. It is "Show me the data, not just the money" before decisions are made. In fact, the term big data, which first saw its use in the 1990s, has seen data sets grow from megabytes (MB) to petabytes (PB). 1024 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte (typically DRAM DIMMs max out at 32GB and SSD at 500GB) 1024 Gigabytes = 1 Terabyte (typically hard disks max out at 8TB) 1024 Terabytes = 1 Petabyte (currently the largest single data sets) 1024 Petabytes = 1 Exabyte 1024 Exabytes = 1 Zettabyte 1024 Zettabytes = 1 Yottabyte 1024 Yottabytes = 1 Brontobyte (and after that Geopbyte). Typical data growth rates of 20% to 50% annually are attributed to newer data sources, such as Web traffic, IoT sensor data, location and telephone call data. Exabyte-sized data warehouses will soon be the norm. And it is no longer about data from one source – it is about the vast data lakes or warehouses created when you mix in your data with other relevant data from social media, finance, government, utilities, telcos, marketing clouds, even free public Wi-Fi, street cameras and mobile/computer logins. As Gartner, a research and advisory company puts it, "Big Data represents information assets characterised by such a high volume, velocity, and variety to require specific technology and analytical methods for its transformation into value." And a fifth “V” has been added for veracity – it must be true to be of value. A few years ago, you could ask if big data and analytics was a cure for insomnia and I would have responded, “Storage is snorage, Big Data is on Star Trek.” After a couple of years of writing about this field let me simply say, big data and analytics is hot, vibrant, immensely interesting and the next big thing. This was my second Global Forum, my first was last year in Las Vegas. I was very thankful it was in Orlando, Florida, this time – Vegas is nice but I have been there a little too often. Next year’s SAS Global Forum is in Denver, Colorado from 8-11 April (spring), so if you have an interest in analytics and data, and are captivated by the wild west, Buffalo Bill, and Rocky Mountain High plan to attend. The forum attracts about 5000 people and a further 25,000 online participants. Sessions are video recorded and become valuable teaching aids – SAS has a laser focus on teaching the world about analytics and makes its SAS-on-demand software available free to students and institutions interested in analytics. It is all about what Goodnight calls making analytics “ambient”. I interviewed its co-founder and chief executive Dr. Jim Goodnight, a focused, insightful 74-year-old who still drives the company and places his personal stamp on everything. “SAS was doing analytics before it was cool. It can do so much more to effect change for good,” he said.   I interviewed Randy Guard, chief marketing officer, a savvy, astute marketer who really understands data-driven marketing and where analytics is heading. Guard said, “The future drivers for analytics are what it can do for business of all sizes, IoT, and regulation/compliance. SAS is well ahead in all respects.”   I interviewed Oliver Schabenberger, executive vice-president and chief technology officer, who spoke “tech” with such a passion, and whose entrance onto the forum stage on a Segway mini-Pro was using technology the smart way – well it was a very big, long stage. He said, “Hype hurts promise. Everyone from small to large business needs to get serious about using serious analytics.” I interviewed Jill Dyché, vice-president of Best Practices, about her role as an evangelist bringing the world of big data and analytics to help build company cultures that value analytics. “Don’t talk to me about the (SAS) product, talk to me about how analytics can enable your business. The truth is we are up to Analytics 4.0, but people still think it is a new thing,” she said. I also listened to two very inspirational speakers – Captain “Sully” Sullenberger of the “Miracle on the Hudson River” fame, and Colonel Chris Hadfield, Canadian Astronaut and International Space Station manager. Some of these interviews will appear in extended form soon, but more importantly, they gave me the valuable insights and framework that I could explore and action throughout the global forum. First look at the business executive to technology user ratio. Amazingly it was about 50/50. The C-level suits were there to learn what analytics could do for their organisation and enrolled in the executive program. They were keen to see how regulation and governance might affect their organisation. They were also keen to see how adopting a suite of SAS products, especially its new cloud based Viya (both a subset and superset of SAS 9.4), SAS Results-as-a-Service, visualisation with the new Visual Analytics suite, risk management, behavioural spend modelling, IoT and ESP (event stream processing), and best practices in general. The geeks were there to learn more about analytics and enrolled in the user programme stream. They were focused on data management, programming, helping to align analytics to line of business processes, and generally to learn more and gain SAS Master Data Management (MDM) or other certifications and tertiary qualifications. I decided to talk to a range of delegates to get their impressions about SAS and the field of big data and analytics. First was a group of undergraduate students. “All the exciting jobs are in data science and analytics.” Of the group, four had already received job offers at the Forum that would take them down the path of becoming data scientists. One undergraduate had a marketing focus and he was firmly of the conviction that the world could not function without data and analytics. As we spoke he wondered how I (born in the 50s) ever managed to build a business without data and analytics. “It is so pre-Matrix,” this student said referring to the movie of the same name and meaning that everything we do today, every decision we make, is backed by data. I spoke to a few “geeks” who were there to hone analytics skills (and there were hundreds of learning sessions). “I have learned probably 50 new ways to use, manage, and visualise our hugely growing data – I would have been happy with one!” one said. I spent some time with employees of a major Australian bank and long-time SAS user. One was from the C-suite and one in a more analytics-based role. The former was there to “visualise” how SAS could help the bank to be innovative in ever increasingly competitive times. The latter was there to see if he could do more with analytics. His comments were interesting, “Analytics starts with getting a few BI tools (shadow IT) and you start uncovering insights. But when you overlay SAS over those existing tools it uncovers so much more – no other solution comes remotely close.” Dyche said as much too. “The biggest danger to analytics is not doing it properly from the start. A lot of companies start “easy” going after the low-hanging fruit not committing the resources and staff. Technically it is the difference between using entry-level business intelligence (BI) tools, many of which are simply dashboards and scorecard approaches, versus true analytics — heavy algorithms — that SAS has been doing for 40 years. You don’t see BI and shadow IT feature in the Forrester Wave: Enterprise Insight platform [industry rankings],” she said. I spoke to the Diamond sponsors – Accenture Analytics, EY, Intel, and Teradata. The predominant theme was that SAS provides them with a major, trouble-free, powerful platform to solve customer needs. Intel was there as a long-term SAS supporter as its Xeon E7 processors and SSD/memory are used in most SAS on-premise, hybrid and cloud servers. We chatted about the new Optane memory (iTWire article here ) and there was a lot of excitement over what this radical 3D XPoint non-volatile memory could do for huge data sets and compute speeds. There were many more sponsors and supporters but perhaps the most impressive were the range of academic institutions offering K-12 secondary school, education certificates, under/post graduate and Masters in big data and analytics. The recurrent theme was that big data/analytics “graduates” all got jobs, all received better money than the average, and had a real future. The secondary theme was how supportive SAS is in providing the free SAS OnDemand to teachers and students. During a keynote session, Anthony Perez executive vice-president of strategy of the Orlando Magics (an NBA basketball team) and a SAS user, summed it up, “Innovation is a priority for all organisations. I think we’ve done a really good job in the space of sports. Being innovative is certainly helping with our mobile app. We were the first team to have that type of huge overhaul on our app and engage in the fan experience to those extremes. It has allowed us to innovate and figure out engaging ways for the fans to be involved.” Interestingly SAS had done the analytics on the upcoming national championship NBA game between the North Carolina Tar Heels and the Gonzaga Bulldogs. It predicted Tar Heels to win and it did – 71-65.  The writer attended the SAS Global Forum in Orlando, Florida, as a guest of the company.

Peter Wennink, director of chips machine maker ASML, said the Netherlands should not be ‘naive’ and that France, Germany and the US all have some sort of shield to protect their industry. Wennink was reacting to recent hostile bids for Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group Unilever and AkzoNobel, the Amsterdam-based paints and coatings concern. Wennink said he had no fears ASML itself would be the object of a hostile bid. He said the large customers for its chips-making equipment like Intel and Samsung could not take over ASML because of anti-trust regulations.  Moreover, ASML is the largest player in the sector with an 80% market share. On Buitenhof, Wennink also plugged the high-tech ‘Brainport’ alliance being developed around Eindhoven which includes ASML. Last week the alliance asked for €10bn in state support to develop the area into a third pillar of the Dutch economy alongside the Rotterdam port and Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport.

The attack allows hackers to remotely execute code on a targeted computer by tricking the user into opening a Word doc containing an embedded exploit. The Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is primarily targeted with this exploit, which works on all versions of Office up to Office 2016 running on Windows 10. FireEye, which has been working with Microsoft on the issue “for several weeks”, explained that a hacker would first email a Word document booby-trapped with a malicious embedded OLE2link object. It continued: “When the user opens the document, winword.exe issues a HTTP request to a remote server to retrieve a malicious .hta file, which appears as a fake RTF file. The Microsoft HTA application loads and executes the malicious script. In both observed documents the malicious script terminated the winword.exe process, downloaded additional payload(s), and loaded a decoy document for the user to see. The original winword.exe process is terminated in order to hide a user prompt generated by the OLE2link.” Thus, the threat could be used to silently deliver multiple types of malware, and because it’s a logical bug, can bypass any memory-based mitigations, according to McAfee. The Intel spin-off urged users not to open any Office files if they don’t trust the sender/location, and advised them to switch on Office Protected View, which the attack apparently cannot bypass. It is believed that Microsoft will address the threat in its April Patch Tuesday security update round. That is, unless there are any last-minute problems. In February, the Redmond security team was forced to cancel Patch Tuesday at the eleventh hour due to an unspecified issue.

TOKYO — Reuters Published Monday, Apr. 10, 2017 3:21AM EDT Last updated Monday, Apr. 10, 2017 4:25AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Japanese automotive chip maker Renesas Electronics Corp is hungry for more acquisitions amid a wave of megamergers in the industry and may need to issue equity shares sometime in the future to build its warchest, its CEO said on Monday. "The fragmented (automotive chip) market will be eventually consolidated into some dominant players" posing a long-term threat to Renesas, currently the world's No. 3, Renesas chief executive Bunsei Kure told reporters. NXP Semiconductors NV, the industry leader, has agreed to be acquired by Qualcomm Inc in a $47 billion deal to retain its lead in the fast-growing automotive chips market. And more recently, Intel Corp agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion. Kure said Renesas, which bought U.S. chipmaker Intersil Corp for $3.2 billion this year, is constantly reviewing its list of potential acquisition targets, comprising around several dozen names in fields such as sensors and security. To be ready for major acquisitions, Kure said the company would probably need to raise capital by issuing shares "at some point" in the future. "We want to be prepared to move when necessary," he said. According to data research firm IHS, Renesas had an automotive chip market share of 9.0 percent in 2016, ranking after NXP with 12.6 percent and Infineon Technologies with 9.5 percent.

Reuters/Shailesh Andrade IT giant Microsoft has started taking registrations for its Windows Insider Program for Business. Incorporating the Insider Preview in the company’s deployment plans will go a long way in preparing for the next update of Windows 10. Such developments on the Windows 10 front could also ease out the release of the Microsoft Surface Phone, which is a highly-anticipated device for the Windows Phone fans. The Program has been designed to better support business users and IT professionals who are part of the Insider community. Tech professionals can now use their corporate credentials to down the Windows 10 Insider builds. The program will also help in the deployment of new tools and services quicker and help secure a user’s applications and increase productivity and confidence. “This option will also increase the visibility of feedback submitted by you and others in your organization – especially on features that support your productivity and business needs. We’ll also help you deepen your connections with the IT Pro community, collect feedback within your organization, and resolve blocking or critical issues to better support your organization’s needs sooner,” says Microsoft. Meanwhile, Microsoft is said to be building a Windows 10 phone that will replace one’s laptop and desktop. Official details about the Microsoft Surface Phone are limited. The Windows 10-powered device could come with a radical design and some pretty unique features. The three editions expected are a business edition, consumer edition and an enthusiast edition. A new patent filed by Microsoft also mentions a device with multiple flexible hinges. This could mean that the device could function both as a tablet as well as a smartphone. The device maker could also be developing a removable keyboard and a pen to make business users and professionals more productive. User will be able to run Windows program on the smartphone. Due to the availability of Win32 apps, it is expected that Android and iOS users may also look to shift to this kind of a phone. As of now, an Intel Kaby lake processor is expected in the Microsoft Surface Phone. Earlier, Qualcomm and Microsoft had talked about their plans to bring Windows 10 support to devices running Snapdragon chips. The phone will be a productivity-oriented and secure handset. One of the possible reasons that is delaying the release of the device is the company’s effort to bring a device that won’t simply be a smartphone packed with powerful specs. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the Microsoft Surface Phone.

By Andy Eubank - Apr 9, 2017 SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Ag chair heading Russia probe If you pay attention to national politics you know that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes from California has stepped down from heading the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. His replacement just happens to be House Agriculture Committee Chair Mike Conaway. Will Conaway’s work on a new farm bill will be hurt by his new, high profile responsibilities? National Farmers Union President Roger Johnson isn’t quite sure. “Chairman Conaway’s staff has said they don’t expect this to have any impact on the pace of the farm bill,” he said. “We’re going to have to give this probably a few weeks, maybe a month or so, before we’ll really know the amount of time that it’s going to take out of his schedule.” Certainly, the investigation will take time, and can only mean an increased workload for Conaway. “I do expect that this is going to increase Chairman Conaway’s workload and take some of his attention. There’s no question about that. he happened to be the 2nd ranking on that committee (Intel) so it would naturally fall to him as soon as Chairman Nunes stepped aside.” Conaway issued a statement that he takes his new role with “the utmost seriousness,” but stressed that role is only temporary. Yet, leading the Russia probe puts Conaway in the national spotlight, compared to the low-profile job of leading the Ag Committee. It would seem to further complicate a farm bill process already disadvantaged by the much-delayed confirmation of Sonny Perdue as Ag Secretary.

Worldwide Cloud IT Infrastructure Top Cloud Vendors 2016 Q4 vs 2015 Q4 – Source: Worldwide Quarterly Cloud IT Infrastructure Tracker, Q4 2016 Vendor revenue from sales of infrastructure products (server, storage, and Ethernet switch) for cloud IT, including public and private cloud, grew by 9.2% year over year to $32.6 billion in 2016, with vendor revenue for the fourth quarter (4Q16) growing at 7.3% to $9.2 billion. According to the latest report from International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Cloud IT Infrastructure Tracker, "Cloud IT infrastructure sales as a share of overall worldwide IT spending climbed to 37.2% in 4Q16, up from 33.4% a year ago." — "Revenue from infrastructure sales to private cloud grew by 10.2% to $3.8 billion, and to public cloud by 5.3% to $5.4 billion. In comparison, revenue in the traditional (non-cloud) IT infrastructure segment decreased 9.0% year over year in the fourth quarter." — "Private cloud infrastructure growth was led by Ethernet switch at 52.7% year-over-year growth, followed by server at 9.3%, and storage at 3.6%. Public cloud growth was also led by Ethernet switch at 30.0% year-over-year growth, followed by server at 2.4% and a 2.1% decline in storage. In traditional IT deployments, storage declined the most (10.8% year over year), with Ethernet switch and server declining 3.4% and 9.0%, respectively." — Kuba Stolarski, research director for Computing Platforms at IDC: "Growth slowed to single digits in 2016 in the cloud IT infrastructure market as hyperscale cloud datacenter growth continued its pause. Network upgrades continue to be the focus of public cloud deployments, as network bandwidth has become by far the largest bottleneck in cloud datacenters. After some delays for a few hyperscalers, datacenter buildouts and refresh are expected to accelerate throughout 2017, built on newer generation hardware, primarily using Intel's Skylake architecture." — "From a regional perspective, vendor revenue from cloud IT infrastructure sales grew fastest in Japan at 42.3% year over year in 4Q16, followed by Middle East & Africa at 33.6%, Canada at 16.6%, Western Europe at 15.6%, Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) at 14.5%, Central and Eastern Europe at 11.6%, Latin America at 9.9%, and the United States at 0.1%."
