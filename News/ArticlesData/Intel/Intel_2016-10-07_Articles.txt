Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 8, 2016 at 9:35AM   Image source: Intel.  Back in 2013, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and then-standalone programmable logic chip specialist Altera announced that the latter would build its next high-end field programmable gate array, or FPGA, known as the Stratix 10 in the former's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. This was something of a big deal, because Altera had a long history of using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) for chip manufacturing services. More importantly, it arguably represented Intel's first high-profile contract chip manufacturing win. The Stratix 10 ultimately saw delays and for a while it wasn't even clear that Altera would continue to work with Intel to build future high-end FPGAs. That is, until Intel bought the company last year. At long last, on Oct. 4, Intel announced that the Stratix 10 chip had begun sampling to potential customers. Better late than never In the world of high-performance FPGAs, there are really two major players: Intel and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX). Intel is mainly using its own manufacturing technology to build future FPGA products, while Xilinx is likely to continue to tap TSMC. According to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, "history tells us that the FPGA vendor who is first to a manufacturing process node enjoys a market segment share advantage over the life of that node." Unfortunately for Intel, Xilinx began sampling FPGAs built on TSMC's 16-nanometer manufacturing technology back in the first quarter of this year. This puts Xilinx about a couple of quarters ahead of Intel when it comes to sampling an FPGA manufactured in a 14/16-nanometer technology. Based on "history," Xilinx looks poised to capture greater market share at the 14/16-nanometer manufacturing nodes than Intel.  A potential silver lining Although Xilinx was first to a 14/16-nanometer FPGA, it's worth pointing out that Intel claims that its 14-nanometer manufacturing technology is significantly ahead of TSMC's 16-nanometer technology, at least in terms of the density of its technology -- in other words, the number of transistors that can be packed into a given area. Image source: Intel. If Intel's 14-nanometer technology really delivers a significant benefit over TSMC's 16-nanometer technology, then perhaps the conventional thinking with respect to timing and ultimate market share might not hold in this case. Intel is sampling, but it's still a way off from mass shipments Generally speaking, there's a significant lead time between when a product begins sampling to customers and when final product is shipping in significant quantities to those customers. The delta between sampling and commercial, high-volume shipments can often be a year or even longer. I expect that based on the sampling timelines for both Intel and Xilinx, Xilinx will wind up shipping final 14/16-nanometer chips to customers first. However, if Stratix 10 winds up being a better solution, in terms of performance, power, and/or features, then Intel could very well be positioned to edge past Xilinx in terms of 14/16-nanometer FPGA share out in time.  Need to see better execution from Intel going forward A while back, now former Intel CFO Stacy Smith explained at an investor conference that the execution problems on Stratix 10 were due in no small part to Altera's "having some issues with current-generation products," requiring the chipmaker to divert resources from Stratix 10 to those other products. However, Smith made it clear that because Altera is now folded into Intel, the company will be better positioned to achieve improved time-to-market on future FPGA products manufactured on Intel technology. Investors will just have to wait and see how it all plays out over the next couple of years. But, at least for now, the first FPGA manufactured in Intel's 14-nanometer technology is finally alive and making its way into the hands of potential customers -- a reasonable start.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Gigabyte surrounds Kaby Lake CPUs with Brix by Zak Killian  2:07 PM on October 7, 2016 Now that the first Kaby Lake CPUs are out, everyone's got new versions of their toys to show off. Gigabyte is getting in on the fun by updating its popular Brix mini-PCs to the latest Intel processors. The company is debuting six new models based on three different Intel CPUs: the Core i3-7100U, Core i5-7200U, and Core i7-7500U. Each chip is getting a home in a corresponding pair of Brixes: one with room for a 2.5" storage device, and another, thinner version without. Besides the processor used and the presence (or lack) of the 2.5" bay, the new Brix machines are all identical. They come as barebones machines with two empty DDR4 SO-DIMM slots and an M.2 2280 slot. Right up front on the new Brixes are a pair of USB 3.1 ports: one Type-A and the other a Type-C. Those ports are powered by an Asmedia controller, so don't plug your Thunderbolt devices into these machines and expect them to work. A pair of USB 3.0 ports live on the back of the machine alongside an Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet jack. Another Intel chip delivers both 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. Gigabyte says the new Brixes can drive up to three displays, but doing so will require using displays that support DisplayPort chaining. Besides the mini-DP 1.2 connection, the little PCs can hook up to monitors and TVs using HDMI 2.0. The Kaby Lake chips in the new machines support hardware playback of 10-bit HEVC, so a display-mounted Brix (using the included VESA mount) could make for a neat little HTPC.

A Southwest Airlines jet was evacuated Oct. 5 in Louisville, Ky., after a Samsung Galaxy Note7 smartphone began smoking while the plane was still at a gate, potentially adding to Samsung's woes in connection with its recent Note7 global recall due to battery fires and explosions. The Louisville incident was revealed in an Oct. 5 report byNBC5 in Texas, which said the flight to Baltimore was evacuated when the fire was discovered. The airline's gate agents had already warned passengers about flying with Note7s that were turned on, the report said. The owner of the phone that began emitting smoke told the TV station that he was surprised when the incident unfolded in his pocket. In 2015, Yahoo allegedly developed a system that enables it to search all of its Yahoo Mail user accounts for information requested by the U.S. government, according to a Reuters report published on Oct. 4. Yahoo responded to media outlets requesting comment on the allegation with a terse one line comment: "Yahoo is a law-abiding company and complies with the laws of the United States." According to the report, Alex Stamos, Yahoo's former chief information security officer, left the job in June 2015 as a result of the company's compliance with the alleged U.S. government directive to enable email searches. Stamos had joined Yahoo in March 2014 and notably directly challenged National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers at a February 2015 event about security back doors for U.S. intelligence agencies in consumer software and services. Intel is turning to the cloud to make its consumer security capabilities more effective. The chip maker's security group this week unveiled enhancements to its McAfee AntiVirus Plus, Internet Security, Total Protection and LifeSafe software suite that aim to protect the growing number and variety of connected devices consumers are using as the internet of things ecosystem continues to grow. "People are enjoying more and more connected devices as part of everyday life—in their homes, in their cars and even in the things they wear," said John Giamatteo, corporate vice president and general manager at Intel Security. "This wave of new connectivity is exciting, and a reminder that security is more important than ever. We know our customers need solutions that protect their digital lives, particularly as connectivity continues to rise and threats continue to evolve," he added. Lenovo reportedly may buy Fujitsu's PC business, a move that would further expand Lenovo's lead position in the struggling global PC market while enabling Fujitsu to get the money-losing unit off its books.  Fujitsu officials, in a statement to The Wall Street Journal, said they "are considering various options for the PC unit, including a possible deal with Lenovo." Lenovo has declined to comment on the reports, which included the Nikkei business daily in Japan citing an unnamed source saying officials with the two companies are in talks with the hope of reaching a deal this month. The deal would move about 2,000 Fujitsu employees over to Lenovo, the Nikkei reported.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the sales of NAND flash chips to consumer electronics manufacturers for smartphones, tablets, audio players, and digital still cameras (DSCs) segments. The global mobile negative-AND (NAND) flash market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% during the forecast period. NAND flash is gaining more popularity over dynamic random access memory (DRAM) as it does not have to be powered continuously to retain data. Vendors are shifting their focus from the production of 2D NAND to 3D NAND, as the latter stores more bits of data per layer of memory cells and lowers the cost per gigabyte. The smartphone and tablet application segments are the two largest segments of the global mobile NAND flash market. NAND flash is ideal for portable devices due to its non-volatile feature and hence it is widely used in smartphones and tablets. The smartphone market is growing at a CAGR of 7.61% and the tablet market is growing at a CAGR of 8.32%, which provides an incentive for NAND flash vendors. Competitive vendor landscape The market is dominated by major vendors and the competition among vendors in the market is intense. As the entry barriers in the market are high, the entry of new players in the market is difficult. Many new suppliers are attracted to the market because of its high growth potential. The existing vendors in the market are investing heavily in R&D of new and innovative products. "Samsung produces 3D NAND flash by vertically stacking the memory cells instead of photolithography, which enables 3D NAND to provide more capacity and occupy less space. Micron Technology and Intel have jointly manufactured the high-density 3D NAND flash memory known as 3D XPoint," says Chetan Mohan, a lead embedded systems analyst from Technavio. Samsung is mass-producing 3D-NAND flash memory, and it has gradually increased its market share. Toshiba and SanDisk are also expected to increase supplies of NAND flash products during the forecast period. Intel is expected to start manufacturing 3D NAND flash products in Dalian, China, in the second half of 2016. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=53302 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Top six mobile NAND flash market vendors Intel The NAND flash business of Intel comes under the non-volatile memory solutions segment. The company's NAND flash memory products are manufactured by IM Flash Technologies and Micron Technology. In 2015, the company announced the launch of 3D XPoint technology, which is a type of non-volatile memory. The introduction of products like 3D NAND and 3D XPoint technology is helping companies to deliver solutions to customers in their data centers and Internet of Things businesses. The company has also increased its capital investment in new memory technologies. Micron Technology It manufactures and sells a full range of memory products such as DRAM, NAND flash, and not OR (NOR) flash memory for applications in computing, networking, consumer, industrial, automotive, embedded, and mobile products sectors. In the NAND flash memory segment, the company offers high-speed SLC, MLC, and TLC NAND flash products. These products are compatible with advanced interfaces. MLC products have two times the bit density of SLC products and TLC products have three times the bit density of SLC products. Samsung Electronics Samsung plans to strengthen its core business by focussing on segments such as memory chips, TVs, and mobile phones to develop premium products and strengthen technology leadership. In 2015, Samsung Electronics was the market leader of NAND flash memory, accounting for 32.57% of the total market. Its top ranking in the NAND memory market is supported by its superior technology. SanDisk SanDisk products include flash storage solutions for enterprise data centers and client computing platforms, and removable and embedded flash products for mobile devices, automotive, cameras, and connected home electronics. The products are reliable and affordable and are used as flash storage solutions by consumers and enterprises in a variety of devices and applications. SK Hynix SK Hynix produces memory semiconductors like DRAM and NAND flash, which are required for mobile devices, computers, and other IT devices. The demand for larger volumes of compact, high-capacity, and high-speed products such as TLC and 3D NAND flash has been increasing. Therefore, the company has been focusing on producing 16-nano MLC since 2014. The company has employed the cost reduction process through TLC and the 3D technology to increase its market share in the NAND flash market. Toshiba Toshiba has a strategic alliance with SanDisk for the production of NAND flash memory, which includes production joint ventures. Under this agreement, Toshiba is allowed to purchase SanDisk's ownership interests in the production joint ventures. Furthermore, Toshiba and SanDisk each provide a 50% guaranty in respect of the lease agreements of production facilities held by the production joint ventures. The aim of the joint venture is to strengthen the production of NAND flash memory.

While the modern Atom x5 processor combines features from Intel’s mainstream processors, such as hyperthreading and 3D transistors, benchmarks indicate weak processing capabilities.

For multi-tabbed browsing and other tasks expected of Windows users, 2 GB of RAM causes frequent stuttering during multitasking, disk wear, and other performance problems. On top of that, Windows takes up a whopping 20 GB of space on a hard drive — that leaves less than 12 GB of space free on a 32 GB drive. Unlike SATA and NVMe SSDs, eMMC modules just aren’t built for performance. While they’re mostly faster than regular Hard Disc Drives, they can perform worse (or about the same) in sequential writes with deep queue depths.

That’s because Intel insists that the Atom platform use no more than 4 GB of RAM. The majority of devices in this price segment could, in theory, perform at a much higher level with faster storage options and larger amounts of RAM. Unfortunately, that would cannibalize sales of Intel’s mainstream Core series processors. At present, the sort of devices available on the mini-PC market tend to look almost identical to one another — except the cooling system. In general, if you’re buying a fanless mini-PC, the cooling system is the most critical component. An efficient heatsink allows a Cherry Trail processor to maintain its performance for longer periods of time. On top of increased snappiness, a better cooling system can improve system durability. So within the $200 market, how many other mini-PCs compete with the Azulle Byte Plus? The best known is the ASRock Beebox, which offers a unit with similar specifications, and barebones options, at a higher price. A smaller competitor is the Kangaroo Moble Desktop Pro, which costs about the same as the Byte Plus and offers almost identical specs. Of the two, neither really rivals the cooling system of the Byte. However, the Beebox is user-serviceable. Performance A sane person wouldn’t use a mini-PC for complex rendering or video-editing projects. For the most part, users of the Byte Plus might find themselves web-browsing, visiting social media sites, streaming media, or even running wireless presentations. In all these roles, the Byte Plus functions in the same fashion as a $1,000 desktop computer. Provided the user stays within its performance confines, the Byte Plus makes a tantalizing value proposition on the grounds of its portability, reliable performance, and low cost. Computing Tasks: Social Media, Chat, Office, and Browsing The mini-PC’s performance — in real terms — for general computing feels fluid and snappy. Users can run virtually all Windows 10 applications without much stutter or lag, such as Skype or Microsoft Office. For web surfing, it won’t open a hundred tabs without being bogged down under the weight of advertisements and poorly crafted Javascript — but it will browse a few web pages at a time, without much issue. Even so, I would recommend that prospective buyers look very carefully at the 4 GB Byte Plus version rather than the 2 GB starter model. Media PC: Streaming Media, Gaming, and Playback The mini-PC excels as an HTPC or light gaming rig. Most mobile games, such as Minecraft and Asphalt 8, run great. It also streams 1080p media with ease and it plays 4K content without issue. As far as gaming goes, the Byte Plus handles all mobile games you could throw at it. Asphalt 8 on Extreme settings runs fluidly and with a maximum temperature of 73 degrees Celsius after several hours of continuous use. Minecraft runs just as smoothly — even so, don’t expect to play the latest non-mobile games on an Atom processor. Not that you would want to install the Steam client, with only around 12 GB of free storage capacity. On the downside, the Byte Plus doesn’t stream 4K media, although it streams 1080p. Part of the reason it may suffer problems streaming 4K stems from its single-stream Wi-Fi card, the Intel 3160. The 3160 hits about half the speed of a wireless-AC 2×2 card and is about as fast as a dual-band 802.11n card. That’s fast, but not blazing fast for internal network speeds or streaming 4K video. I couldn’t test the Byte Plus’s performance in 4K playback. However, the Cherry Trail processor inside of the Byte possesses more than enough horsepower. Power Consumption The Byte Plus, like most Cherry Trail-based systems-on-a-chip (what’s an SoC? Jargon Buster: The Guide to Understanding Mobile Processors Jargon Buster: The Guide to Understanding Mobile Processors In this guide, we'll cut through the jargon to explain what you need to know about smartphone processors. Read More ), offers extraordinary power efficiency. Not only does it sip energy, but it also drains a remarkable zero watts while turned off. Its power consumption compares favorably with even the European standard for energy consumption, which sets the bar at a half watt of power consumed while turned off. I believe that this has to do with some of Cherry Trail’s newly introduced power saving features, rather than any unique hardware customizations by Azulle. Here’re a few energy consumption readings that I took with a wattage meter How Much Power Is Your PC Using? How Much Power Is Your PC Using? Computer power consumption can be estimated. Most of the components inside a PC have specific minimum and maximum power draw figures and, because quality control is so tight, it’s rare of a part to break... Read More : Power consumption at load: 13–15 watts Power consumption while idle: 7–8 watts Power consumption while powered off: 0 watts What’s Missing in the Byte Plus? A strange omission concerning the Byte Plus is the lack of a USB Type-C port (what’s USB Type-C? What Is USB Type-C? What Is USB Type-C? Ah, the USB plug. It is as ubiquitous now as it is notorious for never being able to be plugged in right the first time. Read More ). At present, few desktop computers include the technology. Even so, USB-C would have given the Byte Plus an added degree of future-proofing. I’m not sure why Azulle chose to leave it out. Another feature lacking in the Byte Plus is user-serviceability. There doesn’t appear to be any means of dismantling the device or replacing parts. Compounding issues, users can access the BIOS (what’s a BIOS? Why Does My Motherboard Have A Battery? Why Does My Motherboard Have A Battery? Whether you’re using a desktop computer or a laptop, your computer’s motherboard contains an integrated battery. Unlike a standard laptop battery, the motherboard’s battery doesn’t power your computer while you're using it. Quite the opposite,... Read More ), which means the system can be rendered unbootable through accidental misconfiguration. If that happens, there’s no method of resetting the BIOS, which translates into a hard brick (that means a broken device). However, these problems aren’t deal-breaking in the slightest. Overall, the Azulle Byte Plus offers few vices and a lot of virtues. Should You Buy the Azulle Byte Plus? At around $200 the Azulle Byte Plus compares on equal footing to many of its small form factor competitors. In its niche, the Byte excels within several roles for two reasons. First, it can deliver unthrottled performance for a longer period than any stick PC with similar specifications. Second, it includes more ports, ethernet capabilities, and versatility than its competitors, which make it useful in a range of roles. For most users, it’s one of the best Cherry Trail mini-PCs around. Byte Plus (Fanless Windows 10 Mini Desktop PC - Intel CherryTrail T3 Z8300 Quad-Core, 1.44 GHz (up to 1.84 GHz) 4GB RAM+32GB storage) Byte Plus (Fanless Windows 10 Mini Desktop PC - Intel CherryTrail T3 Z8300 Quad-Core, 1.44 GHz (up to 1.84 GHz) 4GB RAM+32GB storage) Azulle's byte plus can be purchased either with a Windows 10 or Linux operating system. It's compact size, allows you to neatly tuck away the byte plus and keep your desk area neat. Buy Now At Amazon $189.99 If you need Windows 10 and a small, efficient PC, then Azulle’s device should satisfy your needs. On the other hand, it packs in similar specifications as a Chromebook, at the same price — and a Chromebook can fulfill most of the things that the Byte Plus can. Our verdict of the Azulle Byte Plus: Buy it if you need a mini-PC with Windows 10. Otherwise, you might be better off with a Chromebook.810 Previous PostiLife X5 Robot Vacuum Review and GiveawayNext PostPokémon GO Plus Review 6 comments Write a Comment Paul Rhodes October 17, 2016 at 1:35 am The small computer is Ideal for people who do not have a lot of room , helping to keep in touch with the world.

You’d normally expect copycats to appear, but they’ve been slow. Only HP’s Spectre might be targeted with that accusation – and now, Asus’ Zenbook 3. Asus’ hasn’t just copied Apple’s plan. Instead, the company has improved it. Though thinner than the MacBook, the Zenbook 3 offers 7th-generation Intel Core processors of the Core i5 and Core i7 line. It also can be equipped with more memory. We think the Zenbook 3 looks better than the MacBook, which is comparatively plain. Our review unit, the high-end model with Core i7, 16GB of memory and a 512GB solid state drive, retails for $1,600. The entry-level model with Core i5, and half the RAM and hard drive space, is $1,100. Surprisingly, only the latter pair undercuts the MacBook. The flagship review unit we tested exactly matches the price of Apple’s most expensive MacBook. It’s also more expensive than a similar HP Spectre. Clearly, Asus thinks it has a winner here, and doesn’t plan to use price as a crutch. But does the Zenbook 3 have what it takes to be the most super of the super-thin laptops? Blue and gold Reactions were mixed when we unboxed the Zenbook 3. Some of our staff found it beautiful, but others were disappointed by the similarities to the MacBook. The two do indeed look very similar, though to be fair, there’s only so many ways to make a 12.5-inch that’s just .47 inches thick look unique. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Zenbook fans will be happy to know the company’s popular “hairline spun concentric metal circle pattern” is present. It looks better than it sounds, providing a subtle etching to the lid that’s more alluring than a matte finish. It’s perhaps too subtle, though, as many didn’t seem to notice it until it was pointed out. Deeper etching might’ve helped to ward off accusations that Asus is playing the copycat. Related: Lenovo Ideapad 710S review Our review unit was also handsomely tailored in blue-and-gold, a look that’s distinctive but not garish. Copycat or no, we think the Zenbook 3 looks better than both the MacBook, which is comparatively plain, and the HP Spectre, which is so extravagant it borders on tacky. One port wonder The Zenbook 3 has a USB 3.1 Type-C port and a headphone jack. Its four speakers surprised us with strong, loud audio. Yep, that’s it. Unlike the HP Spectre, which at least offered two additional Type-C ports, the Zenbook 3 forces you to get by with one, just like the MacBook. That means you’d better like dongles. The simplicity of a single port has its allure. And we like that it makes charging the device easier, since users are no longer tied to a proprietary charging jack. Still, it’s hard to see this as anything but a negative. You can get by with one port, but it will inconvenience you sooner or later. The touchpad forgives the keyboard HP Spectre set the bar for keyboard quality in a thin-and-light when it appeared in July, thanks to reasonable key travel and a spacious layout. The Zenbook 3 tries to keep up to HP’s standard with a chiclet design that offers a .8 millimeter keystroke, but it falls short. The problem’s not key travel, but rather feel. Each stroke ends abruptly, which leads to a typing-on-wood sensation. It’s not as bad as with the MacBook, and we did eventually get used to it, but picky typists won’t be satisfied. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Backlighting is standard, and it looks slick. There’s three levels of lighting available, and the LEDs light most keys evenly. Light leak is minimal, peaking out only behind a few function row keys. And the color of our blue-on-gold unit’s backlighting was gold, rather than the typical white. That’s a nice touch. Speaking of touch — the touchpad is awesome. It’s large, and offers a glass surface that rivals Apple’s much-lauded smoothness. Multi-touch gestures work brilliantly, which helps the Zenbook 3 make full use of new gestures (like the three-finger Cortana tap) recently introduced to Windows 10. Only 1080p, but that’s okay Resolution is one area where the Zenbook 3 doesn’t live up to the MacBook, or some competitors. It has a 1080p display – just like HP’s Spectre. Battery life is likely the main reason. Higher display resolutions draw more power. Still, the display’s 176 pixels per inch is respectable, if not quite up to “Retina” levels of sharpness. The difference in quality relative to more pixel-dense displays is hard to notice at a glance, though closer examination challenges that. Luckily, the display excels in metrics aside from resolution. Its maximum brightness of 358 lux is solid, and leads to an overall maximum contrast ratio of 900:1. That beats the HP Spectre, which hit a contrast ratio of 760:1. We weren’t able to measure the MacBook because our test software was only compatible with Windows (at the time). The Zenbook 3’s average color error came in at 3.58. In this metric a lower number is better. The HP Spectre has the Asus beat with its excellent color error of only 1.58. The Zenbook 3 does will in color gamut tests, though, displaying 76 percent of the AdobeRGB standard. That’s slightly better than the Spectre, which hit a mediocre 71 percent. Put simply, the Spectre displays color more accurately, but the Zenbook 3 can display more colors. All these numbers add up to a display that’s good, if not great. Blue and red hues looked tepid to our eyes, but the sharp look and solid contrast ratio made up for that problem with crisp, vibrant reproduction of photos and video. Audio performance This is a thin laptop, so we didn’t expect much from the speakers. The Zenbook 3’s endurance competes well in its class.   We were very, very surprised. The Zenbook 3’s four speakers – two at the front edge, and two near the display – are excellent. They face towards the user, which bolsters their modest output, and do an excellent job of resisting distortion. Surprisingly, they even produced a tinny version of bass. It won’t be great for dubstep enthusiasts, but it’s way better than expected. Processor performance Our top-shelf Asus Zenbook 3 came with Intel’s Core i7-7500U, part of the latest processor generation. Despite the size of this laptop, the i7-7500U is a full-fat, dual-core chip, with a thermal design power of 15 watts. It’s the same as you’d find in much thicker laptops. As you can see, the new Core i7-7500U is fast. Very fast. It’s a bit surprising, given that Intel made extremely modest claims about the processor’s capabilities. Here we see the Zenbook 3 easily defeating even HP’s Spectre, which we reviewed with a Core i7-6500U. The most impressive result is Handbrake, where the Zenbook 3 defeats the Spectre by cranking through a 4K video file encode 15 percent more quickly. In fact, the Zenbook 3 is the fastest dual-core notebook we’ve reviewed since the Sony Vaio Flip Z, and in the top three mobile dual-core laptops we’ve ever reviewed. We weren’t able to include the MacBook in these results due to differences in our test suite between now and then. However, public results from Geekbench 3 show the MacBook (2016) earning hitting a single-core score of 2,995, and a multi-core score of 5,705. The Zenbook 3 has a definite edge over that, especially in the multi-core test. Hard drive performance A Toshiba solid state drive lurked inside our Zenbook 3. Its presence isn’t a shocker, but we’ve seen an endless parade of Samsung drives as of late. It’s nice to have some variety. And, as it turns out, the Toshiba drive is a performer. The HP Spectre is again the main competitor. Compared to it, the Zenbook 3 is slower in read speeds, but faster in write speed. That means opening large files may be faster on the Spectre, but saving large files may work better on the Asus. Realistically, though, both machines achieve fantastic scores. Programs load in the blink of an eye, and files transfer as quickly as on any PC available today. Storage performance is not a bottleneck with either system. Graphics performance Though Intel did update its Core line to the 7th-generation, the company did not revise the Intel HD Graphics component found on-board. The Intel HD 620 on the Zenbook 3 should perform similarly to last generation’s Intel HD 520. In fact, in our testing, it proved rather slow. And so we find this slim system’s one performance blemish. It’s no good for gaming. The Fire Strike score of 620 is among the lowest we’ve seen from a high-end notebook, dipping noticeably below even other systems powered by Intel HD graphics. We’re doubtful that this represents a problem with Intel HD 620 itself. Instead, we think the Zenbook 3 is throttling based on heat generated by intense gaming. That seems the likely explanation, because gaming performance over time was often unreliable. Related: HP Spectre review The poor 3D Mark score was backed up by real-world gaming. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive averaged only 52 frames per second at 1080p resolution with all detail settings at low, AA turned off, and texture filtering at bilinear. Turning detail up to high dropped the framerate to an unplayable average of 16 frames per second. Asus Zenbook 3 UX390UA Compared To Microsoft Surface Book with… Acer Swift 7 SF713-51-M90J Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Dell Precision 15 3510 Lenovo Ideapad 710S HP Spectre Acer Aspire S 13 S5-371-52JR Samsung Notebook 9 900X5L-K02 Dell XPS 13 (Skylake) Dell Latitude 12 LG Gram 15 Z960 Samsung Notebook 9 Pro… Asus Zenbook UX501VW-DS71T Toshiba Satellite Radius 12… Dell Inspiron 15 7000 (Late 2015) The battery won’t last forever, but it’s good enough Small laptops, like small phones, continue to have a troubled relationship with battery life. There’s no replacement for capacity, and reducing size means less room for precious watt-hours. The Zenbook 3 is no exception. Its 40 watt-hour unit is respectable, but quite far behind systems like the Dell XPS 13, which fits a 60 watt-hour battery in its latest version. Still, the Zenbook 3’s battery is almost the same size as the MacBook, and a tad bigger than the HP Spectre’s 38 watt-hour unit. Still, the Zenbook 3’s battery life is respectable. It lasted six hours and 51 minutes in our web browsing macro loop, which simulates browsing by loading pages frequently, with pauses in between. That’s over an hour better than the HP Spectre, which lasted five hours and 28 minutes. It’s way better than the Razer Blade Stealth. That laptop’s 4K display drug it down to three and a half hours. Our video loop, which replay a 1080p clip until the battery dies, extended endurance a hair past 10 hours. That’s great, and again better than the Zenbook 3’s PC competition. Testing we conducted on the MacBook isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison with the Zenbook 3. However, we think users will find the battery life roughly equivalent. Apple claims 10 hours of life for the MacBook, but as we noted in our review, that seemed a charitable figure. Power users may be annoyed by the Zenbook 3’s inability to last for eight hours of web browsing. The fact remains that if you want that, you need to buy a bigger laptop with a bigger battery. Still, Asus’ slim system competes well in its class. It gets hot! Placing a Core i7 processor in a laptop less than an inch thick inevitably leads to heat. At idle, the Zenbook 3 hits 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s hotter than just about every notebook we’ve tested this year. Under load, external temperatures can hit an uncomfortable 117.6 degrees. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The heat is concentrated in a specific spot on the upper-right of the keyboard, which reduces the problem. Other areas can be up to twenty degrees cooler. Still, you’re going to get sweaty palms if you use the Zenbook 3 under heavy load. Fan noise is noticeable, but not overly loud. The ideal peak was 42.8 decibels, which increased slightly to 44.6 decibels at load. The HP Spectre and Acer Aspire S 13 were quieter by a couple decibels while other thin laptops, like the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga, were a couple decibels louder. Warranty Asus’ ships the Zenbook 3 with the usual one-year warranty. Though it’s always disappointing to see that on an expensive piece of hardware, the competition does no better. Our take The Asus Zenbook 3 was a long time coming. We first heard of it all the way back at Computex, held in early June. We heard of it again at IFA, held in early September. A long tease builds up anticipation, and heightens expectations. Fortunately, the Zenbook 3 meets them – and it’s perhaps the best example yet of a PC maker beating Apple at its own game. The DT Accessory Pack Timbuk2 Command Laptop Messenger Bag $86.00 Logitech M510 Wireless Mouse $19.95 SAVFY 12 - 12.9 Inch Sleeve Cover $17.99 What are the alternatives? Many will be considering the Zenbook 3 next to the HP Spectre, which was released in June, and hasn’t been updated to the 7th-generation Core (yet). That puts HP at a disadvantage. The Spectre is slick, but it’s slower, and doesn’t last as long on a charge. The keyboard is better, but the touchpad isn’t, and the displays are about equivalent. The Spectre also goes with USB Type-C, but it has two additional ports. There’s no denying Asus’ aesthetic similarities to the Apple MacBook released a year ago, from the design of the speaker grill, to the profile of the chassis (if you want to see how it could be more unique, check out HP’s Spectre). But the Zenbook 3 is faster, with better speakers and a better keyboard. It’s also slightly less expensive if you go with the base model. Still, the Zenbook 3’s price is intimidating. Our review unit’s $1,600 price tag is, well, a lot of money. Buyers can pick up similar performance and capability at a lower price by choosing a thicker laptop, like our twin favorites – the Dell XPS 13, and Asus Zenbook UX305UA. How long will it last? This laptop should hold up well over time. It’s solid, relatively simple, and has a strong battery. The lack of ports will become less of an issue as the years roll by, and the hardware isn’t going to feel taxed anytime soon. Should you buy it? Yes. The Zenbook 3 is expensive. You can buy a laptop that’s as quick, for less. But that’s not the point. Super-thin laptops like the HP Spectre, MacBook, and Zenbook 3 promise to offer everything a laptop normally does in a case nearly as thin as your smartphone. Asus’ flagship lives up to that promise better than any laptop before it.

ALSO READ Global device shipment to dip second year in a row: Gartner Gartner Says Worldwide Server Revenue Declined 0.8 Percent in the Second Quarter of 2016, While Shipments Increased 2 Percent Worldwide PC shipments declines 5.2% in Q2 of 2016: Gartner Global device shipments continue to decline: Report PC shipments decline globally in Q1 of 2016: Gartner Mobile Phone Shipments Will Fall 1.6 Percent in 2016, but Will Return to Growth in 2017Gartner, Inc. said worldwide combined shipments for devices (PCs, tablets, ultramobiles and mobile phones) are expected to decline 3 percent in 2016 (See Table 1). This will mark the second consecutive year of decline. The global devices market fell by 0.75 percent in 2015. "The global devices market is not on pace to return to single-digit growth soon," said Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner. Growth is on pace to remain flat during the next five years. All segments are expected to decline in 2016, except for premium ultramobiles and utility mobile phones (entry level phones), which are expected to show single-digit growth this year. "We expect premium ultramobiles will start benefiting from the collective performance and integration of the latest Intel CPU platform and Windows 10," added Mr. Atwal. Table 1. Worldwide Devices Shipments by Device Type, 2015-2018 (Millions of Units) Device Type 2015 2016 2017 2018Traditional PCs (Desk-Based and Notebook) 244 216 205 199Ultramobiles (Premium) 44 49 61 75PC Market 288 265 266 274Ultramobiles (Basic and Utility) 196 177 173 173Computing Devices Market 484 442 439 447Mobile Phones 1,917 1,887 1,910 1,933Total Devices Market 2,401 2,329 2,349 2,380 Note: The Ultramobile (Premium) category includes devices such as Microsoft's Windows 10 Intel x86 products and Apple's MacBook Air. The Ultramobile (Basic and Utility Tablets) category includes devices such as, iPad, iPad mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, Amazon Fire HD, Lenovo Yoga Tab 3, Acer Iconia One Source: Gartner (October 2016) PC Market to Bottom Out in 2016 and PC Prices in the UK to Increase Less Than 10 Percent in 2017 The PC market is expected to exhibit an 8 per cent decline in 2016, as the installed base bottoms out and replacement cycle extensions halt. "The effect of currency depreciation on the market is diminishing," added Mr. Atwal. "The second quarter of 2016 was the first since the second quarter of 2015 least impacted by currency depreciation." Regions such as Western Europe, where the Euro depreciated significantly in 2015 and PC prices increased, finally showed flat market growth (-0.9 percent) in the second quarter of 2016. This follows four consecutive quarters of decline. If this situation prevails it means that PC sales will bottom out in 2016. However, the PC market in Western Europe remains difficult following the Brexit vote. "Device vendors are mitigating the currency depreciation of the pound in two ways first, they are taking advantage of the likelihood of a single-digit decline in PC component costs in 2016," said Mr. Atwal. "Second, they will "de-feature" their PCs to keep prices down. With these changes, Gartner expects PC prices in the UK to increase by less than 10 percent in 2017." For the PC market to stay on pace for flat growth in 2017, business spending needs to flourish. "The inventory of Windows 8 PCs should have been cleared, and large businesses in mature markets are now looking to move to Windows 10 through 2018," added Mr. Atwal. "In addition, more affordable hardware and increasingly available virtual reality content (such as games, stories and other entertainment) will enable consumer PC buyers to upgrade in order to experience immersive offerings. Smartphone Growth to Continue Slowing Down in 2016 Total mobile phone shipments are on pace to decline 1.6 percent in 2016. The smartphone segment continues to grow, albeit more slowly than in previous years, and is expected to reach 1.5 billion units in 2016. "This is no surprise; the smartphone market is maturing, and reaching global saturation with phones that are increasingly capable and remain good enough for longer," said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner. In 2016, the Android market will continue to be bolstered by Chinese vendors offering more affordable premium devices. Despite the availability of the iPhone 7, Gartner expects a weaker year-over-year volume performance from Apple in 2016, as volumes stabilize after a very strong 2015. As a result, Gartner expects total smartphone market to only increase 4.5 percent with premium smartphones declining 1.1 percent in 2016. "We expect the market for premium smartphones to return to 3.5 per cent growth in 2017, as stronger replacement cycles kick in and in anticipation of a new iPhone next year, which is expected to offer a new design and new features that are attractive enough to convince more replacement buyers," said Ms. Cozza.

"The effect of currency depreciation on the market is diminishing," added Mr. Atwal. "The second quarter of 2016 was the first since the second quarter of 2015 least impacted by currency depreciation." Regions such as Western Europe, where the Euro depreciated significantly in 2015 and PC prices increased, finally showed flat market growth (-0.9 percent) in the second quarter of 2016. This follows four consecutive quarters of decline. If this situation prevails it means that PC sales will bottom out in 2016. However, the PC market in Western Europe remains difficult following the Brexit vote. "Device vendors are mitigating the currency depreciation of the pound in two ways first, they are taking advantage of the likelihood of a single-digit decline in PC component costs in 2016," said Mr. Atwal. "Second, they will "de-feature" their PCs to keep prices down. With these changes, Gartner expects PC prices in the UK to increase by less than 10 percent in 2017." For the PC market to stay on pace for flat growth in 2017, business spending needs to flourish. "The inventory of Windows 8 PCs should have been cleared, and large businesses in mature markets are now looking to move to Windows 10 through 2018," added Mr. Atwal. "In addition, more affordable hardware and increasingly available virtual reality content (such as games, stories and other entertainment) will enable consumer PC buyers to upgrade in order to experience immersive offerings. Smartphone Growth to Continue Slowing Down in 2016 Total mobile phone shipments are on pace to decline 1.6 percent in 2016. The smartphone segment continues to grow, albeit more slowly than in previous years, and is expected to reach 1.5 billion units in 2016. "This is no surprise; the smartphone market is maturing, and reaching global saturation with phones that are increasingly capable and remain good enough for longer," said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner. In 2016, the Android market will continue to be bolstered by Chinese vendors offering more affordable premium devices. Despite the availability of the iPhone 7, Gartner expects a weaker year-over-year volume performance from Apple in 2016, as volumes stabilize after a very strong 2015. As a result, Gartner expects total smartphone market to only increase 4.5 percent with premium smartphones declining 1.1 percent in 2016. "We expect the market for premium smartphones to return to 3.5 per cent growth in 2017, as stronger replacement cycles kick in and in anticipation of a new iPhone next year, which is expected to offer a new design and new features that are attractive enough to convince more replacement buyers," said Ms. Cozza.

Roston - Oct 7, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Gigabyte has a new array of “Brix” miniature PCs that sport Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, giving consumers a very-small-form-factor way to use the hardware. These Brix units are, as the name suggests, shaped relatively like bricks and they’re not much larger at only 4.7″ x 4.4″ x 1.4-inches (starting size). Consumers can choose from the latest Intel Core i3, i5, and i7 processors. It appears Gigabyte is offering these desktops as barebones systems, meaning they come with certain hardware — like the processor — but leave the rest up to you. With the GB-BKi3HA-7100 model, there’s support for 2.5-inch SSD/HDD storage drives, a pair of SO-DIMM DDR4 slots, and a single M.2 SSD 2280 slot. As far as other hardware is concerned, there’s an Intel IEEE 802.11ac dual-band WiFi card wth Bluetooth 4.2 and Intel HD Graphics 620. These are joined by a pair of USB 3.0 ports and a pair of USB 3.1 ports (aka, USB Type-C). There’s also HDMI 2.0 for video-out and HDMI with Mini DisplayPort, thusly support for dual-display setups. Finally, the new Brix mini computers include Intel Gigabit lan, a combination microphone and headphone jack, and a VESA mounting bracket for mounting purposes. Gigabyte’s website does not list device availability or pricing at this time.

Performance-Boosting HiZ Support Lands For Intel's Mesa Vulkan Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 7 October 2016 at 04:13 PM EDT. 1 Comment Intel's "ANV" Mesa Vulkan Linux driver now has basic support for HiZ, an important performance feature. A while back I wrote about Intel Vulkan driver HiZ patches that were on the mailing list while today they were merged into Mesa Git -- in time for next week's feature freeze for the next Mesa mailing list. So far Hierarchical-Z is only implemented for basic cases, but in those basic triangle-type Vulkan demos there is about a 15% performance boost and around a 30% performance boost for the demos making use of fast depth clears. For now the HiZ ANV Vulkan implementation probably won't translate into any real performance gains for Linux's current Vulkan games: Dota 2 and The Talos Princple, but nevertheless great to see the basic support hitting Git. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Wacom MobileStudio Pro is for you, then. Coming this November, these lightweight, mobile, pen-equipped computers are available in two sizes, one with a 13.3-inch display and the other with a 15.6-inch display. Of the new product, Ed Neumann, Senior Vice President of Wacom's Creative Branded Business says, "Unlike most general-purpose mobile tablets created for the mass market, Wacom's MobileStudio Pro was designed specifically for the needs of the creative professional and how they work...[MobileStudio Pro] provides the best, most natural and precise creative experience imaginable." The computers are available in a wide variety of configurations, but they all run Windows 10 and utilize the new Wacom Pro Pen 2. Regarding the Pro Pen 2, itself, it offers a wealth of performance improvements over previous Wacom pens. It is four times more pressure sensitive and accurate than the original Pro Pen, has "virtually no lag," offers natural tilt support, no parallax and doesn't require batteries or recharging. There are four MobileStudio Pro 13 models and two Pro 16 models. In the 13.3-inch models, two utilize Intel i5 processors while the other two come with i7 processors. All four 13-inch computers come with Intel Iris 550 graphics processing units (GPUs). All four have WQHD (2560 x 1440) resolution displays that offer 150cd/m2 brightness and can display 96% of the Adobe RGB color gamut. They include UHS-II Micro SD slots and a trio of USB-C ports. Full pricing is not yet available, but the 13-inch models start at around US$1,400 (4GB of RAM and 64GB solid state drive (SSD) storage). The 13-inch model can be upgraded to include 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. As mentioned above, there are two 15.6-inch MobileStudio Pro models, as well. One comes with an i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD and an NVidia Quadro M600M GPU with 2GB of VRAM. The Intel i7-powered top-end model costs just under US$3,000 and has 16GB of RAM, 512GB of SSD storage and an NVidia M1000M GPU that has 4GB of VRAM. The 15.6-inch display has 4K UHD resolution (3840 x 2160) and displays 94% of the Adobe RGB color gamut, which is slightly less than its smaller sibling, but it does have a 1000:1 contrast ratio versus the 800:1 contrast found in the MobileStudio Pro 13 models. All of the 13-inch and 15-inch models have a 5-megapixel front camera and 8-megapixel rear camera, but the premium 15.6-inch computer has an Intel RealSense R200 3D scanning camera, letting you scan real-world objects into 3D modeling software.   Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 There are a variety of accessories available for the Wacom MobileStudio Pro as well, including a wireless keyboard and mobile stand, which lets users switch between three different drawing angles. There is also a Wacom Link available. When connected to a compatible Mac or PC, you can use the MobileStudio Pro as a standard Cintiq tablet.

Now, Microsoft hopes it can do the same for desktop PCs. The firm is rumoured to be putting the finishing touches to an all in one desktop PC - and today sent out invites for an event in New York on the 26th October where it is expected to be unveiled.  Scroll down for video  Microsoft's Surface brand could soon be extended to an all in one desktop PC codenamed Cardinal.

Share this article Share 66 shares The device is expected to be unveiled at an also rumoured late October event where the firm's tablets could also get an upgrade. Microsoft also recently revealed it will launch a mixed reality version of Windows next year. The move will bring a 3D holographic version of the platform to Windows 10 users who own a virtual reality headset. Announcing its plans at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco yesterday, Microsoft said user interface will be available to run on mainstream PCs.  Lenovo already makes a 27inch tablet/PC hybrid, called to Yoga 900 HOW WILL IT WORK?  According to Microsoft, the Holographic shell UI for Windows 10 will enable users to put on a headset to navigate their Windows desktop. It will mix 2D apps such as email and calendars - which could be overlaid onto surfaces with augmented reality - with fully immersive 3D apps, such as a virtual reality tour of a location. The exact look and feel will be dependent on the headset used - where an Oculus Rift style VR headset being fully immersive, while a Holoens style headset enabling AR and mixed reality. Users will be able to select applications using a point and click selector, like a Wii controller.  The new Holographic shell desktop UI will enable users to run Windows 10 through a VR headset hooked up to a standard PC, opening up the experience beyond those with high end gaming machines.  Writing in a blog post, Microsoft's executive vice president for Windows, Terry Myerson, said: 'Next year, we will be releasing an update to Windows 10, which will enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications. 'The Windows Holographic shell enables an entirely new experience for multi-tasking in mixed reality, blending 2D and 3D apps at the same time, while supporting a broad range of 6 degrees of freedom devices.' Microsoft is working with chip-maker Intel on a specification for mixed reality PCs and head mounted displays, in an effort to open up the market and its platform. Microsoft has announced it will launch a new Holographic shell desktop UI for Windows 10, which will enable users to run Windows through a VR headset hooked up to a standard PC A video demonstrates how the interface will look running at 90 frames per second, triple that of most HD televisions. It shows a woman wearing a headset running a mix of 2D and 3D apps as she checks email, books flights, navigates a diary and takes a virtual tour (pictured) 'Our shared goal is to enable our hardware partners to build a broad range of devices for the mainstream consumer and business markets,' wrote Myerson. A promotional video demonstrates how the interface will look, running at 90 frames per second, triple that of most HD televisions. It shows a woman wearing a headset in a virtual room running a mix of 2D and 3D apps as she checks email, books flights, navigates a diary and takes a virtual tour of the Pantheon in Rome. The virtual dog in Windows holographic shell UI bears a close resemblance to Rover, the assistant character which made appearances in earlier Microsoft software Veteran Windows users will also notice the similarity between the virtual dog and Rover, an assistant character in Microsoft's less than successful Bob software and who later made an appearance in Windows XP. According to Microsoft, using a 'six degrees of freedom' headset, the interface can be manipulated using a point and click Wii-type controller. The headset in the video is unbranded (still pictured) but it could well be the Washington tech giant's mixed reality Hololens, or Facebook's Oculus Rift The headset in the video is unbranded but it could well be the Washington tech giant's mixed reality Hololens, or Facebook's Oculus Rift – which is set to launch in the UK next month – and which runs on Windows 10 devices.  While Hololens began shipping to developers in March at $3,000 a piece, but it remains unclear when a consumer version of the headsets could launch. OCULUS RIFT GETS AN OFFICIAL UK LAUNCH DATE The Oculus RIft has been the most talked about tech for years, with the first developers kits sent out in 2012. The latest official news is that the kit will launch in the UK, Europe and Canada on 20 September, with a price tag of £549 or €699. It's already available in the US priced at $599.  A number of outlets are already taking orders for the headset, including John Lewis, Amazon and Game, and the kit will come with platform game Lucky's Tale, along with hundreds of videos and VR movies.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

For example, connect it to the Productivity Module and you immediately get more battery time. The tablet itself has a built-in battery with a usage time of up to 10 hours and the Productivity Module increases the battery life by up to five more. Add the Presenter Module and it evolves into a pico projector with an HDMI port. The pico projector is really fun to use and allows you to present your work on a big screen or play HD movies on the tablet and display the pictures on a huge screen. The projector module is capable of showing a 60-inch display at a distance of two metres from the projector screen. The HDMI port has two switchable functions – HDMI-in and HDMI-out. You can use the HDMI-out function to play HD movies on the tablet while watching them on a large screen LED TV. Or you can use the X1 Tablet’s screen as a display for other devices such as a 4K video camera with HDMI output. Used as a tablet, the ThinkPad X1 is powerful. Several versions of the X1 Tablet are available and vary according to the CPU, memory and storage configurations. The one I tested was powered by the Intel Core m-5-6Y57 CPU running at 1.10 GHz and equipped with 8 gigabytes of DD3 RAM or working memory. It uses Samsung 512GB SSD as internal storage. And the tablet runs on Windows 10 Pro. The tablet comes with a large, bright and sharp display – a 12-inch IPS touch panel with 2160x1440-pixel resolutions in 3:2 ratio. The ThinkPad X1 is skinny too, boasting a footprint of just 291x209.5x8.4mm and a weight of 770 grammes. When used with a provided keyboard, which folds out as a front cover, the thickness increased by 5.2mm and 30g are added to the weight. The keyboard is really useful as it turns the tablet into a laptop computer. The full size ThinkPad keyboard with the iconic TrackPoint has three adjustable typing angles and recreates the classic ThinkPad keystroke feel. The keyboard can be easily snapped into place with a magnetic connection. The tablet has a built-in stand at its back so that you can position the computer in a position that’s comfortable for typing. Moreover, while the tablet is connected to the keyboard, you can simply fold it to the back of the tablet and the X1 will ask you whether to change its mode to a tablet mode so that the keyboard can stop functioning. The process reverses when you move the keyboard to the front. The X1 Tablet is suitable for an executive on the go thanks to a nano SIM slot that supports LTE 4G connection. This allows you to work on your projects on the move without having to look for Wi-Fi hotspots. The X1 Tablet is also business-ready because it comes with security features like Touch-Sensor fingerprint reader and remote manageability features like Intel vPro and Active Management Technology. The tablet has one full-size USB 3.0 port, a USB Type-C port for recharging its battery, a Mini Display Port, and headphone jack. Its nano SIM slot and microSD slot are located at the back behind the stand. The X1 Tablet uses the Intel 8260AC adapter to provide Wi-Fi 802.11 connection. I had no problem connecting it to my Linksys WRT1200AC router for fast Internet connection. During the test, I found that the X1 Tablet had good performance. Business applications ran fast and smoothly. Video clips also played smoothly. The tablet started up and shut down in a snap. I encountered no difficulties mounting the Productivity and Presenter Modules. The projected images looked sharp and clear on my wall during the test. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet has a starting price of Bt60,000, depending on configurations. The expandable modules have to be pre-ordered and the prices will vary according to the number of ordered units.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Oct 08, 2016 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Qualcomm reportedly sees progress on NXP agreement COUNTING ITS CHIPS:Two issues appear to be holding up a deal — a gap of less than 10 percent on the price and whether the deal would be all cash or cash and stock Bloomberg Qualcomm Inc is the only company in talks to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV and is making progress toward an agreement with the Dutch chipmaker on a fair price, people with knowledge of the matter said. There is currently a valuation gap of less than 10 percent between Qualcomm and NXP as they discuss a possible transaction, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Qualcomm is considering a deal structure of 75 percent cash and 25 percent stock, one of the people said. NXP would prefer all cash, another person said. Qualcomm, based in San Diego, California, is still considering its options and talks with NXP are in early stages, they said. NXP, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, is pushing for a price of about US$120 per share, while Qualcomm is targeting a price closer to US$110 per share, the people said. The sides are closing that gap, signaling both parties are interested in reaching an agreement, the people said. NXP closed at US$102.50 a share on Wednesday in New York, giving it a market value of about US$35 billion. The company is working with Qatalyst Partners to find a buyer, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last week. The list of chip companies that could afford to even think about buying NXP is short. Only seven members of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index are larger by market value. Of those, two are in completely different areas of the chip industry and another two, Intel Corp and Broadcom Ltd, are in the middle of digesting record purchases. Of the remainder, Qualcomm has by far has the most cash, with US$31 billion. Companies including Intel and Texas Instruments Inc looked and decided against pursuing NXP, the people said. Representatives for Qualcomm, NXP, Intel and Texas Instruments declined to comment. Qualcomm, with a market capitalization of about US$98 billion, is weighing a bid for NXP against about four other acquisition options, two of the people said. The company has been studying potential targets for at least six months, the people said, as it seeks to strengthen its position in a consolidating market and as shareholders want the largest maker of chips for mobile phones to put its cash to work. If Qualcomm and NXP are able to reach a deal, it would be the largest technology acquisition of the year. GADFLY’S ANALYSIS NXP’s preference for cash is understandable, especially given the recent performance of Qualcomm’s stock. Over the plast five years, shares of the US$100 billion company have seen only a quarter of the gains enjoyed by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. Qualcomm’s stock has climbed about 6.5 percent since reports of its talks with NXP surfaced last week. It is rare to see an acquirer climb by that much, especially when a deal is so large and would involve a strategic shift (NXP is the largest maker of chips for cars, whereas Qualcomm focuses on smartphones). However, this transaction is just so accretive. Qualcomm is also sitting on about US$31 billion in cash and equivalents, a large part of which is trapped overseas. NXP’s Netherlands home base would allow it to put that money to work. At US$115 a share, a 40 percent premium to NXP’s unaffected price, a deal would easily add to Qualcomm’s earnings even before synergies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

AMD and NVIDIA both had their driver teams working up until the very last minute to ensure they got as many performance tweaks and bug fixes into their day-1 drivers.  Gears of War 4 is an interesting game title in the sense that it must be run on Windows 10 Anniversary Edition and uses the DirectX 12 API with features like async compute and tiled resources. Gears of War 4 has check minimum, recommended and ideal system specifiactions published for both AMD and Intel/NVIDIA systems and they’re all pretty beastly. According to the ‘ideal’ system specifications you’ll want to be running an AMD FX-9590 or an Intel Core i7-4790 processor and either an AMD Radeon R9 Fury X or a NVIDIA Geforce 980 Ti / Geforce GTX 1080 graphics card. The recommended specifications aren’t much easier on graphics card as it is suggested you run an AMD Radeon R9 290X / Radeon RX 480 or an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 / GeForce GTX 1060. Those are all fairly new higher-end cards. If you have a video card older or slower than the Raddeon R7 260X They really aren’t kidding about needing 80GB of free space as we installed the game by itself on a secondary SSD and found that it used up 73.9GB of space! Microsoft and the developer (The Coalition) have worked hard to make the PC port not suck and have placed over 30 graphics cards settings in the option menu with over 100-plus options that you can adjust. NVIDIA already has a great Gears of War 4 graphics and performance guide that they wrote up and posted online that dives deep into many of those settings. The performance guide they wrote up is over 7,000 words and has interactive comparisons of different settings, the impact that many have on performance and then general performance on ten different NVIDIA graphics cards. Since NVIDIA has spent days if not weeks preparing and testing all that we’ll skip over that and just focus on doing independent performance testing on AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards to show you the real numbers that we manually ran on our test system. Gears of War 4 comes with a built-in benchmark that appears to be pretty decent and shows the average minimum framerate (bottom 5%) in the results. This is the benchmark that we ran on nine different graphics cards with Ultra image quality settings to see how they would perform. Before we look at the numbers, let’s take a brief look at the test system that was used. Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

John Mellinger This game runs amazing on my 970. No need for SLI unless I get a new monitor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKhwZXDwXbM Vaughn Plata That is always the story with Dual card setups you either have to wait for NV or AMD to create a provide or the game vendor to support it should not be a surprise to anyone. Jason Kane “The Coalition plans to incorporate multi-GPU support in a game update that will be happening in the near future.” Well in that case that’s when they’ll get my money and not before…not wasting my 970SLI.

SCOUT Chad Simmons Sooner Intel: LB a spot to watch (again) Bob Przybylo 10/07/2016 Intel returns with a look at what Tay Evans' news means for OU linebackers going forward. It’s just the nature of the beast. There isn’t one person who isn’t disappointed for Tay Evans. The former Oklahoma linebacker’s career is over because of lingering issues with concussions. Nobody is throwing a party about it and everybody hopes he can keep his head high. And if he so chooses, becomes a student-coach for the Sooners. Then reality sets in. With Evans, who only would have been a redshirt junior in 2017, out of the picture, the Sooners have to find another answer at inside linebacker. Who’s it going to be? Of course OU is set with one major land at the spot. You can get greedy when you know you have Collinsville (Okla.) High’s Levi Draper wrapped up. The security of a Scout 100 prospect means you can play things out and try to find the right fit. And truthfully, OU has a couple of those guys already. It’s not like Mike Stoops and Tim Kish are going to have to go back to the drawing board, but it does feel like maybe they can take all the inside prospects they see worthy. http://www.scout.com/player/194194-jacob-phillips?s=73 Let’s start with the popular pick in Nashville (Tenn.) East Literature’s Jacob Phillips. The Scout 300 prospect has seemed like OU or Alabama for several months now. The Crimson Tide did everything right on his visit, but when you get a five-star like Dylan Moses on the same weekend, you start to wonder if it’s not in the cards for Phillips and Bama. Phillips is going to take his final official visit this weekend to College Station to see Texas A&M and Tennessee. Going into the visit, it feels like the ultimate courtesy visit and a chance to see a huge game in a great atmosphere. Notre Dame doesn’t seem to be a factor. Oregon was never a grave concern. It’s still down to OU and Bama, but the Sooners seem to have a lot more to offer Phillips right now based on early playing time. http://www.scout.com/player/204330-tyler-taylor?s=73 The other name to circle is Buford (Ga.) Lanier’s Tyler Taylor. Ranked as a Scout 300 outside linebacker, you look at his size and see a potential move to the inside if he were to be a Sooner. And he absolutely could move and could absolutely be a Sooner. Taylor has made two visits to Norman already and come away incredibly impressed on both of them. Not only that, his family has given the trips rave reviews as well. Now Taylor wants to play things out a lot more, which looked like it could spell the end of any hope of him being in Norman. But with Evans off the table, OU can wait for Taylor and hope Taylor is still all about the Sooners when his choice rolls around. Taylor said he wants to make another visit to Norman, which would have to be an unofficial one this time around. For a non-regional recruit to make three visits would be one heck of a great sign. http://www.scout.com/player/193606-kenneth-murray?s=73 You could also get a little funky with who you already have locked up. In this case, we’re talking about Missouri City (Texas) Fort Bend Elkins linebacker Kenneth Murray. Ranked as an outside linebacker, Murray has the size to move inside, and he has been sensational so far during his senior season. If Murray were to move, then you’ve got the possibility of guys like K’Jakyre Daley and K’Lavon Chaisson as legitimate outside linebacker targets. http://www.scout.com/player/179859-anthony-hines?s=73 The one name do not want to give OU fans any false hope with is Plano (Texas) East inside linebacker Anthony Hines. The five-star prospect and the Sooners appeared to have gone their separate ways and everybody might be better off in thinking about who wants to be at OU instead of guys who you think should be at OU. Doubt we’ll ever really hear the story of how things broke down between OU and Hines, but there’s a clear riff and doesn’t look like it will be corrected anytime soon.     Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Post-chaos CFP rankings out: Who's 2, 3 & 4?

SCOUT Sooner Intel: OU focused on certain few Bob Przybylo 10/07/2016 Intel returns with a look at why it's OK that OU isn't bringing the house for Red River Showdown. Not going to stop you from saying the Oklahoma-Texas matchup is lacking the sizzle of years past. Both teams have two losses and a lot of recruits are headed to College Station for Texas A&M and Tennessee. What will say, though, is no big deal. The Sooners enter the weekend with 20 commits for the 2017 class, including 15 in the Scout 300. That’s not much more OU needs to do at this point to finish the class outside of finding the last pieces and keeping the committed ones home. So yea, the visitors list isn’t all that exciting. Don’t panic. There are two names for OU to zero in on and a chance to make that major impression. http://www.scout.com/player/204366-kobe-boyce?s=73 Lake Dallas (Texas) High CB Kobe Boyce A lot of OU fans believe wide receiver commit Jalen Reagor is looking for a reason to leave SoonerSquad17. If that’s the case, then say hello to the Texas version of it. Boyce has been committed to the Horns for a while, but it has always felt like he’s had one foot out the door. That feeling continued last month when Boyce, a high three-star cornerback, made an official visit to Norman to see the Sooners and Buckeyes. It felt like it would just be a matter of when and not if Boyce would decommit. Three weeks later and still waiting so this would be OU’s chance to show Boyce the problems in the secondary are gone, and now you can come home to Norman. Boyce seems to be favoring OU right now and has no doubt developed a good bond with OU’s 2017 commits. A win here might be enough to push him over the edge and make that leap. http://www.scout.com/player/202196-k-lavon-chaisson?s=73 Galena Park (Texas) North Shore DE K’Lavon Chaisson Oh what a recruitment this has been. From looking like an OU lock in the summer to parting ways to reconnecting once again. OU is being helped immensely by the struggles of LSU and Florida State as those two schools would seemingly be the top ones for Chaisson in a different scenario. Instead, if OU can win for the second week in a row and defeat its rival, it could show Chaisson the 2016 season is not lost. Texas is also in the mix for Chaisson, but it’s so hard to see anybody heading toward Charlie Strong based on his uncertain future. OU can do a lot of good in helping its cause with Chaisson, while at the same time hurting the chances for Texas to land the Scout 100 prospect. Those are the names. Now OU is bringing the house in terms of its commitments, no doubt about that. Included in that will be the newest pledge, Mansfield running back Kennedy Brooks. There will be some 2018 recruits to watch, but OU had to fight off Arkansas-Alabama for recruits in Tulsa and the Aggies-Vols for kids in Texas. It wasn’t ideal so the key thing to watch is how well the group interacts together. A good number of these recruits were together in Norman three weeks ago when Ohio State put on a pounding on the Sooners at Owen Field. It’s a chance to make things right. Get the commits smiling again and start adding more members to the fold for SoonerSquad17.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Sooners leadership shows in 45-24 win vs. BU Charles Walker NOT returning to OU OU's road to CFP playoff a daunting one Big 12 Player of the Week: Jordan Evans Video: Lincoln Riley letting Baker be Baker Sooners Illustrated Top Stories OU's road to CFP playoff a daunting one OU's road to the college football playoff is not a smooth road but not impossible. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated7:15 PM Sooners No. 9 in CFP rankingsOU is in the top 10 of the college football playoff rankings for the first time, coming in at No. 9. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated6:38 PM Breaking News Charles Walker NOT returning to OUDefensive lineman Charles Walker is not going to return to OU and will focus on the NFL Draft. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated4:57 PM OU 11: BaylorPretty easy No. 1 choice this week for the OU 11. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated7:20 AM Przybylo: OU bred for 'Championship November'OU keeps slowly rising up the rankings because Sooners know what 'Championship November' is all about. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 7:19 AM Life After Buddy - Sooners tipoff previewOU basketball is here.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 7, 2016 at 8:43AM An Intel desktop chip. Image source: Intel.  Last year, former Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Client Computing Group chief Kirk Skaugen admitted to something of an epic blunder. In a bid to save a little bit on research and development expenses (yes, really), the company straight up didn't bother building a new generation of desktop processors to support the business (which Skaugen said was worth around $10 billion at the time) between mid-2014 and mid-2015. This mistake, Skaugen indicated at the time, had a negative impact on the company's financial performance (without new products, it was likely more difficult for personal computer makers to convince potential customers to buy new systems). Unsurprisingly, Skaugen said that Intel is now committed to refreshing its desktop product line annually. Although there's every indication that Intel is trying to put out new desktop processors each year, the reality appears to be that execution problems are keeping Intel from hitting a strict annual release cadence. Past, present, and future Here are Intel's desktop processor architectures along with their respective launch dates: Architecture Release Date Time From Predecessor Sandy Bridge January 2011 1 year, 3 months Ivy Bridge April 2012 1 year, 3 months Haswell June 2013 1 year, 2 months Skylake  August 2015 2 years, 2 months Kaby Lake January 2017 (expected) 1 year, 5 months Coffee Lake  Q2 2018 (expected) >=1 year, 3 months Data sources: Various. The typical generation-on-generation cadence appears to be on the order of one year and three months. There is an exception when we look at the Haswell to Skylake transition, but this can be thought of as a two-generation jump (since Intel didn't release chips based on its Broadwell architecture for this segment). Interestingly enough, Intel hasn't been able to actually achieve a strict annual product release cadence, at least in desktops, over the last five years. And, based on what we know about Intel's future processor releases, it's not going to be able to hit such a cadence over the next couple of generations. Delays are hurting Intel's progress Early leaks suggested that Intel was initially targeting a fourth-quarter 2016 launch for the desktop variants of Kaby Lake. However, that schedule slipped to a January 2017 launch. Additionally, Digitimes reported that Intel had originally planned to release Coffee Lake for desktops during the second half of 2017, though other leaks now point to a launch of these products in the second quarter of 2018. A single product delay isn't enough to throw a company off track. The problem that Intel faces is that with each generation, the schedule seems to slip by about three months (remember: Intel should ideally aim to launch new products every 12 months). Those three-month slips add up -- indeed, by the time Intel launches Coffee Lake, those slips will have added up to at least 18 months, or nearly two product cycles. Can Intel fix it? 18 months is a long time, but I believe that Intel can cut significantly into that deficit over the next several years with excellent execution and a willingness to shorten some product cycles. For example, if Intel is willing to replace Coffee Lake with its successor, known as Ice Lake, in the fourth quarter of 2018, then that could shave off roughly six months. Then, if Intel were able to release Tiger Lake (the successor to Ice Lake) in the third quarter of 2019, that would be good for another three months out of that deficit. At that point, the previously 18-month deficit would be cut down to just a nine-month one. From that point forward, Intel probably wouldn't need to work to further reduce it -- just keep it from growing any further. The one little problem Although I do think that Intel could, in theory, accelerate its product development and launches to recover lost time, we have to keep in mind that the same teams that allowed Intel to fall behind in the first place (both Intel's manufacturing and product development groups deserve some blame) are the ones running the show now. Intel appears to have taken some actions to try to improve its execution by bringing on accomplished executives such as Murthy Renduchintala to try to fix the company's "competitiveness gaps." Perhaps things will get better out in time, but at least over the next couple of product cycles, things don't seem to be on track to get much better. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The integration of Versa’s NFV-based architecture and Lanner’s hardware vCPE platform delivers flexibility and cost advantages for creating agile and profitable managed services. Lanner’s FW-7525 functions as the vCPE device in conjunction with Versa’s FlexVNF software.FW-7525 is built on open x86 architecture in a compact fan-less desktop form factor. The desktop platform is powered by a dual or quad-core Intel® Atom™ C2000 Series processor, enabling network function virtualization at optimal power efficiency. FW-7525 comes with up to 6 Ethernet ports to connect with other networking devices at the customer site. Internally, the platform integrates an Intel QuickAssist crypto hardware accelerator to boost security inspection capability and secure network traffic. By integrating the flexibility of Versa’s NFV- and software-based approach to SD-WAN with Lanner’s versatile vCPE, the joint offering delivers an optimal solution for building profitable SD-WAN managed services and large enterprise WANs.

Some ship with Windows software. Some have Linux. And others have no operating system at all. Want to install your own operating system? If you’re using Windows that shouldn’t be too hard. But Linux may be another story, since many GNU/Linux-based operating systems lack some of the wireless or HDMI/audio features you may need. But developer Linuxium (Ian Morrison) has been releasing patched builds of Ubuntu Linux for tiny, Atom-powered computers like the Intel Compute Stick for a while. Now he has gathered a bunch of his builds in one place, making it easy to install Ubuntu on most desktop computers with Intel Bay Trail or Cherry Trail processors. In addition to Ubuntu, there are downloads available for Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, and Ubuntu MATE (which all share a common core, but which have different desktop environments).

It seems unlikely, and here's why. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 8, 2016 at 9:22AM Image source: Google.  Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google recently announced its first in-house smartphones, known as the Pixel and the Pixel XL (a larger variant of the Pixel). These are premium devices, starting at $649 for the base Pixel model (5 inches) and $769 for the base Pixel XL model (5.5 inches). These phones currently use a Snapdragon 821 applications processor produced by wireless chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). However, according to Bloomberg, Google has expressed interest in building its own custom silicon out in time. This leads to a very interesting question: Will Google develop its own applications processors for future Pixel smartphones? Google could probably do it Putting together a reasonably competent smartphone-oriented applications processor these days isn't too difficult, especially if one has the money to spend (and Google can clearly afford it). Many of the key intellectual properties that go into a mobile processor -- CPU cores, graphics, memory controllers, eMMC, and so on -- can be licensed from third parties such as ARM Holdings, Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH: IGNMF), and Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS). One major hurdle that Google would undoubtedly face in trying to build its own custom chip is the fact that it could not easily license a cellular modem to integrate into such a chip. Google would either have to spend a lot of time, money, and effort to even hope to build a reasonably competitive cellular modem or it would need to use stand-alone modems from the likes of Qualcomm or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the two suppliers of modems into the latest iPhone.  The stand-alone solution is less than ideal because the current Pixel phone uses a chip that integrates the modem onto the same piece of silicon as the applications processor, which helps to reduce board size as well as power consumption. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been dealing with stand-alone modems for as long as the iPhone has been around, but for Google it would represent a step back from the solution that it's already using.  In order to build a differentiated solution, Google could choose to build unique intellectual properties to integrate alongside the core technologies licensed from the above vendors. Custom hardware to accelerate certain common smartphone functions (thereby improving performance and/or lowering power consumption), for example, could be worthwhile projects for a potential Google custom silicon team to pursue if it really wants to build its own chips. Would it be worthwhile? The impression that I get is that most of the companies that build their own applications processors don't actually produce differentiated (or, frankly, even worthwhile) solutions relative to what can be purchased from the likes of Qualcomm and MediaTek. Apple's in-house chip efforts have been quite successful, and Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been reasonable, but efforts from the likes of Huawei's HiSilicon and LG have been mostly underwhelming. If Google were a major smartphone vendor and its core revenue/profitability depended on selling large volumes of ultra-premium smartphones, then there might be a case to spend all of the time and effort to build in-house applications processors, though there's no guarantee that it'd be as good as, let alone better than, what Google could buy from Qualcomm. However, given that the Google Pixel is unlikely to be a particularly high volume seller, especially when it's charging premium prices, and given the fierce competition in the Android landscape from companies that have been at this longer than Google has been, I doubt that there's much of a (rational) business justification for such an effort. I'm not betting on it My guess is that Google will build a couple more generations of these Pixel devices, but they ultimately won't sell all that well. At that point, I expect the effort around the Pixel to be scaled back, if not outright shuttered. If the case for an in-house applications processor is tenuous at this point, I suspect that it'll seem downright silly if and when it becomes clear that the Pixel is a nice hobby, but not really a worthwhile product category for Google to pursue over the long haul.

For Microsoft, October has always been about Surface branded hardware. Last year, Microsoft stunned the world by announcing Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. However, it seems like a quite event this time around. According to ZDNet, Microsoft’s October 26 will be more about Windows 10 and less about Surface hardware. The focus is reportedly around Windows 10 Redstone 2 update and Microsoft is reported to showcase third party OEM products. Microsoft is widely rumoured to announce Surface All-in-One type device at this event. There are reports indicating Microsoft’s plan to announce a new type of Surface keyboard and mouse at this event. With Intel’s seventh gen Core i processors hitting notebooks, Microsoft would use the stage to demonstrate partner products – especially at a time when PC sales are going down globally. One thing is certainly sure – Microsoft won’t be launching a new fitness band and there are also no likelihood of Surface branded smartphone. Lately, Microsoft has taken great deal of time to unify Windows 10 across platforms and recently delivered Project Centennial – which acts as a bridge between traditional Windows program and Windows Store apps.

For comparison, a strand of human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick. For more than a decade, engineers have been eyeing the finish line in the race to shrink the size of components in integrated circuits. They knew that the laws of physics had set a 5-nanometer threshold on the size of transistor gates among conventional semiconductors, about one-quarter the size of high-end 20-nanometer-gate transistors now on the market. Some laws are made to be broken, or at least challenged. A research team led by faculty scientist Ali Javey at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has done just that by creating a transistor with a working 1-nanometer gate. For comparison, a strand of human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick. "We made the smallest transistor reported to date," said Javey, lead principal investigator of the Electronic Materials program in Berkeley Lab's Materials Science Division. "The gate length is considered a defining dimension of the transistor. We demonstrated a 1-nanometer-gate transistor, showing that with the choice of proper materials, there is a lot more room to shrink our electronics." The key was to use carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), an engine lubricant commonly sold in auto parts shops. MoS2 is part of a family of materials with immense potential for applications in LEDs, lasers, nanoscale transistors, solar cells, and more. The findings were published today in the journal Science. Other investigators on this paper include Jeff Bokor, a faculty senior scientist at Berkeley Lab and a professor at UC Berkeley; Chenming Hu, a professor at UC Berkeley; Moon Kim, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas; and H.S. Philip Wong, a professor at Stanford University. The development could be key to keeping alive Intel co-founder Gordon Moore's prediction that the density of transistors on integrated circuits would double every two years, enabling the increased performance of our laptops, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics. "The semiconductor industry has long assumed that any gate below 5 nanometers wouldn't work, so anything below that was not even considered," said study lead author Sujay Desai, a graduate student in Javey's lab. "This research shows that sub-5-nanometer gates should not be discounted. Industry has been squeezing every last bit of capability out of silicon. By changing the material from silicon to MoS2, we can make a transistor with a gate that is just 1 nanometer in length, and operate it like a switch." When 'electrons are out of control' Transistors consist of three terminals: a source, a drain, and a gate. Current flows from the source to the drain, and that flow is controlled by the gate, which switches on and off in response to the voltage applied. Both silicon and MoS2 have a crystalline lattice structure, but electrons flowing through silicon are lighter and encounter less resistance compared with MoS2. That is a boon when the gate is 5 nanometers or longer. But below that length, a quantum mechanical phenomenon called tunneling kicks in, and the gate barrier is no longer able to keep the electrons from barging through from the source to the drain terminals. "This means we can't turn off the transistors," said Desai. "The electrons are out of control." Because electrons flowing through MoS2 are heavier, their flow can be controlled with smaller gate lengths. MoS2 can also be scaled down to atomically thin sheets, about 0.65 nanometers thick, with a lower dielectric constant, a measure reflecting the ability of a material to store energy in an electric field. Both of these properties, in addition to the mass of the electron, help improve the control of the flow of current inside the transistor when the gate length is reduced to 1 nanometer. Once they settled on MoS2 as the semiconductor material, it was time to construct the gate. Making a 1-nanometer structure, it turns out, is no small feat. Conventional lithography techniques don't work well at that scale, so the researchers turned to carbon nanotubes, hollow cylindrical tubes with diameters as small as 1 nanometer. They then measured the electrical properties of the devices to show that the MoS2 transistor with the carbon-nanotube gate effectively controlled the flow of electrons. "This work demonstrated the shortest transistor ever," said Javey, who is also a UC Berkeley professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences. "However, it's a proof of concept. We have not yet packed these transistors onto a chip, and we haven't done this billions of times over. We also have not developed self-aligned fabrication schemes for reducing parasitic resistances in the device. But this work is important to show that we are no longer limited to a 5-nanometer gate for our transistors. Moore's Law can continue a while longer by proper engineering of the semiconductor material and device architecture."         LATEST STORIES (18) Report: Apple to Offer Two 5.5-Inch iPhone Models in 2017 PlayStation 4 Pro Found to Offer Weaker Performance Than Regular PS4 for Some Games Google PhotoScan Turns Your Prints into High-Quality Digital Images Super-Red Quasars Extinguish Star Formation Tens of Nusra Terrorists Killed in Syrian Army Attacks in Northern Homs Popular Uprising against Terrorists Begins in Syria's Aleppo Syria: Terrorists in Homs, Idlib Surprised by Russian Navy Operation Syria in Last 24 Hours: Army, Air Force Inflict Heavy Losses on Terrorists in Northern Hama American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US Eleven Killed, Wounded in Terrorists' Rocket Attack in Western Damascus Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syrian Army Discovers Terrorists' 700-Meter-Long Tunnel in Khan Al-Sheih Connecting Damascus to Quneitra Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win Yemen Water Crisis Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Report: Apple to Offer Two 5.5-Inch iPhone Models in 2017 TEHRAN (FNA)- A noted analyst covering Apple expects three new iPhone versions in 2017: one 4.7-inch and two 5.5-inch.

Windows Live YahooBuzz FriendFeed Relative Merits of Three JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS, ReactJS, and EmberJS Posted on October 5th, 2016 Vote! Tweet By Phong Bui When you're working towards creating a solid responsive design that works across multiple platforms, you need to choose the right client-side framework for best results. Anyone seeking a JavaScript framework for their project today is going to consider the big three: AngularJS, ReactJS, and EmberJS. But, how do you narrow down your choice? Which framework is going to deliver what you need? In this article, we're going to delve into the pros and cons of each framework in turn and try to help you make the right choice for your project. Background and Popularity The first framework on the scene was AngularJS, which was first released in October, 2010. It is maintained by Google and enjoys a large, active community of developers and organizations. You'll find it on the Web sites of ABC News, Intel, Walgreens, and others. Angular has 165,000 followers on Twitter. First released in March, 2013, ReactJS is the youngest framework of our trio. It's maintained by Facebook and a large community of individuals and corporations. You'll find it used on Netflix, Feedly, Airbnb, and many other Web sites. React has 93,500 followers on Twitter. EmberJS was first released in December 2011 and it also has a large active community, though it lacks the big-name backing of Angular and React. It can be found on Web sites like Groupon, Vine, and Chipotle. Ember has 35,200 followers on Twitter. The relative popularity of each platform on Twitter broadly reflects our own client experience. Around 60% of our clients use Angular, about 30% use React, and the remaining 10% are using Ember. Before we dig into the technical strengths and weaknesses of each platform, it's worth noting that Google's backing for Angular and Facebook's backing for React make both of them safe bets. They won't run into any funding issues or suffer from lack of support for the foreseeable future. Now, let's take each platform in turn and drill into the advantages and disadvantages, before suggesting some scenarios where they might be the right pick. AngularJS It looks as though Angular is the most popular choice, but the move to Angular 2.0 has been a bit disruptive. A lot of the community is still using Angular 1.x, and although Angular 2.0 offers many benefits, the transition is far from complete. Advantages of Angular MVC architecture Easy-to-customize DOM Two-way data bindings Extendable HTML directories Support for desktop and mobile applications Built-in dependency injection Support for server-side rendering Easy to build and deploy with AngularCLI tool Disadvantages of Angular The big disadvantage with Angular 2.0 is the lack of documentation. The problem is complicated by the fact that the wealth of resources for Angular 1.x don't really help because the framework has changed so much. Angular Is Recommended AngularJS is recommended for projects that need to support desktop and mobile. Also, because it is written in Microsoft's TypeScript, it's a good choice for large enterprises. ReactJS When Facebook created React, it was trying to find an efficient way to keep a consistent UI and it succeeded. It may be the newest kid on the block here, but it has made some innovative strides. Advantages of React Virtual DOM One-way binding Support for desktop and mobile applications Support for server-side rendering Fast performance Disadvantages of React The big disadvantage for React is the fact that it's not really a full framework. You still need a third-party framework such as Flux or Redux to make a full MV* architecture. React Is Recommended ReactJS is recommended for projects that require high performance and simple libraries over a complete MV* framework. EmberJS Started with a focus on ambitious Web applications, Ember has some serious programming talent behind it, even if it does lack the backing of Google or Facebook. Ember 2.0 was released in August, 2015 and brought a raft of enhancements to the platform. Advantages of Ember MVC architecture Two-way data bindings Fits well with the RoR model and applications Built-in dependency injection Easy to build and deploy with EmberCLI tool Quick to develop Disadvantages of Ember The relatively small community is a drawback for Ember and it's also hard to code if you stray beyond its typical uses. Ember Is Recommended EmberJS is recommended for any projects that strictly follow the namespace/convention over configuration, especially Ruby on Rails projects. How to Choose There is no overall winner. The framework you choose depends on the project you're working on. If you have the time, try them out and see what aligns most closely with your current requirements. Factor in any existing knowledge you might have to help you get a head start. Although there are some unique selling points for each framework, the majority of the best new features and functions can be found in each of them. These are the three most popular frameworks for good reason.

I liked the post. Also, I think you shouldn't gripe about Ember, or any other framework, copying things from React or anywhere else. They admit what they liked about React. We, as developers, rarely create anything very new. Its a great thing to have tools that are made better by combining the best-of-breed. It makes us better. I did not see you offering much constructive criticism. Reply MV* architecture ? Posted by Can Ho on 10/07/2016 12:07am Thanks for your post. I have some concerns: 1. AngularJs Angular 1.x and Angular 2.x are completely different frameworks. I don't think it makes sense when saying "Advantages of Angular", "Disadvantages of Angular". Are you saying "Advantages of Angular 1.x" and "Disadvantages of Angular 1.x" ? 2. ReactJs This is a library not a framework. So, you're comparing apples and oranges. I agree that "Virtual DOM" is what makes React famous. There're a lot more that make React really powerful: Unidirection data flow, composition, Unix mentality, free from Domain Specific Language, JSX,.. "You still need a third-party framework such as Flux or Redux to make a full MV* architecture." --> Flux is a design pattern, not a framework. Redux is "Flux like" implementation. Furthermore, I don't think that we need "a full MV* architecture" in React world. 3. Ember Ember 2.0 copied a lot from React (https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/15): * One-way data binding by default * Virtual DOM * Component based * Controller is deprecated * Lifecycle callbacks Generally speaking, I don't agree with your points on Ember's advantages. To be honest, after reading this post, it seems to me that this post was created years ago (which favors MV* a lot) Reply You must have javascript enabled in order to post comments.

BLAIR / Statesman Journal)Buy Photo 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — Ron Wyden is expected to comfortably coast to a fifth term in the Senate next month and, if Democrats win the majority, pick up the gavel as chairman of the Finance Committee again. “He has basically spent his adult life representing Oregon,” said William M. Lunch, a professor of political science at Oregon State University. “Wyden’s roots run deep,” he said, with 16 years in the House before winning a special election to the Senate in early 1996. In Oregon, he’s perhaps best known for holding town hall meetings in each county every year, including ones he knows he won’t win in the southern and eastern parts of the state. “Wyden goes to all those places and listens to people and talks to local leaders. Part of success in politics is showing up,” Lunch said. “He’s very good at interacting with people. It doesn’t mean he wins those districts or those counties, but he limits the degree to which he loses them. Those kinds of moves have made him a very formidable political force in Oregon.” Nationally, Wyden is perhaps best known these days for his concerns about government intrusions into privacy and for encouraging the expansion of the high-tech industry in a state where Intel is the leading private employer. He put a hold on the Intelligence Authorization Act this summer to call attention to provisions allowing the FBI to demand customers’ Internet browsing histories and restricting the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. As a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence since 2001, he was instrumental in getting the CIA inspector general’s report on 9/11 declassified. STATESMAN JOURNAL Wyden, Udall side with Feinstein on CIA issue Wyden, 67, also has a reputation for “going off the reservation” and finding areas of agreement with Republican colleagues on health care and other issues, Lunch said. But he doesn’t think that has harmed his reputation with the Democratic leadership that would return him to the Finance Committee chairmanship he held briefly when Max Baucus of Montana was tapped to become ambassador to China in early 2014. Wyden is the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee. The influential handicappers at the Cook Political Report have consistently put Wyden’s seat in their “Solid D” category. They also put seven Senate seats — six of them Republican-held — in the “toss up” column, suggesting the Senate majority could flip to Democrats. “There’s no indication that Wyden is in any trouble as he runs for re-election this year,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. By email before Sunday’s second presidential debate, he added that Hillary Clinton’s standing suggested Democrats are now “narrow favorites” to take the Senate. Professor James D. Moore, director of the McCall Center for Policy Innovation at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Ore., also noted Wyden’s efforts to “keep up connections with the Republican parts of the state,” and said he works to find bipartisan consensus on the Finance and Natural Resources committees. An example of the latter occurred in 2014, when Wyden sought to balance environmental and timber logging interests in a bill that could win Democratic support in the Senate. The bill took a different approach than a House bill co-sponsored by Rep. Greg Walden, a Republican whose district covers almost two-thirds of the state east of the Willamette Valley, and co-sponsored by Reps. Peter DeFazio, D-Eugene, and Kurt Schrader, D-Canby, favored by the timber industry. After lengthy negotiations, the deal fell through. “Greg Walden outflanked him and, in the end, nothing got done — not a surprise in this Congress,” said Moore. STATESMAN JOURNAL Wyden timber bill gets support, condemnation from enviros Contrasting Wyden with former Oregon Sens. Bob Packwood, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee when major tax reform was passed in 1986, and the late Mark Hatfield, the Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee from 1981-87 and 1995-97, Moore said Wyden doesn’t have their “kind of footprint” nationally. When both were serving as chairmen, “Oregon was in the catbird’s seat,” he said. “(Wyden)’s not behind any of the major legislation that affects either Oregon or the country, but he’s in the middle of the discussions,” Moore said. Wyden has been a sponsor of 79 bills in this session of Congress, ranking fourth of 100 senators. And he is in the middle of things. Just last week, Wyden was one of 14 senators asking Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate and, if appropriate, file charges against the Wells Fargo officials responsible for the creation of millions of fraudulent accounts. “Every time the Department of Justice settles a case of corporate fraud without holding individuals accountable, it reinforces the notion that the wealthy and powerful have purchased a higher class of justice for themselves,” they wrote. Wyden is well-regarded by colleagues, who say he’s known for his studious hard work. “Our entire delegation has achieved a great deal of success, especially coming from a  small state, and a lot of that has to do with the senator’s leadership here in Washington, as well as back at home," said Schrader. "That hasn’t gone unnoticed by Oregonians either, which is why I know it is going to be an easy vote for folks to re-elect him this fall. If the Senate flips, Senator Wyden will be in an even better position to continue to deliver for Oregonians.” Teresa Alonso Leon, the Democratic candidate for State House District 22 in Salem, said she was “thrilled” to get Wyden’s endorsement. Frank Dixon, chairman of the Democratic Party of Oregon, called Wyden an effective leader who “time after time has proven his service to the people of Oregon, standing up for our values and the issues that make a difference." But Wyden also has his critics. David Jaques, an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention last summer in Cleveland and editor of The Roseburg Beacon newspaper, says Wyden has been ineffective solving problems and has been in office too long. “I do think we need term limits,” he said. “There’s more turnover in the monarchies of Europe than there is in our Congress.” Jaques concedes Wyden will defeat Republican Mark Callahan, a Salem information technology consultant, and four others on the ballot. Callahan did not respond to a request for comment. Wyden ranks as 20th wealthiest in the Senate with an estimated net worth of $10.8 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. It noted he receives rent from a New York City building where the landmark Strand book store co-owned by his wife, Nancy, is located. Wyden won the Democratic nomination in May against two others with 84 percent of the vote. He has raised $11.4 million since his last re-election and has spent $4.2 million, while Callahan has raised just $15,852, records show. The center says Wyden’s biggest donors have been Nike ($89,922), Blue Cross-Blue Shield ($78,400), the League of Conservation Voters ($75,012), the law and lobbying firm Akin, Gump ($65,655) and Intel ($59,307). Not surprisingly, given his committee assignments, Wyden’s largest donor base is the securities and investment world, which has given his campaign committee $853,500 this cycle. Right behind that were lawyers ($801,517) and the insurance industry ($568,790). Thirty percent of his contributions have come from political action committees. “Ron Wyden isn’t shy about raising money, even though he isn’t in any danger of losing re-election,” political prognosticator Nathan L. Gonzales wrote in the Rothenberg-Gonzales Political Report after his primary victory. He rated Oregon’s Senate seat “safe for the Democrats.” Wyden appears to be preparing for victory. In a statement to The Statesman Journal, he said: “I appreciate the trust my colleagues placed in me when Democrats were last in the majority, and I’m planning to pursue policies important to Oregonians when Democrats win in November. “My goal in the Senate has always been to find a way to do the most good for Oregonians, and the rest of the country. Chairing the Senate Finance Committee would give Oregon a strong voice as I fight to pass policies that help bring down the cost of child care, education and homes for the middle class. I’ll fight to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, expand access to affordable, quality health care for women and men across the country, and provide resources to aid our nation’s most vulnerable children and families."

(Qing Li/ Epoch Times) A fashion show, a brain signal headset, and scientist designers—this is a combination you can probably only see in San Francisco, a leading city in technology innovation. The San Francisco Fashion Week: Ready to Wear Showcase was held in the DZINE furniture gallery on the evening of Oct. 1. Two of the three designers are actually scientists. A crowd waits for the fashion show to start outside the DZINE furniture gallery in San Francisco. (Qing Li/ Epoch Times) Kitty Yeung, a hardware engineer at Intel with a Ph.D. in applied physics from Harvard University, brought 12 pieces of her work to show to the audience. The prints on the fabrics are all her own paintings, including a Chinese-style lotus, a spring in the Harvard yard, and a painting of Jupiter. The paintings show her love of nature and science. She also blended Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and wearable technology into her design. One of her pieces has dynamic sleeves that look like wings on the shoulders. Yeung herself was wearing a headset with a sensor. She explained that the headset is a product from BrainCo that can detect one’s brain signal and the movement of one’s head, and it is connected to LED lights on her dress. The LED lights change color based on the motion of her head. “I think in the future people will wear electronics [in] their fabrics,” Yeung said. Kitty Yeung, a hardware engineer at Intel and a fashion designer, explains to a reporter how her dress works. The headset she is wearing can control the LED lights on her dress. (Qing Li, Epoch Times) The theme of the fashion show also attracted many professionals working in the tech industry. Arpita Patel, Rowena Zuniga, Teresa Mao, and Arpita Shrivastava, who are all software engineers in the San Francisco Bay Area, attended the event. They were inspired by how the designers think outside the box and apply technology to fashion. (L-R) Arpita Patel, Arpita Shrivastava, Rowena Zuniga, and Teresa Mao are all software engineers working in the San Francisco Bay Area. They were attracted to the fashion show by its theme of technology and fashion. (Qing Li/ Epoch Times) Patel, a software engineer at Slack, is very interested in IoT. The fashion show made her think about its applications. She was also amazed by the creativity of the female designers. “Especially for females, it’s not just engineering that is defining them. It’s also their own personal interests along with the engineering skill set they have got there. They’re just putting it out there. We are just very inspired,” Patel said.

Panasonic Toughbook, look out. By: Steven Bassiri | Editorials in Laptops | Posted: Oct 7, 2016 7:54 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Dell's Rugged and Extremely Rugged Products] Page 1 [Dell's Rugged and Extremely Rugged Products] Page 2 [Testing Out Dell's Claims - Part 1] Page 3 [Testing Out Dell's Claims - Part 2] Page 4 [Global Command Center] Page 5 [Where Dell Is Headed] Dell's Rugged and Extremely Rugged Products     A rugged military-grade product might not be what first comes to mind when you think of Dell, but over the past years, the company has shifted more resources towards building rugged notebooks to compete with the likes of the infamous Panasonic Toughbook. Rugged laptops and tablets have many uses ranging from the obvious military usage scenarios to the less obvious ones such as right through into the kitchen. Dell was kind enough to invite me to Texas where they gave me a firsthand account of their progress with their "Rugged" line of products. I also toured their labs and one of their Global Command Centers. Dell is not only a hardware company but they are also heavily invested in services. Dell's support system for their customers is one of the major benefits of Dell products, and all of their Rugged products will utilize Dell's in-house Global Command Centers, instead of an outsourced partner.     Dell's four main products they showcased include the Latitude 14 Rugged, Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme, Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme, and their Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet. All of these products offer MIL-STD-810G certification, which they get from an independent lab. Over the years, their "Rugged" series of products has shifted from rebadged consumer counterparts, to fully redesigned products that might only use a part of the consumer version's PCB.     Since the target audience for these new products isn't your average consumer, but rather a corporation or governmental body that only upgrades once in a while, Dell is looking to hit very important upgrade cycles when it comes to hardware performance. It's the reason that the new products will mostly be based on Intel's Skylake microarchitecture, as it should serve customers well into the future.     Their Extreme Rugged (Fully Rugged) products offer IP-65 ingress protection, should survive a 6-foot drop, are EMI shielded for use around explosives and hazardous locations, and provide "comprehensive" MIL-STD-810G certification. Their Rugged (also called Semi-Rugged) series offers IP-5X or greater ingress protection and will survive a 3-foot drop. From their experience building rugged products, Dell has realized that to provide a better product, they must build their products to exceed the requirements of certifications such as MIL-STD-810G. Dell even says that after the 6-foot drop test, their Rugged Extreme notebook might still be IP certified, which is something not widely promised by other brands.     I will be reviewing a few of Dell's Rugged products, but I thought you might appreciate a little overview of what they have to offer. Dell has taken what looks to be a physically weak concept of the convertible tablet/notebook and produced the fully-rugged Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme. While some might question the frame and rotating display, the product should stand up to a beating just like the Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme. You might have noticed the RGB keyboards, but they aren't there only for show. Dell mentioned that in different lighting conditions, different colors could be useful, such as red at night.     Dell's Latitude 12 Rugged tablet is attached to a keyboard dock in the picture. A rugged tablet has many uses out in the field, particularly when there is no need for a keyboard, such as an interactive map. We used these tablets attached to jet skis to display a map of Lake Travis, and we proceeded to race around the island as our position was tracked in real-time and displayed on the tablet.     The Latitude 14 Rugged and Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme are what we traditionally think of as a rugged computer. Both carry Dell's 14-inch daylight-readable display and are equipped with the latest in high-performance hardware. Dell is using solid state storage instead of spinning disks, which makes a lot of sense considering the nature of the device. Both are the latest Dell has to offer in terms of durability, and we actually tossed the one on the right off a boat onto a rocky island multiple times. The notebook survived with some external scratches, and there it sits the day after. Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.

Now a new kind of transistor design promises to keep it alive for a little longer—though the chip industry is already planning ways to cope when it finally kicks the bucket. The problem currently facing chip design is, sadly, physics itself. Using silicon, it’s impossible to create a transistor in which the gate—the part of a transistor that switches on and off to control the flow of electrons—is smaller than seven nanometers. Make them any smaller, and electrons can move between transistors through a process known as quantum tunneling, which means that a transistor in an “off” state could be unexpectedly switched “on” even if it’s not supposed to be. That places a theoretical limit on Moore’s Law—the idea that the number of transistors that can fit onto a chip doubles every two years or so. But now researchers from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, led by previous TR Innovator Under 35 Ali Javey, have built what’s claimed to be the world’s smallest working transistor. Ali Javey, left, and Sujay Desai have created the world's smallest transistor. Publishing their achievement in Science, the researchers explain that the device has been built using carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide, creating a transistor with a gate length of just one nanometer. It’s an impressive achievement, and—in theory, at least—it means that it would be possible to squeeze far more of the small switches into a chip than could ever be achieved with silicon. For some context, the current state-of-the-art chips use transistors with a 14-nanometer gate, and 10-nanometer chips are on the way. The result is, however, just a proof of concept—a long way from a viable product. Turning these nanotube transistors into a processor would require billions of the switches to be reliably created on a single chip. That may be possible, but it could also be cripplingly expensive. Indeed, the chip industry has already acknowledged that it’s prepared for transistors to stop shrinking. Earlier this year, the Semiconductor Industry Association—made up of the likes of Intel, AMD, and Global Foundries—published a report announcing that by 2021 it will not be economically efficient to reduce the size of silicon transistors any further. Instead, chips look set to change in different ways. We’re already seeing the processor industry fracture, with a movement away from super-fast all-rounder hardware and toward more specialized chips. To that end, Intel recently bought  Movidius, a company that makes chips dedicated to computer vision tasks. Nvidia, meanwhile, is selling specialized AI chips to an industry eager to capitalize on machine learning. More efficient chip designs will also help increase computational speed at lower rates of power consumption. Microsoft and Intel are both working on using reconfigurable chips known as FPGAs to run artificial-intelligence algorithms more efficiently, for instance. And the Japanese telecom and Internet company SoftBank recently acquired British chip designer ARM for its incredibly successful low-power chips, which will provide processing power for the growing crop of Internet-of-things hardware. Less specialized processors will likely change shape to increase processing power. Chips will increasingly use multiple layers of circuitry to increase transistor density, for example. Or, just maybe, they might shrink down using the Berkeley Lab breakthrough to achieve the same ends.

Riskiest Celebrity Names to Click On: Who Made the List? When you search on celebrities' names and click, consider the security risks. Amy Schumer and Justin Bieber top Intel Security's list of most dangerous names to click on. Amy Schumer Takes the No. 1 Spot According to Intel's numbers, consumers have a 16.11 percent chance of hitting on a site loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal data when they search for her online, and a 33 percent chance when they search "Amy Schumer Torrent." She took over from electronic dance music DJ Armin van Buuren, who was at the top of the 2015 list. Silly With Comedians There was a broad range of comedians on the list, including Kevin Hart at No. 25, Mindy Kaling at 30, Kristen Wiig (pictured) at 52 and Ellen DeGeneres at 57. Justin Bieber Attracts Trouble The pop singer, who has had his share of controversy, comes in at No. 2, with fans having a 15 percent chance of hitting on a malware-laden site when searching online. Singing the Blues Bieber was far from the only singer to make the dangerous celebrities list. There were others in the top 10, and lower on the list were the likes of Drake at No. 13, Katy Perry at No. 14, Justin Timberlake (pictured) at No. 17, Lady Gaga at No. 19 and Beyonce at No. 28. Carson Daly Talks His Way Onto the List The host on NBC's "Today" morning show and "The Voice" reality TV series finds himself at No. 3 on the list, where consumers are at a 13.44 percent risk of infection. Late Night Risks Daly wasn't the only night-time TV host to make the list. Others include Seth Meyers at No. 11, James Corden (pictured) and his popular "Carpool Karaoke" at No. 23, John Oliver at No. 24 and Jimmy Kimmel (who was No. 1 two years ago) now at No. 32. Will Smith in a Dead Heat With Carson Daly Like the TV host, movie star Will Smith, most recently seen in "Suicide Squad," came in with a 13.44 percent malware risk. What's Her Name? It's Rihanna, and the singer, who has a string of top hits, reached No. 5 on the Intel Security list, with fans facing a 13.33 percent risk of getting infected with malware. She Came In Like a Wrecking Ball Singer Miley Cyrus seems to live by the belief that there's no such thing as bad publicity. In that vein, she's sitting at No. 6, with a 12.67 percent risk for those surfing the web for her. Talking Dangerous Those searching online for comedian and actor Chris Hardwick, who also is a businessman (CEO of Nerdist Industries) and talk show host ("Talking Dead"), have a 12.56 percent chance of being directed to a website loaded with malware. Tosh.Malware Daniel Tosh—producer, actor, TV host and No. 8 on Intel Security's list of dangerous celebrities. Those searching for him online face an 11.56 percent chance of hitting on a malware-infected site. More Dangerous Than "Barney" Selena Gomez, the singer and actress who got her start as a child in the TV show "Barney and Friends," is now a regular in the gossip columns and No. 9 on the Intel list, coming in with an 11.11 percent risk for consumers searching for her online. She Is Who She Is And she is singer and rapper Kesha, who like Selena Gomez made the top 10 on Intel's list with a risk factor of 11.11 percent.

She's got a top-rated cable TV show with "Inside Amy Schumer," a few movies on her resume and a growing presence in the debate over gun control. And now, according to Intel Security, she not only is attracting her share of fans, but also the attention of hackers and cyber-criminals. Schumer is at the top of this year's list put out by Intel's security business of the celebrities that generate the most dangerous results when searched online. The McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study is in its 10th year, and Schumer has the dubious honor of being the first female comedian to take the top spot. "Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news," said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security. "With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cyber-criminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware."

Transistor. Ever. Berkeley Lab-led research breaks major barrier in transistor size by creating gate only 1 nanometer long WEBWIRE – Friday, October 7, 2016 Schematic of a transistor with a molybdenum disulfide channel and 1-nanometer carbon nanotube gate. (Credit: Sujay Desai/UC Berkeley) For more than a decade, engineers have been eyeing the finish line in the race to shrink the size of components in integrated circuits. They knew that the laws of physics had set a 5-nanometer threshold on the size of transistor gates among conventional semiconductors, about one-quarter the size of high-end 20-nanometer-gate transistors now on the market. Some laws are made to be broken, or at least challenged. A research team led by faculty scientist Ali Javey at the Department of Energys Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has done just that by creating a transistor with a working 1-nanometer gate. For comparison, a strand of human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick. We made the smallest transistor reported to date, said Javey, lead principal investigator of the Electronic Materials program in Berkeley Labs Materials Science Division. The gate length is considered a defining dimension of the transistor. We demonstrated a 1-nanometer-gate transistor, showing that with the choice of proper materials, there is a lot more room to shrink our electronics. The key was to use carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), an engine lubricant commonly sold in auto parts shops. MoS2 is part of a family of materials with immense potential for applications in LEDs, lasers, nanoscale transistors, solar cells, and more. The findings were published today in the journal Science. Other investigators on this paper include Jeff Bokor, a faculty senior scientist at Berkeley Lab and a professor at UC Berkeley; Chenming Hu, a professor at UC Berkeley; Moon Kim, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas; and H.S. Philip Wong, a professor at Stanford University. The development could be key to keeping alive Intel co-founder Gordon Moores prediction that the density of transistors on integrated circuits would double every two years, enabling the increased performance of our laptops, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics. The semiconductor industry has long assumed that any gate below 5 nanometers wouldnt work, so anything below that was not even considered, said study lead author Sujay Desai, a graduate student in Javeys lab. This research shows that sub-5-nanometer gates should not be discounted. Industry has been squeezing every last bit of capability out of silicon. By changing the material from silicon to MoS2, we can make a transistor with a gate that is just 1 nanometer in length, and operate it like a switch. When electrons are out of control Transistors consist of three terminals: a source, a drain, and a gate. Current flows from the source to the drain, and that flow is controlled by the gate, which switches on and off in response to the voltage applied. Both silicon and MoS2 have a crystalline lattice structure, but electrons flowing through silicon are lighter and encounter less resistance compared with MoS2. That is a boon when the gate is 5 nanometers or longer. But below that length, a quantum mechanical phenomenon called tunneling kicks in, and the gate barrier is no longer able to keep the electrons from barging through from the source to the drain terminals. This means we cant turn off the transistors, said Desai. The electrons are out of control. Because electrons flowing through MoS2 are heavier, their flow can be controlled with smaller gate lengths. MoS2 can also be scaled down to atomically thin sheets, about 0.65 nanometers thick, with a lower dielectric constant, a measure reflecting the ability of a material to store energy in an electric field. Both of these properties, in addition to the mass of the electron, help improve the control of the flow of current inside the transistor when the gate length is reduced to 1 nanometer. Once they settled on MoS2 as the semiconductor material, it was time to construct the gate. Making a 1-nanometer structure, it turns out, is no small feat. Conventional lithography techniques dont work well at that scale, so the researchers turned to carbon nanotubes, hollow cylindrical tubes with diameters as small as 1 nanometer. They then measured the electrical properties of the devices to show that the MoS2 transistor with the carbon-nanotube gate effectively controlled the flow of electrons. This work demonstrated the shortest transistor ever, said Javey, who is also a UC Berkeley professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences. However, its a proof of concept. We have not yet packed these transistors onto a chip, and we havent done this billions of times over. We also have not developed self-aligned fabrication schemes for reducing parasitic resistances in the device. But this work is important to show that we are no longer limited to a 5-nanometer gate for our transistors. Moores Law can continue a while longer by proper engineering of the semiconductor material and device architecture. The work at Berkeley Lab was primarily funded by the Department of Energys Basic Energy Sciences program. ### Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory addresses the worlds most urgent scientific challenges by advancing sustainable energy, protecting human health, creating new materials, and revealing the origin and fate of the universe.

For conventional semiconductors, the laws of physics set a 5nm threshold on the size of transistor gates (about a quarter the size of high-end 20nm-gate transistors currently on the market).

By Owen Hughes October 7, 2016 15:12 BST Facebook is working on a mid-range, standalone virtual reality headset. The device, currently nicknamed Santa Cruz, will sit between the Gear VR and Oculus Rift in Facebook's product line-up in terms of affordability, and will likely count Google's recently-announced Daydream View amongst its main competitors. Generally speaking, virtual reality currently forces users to choose between basic, budget headsets such as those supported by Google Cardboard, and the high-fidelity yet costly experiences afforded by devices like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Samsung's Gear VR, also powered by Facebook's Oculus, goes some way towards locating a middle ground in terms of affordability, but compatibility is limited to a handful of Samsung devices. There is, therefore, a need to target consumers who want an affordable but high-quality VR headset that isn't tied down to a mobile device or PC. A number of tech companies are now developing such devices, including Intel, Qualcomm and Alcatel. Speaking at the Oculus Connect conference in San Francisco on 6 October, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that virtual reality needs to offer more wallet-friendly experiences while not sacrificing too much on quality. "We believe that there is a sweet spot, a standalone virtual reality product category that is high quality and affordable, and you can bring with you out into the world," he said. "We're working on this now. It's still early, so don't get your hopes up too much." Facebook's social VR avatars are now more expressiveFacebook Zuckerberg briefly showcased the Santa Cruz prototype on stage while showcasing the updates in Facebook's social VR platform. First demoed back at the F8 conference in April, the software now features more accurate avatars capable of portraying basic facial expressions based on voice analysis. The social VR platform was noticeably more feature-rich than it was at its initial debut, with Zuckerberg and his colleagues able to more deeply engage with each other within the virtual space. All of this was shown running on Facebook's new wireless device, although neither it nor the social VR software were given a release date. Facebook will be keen to push a mid-range virtual reality product given the imminent arrival of PlayStation VR and Google's Daydream View, both of which promise to offer high-quality virtual reality at a more affordable price. While both headsets are tied to external devices, they are expected to be popular due to the large user bases of the PS4 and Android smartphones.

The automakers – Audi, BMW and Daimler – have formed the “5G Automotive Association” together with Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm. The group’s aim is to test and promote 5G and agree on standards for it. Automakers need 5G to support their goal of putting driverless cars on the road sometime in the next decade. Autonomous vehicles need to be able to send and receive large amounts of data almost instantly, which is impossible with the current 4G or LTE standard. By adopting the 5G standard, networks will be able to handle much more data, connect many more devices, reduce latency and bring new levels of reliability, the association said in a press release. “Next-generation mobile networks will take car-to-x connectivity to a new level,” Alfons Pfaller, head of infotainment development at Audi, said. The 5G association, which is open to additional members, expects, among other things, to run joint projects that can result in integrated solutions and large-scale pilots and trial deployments.   Rate this article   Read automotiveIT international magazine Related Articles Audi, BMW, Daimler jointly acquire Nokia HERE Nokia HERE: Accenture consultant sees more acquisitions carIT Congress – Hanover VW launches car-sharing program as new mobility initiatives increase Vodafone joins automotive 5G alliance PDF VERSION · Print this page Tags: 5g, Audi, BMW, connected car, Daimler, ericsson, huawei, intel, nokia, qualcomm, vw Share this article: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook E-Mail Our Websites Media-Manufaktur Corporate automotiveIT - Germany automotiveIT Kongress automotiveIT Forum Industrie 4.0 automotiveIT International business impact - Germany carIT - Germany carIT Kongress Poll Where will automakers get the greatest benefit from big data?

Image: Marina Lopes We’re So Addicted to Our Gadgets That ‘Unplugged’ Tourism Is Booming Written by Marina Lopes October 7, 2016 // 08:00 AM EST Copy This URL If a tree falls in the Amazon, but you don’t capture it on Snapchat, did it actually fall? I had the thought while hiking through the rainforest, on the third day of a digital detox that was slowly killing me. What’s the point of eating a live worm or luring a monkey onto my shoulder if I can’t post the photos to prove it? These days, vacation can feel like work. Between Facebook updates, Instagram posts and tweets of your shower thoughts, memorializing your vacation can overpower the trip itself. In fact, 41 percent of millennials feel that their phones are keeping them from living in the moment when traveling, according to a JWT Intelligence consumer trends survey. And over half of those who plan on unplugging during vacation aren’t able to, according to an Intel digital behavior study. So how much are tech addicts (i.e. most of us) willing to pay for someone to cut them off? It turns out, quite a lot. And the travel industry is readily capitalizing on our addiction to glowing screens. Well, somebody needed to take a picture of this hammock. Image: Marina Lopes Lack of WiFi and cell service, once unforgivable for any hotel, have become selling points at places like La Pause, in Morocco. Nestled between desert sand dunes, it has no electricity or cell service, but offers luxury tents with egyptian cotton linens and bathrobes for $250 a night. Similarly, at Petit St. Vincent, a secluded Caribbean resort averaging $1,000 a night, the phone never rings. Residents use flag poles outside their bungalows to communicate with management. “People don’t know how to disconnect. That’s why there’s this demand. It’s catering to soul searchers, people are looking to get to know themselves again,” said Adriana Lacerda, a travel consultant at Plantel Tourism. “Technology prevents this self-reflection. You are connected to other people, but not really.” Unplugged tourism is like rehab for the traveler whose thumb flicks upward at the first sign of boredom. And digital breaks can have actual health benefits. Studies show that heavy users of technology suffer more mental illness and have trouble sleeping. Over the summer, in search of this elusive freedom from technology, I took a plane, two boats and a van into the heart of the Amazon. I wanted to trade in my Spotify playlist for a creaking hammock and reconnect with nature. Juma Lodge promised just that. The secluded hotel is made up of 21 thatched-roof huts swaying on stilts at the basin of the Paraná do Araçá River. For $300 a night, the hotel boasted a return to the basics. There were no televisions, telephones, and certainly no wifi. The only means of communication with the outside world was five radios, used strictly for emergencies. Juma Lodge. Image: Marina Lopes The lodge was packed with overworked businessmen, european lawyers and a high schooler looking for a college essay topic. The first days were pure bliss. I went on a midnight hike through the jungle, learned how to crack open vines to get drinking water in the wild and hunted alligators in the moonlight. I journaled and reflected on life as I watched the sunset. I had no idea what was happening beyond my immediate surroundings. But halfway through the week, withdrawal took over. The heat and stillness leveled me and I needed a break from my own mind. I wondered about the Twittersphere. What was I missing? Which videos went viral, what did the latest election polls show, who Taylor Swift was dating? But with no option to cheat on my detox, I pushed the thoughts away and learned how to build shelter from banana leaves instead. I was startled a few days later, when on a rickety boat halfway to the mainland, my phone buzzed alive. I slowly swiped it on, submerging myself back into civilization. It turns out the internet hadn’t missed me nearly as much as I missed it. Within five minutes, I was all caught up. With a sigh of relief, I turned my phone off and enjoyed the last few hours of my vacation. Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.

Rumored Specs and Other Expected Devices Revealed By Christian Ver Marcelo Oct 7, 2016 | 3:05 AM Microsoft has really racked up their device lineup over the years with tablets, 2-in-1s and desktop devices. This October, the tech giant is set to release new devices and many fans are excited to see the outcome. Microsoft Hardware Event The tech giant has no doubt saturated the tech market with all their hardware and software offerings. There's the Windows OS environment, the Xbox consoles, and the multi-platform Surface devices. Of these devices, however, fans have been most eagerly waiting for the next generation of Surface devices to come. As Microsoft is set to host an event this month, will we see the new Surface devices? Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Surface Pro 5 Microsoft remains silent regarding concrete updates regarding the next generation Surface Pro 5. However, reports have stated that the hybrid device will sport impressive specs that will make the Surface Pro 5 stand out among the highly saturated tech market. They have also stated that the device will definitely be one of the highlights of the event. The Surface Pro 5 is set to feature the new Windows 10 Redstone 2 update as its operating system. Along with this, the Intel Kaby Lake chipset is predicted to make an appearance to be the main device processor. The Surface Pro 5 is also rumored to come with a tremendous 16GB of RAM, coupled with at least 128GB of internal storage. The 16-megapixel rear camera is also improved, along with the 8-megapixel front snapper. The Surface Pro 5 may also come with a 4K display on a 3840-pixel resolution screen. The upgraded screen will definitely be ideal for all types of media consumption. It may also come in at least two variants, with the base model sporting at least a Quad-HD screen resolution. A USB Type-C is also expected to appear in the new Surface Pro 5, along with an improved Surface Pen and Keyboard cover. Surface Book 2 The other half of the Surface hybrid device lineup is the Surface Book. No concrete details are out yet regarding the Surface Book 2, but it is rumored to feature equally powerful specs as the Surface Pro 5 mentioned above. However, release of these devices may come at a later time due to the procurement of the processors, which will be shipping next year. AIO Surface PC The next All-in-One PC from Microsoft is also set to be announced at the event. Adding to the hype and excitement is the new Surface keyboard that features an all new ergonomic design. A new Surface mouse will also be introduced. The most premium specs are also expected of this device, similar to the Surface Pro 5.

Microsoft makes patch data RESTful Mostly-forgotten silicon-maker Zilog is alive and has just released a new product that shares a little DNA with the Z80 CPU that powered many of the earliest mass-market microcomputers. The Z80 famously powered Sinclair's iconic ZX 80, ZX 81 and Spectrum computers. The CPU also made it into the Radio Shack TRS-80, the Osborne 1, the Microbee and many more machines. The CPU was compatible with Intel's 8080 and was arguably better and cheaper too, but before long the IBM PC came along and that meant a decade or three of difficulty for just about all PC CPU makers other than Intel. Zilog and the Z80 persisted, though, despite bankruptcy, acquisition and many adventures. Today it is a subsidiary of Dutch semiconductor concern IXYS, which keeps the brand alive. So what's Zilog up to now? Well on Thursday this week, Zilog announced “ the IXRD1004 - High Power Two-Phase Digital Power Factor Correction (PFC) reference design … based on Zilog’s 8-bit Z8F6481 microcontroller, a member of the Z8 Encore! XP F6482 series of microcontrollers.” The Z8 Encore! is the heir to the Z8, a microcontroller that debuted in 1979 and offered a completely different architecture to the Z80. The two did, however, have very similar instruction sets and assembly syntax. Hence our “very, very distant relative” description in the subhead. Zilog says the new product “provides a platform for developing a number of power management solutions such as electric vehicle chargers, air conditioning systems, high-power LED lighting, and welding equipment.” Okay, okay, that's not something many of you will use any time soon. But if nothing else it is nice to know Zilog's still around, and still relevant. If only so that those of us who remember the company's heyday can say the same. More information on the device and code to make it work can be found here. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 57 Comments More from The Register World eats its 10 millionth Raspberry Pi Humble Pi most successful British 'puter in history 55 Comments Raspberry Pi adds PIXEL eye candy to desktop Raspbian gets user interface makeover and Chromium browser 13 Comments Raspberry Pi Zero gains a camera connector 30,000 hot Pis in stores now and factory ready to bake plenty more 24 Comments Citrix bakes up Raspberry Pi client boxes Tiny 'puters find a niche in virtual desktops 46 Comments Raspberry Pi 3 tops SBC poll for self-brew hackers and Linux folk Mmm, lovely fresh new Pi 31 Comments Android might be on the way to the Raspberry Pi A new tree sprouts on android.googlesource.com 15 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Yahoo case brings back the Edward Snowden effect USA TODAY 07/10/2016 Elizabeth Weise © Thomas Kienzle, epa Edward Snowden appears from Russia to people in Stuttgart, Germany, in 2014. SAN FRANCISCO — The Edward Snowden effect just made an encore, thanks to a report  Yahoo has been scanning incoming emails on behalf of U.S. intelligence officials.  And it's likely to take a few more bows. U.S. technology companies, already in defensive mode thanks to the former NSA contractor's revelations of a mass government surveillance program in 2013, are even more data-hungry today and therefore more on edge.  From big data to the cloud to artificial intelligence you can talk to in your kitchen, the tech world is busy spinning the straw of information it gathers about users into gold. While the privacy of corporate data has long been a concern among civil libertarians, a consumer flashpoint came when former NSA contractor Snowden released a trove of classified information about a mass NSA phone spying program. A federal appeals court later ruled the bulk collection of phone data was illegal under the Patriot Act, but the damage to the reputation of U.S. computer companies was done. The Snowden effect — heightened public fear about information security and privacy in the wake of his revelations — looms large as the power of the data troves being amassed by companies grows. The potential to gain an edge with this data and sophisticated systems that model human behavior has been guiding big shifts in corporate strategy. Some of the most recent include Microsoft's purchase of LinkedIn and Salesforce's interest in the professional network as well as Twitter (both seen as plays for data); aggressive expansion into cloud computing by Microsoft, Google and Intel; and a stream of artificial intelligence-powered devices like Google’s new Pixel phone and Home speaker, which aim to use your responses to make a "personal Google." With an estimated 1 billion active users a month worldwide and 81 million active Yahoo Mail users in the United States, Yahoo is a nexus for such data. On Wednesday a federal law enforcement official told USA TODAY that the government directive ordering Yahoo to scan customer emails was issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. That's the closed  court in Washington D.C. that oversees requests for surveillance warrants for foreign intelligence purposes. The directive asked Yahoo to essentially sift through incoming email streams for a digital signature associated with a known terror organization.   Unresolved issues While the Yahoo saga is still developing, the questions it raises show the dilemmas faced by companies with a voracious need for data about their customers but also a user base that might turn on them should they find the companies have aided the government in spying on them. Simmering under the surface is a fraught, unresolved legal and public battle between U.S. tech companies and the U.S. government over user privacy on the one hand and the need for intelligence in an age of terrorism on the other. Multiple recent legal battles highlight the tension.  In July, a court ruled that Microsoft couldn't be forced to give the U.S. government e-mails stored in Ireland that are part of a U.S. drug investigation. It's expected the ruling will be appealed possibly all the way to the Supreme Court. Apple fought the Department of Justice for 43 days earlier this year over whether the computer company should be forced to overwrite the software to hack into an iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. The dispute ended only when the FBI found another way into the phone.  Last October the 15-year old Safe Harbor pact, which created a legal framework for data transfers between the United States and the European Union, was declared invalid by the European Court of Justice over concerns about the U.S. mass surveillance Snowden revealed. It was replaced by a more transparent agreement, the Privacy Shield, in July.  News of Yahoo's possible capitulation to a much broader U.S. sweep of its data than ever before reported will likely cause more European concern.  “Without a doubt lots of European regulators will be pointing to this as exactly the sort of thing they were concerned about,” said Scott Vernick, an information security and privacy partner at the law firm of Fox Rothschild in Philadelphia. The European Union is also investigating Facebook for possible misuse of data, on the theory that it is so dominate in several European countries that people are accepting a lower degree of privacy for their personal data because they feel they must use the service.  Privacy, monetization and investment In terms of business models, most large tech companies would wither if they lost access to information about their users’ online lives. “They certainly don’t want to lock it away from themselves – they absolute need it to monetize it,” said Jeff Pollard, a privacy and security analyst with Forrester, a consulting company. The rise of chat bots and artificial intelligence (AI) agents is a case in point. Amazon has invested heavily in its popular and groundbreaking Alexa digital assistant, which learns not just users' voices but also their preferences so it can make better guesses at what they're asking for.   Facebook hopes its Messenger chat bot will allow businesses to talk to, and more importantly sell to, customers by providing "really awesome experiences," in the words of the project head, David Marcus. Those experiences get better the more the AI knows about the user, allowing it to make better-educated guesses about their needs and desires. Samsung just this week announced it was buying Viv, machine-learning virtual assistant company started by Siri founder Dag Kittlaus. But as he acknowledged, smarter smartphones will have to deal with balancing consumer's desire for privacy with the artificial intelligence's voracious need for more data about them. So far, all the big U.S. tech companies are saying they were not asked to do what Yahoo is said to have done, and if they had been, they would have fought it. In Apple's words, "We have never received a request of this type. If we were to receive one, we would oppose it in court." How this dilemma will ultimately be resolved is unclear, with experts saying many legal battles are likely still ahead and a possible growing chasm between what's acceptable in the United States and in Europe. Long term, pushback could come not just from consumers, but investors themselves. Michael Gordon CEO of Group Gordon, a New York-based corporate and crisis public relations firm, said companies such as Yahoo that collect massive amounts of user data must tread carefully.  Once a company gets stuck with a label of lackluster data protection, he said, “investors or users will automatically assume the worst.”  Elizabeth Weise covers technology and cybersecurity for USA TODAY.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Tesla Radar, MobilEye fight and the Comma One $1,000 add-on-box Submitted by brad on Sat, 2016-09-17 17:13. Robocars Tesla’s spat with MobilEye reached a new pitch this week, and Tesla announced a new release of their autopilot and new plans. As reported here earlier, MobilEye announced during the summer that they would not be supplying the new and better versions of their EyeQ system to Tesla. Since that system was and is central to the operation of the Telsa autopilot, they may have been surprised that MBLY stock took a big hit after that announcement (though it recovered for a while and is now back down) and TSLA did not. Statements and documents now show a nastier battle, with MobilEye intimating they were worried about Tesla using their tool in an unsafe way, invoking all the debate about the fatality and other crashes allegedly caused by people who are lulled into not bothering to supervise the autopilot. Tesla says that instead they have been developing their own advanced vision tools, and that MobilEye was afraid of that and told Tesla that if they wanted more EyeQ chips, they would need to halt the competing project and commit to ME. That’s a nasty spat. Tesla’s own efforts represent a threat to MobilEye from the growing revolution in neural network pattern matchers. Computer vision is going through a big revolution. MobilEye is a big player in that revolution, because their ASICs do both standard machine vision functions and can do neural networks. An ASIC will beat a general purpose processor when it comes to cost, speed and power, but only if the ASIC’s abilities were designed to solve those particular problems. Since it takes years to bring an ASIC to production, you have to aim right. MobilEye aimed pretty well, but at the same time lots of research out there is trying to aim even better, or do things with more general purpose chips like GPUs. Soon we will see ASICs aimed directly at neural network computations. To solve the problem with neural networks, you need the computing horsepower, and you need well designed deep network architectures, and you need the right training data and lots of it. Tesla and ME both are gaining lots of training data. Many companies, including Nvidia, Intel and others are working on the hardware for neural networks. Most people would point to Google as the company with the best skills in architecting the networks, though there are many doing interesting work there. (Google’s DeepMind built the tools that beat humans at the seemingly impossible game of Go, for example.) It’s definitely a competitive race. Using Radar While Tesla works on their vision systems, they also announced a plan to make much more use of radar. That’s an interesting plan. Radar has been the poor 3rd-class sensor of the robocar, after LIDAR and vision. Everybody uses it — you would be crazy not to unless you need to be very low cost. Radar sees further than the other systems, and it tells you immediately how fast any radar target you see is moving relative to you. It sees through fog and other weather, and it can even see under and around big cars in front of you as it bounces off the road and other objects. It’s really good at licence plates as well. What radar doesn’t have is high resolution. Today’s automotive radars have gotten good enough to tell you what lane an object like another car is in, but they are not designed to have any vertical resolution — you will get radar returns from a stalled car ahead of you on the road and a sign above that lane, and not be sure of the difference. You need your car to avoid a stalled car in your lane, but you can’t have a car that hits the brakes every time it sees a road sign or bridge! Real world radar is messy. Your antennas send out and receive from a very broad cone with potential signals from other directions and from side lobes. Reflections are coming from vehicles and road users but also from the ground, hills, trees, fences, signs, bushes and bridges. It’s work to get reliable information from it. Early automotive radars found the best solution was to use the doppler speed information, and discard all returns from anything that wasn’t moving towards or away from you — including stalled cars and cross traffic. One thing that can help (imperfectly) is a map. You can know where the bridges and signs are so you don’t brake for them. Now you can brake for the stalled cars and the cross traffic the Tesla failed to see. You still have an issue with a stalled car under a bridge or sign, but you’re doing a lot better. There’s a lot of room for improvement in radar, and I will presume — Tesla has not said — that Tesla plans to work on this. The automotive radars everybody buys (from companies like Bosch) were made for the ADAS market — adaptive cruise control, emergency braking etc. It is possible to design new radars with more resolution (particularly in the vertical) and other approaches. You can also try for more resolution, particularly by splitting the transmitter and receiver to produce a synthetic larger aperture. You can go into different bands and get more bandwidth and get more resolution in general. You can play more software tricks, and most particularly, you can learn by examining not just single radar returns, but rather the pattern of returns over time. (After all, humans don’t navigate from still frames, we depend on our visual system’s deep evolved ability to use motion and other clues to understand the world.) The neural networks are making strides here. For example, while pedestrians produce basic radar returns, it turns out that their walking stride has a particular pattern of changes that can be identified by neural networks. People are doing research now on how examining the moving and dynamic pattern of radar returns can help you get more resolution and also identify shapes and motion patterns of objects and figure out what they are. I will also speculate that it might be possible to return to a successor of the “sweeped” radars of old, the ones we are used to seeing in old war movies. Modern car radars don’t scan like that, but I have to wonder if with new techniques, like phased arrays to steer virtual beams (already the norm in military radar) and modern high speed electronics, that we might produce radars that get a better sense of where their target is. We’re also getting better at sensor fusion — identifying a radar target in an image or LIDAR return to help learn more about it. The one best way to improve radar resolution would be to use more bandwidth. There have been experiments in using ultrawideband signals in the very high frequencies which may offer promise. As the name suggests, UWB uses a very wide band, and it distributes its energy over that very wide band, which means it doesn’t put too much energy into any one band, and has less chance of interfering in those bands. It’s also possible that the FCC, seeing the tremendous public value that reliable robocars offer, might consider opening up more spectrum for use in radar applications using modern techniques, and thus increase the resolution. In other words, Tesla is wise to work on getting more from radar. With the loss of all MobilEye’s vision tools, they will have to work hard to duplicate and surpass that. For now, Tesla is committed to using parts that are for sale for existing production cars, costing hundreds of dollars. That has taken LIDAR “off their radar” even though almost all research teams depend on LIDAR and expect LIDAR to be cheap in a couple of years. (Including the LIDAR from Quanergy, a company I advise.) Comma announces a $1,000 autopilot box I wrote earlier about comma.ai and their efforts to drive with just vision, radar and neural networks. They now plan to offer a box for $1,000 to give you some basic autopilot functionlity as an add-on. To do this, they are working with only some specific car models, namely some Honda vehicles that already have advanced ADAS in them. Using the car’s internal bus, they can talk to the sensors in these cars (in particular the radar, since the Comma One has a camera) and also send control signals to actuate the steering, brakes and throttle. Then their neural networks can take the sensor information, and output the steering and speed commands to keep you in the lane. (Details are scant so I don’t know if the Comma One box uses its own camera or depends on access to the car’s.) When I rode in Comma’s prototype it certainly wasn’t up to the level of the Tesla autopilot or some others, but it has been several months so I can’t judge it now. Like the Tesla autopilot, the Comma will not be safe enough to drive the car on its own, and you will need to supervise and be ready to intervene at any time. If you get complacent, as some Tesla drivers have, you could get injured or killed. I have yet to learn what measures Comma will take to make sure people keep their eyes on the road. Generally, I feel that autopilots are not very exciting products when you have to watch them all the time — as you do — and also that bolt-on products are also not particularly exciting. Cruise’s initial plan (after they abandoned valet parking) was a bolt-on autopilot, but they soon switched to trying to build a real vehicle, and that got them the huge $700M sale to General Motors. But for Comma, there is a worthwhile angle. Users of this bolt-on box will be helping to provide training data to improve their systems. In fact they will be paying for the privilege of testing the system and training it. Something that companies like Google did the old fashioned way, paying a staff of professionals to drive the cars and gather data. For a tiny, young startup it’s a worthwhile approach. » brad's blog "Nvidia, Intel and others Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sun, 2016-09-18 14:22. "Nvidia, Intel and others are working on the hardware for neural networks." -- Google has already deployed them: https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine... -- "Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a custom ASIC we built specifically for machine learning". » reply Yes, this is well known Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-09-18 15:02. In fact the TPUs were used in the Go victory described. At present I have not seen indication Google plans to sell them, though you can rent them in Google’s cloud offerings in theory. » reply "can talk to the sensors in Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sun, 2016-09-18 14:37. "can talk to the sensors in these cars (in particular the radar, since it has a camera)" -- this is very confusing: there is no camera inside the radar (or is there?). From Hotz' presentation (https://youtu.be/AerjS7PTNYs?t=7m24s) they are using existing radar and *their own* camera contained in the kit. » reply Corrected the wording for you Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-09-18 15:00. Since the “it” in the clause is the Comma One. Obviously there is no camera in the radar. There are cameras in these cars, and in theory a tool could use them if you could get on their bus and they output the video, but Comma wants a better performance camera. » reply echolocation Submitted by Dave Brown (not verified) on Wed, 2016-09-21 19:00. Any idea if echolocation might be a viable alternative? Bats seem to navigate well with it. » reply Quite common Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-09-22 10:08. A large fraction of cars today come with ultrasonic sensors, which are very inexpensive. They are generally only quite short range, so they are used primarily in parking and low speed operations. Even if you could use sound long range, it only goes about one foot per ms, so something 100’ away would not ping back until 200ms, which is kinda long. » reply Bats Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-23 07:02. Bats don't move at 100 mph, even the fastest bats don't reach 100 km/h(62.5 mph) and they move through open air with their top speed(which very much unlike car traffic), while around obstacles they move much slower. Sound doesn't travel that fast, especially when compared to EM radiation like light and radar waves, which move approximately a million times faster and the current ultrasonic sensors on cars have a very limited range, they're good for detecting a car in an adjacent lane, but not one moving towards you. » reply CPU & GPU upgrades Submitted by GMcK (not verified) on Thu, 2016-10-06 20:47. With all this activity on custom ASICs, neural network chips and the like, it'll be interesting to see if any car manufacturer decides to take the next step beyond over the air software updates and put upgradable driving computers in their cars. I've upgraded the RAM and hard drive on almost every PC I've ever owned, and I bought my latest PC with the explicit intention to have a GPU upgrade as an option. But then there's my phone without even a microSD card for upgrades... If car manufacturers stay with the "no upgrades possible" path that they're currently on, it'll be another reason to never buy another car, and either lease and get annual upgrades with next year's model, or go on-demand and get continual upgrades, as long as there's enough competition or regulation to keep the fleet's capability current in the face of cost-cutting pressures. Pricing tiers that would make you decide on a ride by ride basis when to pay extra for a smarter vehicle would be no fun. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

The biggest medical breakthroughs in future will not just happen in laboratories and they will certainly no more be a result of some chance discoveries. Almost every breakthrough that happens will have its foundation built on Data Science & Analytics. With its potential of large-scale outcome analysis, pattern recognition & future prediction - data analytics is winning over intuition and judgmental faculties at an increasing rate, seeking an ideal avenue to facilitate decision optimization. Data Science & Analytics are integral components of Internet of Things (IoT) - gearing up to bring robust technology & agile platforms in the market and creating highly attractive opportunities for the healthcare sector. According to a recent research by MarketResearch.com, the IoT market, just in the healthcare segment is poised to hit $117 billion by 2020 with a CAGR of more than 30%. IoTization - Redefining Boundaries of Healthcare Healthcare today is undergoing a radical shift with increasing play of wider ecosystem involving data scientists, aggregators, technology giants & device manufacturers. The future of healthcare will be marked by an ecosystem that will essentially evolve from isolated smart systems to system–of–systems connecting patients, devices & hospitals - with IoT being at the core of this transformation. Smartphones, wearables and other medical devices are increasingly being seen as a replacement for traditional pedometers, Sphygmomanometers (blood pressure monitor), glucometers & calorie counters, and are soon expected to find a significant place in a physician’s diagnostic toolbox. The evolving ecosystem and landscape of connected devices will expand the ability of healthcare providers to customize the treatment for patients, enabling better ways to predict, prevent and cure, improving the longevity of life. IoT – The New Resident Doctor Remote Patient Monitoring solutions and Disease Management Platforms will facilitate better Care Coordination across the Care Continuum by connecting patients with their Physicians and Caregivers in a more effective way. For instance, Intel has collaborated with Michael J. Fox Foundation to improve monitoring and treatment of Parkinson's disease, wherein they are developing a connected platform to detect patients’ patterns, collected through wearable technologies, and monitor symptoms that otherwise go unnoticed during diagnosis. Such integration of technology and analytics is leading to disruption in healthcare industry. IoTization of these solutions will also have the potential to give the Bio–Pharmaceuticals sector ability to disrupt the current ‘old school’ clinical research model with simplified and adaptive Clinical Trial design and implementation of a more patient centric drug development program. IoT enabled remote diagnosis and health checkups can eliminate the need to move patients with chronic illnesses to care homes. For instance, the percentage of people above 60 years of age is expected to rise from 11% to 15% between 2010 and 2020 and close to a billion population suffering from chronic illnesses requires continuous monitoring. Predictive models, along with the insights gleaned from healthcare IoTization, will facilitate the bedbound residents with self-monitoring of their health parameters. Businesses will be able to automate their processes, improve efficiencies and bring the providers closer to the patients by enabling real-time patient access, thus solving some of the biggest challenges in healthcare industry today - time and accessibility. Unprecedented Business Opportunities Empowered by the market need and evolving potential of IoT, new business avenues are being generated for service players to build & deploy smarter platforms in the ecosystem. New Services, along with technology integration are redefining the business model of the healthcare. Businesses will compete on their ability to deliver quantifiable end results in real time and it’s the end result that will begin to command a fee. For instance, Obama care mandates fee-for-outcome per patient where single payment is paid to the hospital for a defined episode of care. All this will require much more automation, better predictability and greater collaboration in healthcare ecosystem to offer a reduced cost of service. Service providers have huge opportunity to ride this technological shift with some of the primary use cases being: • Supply chain optimization: According to Cardinal Health, about $5Bn of medical waste is generated annually owing to ineffective inventory and supply chain tracking. Real-time monitoring & tracking could trigger alerts for automatic replenishment of supplies limiting the costs with increased efficiency • Reduced machine downtime: The average downtime cost for a healthcare related outage per incident is about $690K. According to a McKinsey study, there is potential to save upto $2.5 trillion annually by 2025 on account of the industrial IoT • Reduced turnaround time with process automation:  Continuous tracking of patients’ health through remote monitoring can reduce mortality rates by about 45% and on average firms have potential to realize upto 89% reduction in turnaround time owing to improved connectivity and process automation IoT adoption lies at the core of all these humungous business benefits which will have a direct impact on both top line and bottom line. For instance: at HCL ‘IoT Works’ - we are already witnessing significant increase in traction with our customers, for building solutions in these use cases. With one of the leading partners – just developing a gateway between client’s sterilization and verification devices helped improve device uptime by 27%, reduced field visit costs by 18%, and eliminated manual data reconciliation, ultimately leading to a significant improvement in equipment sales. The time to act is now! The emergence of the new IoTized healthcare ecosystem, with IoT being the glue binding the parts together poses a set of opportunities as well as challenges. Efficiencies and experiences will improve manifold, while we will become more vulnerable to security and privacy threats with increasingly sensitive data being generated and getting accessible. This double edged sword of IoTized Healthcare is sure to swing its way to prominence in the years to come; the difference between having the edge and being edged out boils down to how well organizations understand IoT and start acting towards building a strategy today.

They knew that the laws of physics had set a 5-nanometer threshold on the size of transistor gates among conventional semiconductors, about one-quarter the size of high-end 20-nanometer-gate transistors now on the market. Some laws are made to be broken, or at least challenged. Schematic of a transistor with a molybdenum disulfide channel and 1-nanometer carbon nanotube gate.

(Credit: Qingxiao Wang/UT Dallas) Science - MoS2 transistors with 1-nanometer gate lengths A research team led by faculty scientist Ali Javey at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has done just that by creating a transistor with a working 1-nanometer gate. For comparison, a strand of human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick. “We made the smallest transistor reported to date,” said Javey, lead principal investigator of the Electronic Materials program in Berkeley Lab’s Materials Science Division. “The gate length is considered a defining dimension of the transistor. We demonstrated a 1-nanometer-gate transistor, showing that with the choice of proper materials, there is a lot more room to shrink our electronics.” The key was to use carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), an engine lubricant commonly sold in auto parts shops. MoS2 is part of a family of materials with immense potential for applications in LEDs, lasers, nanoscale transistors, solar cells, and more. The findings were published today in the journal Science. Other investigators on this paper include Jeff Bokor, a faculty senior scientist at Berkeley Lab and a professor at UC Berkeley; Chenming Hu, a professor at UC Berkeley; Moon Kim, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas; and H.S. Philip Wong, a professor at Stanford University. The development could be key to keeping alive Intel co-founder Gordon Moore’s prediction that the density of transistors on integrated circuits would double every two years, enabling the increased performance of our laptops, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics. “The semiconductor industry has long assumed that any gate below 5 nanometers wouldn’t work, so anything below that was not even considered,” said study lead author Sujay Desai, a graduate student in Javey’s lab. “This research shows that sub-5-nanometer gates should not be discounted. Industry has been squeezing every last bit of capability out of silicon. By changing the material from silicon to MoS2, we can make a transistor with a gate that is just 1 nanometer in length, and operate it like a switch.” When ‘electrons are out of control’ Transistors consist of three terminals: a source, a drain, and a gate. Current flows from the source to the drain, and that flow is controlled by the gate, which switches on and off in response to the voltage applied. Both silicon and MoS2 have a crystalline lattice structure, but electrons flowing through silicon are lighter and encounter less resistance compared with MoS2. That is a boon when the gate is 5 nanometers or longer. But below that length, a quantum mechanical phenomenon called tunneling kicks in, and the gate barrier is no longer able to keep the electrons from barging through from the source to the drain terminals. “This means we can’t turn off the transistors,” said Desai. “The electrons are out of control.” Because electrons flowing through MoS2 are heavier, their flow can be controlled with smaller gate lengths. MoS2 can also be scaled down to atomically thin sheets, about 0.65 nanometers thick, with a lower dielectric constant, a measure reflecting the ability of a material to store energy in an electric field. Both of these properties, in addition to the mass of the electron, help improve the control of the flow of current inside the transistor when the gate length is reduced to 1 nanometer. Once they settled on MoS2 as the semiconductor material, it was time to construct the gate. Making a 1-nanometer structure, it turns out, is no small feat. Conventional lithography techniques don’t work well at that scale, so the researchers turned to carbon nanotubes, hollow cylindrical tubes with diameters as small as 1 nanometer. They then measured the electrical properties of the devices to show that the MoS2 transistor with the carbon-nanotube gate effectively controlled the flow of electrons. “This work demonstrated the shortest transistor ever,” said Javey, who is also a UC Berkeley professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences. “However, it’s a proof of concept. We have not yet packed these transistors onto a chip, and we haven’t done this billions of times over. We also have not developed self-aligned fabrication schemes for reducing parasitic resistances in the device. But this work is important to show that we are no longer limited to a 5-nanometer gate for our transistors. Moore’s Law can continue a while longer by proper engineering of the semiconductor material and device architecture.” A flatter route to shorter channels High-performance silicon transistors can have gate channel lengths as short as 5 nm before source-drain tunneling and loss of electrostatic control lead to unacceptable leakage current when the device is off. Desai et al. explored the use of MoS2 as a gate material, given that its electronic properties as thin layers should limit such leakage. A transistor with a 1-nm physical gate was constructed with a MoS2 bilayer gate and a single-walled carbon nanotube gate electrode. Excellent switching characteristics and an on-off state current ratio of ∼10^6 were observed. Abstract Scaling of silicon (Si) transistors is predicted to fail below 5-nanometer (nm) gate lengths because of severe short channel effects. As an alternative to Si, certain layered semiconductors are attractive for their atomically uniform thickness down to a monolayer, lower dielectric constants, larger band gaps, and heavier carrier effective mass. Here, we demonstrate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) transistors with a 1-nm physical gate length using a single-walled carbon nanotube as the gate electrode. These ultrashort devices exhibit excellent switching characteristics with near ideal subthreshold swing of ~65 millivolts per decade and an On/Off current ratio of ~106. Simulations show an effective channel length of ~3.9 nm in the Off state and ~1 nm in the On state.

Eliran Rubin Oct 07, 2016 3:15 AM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Artist’s rendering of Mercedes-Benz’s projected autonomous car. Opinion Self-driven Israeli car industry is heading for a crash If you would ask the average Israeli about their country’s involvement in the auto industry, they would probably sum it up with Mobileye, the auto collision avoidance and self-drive tech company, along with navigational app Waze, which was sold to Google. Those with a more historical perspective might also mention the Susita, from the country’s defunct auto industry. The global automobile industry has been centered in the United States, Germany and Japan, but as with other sectors that are being transformed by technology, Israel is becoming a powerhouse when it comes to certain aspects of the car industry. New technology is making the automotive industry smarter and more efficient, and is ultimately also headed toward the widespread production of self-driving cars. These developments have transformed an industry that used to be based primarily on sheet metal and iron into one increasingly reliant on software. In addition to the car manufacturers’ own efforts on this score, tech giants such as Google and Apple have ventured into the fray. And then there is Israel’s prominence in the field, which even in the past several months is reflected in Volkswagen’s investment of a whopping $300 million in the Israeli firm Gett (formerly Gett Taxi), as part of its effort to create a shared fleet of smart vehicles. And in July, Mobileye signed a collaboration agreement with BMW and Intel for the production of a self-driving car. In other developments, NNG, the developer of iGO navigation software, bought the Bnei Brak-based automotive cyber firm Arilou and the Israeli firm Saips, which is involved in the development of complex algorithms, was sold in August to Ford Motor for a figure estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. And the list goes on. Last month Volkswagen became a 40% partner in a new cyber security firm in which former Shin Bet security agency head Yuval Diskin is involved. As far back as 2010, General Motors spotted the potential that Israeli talent offered in the field and established a research and development center in Herzliya. Daimler Mercedes-Benz, which local industry sources say is also showing great interest in Israel, is expected to follow suit in the coming months. “There are now about 100 processors in a car and the more that [automotive] technology shifts in the direction of using software, Israel has an increasing advantage,” Yahal Zilka, a founder and partner at the Israeli firm Magma Venture Partners, which has already invested in four smart vehicle firms, tells TheMarker. “It will have an impact on all of us, and Israeli high-tech will have a substantial part in it.” There has been virtually an airlift of automotive executives who have visited Israel in recent months to meet with local companies in the field, he adds. Confusing coverage Media coverage of the future of the auto industry is a bit confusing, however, focusing primarily on self-driving car technology. Analysts at the Boston Consulting Group predict that the driverless car sector will be worth $42 billion by 2025, but in the meantime, car manufacturers and high-tech firms are talking about other transportation solutions such as the ride-sharing that Uber has made ubiquitous in some parts of the world. There are two major functions that will determine what the automotive industry of the future looks like: control and ownership, says accountant Tal Chen, a partner at Deloitte Israel. The control function involves either a human driver or automated control, and when it comes to ownership there is the dichotomy of self-ownership or shared transportation, he says. Chen cited recent comments by an auto industry executive who noted the rapid acceleration in the pace of change that the industry is expected to undergo and said the automakers want to be substantial players in this “ecosystem.” For his part, however, lawyer Itay Frishman, who heads the high-tech and venture capital group at the law firm of Gross, Kleinhendler Hodak, is more cautious. “It’s not necessarily the best startups that will be successful,” he says. “The automotive industry doesn’t want to step on its own toes. It needs technology, but it is also threatened by it, so success is dependent on whom the major corporations will be comfortable working with.” Most of the deals, he says, are cooperative ventures, which is different from how most startups work. The process is slower and startups need to have patience, he adds. Another challenge for startups in the field is regulation, Frishman notes, explaining that it is a new field presenting unfamiliar issues such as liability regarding self-driving cars. The main technology fields related to the car industry include the development of various kinds of chips; communications; big data and analytics; artificial intelligence; and above it all, there is the looming threat of cyber attacks. And there is also the challenge in the development of self-driving cars of integrating the range of technology so that the various features communicate with one another, making the journey safer and more comfortable. For his part, Zilka says all of these fields are ones that Israel has particular expertise in thanks to Israeli academics and the defense industries. “Everyone has noted that we have special talents here, and I am not just talking about cyber security. Back in the 1990s, Israel was a communications powerhouse and Israel is a leader in the radar field as well.” The expertise that Israel has in a number of fields also applies to the automotive sector, he adds. Valens’ accidental connection One of the more interesting Israeli high-tech stories, which is related to the car industry almost by happenstance, involves the Hod Hasharon-based company Valens, which is now considered an influential force when it comes to cars of the future. Established in 2006 by six people, all of whom are still with the company, Valens develops chips based on technology called HDBaseT, which provides connectivity using Ethernet cables among various video products. It’s used mainly for conference rooms, conferences and public facilities such as shopping malls and airports. Valens CEO Dror Yerushalmi explains that his company’s technology has allowed for the use of one cable instead of a multiplicity of lines. The company has managed to establish the industry standard. Last year it won the television Emmy award in the United States in the field of technology, along with other recipients including HBO, Netflix and DirectTV. Along the way, however, about two years ago, Valens was surprised to attract the attention of senior executives of a major auto manufacturer that Valens asked not be named. The automaker realized that the audio-visual technology that was Valens’ mainstay would be a nearly critical component for high-tech vehicles and self-driving cars. Magma Venture Capital’s Zilka says the industry recognized the problem presented by the increase in data that needed to be handled in the vehicles, but explains that cables can be heavy, which is a major concern for the industry. Yerushalmi, of Valens, says the ability to carry a number of streams of data in one cable therefore becomes all that more important. Although the quantity of cables is small in most cars now, the more that accessories such as cameras, sensors and data processors are added to the vehicle, the more light-weight cables will be required. TheMarker’s interview at Valens was cut short by a group of senior executives from a German technology firm that was interested in Valens’ knowhow. Mobileye was the pioneer The Israeli company considered the pioneer on a global scale in the automotive sector and which in many respects has promoted Israel’s prowess in the field, along with Waze, is Mobileye. The Jerusalem-based company developed a system based on artificial intelligence that includes a camera and computer vision capabilities to prevent accidents. It knows when a driver drifts out of lane or gets too close to another vehicle or a pedestrian and can also sense rapid acceleration or deceleration. Now in addition, it is considered a leader in efforts to develop self-driving cars, or autonomous cars as they are sometimes called. The company is publicly traded at a market value of $9.5 billion and has collaborative relations with major car manufacturers including Audi, BMW, Tesla Motors, General Motors, Hyundai, Renault-Nissan and Volvo. In addition to Mobileye’s camera-based technology, there is a need for radar and laser technology to improve visibility at night and in fog. Innoviz is a young Israeli startup in the field that is developing sensors and visual processors for use in self-driving vehicles in conditions of difficult visibility. The company is developing a laser sensor that is being used by Google in its autonomous vehicle project, providing a detailed, three-dimensional picture of the car’s surroundings. Founded this year, Innoviz raised $9 million a few months ago. Another aspect of self-driving car technology involves what is called V2V or vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The field includes two Israeli companies, Otonomo and AutoTalks, which compete with chipmaker NXP. Founded in 2008, Otonomo develops technology related to radio communications among vehicles, with the aim of creating a system in which each vehicle broadcasts its location along with other data on its movement, including its velocity or use of its steering wheel or brakes. But the connectivity technology in highly sophisticated cars also raises the prospect that hackers could break into various systems. Israel is considered a leader in the field of information security and a number of entrepreneurs have already spotted the potential that the automotive field offers. In fact, five of the eight automotive cyber security companies worldwide are Israeli. The first in Israel was Arilou, in which Israeli firm NNG recently acquired a 60% stake for $10 million. In addition, in January, the global car entertainment systems company Harman International bought another Israeli firm, TowerSec, for $70 million. And just weeks ago, Diskin announced the creation of his new company in the field, CyMotiv, which he established with two partners in cooperation with Volkswagen, which has a 40% stake in the firm. The company, Diskin said, will without question be run from Israel.

This has created opportunity in that market that Hewlett-Packard is consciously exploiting. The Best Surprise is No Surprise Apple keeps secrets for good reason. The PC market remains very competitive, and there are several companies who have been emulating Apple’s designs and coveting Apple’s image and success in the notebook market. Apple has a history of developing breakthrough designs that leave the competition gasping. But they’ve been catching up. HP ZBook. 120 sent to NASA’s space station. Runs Linux. That said, the enterprise and technical markets do need some occasional care and feeding when it comes to professional, mission critical equipment. Just as Apple’s product cycle can get out of sync with Intel’s, technical professionals engaged in design, research and computation need to depend on a long-term vision from their favorite computer supplier. Over the past few years, signs of inattention to these markets have emerged from Cupertino. All this has been documented elsewhere, so I won’t rehash it in detail except to point to the long-awaited 2013 Mac Pro, Apple’s grand opening fanfare and then its subsequent abandonment: 1,000+ days of silence. The demise of apple.com/science and the absent attention to the eventually terminated, obsolete Thunderbolt display and the end of support for Aperture sent unmistakable messages that weren’t explained or remedied by new initiatives. Hewlett-Packard Has Noticed HP has had its ups and downs in recent years, but it remains a strong engineering company that caters to technical professionals. HP has a storied tradition in everything for technical professionals from handheld calculators to measurement and instrumentation to UNIX workstations to supercomputers. Along the way, I have become aware of certain initiatives by Hewlett-Packard and have engaged the company in conversation about its initiatives. Perhaps the most visible sign so far was my long odyssey, looking for a new display for my Mac Pro culminating in a review of HP’s magnificent Z34c 34-inch display. See: “The Display You’ve Always Wanted For Your Mac: HP Z34c.” HP’s amazing Z34c curved display. (3440 x 1440) Further discussions have resulted in an affirmation that HP both recognizes the opportunity created by Apple and is eager to exploit it. My HP representative provided some insight. Note that the following statement may seem like market-speak, but that’s not the point. The point is that HP is hereby punctuating its interest in catering to technical professionals who feel abandoned by Apple, rightly or wrongly. HP’s Z Family of professional workstation-class products is focused on meeting the needs of the world’s most demanding users. HP has a heritage of engineering excellence, and has been delighting customers with workstations innovations for more than 35 years. Today, HP Z Desktop Workstations, ZBook Mobile Workstations, and Z Displays are used to design everything from running shoes and racecars to animated characters and deep-sea submersibles, as well as to manage research labs, mission-critical IT environments and billions of dollars of tradable securities. HP Z products are designed to meet the needs of some of the most compute-intensive industries, including animation, film/video editing, graphic design, CAD, architecture, photography, high-definition video, manufacturing, finance, healthcare, scientific imaging and oil and gas exploration. At the beginning of the century, four key players manufactured traditional workstations: Silicon Graphics, Sun, IBM and HP. Today, HP is the only surviving and thriving workstation vendor of those four. In just a few short years, HP went from a distant second in the market to No. 1 in workstation shipments worldwide. In support of this initiative, HP has developed, if you will, a reverse switcher site, called Mac to Z. Looking at that page’s comparison chart to a Mac Pro, it’s clear why a workstation like this has technical appeal. Imagine 36 cores and 2 TB of RAM. Next page: computing religion and the Mac’s future. Pages: 1 2 Next Page Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple, HP, Macs 5 Comments Add a comment geoduck October 6, 2016 I just went out to the HP site and configured a Z laptop the way I would a MacBook Pro. It was a bit less in price, by no more than a couple of hundred though. BUT it was a better unit than Apple sells now. I could get a basic unit that I could work with for a couple of years foir a LOT less. Mind you I got it with FreeDOS rather than Win10 which helped the price a bit. I’d nuke and pave it with Linux anyway. But the point is Apple had better knock my socks off. The competition is making a VERY solid case for switching. That is ASSUMING they actually release a new MBP this year. I’m still not getting much buzz about that. Yes a lot of sites are speculating but no hardware photo leaks. No notes from anonymous Apple staff about vacation blackout periods. No rumors from FedEx about big shipments from Apple sitting in warehouses. No leaks of preparations or reservations for venues. Other then sites saying “Yes they always have a Mac event in October” it’s been nothing. Nothing hard. Nothing even squishy but believable. Sites are still nursing the “thinner with an OLED function key row” stories from months ago. The silence is deafening. Today is the 6th. Factor in a 2 week heads up about an upcoming event and that puts you in mid to latter half of the month. The window is closing for the Christmas rush. As my dad would say they need to S or get off the P. October 6, 2016 at 7:33 EST PM MarcusNewton October 7, 2016 The HP workstations are nice options. For me, I like how many different configurations options there are to choose from. Unlike the 1000 day old Mac Pro, I can pick something middle of the road and still add and upgrade things later. Sure the two graphics cards included in the Mac Pro were a good deal at the time it was released, but now a single Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 is more powerful then two D500s. (Based on the D500 having 2.2 teraflops each for a combined 4.4 teraflops, and the solo Nvidia 1080 having 8.2 teraflops floating-point performance). Also, a single GeForce 1080 has a retail price of $599. Yes, I know there is a difference between gaming graphics cards and workstation graphics cards, but the 1080 is so powerful it is easily a poor-mans workstation card. I could take a basic HP 440 workstation with a 1080 graphics card and be totally happy with my budget $1,600 workstation instead of a $2,999 Mac Pro I cannot upgrade and has a single internal hard drive. On the other hand, I think Apple knows that my distaste for Windows will keep me from buying a PC workstation no matter how much I may drool over the options, customization choices, and easily swappable PC hardware. I have tried Blender on Linux, and it works really well, but there is just not enough of other things for me to switch full time. Even though I am hopeful that Apple will fall in love with Macs again, and release a Mac Pro that can compete against the HP workstations, I also fear that minimalism and gimmicks will overrun anything actually useful. I have this reoccurring nightmare that the next Mac Pro double-downs on compactness, and ends up looking like a rounded Sony Playstation. October 7, 2016 at 12:11 EST AM geoduck October 7, 2016 MarcusNewton I use my MacBook for writing, some art, and editing YouTube Videos. For me Linux with OpenOffice, Blender, and Gimp would do most of what I want. Switch to DropBox over iCloud and I’d have nearly everything I need. No, it wouldn’t be as seamlessly integrated as the macOS/iOS ecosystem. There would be a bit of kludgyness. But full function with a bit of awkwardness at a huge savings is tempting. October 7, 2016 at 9:38 EST AM DaveNull October 7, 2016 I’ve been using primarily Macs since the IIci, so I’m not exactly one to switch platforms lightly. But I just made the jump from a MacBook Pro to a PC mobile workstation (albeit a ThinkPad, not a ZBook). These days, Apple makes computers for the masses: *Most* of their users don’t care if the computer has an ethernet port; *most* of them don’t care if there are more than two USB ports; *most* of them don’t care that the RAM is soldered on and the battery glued in; and *most* of them don’t care (or know) that their computer throttles when the CPU cores are pegged. And that’s fine. Different users have different needs. What’s disappointing is that despite its vast financial resources, Apple no longer makes a professional computer for those of us who *do* care about these things. Plenty of companies make “halo” products that aren’t meant to sold to the majority of their customers, but the richest company in the world doesn’t. (Okay, you got me. I forgot about $10K Apple Watches.) Fortunately, I’m finding both Windows and Ubuntu to be more viable alternatives than they once were. I’ll continue to buy Apple’s iToys, because they still make the best gadgets. But as far as I’m concerned, Apple no longer makes the best tools for getting work done. So long, Macintosh, and thanks for the memories. October 7, 2016 at 12:43 EST PM khurt October 9, 2016 The MacBook has one USB-C port for connectivity and power. The target demographic for that computer is fine with the speed of wireless, the iWork Suite, mail and calendar and the Safari browser. For the user base portability is the important feature. The professional user, however, needs speed (Ethernet, memory, CPU, GPU) , access to large amount of external storage and the flexibility of connecting to a large existing base of peripherals — professional audio gear, video and photography gear, displays. These peripherals are expensive and often support older standards — USB, FireWire, HDMI, DVI, VGA. For a professional the most important feature is flexibility. They expect a professional machine to have ports. They don’t want to carry a stack of adapters to add back lost functionality. To use a MacBook as a professional computer I would need a USB-C adapter for HDMI, and VGA and DVI. I would need to connect several external storage devices including thunderbolt, FireWire and USB. For high speed acces to network attached storage I would rather have Ethernet than wireless. October 9, 2016 at 11:28 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Image Source: Forbes Facebook revealed its plans for a new wireless VR set during the Oculus Connect 3 Conference. This event took place during the first week of October at San Jose, California. During the Oculus Connect, visitors could test the first functional prototype for the VR headset. The official code-name for this new device is Project Santa Cruz. The company did not mention when the schedule release is or how exactly this new set will work in the future. Also, due to privacy reasons, visitors could not take any pictures when testing the device. The headset is rudimentary and only has one handheld and the VR glasses. To prove this point, reporters mentioned that most of the internal components of the glasses are visible in the back whiteout no protection. This appearance is because the cooling systems do not work as they intended according to the developers. Mark Zuckerberg believes that the future of VR is Project Santa Cruz Facebook’s CEO explained during the conference that Project Santa Cruz takes the best from VR and blends it with the freedom of having no wires. He then proceeded to talk about the concept behind the glasses. Facebook’ developers just added four cameras to the front and then inserted the GPU, the graphic card and battery to the back of the headset. The system is still under development, but Mark Zuckerberg feels pleased with the results so far. To prove his point, he invited visitors to try the VR set with the two available scenarios. However, Intel and Qualcomm are also developing similar devices with wireless compatibility. All projects are still in their early stages due to the difficulty of fitting an entire computer in the back of a headset, mentioned most journalists that attended the event. Nonetheless, they believe that this concept is promising and is the future of VR. Project Santa Cruz already has some beta games under development During the conference, people could explore two different scenarios with the Santa Cruz VR. The first was a city in flames with interactive fire and citizens. Most of the people and cars that are featured in the city looked pixelated, but their movement was very natural. The second scenario was a simple walk in outer space. This one featured a lot more colors and different sized planets to look from afar. The 3D design and the zero gravity sensation are the main features of this second game. However, other games feature similar interactive systems, and Facebook hopes that Santa Cruz will support them in the future. A good example of this is Killing Floor Incursion, which features complete compatibility with VR systems and their controls. The game even has special features for players who choose to try the Virtual Reality experience with it.

Tech giants are hungry for artificial intelligence. In a race to create the best AI solutions in an increasingly hot sector, U.S. tech behemoths like Alphabet's Google and iPhone maker Apple have been quietly snapping up dozens of artificial intelligence companies over the last five years, according to a recent report from analysis firm CB Insights. The firm's data sheds new light on a trend that's been evolving for years. Nearly 140 private companies working to advance AI technology have been acquired since 2011, including 40 buyouts just this year, CB noted. From Google's Assistant to Apple's Siri; Microsoft's Cortana to Facebook chatbots, tech companies appear to be locked in a fierce competition to create autonomous technology that can understand users' needs, and provide information quickly and reliably, CB Insights noted. In addition, companies like AOL, IBM and Yahoo were also among the acquirers, CB said. The report comes as Silicon Valley makes increasingly aggressive inroads into AI, and last week, Microsoft created an artificial intelligence unit of its own. It's a hot market that research firm Tractica estimates will balloon from $643.7 million in 2016 revenues to $38.8 billion by 2025. show chapters <p>Samsung buys AI firm to take on Apple and Google</p> <p>The purchase will help the tech firm compete with Siri and Alexa in the world of artificial intelligence.</p> Samsung buys AI firm to take on Apple and Google    Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 9:00 AM ET | 04:50 Google has been the most prominent global player, CB noted, with 11 low-key acquisitions in the category. Most recently, the tech giant picked up Api.ai, a platfom used to develop chatbots. Earlier this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company objective was to give each individual user their own Google. And last week, Google unveiled a high-end smartphone, Pixel, and home device installed with its AI software. Google said it believes that the next opportunity is building hardware and software together for better AI. The strategic move pitted the company against Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Corporate giants following closely in purchasing AI companies include Intel and Apple. Apple, which is usually quite about its acquisitions and planning, acquired Turi and Tuplejump recently, according to CB Insights. Earlier this year, Apple acquired an start-up called Emotient which has developed technology that can detect emotions. Not to be outdone, Samsung snapped up startup Viv Labs, amid a growing controversy over reports that its premium Galaxy Note 7 battery was exploding.

DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Twitter Facebook Instagram Google+ RSS Feed DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Cloud How DreamHost Builds Its Cloud: Architecting the Network October 8, 2016 Written by Luke Odom This is the fourth in a series of posts about how DreamHost builds its Cloud products. Written by Luke Odom straight from the data center operations. So far in this series, we have looked at what processors to use in our machines and what drives we should use. The next thing we are going to look at is how to connect all the machines and switches together. Image Source: Flickr We want to make sure we both have enough bandwidth and that it is fully redundant. Ceph recovery is the cluster’s most network-intensive activity. From experience, we knew that we would use 2-4 Gbps during Ceph recovery. To put that into perspective, the average American home has an Internet connectivity speed of 12.6 Mbps. During Ceph recovery, we are using about 4000 Mbps. This means that Category 5e ethernet cable, which is what most consumers are using for networking, isn’t practical. We needed to use a cable capable of 10Gbps. Here, we have 3 options: 1. The first is to use a form of fiber optics. There are different wavelengths and connectors with fiber optics, but they all work the same way. They work by sending light over a long and exceedingly thin strand of glass. The advantage of fiber is that it has very low latency and takes very little power to operate. The switches are also widely available as they use transceivers plugged into SFP+ ports which are very common. The compatibility page of Cumulus,  the software we run on our switches, highlights that every 10G switch but one is using 10G-SFP+ ports so we have many options available if we go with fiber. The big disadvantage to using fiber is its cost. You need dedicated SFP+ cards, as motherboards don’t usually have that built in, and you also need both transceivers and fiber, both of which are very expensive. Fiber is also more delicate than copper-based wires, which introduces a layer of complexity in  running it or working near it. Extreme care is required to avoid breakages. 2. Another similar option is Twinaxial cable, more commonly referred to as TwinAx. TwinAx uses an SPF+ port as well, but instead of a transceiver and a strand of fiber, you have a transceiver built into a copper cable. You still have the expense of the extra card, but a TwinAx cable is a third of the price of a strand of fiber and transceiver. It is also the same speed and can be used on the same gear. TwinAx is very similar to Coaxial cable, or “Coax.” Coax is used with cable internet and cable TV to transmit signals to consumers’ homes. The difference is that TwinAx has two copper cables instead of one. TwinAx is what we used for the original DreamCompute cluster as it is a great low-cost alternative to fiber! The downside to TwinAx is latency. TwinAx uses pulses of electricity instead of light to send signals. As electrons travel slower than the speed of light, it takes them three times longer to travel down the same length of cable. 3. The third option we considered was 10G-baseT. For the last decade, almost every server we have purchased has had 1G-baseT ports integrated into the motherboard. Most consumer laptops and desktops that have a wired network port today are also 1G-baseT. 1G-baseT and 10GbaseT both use four pairs of very thin twisted copper wire and an rj-45 connector (which looks like a large phone jack), though the cabling standards for 10G are slightly different to handle the higher speeds. 10G-baseT was standardized 10 years ago, but until recently implementations have been very rare and expensive. That started changing last year with the Intel x540 chipset. This allowed inexpensive onboard 10G-baseT, and manufacturers quickly began adding it as an option. Cumulus also started supporting a 10G-baseT switch. Using on-board 10G-baseT and category 6 ethernet is a tenth of the cost of using fiber and significantly cheaper than TwinAx. The downside to 10G-baseT is latency. At the lengths of cable we use, it takes about 0.000001 seconds longer for a signal to get from the computer to the switch. This seems inconsequential, but some applications, such as Ceph, are very latency sensitive. Even slight latency can make a noticeable impact, and requires testing. We decided to use 10G-baseT. Weighed against the minor latency difference demonstrated in our testing, the ease of install and substantially lower price made our choice clear. We also decided to get motherboards with four 10Gbase-T ports. For the initial deployment, we set up 20 Gbps capacity between each machine and the switch. We didn’t want to use more than half the capacity at any given time. This would ensure that we wouldn’t be saturating one port if another port went down. Based on our testing, we didn’t expect to use more than 10 Gbps. As a failsafe, we got the extra two ports to make any necessary upgrades quick and simple if we needed it. Now that we are in production, we haven’t had any spikes of greater than 10Gbps from any individual machine. Still, it is nice to have the ability to add extra capacity if we need it. Stay tuned for our next post in the series, where we answer the question: To converge, or not to converge?

Linux Kernel 4.4.24 LTS Has NFS and ARM Improvements, Many Updated Drivers GO All users of the Linux 4.4 LTS kernel branch must update Oct 8, 2016 12:58 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  After announcing the release of Linux kernel 4.8.1, Greg Kroah-Hartman had the pleasure of informing the community about the release of the twenty-fourth maintenance update to the Linux 4.4 LTS series. Linux 4.4 LTS is a long-term supported kernel branch, used by some of the most stable GNU/Linux distributions, including Alpine Linux 3.4, Linux Lite 3, and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus), and it will receive point releases that bring bug fixes and security patches, along with updated drivers for a few more years. Linux kernel 4.4.24 LTS is the latest build, and it comes just one week after the release of Linux kernel 4.4.23 LTS. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.4.24 kernel. All users of the 4.4 kernel series must upgrade," says Greg Kroah-Hartman. "The updated 4.4.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.4.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary." Here's what's new in Linux kernel 4.4.24 LTS According to the appended shortlog and the diff from the previous maintenance release, Linux kernel 4.4.24 LTS includes various improvements to the ARM, MIPS, x86, ARM64 (AArch64), AVR32, and PowerPC (PPC) hardware architectures, as well as a large number of updated drivers, this time for InfiniBand, Wireless (ath9k, brcm80211, iwlwifi), Ethernet (Intel i40e), MTD, IRQ Chip, CLK, ACPI, DMA, GPIO, hwmon, MD, MMC, NFC, PINCTRL, SCSI, SPI, and USB devices. Other than that, Linux kernel 4.4.24 LTS comes with minor improvements to the NFS and Ceph filesystems, an updated networking stack with B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced, Netfilter, and SunRPC changes, and an updated sound stack with better support for Intel Skylake and OMAP devices.

Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Edward Helmore in Pittsburgh Saturday 8 October 2016 07.00 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.28 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger When Uber chose to test its robot-driven taxis in Pittsburgh, some may have wondered why the tech company had chosen America’s former capital of steel for its road test into the future. But for those in the know, Pennsylvania’s second city is well on its way to establishing itself as the Silicon Valley of the east – and even its roads are helping. Unlike many American cities, Pittsburgh road system is literally off the grid, its origins dating back to twisty, pre-revolution forest trails. Then there are the city’s 446 bridges to navigate. More importantly Pittsburgh boasts the robotics department at Carnegie-Mellon University, recognized as the leading academic institution in the field. Uber’s first self-driving car spotted in Pittsburgh Read more It was here last month that Pittsburgh opened its doors to show the world why it is so well positioned to be a new tech hub. The city is now in a position to capitalize on the infrastructure of the past in ways that could not have been anticipated at the depths of its post-industrial depression two decades ago, when the city’s population was half its industry peak and the unemployment rate was worse than in Detroit. Last week, the city hosted Thrival, a three-day showcase of panel discussions and exhibitions designed to show off the city’s post-industrial charms. From robotics to biotech, performing arts to healthcare, the city’s premier boosters – many locals or returning natives – sought to describe the city’s upswing. The twin keys to the city’s current success, says the festival’s executive producer, Dan Law, are education and medicine – eds and meds – that helped bridge the gap between old industrial Pittsburgh and a new Pittsburgh that’s about innovation and technology. Now, instead of leaving, students from Pittsburgh’s tech university departments have more options to stay. “Eds and meds are the bedrock of the economic transition,” says Law. “UPMC – University of Pittsburgh Medical Center – alone is a $13bn health system and there are dozens of ancillary industries that began to innovate. So young people started to get jobs here and economic growing around the core economic pillars.” Correspondingly, the city’s arts and culture are thriving. “The City of Bridges is in the throes of a full-on nose-to-tail, barrel-aged, small-plates culinary renaissance,” according to Bon Appetit magazine. It rated one Spanish restaurant, Morcilla, the fourth best restaurant in the US. There’s a trendy Ace Hotel that was originally a YMCA and, of course, the Warhol Museum, dedicated to its most famous artist, and the Carnegie Museums of Art. How community-led renovation is helping a rundown Pittsburgh neighbourhood fight crime Read more “At the centre of it all, Pittsburgh is becoming a diversified innovation economy,” say Luke Skurman, founder of Niche.com and one of the founders of Thrill Mill, a not-for-profit organization providing mentorship and collaborative workspace to early-stage startups. “When I graduated Carnegie Mellon and stayed, people thought I was bananas. Now it’s becoming fashionable to do so.” Among the attendees at Thrival were Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian American neuropathologist who was the first to discover and publish findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players, and Jennifer Krusius, general manager at Uber. The transportation firm has about 500 employees in the city’s tech Strip district and plans to start testing as many as 100 Volvo sport utility vehicles on the city’s streets. Many of Uber’s employees were hired directly from Carnegie-Mellon’s computer labs and the state’s approach to the technology – called greenlight governing – effectively encouraged investment in the field. Uber estimates its investment will reach $1bn over the next few years. “It’s not just about self-driving cars,” says Law. “It’s about the future of urban mobility. How do you create smarter and more efficient cities.” Pittsburgh is ideal, he says, “because if you are going to design a car that needs to navigate some of the most complex road networks and systems, you’re not going to get a bigger challenge than here. It’s old, it was planned poorly, it’s built around hills and valleys, and the roads are windy and steep. If it works in Pittsburgh, it can work anywhere.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A self-driving Uber car drives navigates one of Pittsburgh’s many bridges. Photograph: Gene J Puskar/AP The firm is not alone: General Motors, Google – which has centered its engineering facilities here and employs 600 – and Intel have also come to Pittsburgh. While Apple, which employs 500 here, has not stated the reason for its interest, it is known to have already developed a prototype vehicle. But the city’s easy-going regulatory approach and an intelligent workforce is not the only reason Pittsburgh is becoming ground zero for auto-automation, widely regarded as one of the largest untapped economies. Google’s Mike Capsambelis explains the company’s explicit interest in Pittsburgh is machine learning, a sub-field of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. In other words, learning without needing to be explicitly programmed. “It’s uniquely a collaborative place. We tend to work together even when there’s actual competition,” says Capsambelis. Pittsburgh water: expensive, rust-colored, corrosive, and high in lead Read more Rasu Shrestha, chief innovation officer at UPMC, says healthcare is a natural fit for machine learning. Healthcare, he says, is so muchabout billing and book-keeping. “We want to free the data, to empower patients and consumers to take charge of their own data with the right sets of systems,” says Shrestha. “So the question is, how do we do a better job of precision medicine, not just do a better job of billing and documentation? The entrepreneurial knack is not just to create incremental innovation but to change the entire dynamic of healthcare innovation.” Tech companies, including Google, eye healthcare’s copious resources of data – UPMC’s nine petabytes of data is doubling every 18 months – with some envy. And vice versa. Says Shrestha: “Let’s create solutions that leverage machine learning and big-data-type technologies to create products we can then commercialize.” There may also be a natural symbiosis between healthcare advances and tech’s interest in transport. An ageing population suggests more will need assistance in terms of mobility. “There’s a ton of connections and overlap,” says Capsambelis. “A lot of people will still need cars, but there won’t be as many drivers.” The spirit of entrepreneurship suffuses the robotics lab at Carnegie-Mellon. Not only has tech become a major employer of the university’s graduates, but much of the computational power that was once available only to universities or government laboratories is now available to research. “Having machine learning has really changed the way we do research because the things we used to do at the university, companies can do much better because of their access to huge computing power and big data,” says professor of computer science Lenore Blum. But the city and its promoters at Thrival and Thrill Mill are keen to show off the small entrepreneurs along with the grand-scale technology behemoths that are beginning to occupy the same psychic space in the culture that the robber barons Carnegie and Frick did here in the late 19th century. An app for artists to find spaces, for instance, or a machine-learning ECG device for early stroke detection. Another involves cooking recipes for the sight-impaired. They may not or ever be Google or Uber but they are nonetheless imbibing Pittsburgh’s spirit of innovation. “It looks more like a continuum to us,” says Thrill Mill’s Stephan Mueller, “because we all have this fatal love for Pittsburgh and want to do something for it.” More features Topics Pennsylvania Apple Uber Google Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The bad: A higher price, plus expensive accessories. Less RAM and a slightly slower processor than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and iOS still limits overall flexibility of this iPad. The cost: $532 to $647 The bottom line: It’s still not a full-fledged laptop killer, but the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the best iPad ever made — a near-perfect balance of tablet power and portability. Google Pixel C Cnet rating: 4.5 stars out of 5 The good: The Google Pixel C has a slim, compact aluminum design that feels sturdy. Its optional Bluetooth keyboard is equally solid and doubles as the tablet’s cover, and it has a powerful, long-running battery. The tablet runs the latest version of Android, and its performance is lightning fast. The screen is sharp, bright and colorful, and gaming graphics look stellar. The bad: It’s a bit heavy when attached to the keyboard (which is sold separately). Big-name apps and games still tend to hit iOS before Android. The cost: $678 The bottom line: The Google Pixel C is the best Android tablet money can buy. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The Surface Pro 4 fits a larger screen with a higher resolution into a slightly slimmer body than last year’s model. The pen and keyboard cover are also improved, and this is one of the first mobile systems with Intel’s latest processors. The bad: Microsoft still refuses to include the Type Cover keyboard, forcing a separate purchase. Battery life still isn’t enough for a full day. The cost: $688 to $899 The bottom line: A host of small refinements cements the Surface Pro 4’s position as the best-in-class Windows tablet — so long as you’re prepared to pay extra for the required keyboard cover accessory. iPad Pro (12.9 inch) Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The new iPad Pro is the biggest and fastest Apple tablet to date. The pressure-sensitive Pencil stylus offers superior sketching and drawing, and the Pro’s gorgeous screen and quad speakers are ideal for split-screen apps, multitasking and watching movies. The bad: Very few apps are optimized to take advantage of the iPad Pro’s full potential. Its large size makes it less portable than other iPads. Once you’ve paid for the Pencil and keyboard peripherals, the iPad Pro costs as much as a good laptop, but lacks its flexibility. The cost: $708 to $799 The bottom line: The iPad Pro is a dream machine for graphic designers and media mavens, but this elegant tablet needs more optimized apps and accessories before it can fully achieve laptop-killer status.

UN Photo/JC McIlwaine (file) Print 7 October 2016  At a joint meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the General Assembly’s main economic and financial committee, the respective heads of the two UN bodies today highlighted the need for the benefits of globalization to reach all countries and all peoples. “We have a responsibility to promote narratives that acknowledge that sustainable prosperity for all will come through inclusion rather than exclusion,” said ECOSOC President Frederick Shava in his opening remarks to the joint meeting. Similarly in his own remarks, Dian Triansyah Djani, Chair of the General Assembly’s Second Committee highlighted: “In our world of gaps, there should be special attention of enabling global environment for countries, in particular the developing countries, to provide a considerable share to the global achievements of the SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals].” ‘2030 Agenda provides answers to questions global citizens are asking’ The annual joint meeting is held every year to discuss important economic and financial issues among both bodies’ membership. This year it was under the theme The changing political economy of globalization: Multilateral institutions and the 2030 Agenda. Further in his remarks, Mr. Djani highlighted the importance of collective action for the achievement of SDGs. “We, collectively, will have to demonstrate that the 2030 Agenda provides the answers to the questions being asked by global citizens. The many should work together so the few helpless one are not left behind because of globalization,” he emphasized. Also, Mr. Shava underlined the need to change the “political narratives” that advocate for isolationism, “We have a responsibility to promote narratives that acknowledge that sustainable prosperity for all will come through inclusion rather than exclusion,” he said. Participants at Joint Meeting of Second Committee and UN Economic and Social Council: (left to right) New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, Second Committee Chairman Dian Triansyah Djani and ECOSOC “Too daunting are the challenges of climate change, poverty, conflicts and terrorism, to name a few. The increasingly complex nature of these challenges calls for global solutions as no one country can deal with these issues alone,” the ECOSOC President added. World transformed by seismic events – from iPhone to financial meltdown in 18 months The joint meeting today also featured a keynote address by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and New York Times Op-Ed columnist Thomas Friedman who in his speech stressed: “We were in an age of acceleration where we needed to reimagine and reflect.” The world is witnessing three non-linear accelerations all at the same time: the market (globalization), Mother Nature (climate change, population growth), and Moore’s Law (technology). These three accelerations are reshaping the world’s politics, geopolitics, the workplace, community, and ethics, he continued. Mr. Freidman went on to recount a series of seismic social and technological events that occurred in 2007, when, among others: Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone beginning the smartphone/apps revolution; Facebook went global; Twitter went global; Airbnb hit the marketplace; “Amazon came out with something called the Kindle;” Github emerged; and IBM launched Watson. Further, he said the cost of sequencing a human genome went from around $100 million down to $1, Google bought YouTube, Intel went off silicon to expand Moore’s Law, and cloud computing took off. “2007 was the biggest technological inflection point since Gutenberg invented the printing press, and we missed it [because] the 2008 economic and financial collapse happened right after,” he said. Subsequently, the market is being fundamentally reshaped. “This is not your grandmother’s globalization,” said Mr. Friedman. Although trade in physical goods and financial products and services – the hallmarks of 20th century globalization – have flattened out and even declined in recent years, the globalization of flows means the world has never been more interconnected. If you want to make something, you’re living in the greatest period in history, but if you want to break something, you’re also living in the greatest period in history – Thomas Friedman “And you haven’t seen anything yet,” he continued, noting that the flows of friends, of renters, opinions, crowdfunding, instant messages, peer-to-peer payments, pictures, education, college courses, design tools, music, video, news, cloud-based tools, searches, raw video, “all of these flows are exploding, and they are the new globalization tying us together.” As such, he argued that the country that built infrastructure and educated its people to connect up to more [of these] flows will be the country that thrives in the 21st century. Mother Nature is exponentially changing too, through climate change, population growth, and biodiversity loss. “You’re all familiar with this one, but Mother Nature is going through her own exponential changes, which we’re seeing in Florida right now,” he noted. Mr. Friedman went on to stress that the workplace would be irrevocably altered and it is necessary to convert artificial intelligence to intelligent assistance and algorithms to allow workers to adapt to exponential change. Lifelong learning will be essential, and “building walls will not stop this change.” Politics and geopolitics would have to adapt as well, as parties will need to become more heterodox and less ideological, or fail. Lastly, ethics will have to evolve. “If you want to make something, you’re living in the greatest period in history, but if you want to break something, you’re also living in the greatest period in history,” he said. “What every human being believes now matters.” It will be necessary to bring back the ‘Golden Rule’ through strong families and healthy communities.

To many casual observers, virtual reality represents the future—of computing, social interaction, gaming, and entertainment. But to industry insiders, who flocked to the Oculus developers conference in San Jose, Calif., this week, the main question is not how VR will shape the future, but how to shape the future of VR. Facebook-owned Oculus has come up with short-term and long-term answers to that question. The long-term answer is perhaps the most intriguing: a very rudimentary prototype of a standalone VR headset, code named Santa Cruz. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg touted it this week as a sort of VR Goldilocks: it combines the best of the Oculus Rift (immersive VR experiences that harness a high-end PC processor and external sensors) with the freedom of the Gear VR (a headset not tied down by wires). I tried the Santa Cruz prototype for all of three minutes—that's all the time Oculus let me have with it. I wasn't allowed to take photos or video, but Facebook showed a quick demo video during a keynote address yesterday, from which we took a few screen shots. The demo consisted of two outdoor scenes that I could walk around and explore, one in outer space and one in a dense city. As a concept, the prototype is fairly simple. Engineers took a Rift, added four cameras to the front and a CPU, graphics card, cooling fan, and battery to the back. There's nothing polished about it. The fan is relatively noisy, the logic board is exposed, and the battery dangled from the bottom of the headband. Once I put it on, though, none of that mattered. The sensation of being completely untethered was something I'd never experienced in VR before, not because I'd never used a smartphone-based headset like the Gear VR, but because this time I didn't have to lower my expectations about the video and tracking quality. I walked right up to the chaperones—the blue barriers that appear when you're about to run into the walls of the physical room you're in—with no pesky real-world wires to get in the way. Meanwhile, the display never stuttered or demonstrated tracking lag, something that occasionally happens with the Gear VR. The only drawback that I noticed during the demo was that it appeared to be demanding very little of the Santa Cruz's onboard processor. Cars, buildings, and other elements looked like polygons, and there wasn't much motion in the scenes. An Oculus engineer wouldn't say whether or not Santa Cruz could run a more demanding demo without its performance suffering, but he did acknowledge that components are Santa Cruz's chief limitation. Intel and Qualcomm are working on their own standalone VR headsets, so Oculus isn't alone in its pursuit of an untethered VR future. As Santa Cruz shows, that future is promising, but it's held hostage by the limitations of fitting powerful components into a headset-mountable enclosure. Oculus's more immediate answer to the VR future question, though, is coming in December: the highly anticipated Touch controllers, which I got to test out with a few of the more than 30 games and other apps that will take advantage of them by next year. PCMag has tried the Touch controllers before, when they were on display at CES 2016. Not much has changed since then, except that many more developers now support them. I found the most useful aspects of the controllers to be teleportation and grabbing objects, which are both a bit awkward to do with a conventional controller. In Killing Floor (trailer below), a post-apocalyptic first-person shooter, I used the joystick on the left controller to teleport. It is a slightly cumbersome two-step process, but it affords a lot of freedom. You can look around by moving the joystick through 360 degrees first, and then releasing it wherever you want to end up. While zombies were approaching, though, it was a lot to remember, and I sometimes dropped my weapon (which I held using the middle finger button) while I was looking for a spot to teleport to. Somewhat easier was the teleportation process that Arktika.1 uses. Throughout the battlefield, there are silhouettes of your characters, and all you have to do is look at them and press a button to be instantly transported to one. The tradeoff is freedom—you can only move to predefined locations. The Touch controller contributes to the realism of the VR experience. I got used to it after about an hour, and felt almost helpless during my final demo, a controllerless Karaoke game for the Gear VR. The controller is available for pre-order now at $199, and ships in December. Check back soon for PCMag's full review.

Source: Goldman Sachs Former SolarCity president and chief operating officer (COO) Tanguy Serra is set to leave the company at the end of the year, amid further executive restructuring in the wake of the US$2.6 billion Tesla deal. “Tanguy has played a pivotal role in helping SolarCity achieve the lowest operations costs in the solar industry. He is extremely talented, but due to overlap at the new company, he is going to pursue a new venture. I’m grateful for everything Tanguy has contributed to SolarCity,” said CEO Lyndon Rive in a statement. Radford Small has been promoted to the role of chief financial officer (CFO) after being a managing director and COO for clean technology and renewables since joining the solar installer in 2015. “Rad has been a tremendous asset—he’s excelled at everything we’ve put on his plate—and he brings an incredibly valuable skillset to a potential combination of Tesla and SolarCity,” said Rive. “This promotion largely reflects the reality of the current roles and responsibilities in SolarCity’s finance department. Rad has been leading our efforts in the capital markets for some time, and has been playing an increasingly visible role in financial planning and analysis, investor relations and accounting.” This news follows Lyndon Rive and CTO Peter Rive foregoing their prior salaries of US$275,000 per annum for just US$1 per annum for their services, which was reportedly instigated as per their request.  centrotherm photovoltaics AG management shake up New centrotherm photovoltaics AG COO and supervisory board member Gunter Fauth.

Previously, Paille led Northeast sales and marketing for Dow Chemical’s Powerhouse Solar Shingle product. In his new role, Paille will be responsible for managing all SunTegra sales as well as developing new channel partners across North America. “We are delighted to have Mark join our team at a time when we’re seeing a huge surge in demand from both solar installers and home builders,” said SunTegra CEO Oliver Koehler. “Mark’s extensive experience selling roof-integrated solar products and developing strong channel partners will enable us to expand sales of our SunTegra Shingle and Tile products and position SunTegra for strong growth in 2017.” “SunTegra is selling a truly disruptive product that offers 40% more power than the Dow Powerhouse Shingles at a price that is 30% less—you bet I’m excited to be here,” said Paille. “There is no doubt in my mind that SunTegra’s product, reliability, comprehensive warranty and strong customer service make them the leading provider of solar shingles and tiles in the US.” Former First Solar exec Bruce Sohn joins Siva Power as vice chairman of the board Former First Solar president Bruce Sohn is Siva Power's latest addition to its management board. Source: Twitter California-based thin-film manufacturer Siva Power has hired solar executive Bruce Sohn as its vice chairman of the board. Sohn brings a wealth of experience to the role, having been a key player in First Solar’s growth as a global thin-film producer and also previously holding leadership positions at Intel corporation. Sohn was First Solar’s president in 2007, where he was integral in growing the company from its pre-revenue stage to the multi-billion dollar enterprise it is today. Siva Power CEO Brad Mattson said in a statement: “If I had my choice of any executive in the world to join our team, it would be Bruce Sohn. What he achieved at First Solar speaks for itself, and it says a lot about Siva and where Siva is going now that someone like Bruce has joined us. We’ve consolidated the best and the brightest minds in the thin-film solar industry and Bruce Sohn is a special addition to that brain trust. It was under his leadership that First Solar, the only American thin-film PV success story, became what it is today. His guidance and leadership will be invaluable to Siva going forward as we become the next success. “Bruce’s extensive experience in growing and managing large teams, and in global manufacturing capability, will prove to be a huge asset to Siva Power as we take our next step into giga-scale manufacturing. We’re really pleased to have him and are looking forward to working together – there’s a lot for us to achieve." Currently, Siva Power is developing CIGS thin-film solar modules at its Santa Clara, California headquarters. Five members of Congress receive solar accolades from SEIA Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has received the first ever Lifetime Solar Pugilist Award from the SEIA for his solar advocacy in Congress. Source: Flickr/Center for American Progress Action Fund The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has presented four members of congress with prestigious solar awards for their work in strengthening the industry. Democratic senate leader Harry Reid was the recipient of the first ever Lifetime Solar Pugilist Award and is deemed by the SEIA to be the “strongest advocate for the solar industry ever to serve in Congress.” Indeed, Senator Reid was an instrumental party in securing the ITC extensions in 2008 and 2015 as well as being one of the original architects of the credit. Similarly, four other congress members each received the SEIA solar champion award for their efforts in working to preserve and extend the ITC. The work put in to achieve the credit and its extension cannot be undervalued; with the SEIA estimating that as a result of prolonging the credit, solar jobs will more than double in the US, reaching 420,000 by the end of the decade. Furthermore, solar capacity in the country will more than triple during that time – potentially hitting 100GW by 2020. Senator Dean Heller received the award for his position on the Senate Finance Committee where he ensured that the ITC remained a key component of the final negotiations of the 2015 tax and budget debate. Senator Michael Bennet introduced legislation to allow solar develops to claim the ITC based on when they started construction, instead of when the project was finished, in addition to securing an important reform that allowed for an extension. Fellow award recipient Representative Tom Reed was recognised for his efforts in adopting an “all of the above” approach to American energy policy that encapsulated solar as a disruptive technology. Similarly, Representative Mike Thompson received his award on the back of being an architect of the 2008 ITC extension, as well as being the lead sponsor of the legislation that served as the model for the 2015 extension. “Support for solar energy is support for American jobs and innovation,” said Tom Kimbis, SEIA’s interim president in a statement.  “These five legislators have demonstrated through their leadership in the halls of Congress, their public support and their voting records that they recognize the enormous benefits – from national security to economic development – bestowed on our nation through solar energy. We credit them with recognizing that solar is not a partisan technology, thank them for their relentless support, and proudly present them with these well-deserved awards.” Tags: us, usa, california, germany, europe, thin-film, cigs thin film, solarcity, suntegra, centrotherm photovoltaics, siva power, seia, itc extension, tesla, employment, movers and shakers Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Gen. Michael Flynn during a campaign town hall meeting in Virginia Beach in September. Mike Segar/Reuters | Caption Trump and military adviser differ on blaming Russia for hacks Policy At an event in Boston this week, Michael Flynn, a senior Trump adviser, said he is convinced that Russia was behind hacks into the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Paul F. Roberts @paulfroberts October 7, 2016 —Donald Trump may not be ready to blame Moscow for cyberattacks targeting the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, but his senior military adviser says he's convinced it was Russia. Michael Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, said he agreed with assessments from cybersecurity experts that operatives for the Russian government carried out attacks on Mrs. Clinton's campaign and other Democratic Party organizations, even as he decried the "corruption" that he said the hacks exposed. "We should not be surprised that a communist state run by a totalitarian dictator wants to expose the weaknesses of capitalism and, frankly, show the level of corruption that exists in our political process," he said. Asked if he was satisfied with the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike's attribution of the hacks to a  group known as  Fancy Bear, which has ties to the government of Vladimir Putin, Mr. Flynn said he was. "Yeah, it seems to make sense that there's a concerted effort to understand what’s going on in our political campaigns." The former head of the military's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Flynn said he was not surprised by a foreign power's interest in the US election and he expressed curiosity about whether there might be additional revelations from the hack. Documents from the breach led to embarrassing revelations about friction within the party and prompted the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on the eve of the Democratic convention in August. "So, a state-backed attack against our political – I mean, against anything – is like, 'OK, that’s not surprising,' " Flynn said. "What they have decided to do and what they’ve decided to expose, you know, we’ll have to wait and see what’s about to come out. What’s been exposed is the level of corruption. I mean there’s an enormous level of corruption that’s been exposed in our election system," he added.  After the DNC revealed this summer the cyberattack on the organization, a previously unknown hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 took credit for the attack. Soon afterward, the antisecrecy organization WikiLeaks began publishing the DNC's internal documents and emails. This week, WikiLeaks said it will release more documents ahead of the election.  Follow Passcode! Cybersecurity news and analysis delivered straight to your inbox. Many experts have suggested that Guccifer 2.0 is a cover for Russian operatives who handed the stolen documents to WikiLeaks. Flynn said WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is doing work left undone by the Department of Justice, which investigated Clinton's use of a private email server when she served as Secretary of State but did not bring charges against the Democratic candidate. "It's sad that the Department of Justice ... isn't doing anything about it," he said of the investigation of Clinton. "Whereas everyone's hoping Julian Assange does what the Department of Justice should be doing." Since the beginning of Mr. Trump's candidacy, Flynn has been one of his most ardent supporters. He was widely reported to have been a short list candidate for vice president, though Trump eventually chose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.  The retired general is now chief executive officer of Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm, and was in Boston on Wednesday speaking about the cybersecurity challenges facing the US at  Flight 2016, an event organized by the software firm Black Duck.  Trump has also expressed doubts about who is responsible for the hack of the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and other Democratic party groups, quipping in his first debate with Clinton that the hacks could have been carried out by a  " 400-pound hacker … sitting on their bed." The FBI is investigating the Clinton and DNC hacks, but has not yet attributed the incidents to any nation or actor. Flynn has courted controversy before in regard to Russia and Mr. Putin. He has appeared as an unpaid commentator on RT, the Russian broadcast network. And he sat next to President Putin at  an event hosted by the network in 2015, raising eyebrows in Washington.  In an interview with The Washington Post, Flynn likened CNN and MSNBC to the state owned and heavily censored RT and called the controversy over his dinner with Putin "boring." Flynn's comments in Boston drew sharp rebukes from cybersecurity experts. "Frankly, that’s just offensive," said Ira Winkler of Flynn's comments about the hacks uncovering corruption in the US political system. "Russia isn't looking to uncover corruption in the US election system. It’s looking for whatever benefits Russia the most." Anger and concern about Russia's forays into US politics and the election system have generally cut across party lines, said Mr. Winkler, president of the Internet Security Advisors Group. "This is geopolitical manipulation. You can’t say, "It's OK because it supports my worldview,' " he said. "This is like NATO where an attack on one country is an attack on everyone. An attack on one party should be treated as an attack on all." Follow Passcode! Cybersecurity news and analysis delivered straight to your inbox.

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global NAND flashmarketfor 2016-2020. The report also presents the vendor landscape and a corresponding detailed analysis of the top vendors in the market and lists other prominent vendors. NAND flash is gaining more popularity over dynamic random access memory (DRAM) as it does not have to be powered continuously to retain data. In addition, NAND flash is now extensively used for solid state drives (SSDs), which is replacing hard disk drives (HDDs). This is a major factor for market growth. The smartphone and tablet segments are the two largest application segments for NAND flash, accounting for 45.3% of the market. NAND flash is ideal for portable devices due to its non-volatile feature and hence it is widely used in smartphones and tablets. The smartphone market is growing at a CAGR of 7.61%, and the tablet market is growing at a CAGR of 8.32%, which provide an incentive for NAND flash vendors. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=53302 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio hardware and semiconductor analysts highlight the following four factors that are contributing to the growth of the global NAND flash market: Increasing sales of mobile devices NAND flash-based SSDs replacing HDDs Growth of multimedia applications Increased end-user applications for NAND flash Increasing sales of mobile devices Major smartphone vendors such as Apple and Samsung are continually increasing the memory storage capacity in their latest smartphones with the use of NAND flash memory. The upcoming iPhone models are expected to have higher storage capacity, which will increase the demand for NAND flash memory. The growing sales of smartphones integrated with high memory capacity are boosting the growth of the global NAND flash market. Chetan Mohan, a lead embedded systems analyst at Technavio, says, "Tablets are one of the important markets for NAND flash memory. Leading mobile and PC OEMs are entering the tablet market because of the growing demand for the Apple iPad and the high growth potential of the market. End-users demand high-performance devices with reliable and highly portable computing platforms." NAND flash-based SSDs replacing HDDs "The global NAND flash market is expected to witness high growth because of the increasing adoption of SSDs. HDDs are gradually being replaced by NAND flash-based SSDs. This is because SSDs are more reliable than HDDs as they can withstand more heat, vibrations, and shock," adds Chetan. Moreover, they are more power-efficient, consuming only 50% of the power of HDDs, and they offer 12%-15% longer battery life. SDDs also boot and launch applications faster than HDDs and offer significantly faster performance. These benefits make SDDs a suitable choice for the next-generation notebooks. SSDs are a cost-effective option for upgrading older systems and enhancing their capabilities. Growth of multimedia applications The mobile devices segment is constantly evolving from a voice signal receiver to a full-fledged portable computer. This calls for advanced technologies in storage, which has resulted in the growth of MCPs in NAND memory. With MCPs, vendors have been able to increase the memory density required for memory-intensive mobile applications. With the introduction of the Internet of Things, where a mobile device is considered as the primary connecting device to other smart devices such as TVs, kitchen appliances, door locks, and thermostats, the role of mobile devices is constantly evolving. In addition, technologies such as gesture recognition, augmented reality, and virtual reality are now being integrated in mobile devices, which require higher memory and processing power. An increase in such applications is expected to increase the demand for high-density NAND flash. Increased end-user applications for NAND flash The number of applications for NAND flash is expected to increase during the forecast period, leading to the addition of new revenue sources, thus contributing to the growth in the market. For instance, NAND flash is finding applications in embedded systems. The adoption of NAND flash in embedded systems is expected to increase as it offers many advantages such as high-volume storage at low cost, fast access times, and fast erase times. These features enable the device to process thousands of applications. NAND flash is also used in other applications such as enhanced phones and HHPs, which is expected to contribute significantly to the revenue of the market during the forecast period. The adoption of NAND flash in these application areas is expected to increase the growth prospects of the market in the future.

Minutes into a demo of a new prototype VR headset from Oculus, the benefits of not being tethered to a PC as I would be with the company’s flagship Rift were becoming apparent. Oculus is experimenting with a cordless design because it is seen as necessary to make virtual reality appealing to the masses. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, which bought Oculus in 2014, unveiled the “Santa Cruz” prototype Thursday. Speaking at the annual Oculus Connect developer conference in San Jose, California, he said the “stand-alone” design would fit between expensive headsets like the Rift, which tether to an expensive PC, and cheap ones like Samsung’s Gear VR, which are based around a phone, limiting their power. Mark Zuckerberg showed a short video of someone trying out a new prototype VR headset during an event in San Jose, California, Thursday. The most notable feature of the Santa Cruz’s design is the way it uses four cameras to watch the world around you and track your position in space. In my short demo, I could walk around a staged living room to explore a colorful cardboard virtual world. The headset warned me when I got close to a wall. The Rift headset can also track your position, but it doesn’t afford such freedom. Not only does the PC cord tie you down, but the Rift requires a special sensor to be placed on a desk or shelf in front of you. HTC’s Vive headset has a similar design. The low-cost Gear VR and Google’s forthcoming Daydream headset can’t track your head position at all, limiting you to just turning your head in place. Santa Cruz is a modified version of the Rift headset, with a compact lump of extra electronics on the back of its strap. Oculus won’t detail what exactly is inside, but one of the team members working on the device said the components are similar to those found in a smartphone. Zuckerberg yesterday repeated his prediction that virtual reality will become a phenomenon on par with the smartphone, and spoke of one day seeing a billion people regularly using the technology. Max Cohen, vice president of mobile for Oculus, told MIT Technology Review that the Santa Cruz design shows a possible path to that end. “We think the stand-alone is a sweet spot that gets you most of the way to one billion,” he said. Intel and Qualcomm have recently showed off cord-free headsets of their own, although they appear to be less polished, and demos made available so far have been limited (see “High-End, Cordless VR Headsets Are Nearing Reality”). Cohen says it is likely the entire industry will converge on stand-alone, also known as all-in-one, headset designs. Cohen declined to say anything about when Santa Cruz might develop into a product. When Zuckerberg first introduced the prototype on stage, he signaled that it won’t be soon. “It’s still early,” he said. “I don’t want to get your hopes up too much. We have a demo. We don’t have a product yet.”   Learn more about virtual reality at EmTech Digital 2017.

The S2C SSDs use TLC NAND flash memory made by SK Hynix using 16 nm process technology as well as a controller from Silicon Motion. Plextor has its own history with TLC NAND-based as well as SMI-powered SSDs and the S2C family is the first time, when the manufacturer combined the inexpensive memory and an affordable controller. The company originally planned to release its first SSD featuring TLC memory in mid-2015 and even demonstrated a drive featuring Marvell's 88SS1074 controller as well as Toshiba’s TLC NAND at CES 2015. After months of evaluating the configuration, Plextor decided to proceed with Toshiba’s MLC memory and Silicon Motion’s SM2246EN controller for its M6V SSD. In April 2016, the company finally released the M7V, its first drive based on TLC NAND memory produced by Toshiba using its 15 nm process technology. The Plextor S2C is the second TLC-based SSD by the company, which targets the low-end of the market. The S2C features Silicon Motion’s SM2258 controller (which has four NAND flash channels and supports LDPC ECC technology) as well as SK Hynix’s TLC NAND made using planar 16 nm process tech, a combination found in Intel’s 540s SSDs. SMI’s SM2258 controller is a relatively new IC, which is why some SSD makers plan to use it for 3D NAND-based drives (e.g., ADATA’s SU800) because of compatibility with the memory as well as presumable low cost. Being cautious and due to slow ramp of SK Hynix’s 3D NAND, Plextor decided to use the SM2258 controller with planar TLC NAND from the South Korean company.

Plextor is specing the highest-capacity S2C at up to 520 MB/s for sequential reads and up to 480 MB/s for sequential writes, but more affordable models sport slightly lower write speeds. As for random performance, we are dealing with drives capable of 98,000/78,000K read/write IOPS. Unlike many low-cost SSDs today, the S2C features DRAM cache to guarantee decent performance of write operations. In addition, Plextor promises that its S2C drives will sustain their performance over prolonged periods. The Plextor S2C will be joining in a pretty crowded party ot entry-level SSDs. The drives will naturally compete against Plextor’s own M6V, M7V and M6S Plus. In addition, they will have to rival Intel’s 540s drives, which are not only very affordable, but also come with a five-year warranty (Plextor only offers a three-year warranty with its S2C). Plextor has not announced MSRPs for its S2C drives and right now the products are absent from large U.S.-based retailers. Given performance numbers declared by the manufacturer, the S2C should be cheaper than the other entry-level drives sold under this brand.

POST A COMMENT 17 Comments View All Comments trparky - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link Why the hell are they still making 16nm TLC NAND Flash based SSDs? Haven't we learned that as NAND Flash shrinks past 19nm it becomes too unreliable which results in reduced performance over time due to voltage drive? Reply trparky - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link voltage drift* Reply hojnikb - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link because they are cheap. Reply BrokenCrayons - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link And they sell VERY well to consumers. Reply emn13 - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link Depending on how you measure, such drives still provide the best cost/benefit tradeoff. If you're not doing something unusual, then there's only so much I/O you're going to do. If you can meet those needs in 1ms or 10ms - well, the difference is not likely to be perceptible, so you're better off picking whatever is cheapest. Of course, if you needs have workloads that are (say) 100 times longer, and the choice is between 100ms latency and 1s, then perhaps it's worth talking about! But at light I/O load, a samsung 960 pro may well not feel any faster than this drive, even though it's much more expensive (and quantifiably faster). Reply Samus - Saturday, October 08, 2016 - link Said it before and I'll say it again because it still stands true. TLC drives aren't any cheaper than MLC drives. There is no reason to get something inferior when something superior is the same price. Sandisk SSD Plus is MLC and stupid cheap. Various drives based on the Sandforce SF2281, an incredibly mature controller at this point can still be found on par or CHEAPER than TLC drives. And even though its a 4 year old controller, it's still going to be faster in most applications than any planar TLC drive that relies on SLC caching. And of course, there are used or refurbished drives. I'd take many of these over a new TLC drive. Crucial M550's are dirt cheap on eBay and they are faster and more reliable than any TLC drive. Reply hojnikb - Saturday, October 08, 2016 - link SSD plus is TLC for quite some time now. And other drives also silently switched to TLC. Reply Samus - Sunday, October 09, 2016 - link What the fuck is wrong with them. They rebadged the Z410 as an SSD Plus at the beginning of the year, completely changing the drive? Drives can't just silently switch to TLC. Most drives are recognized by their controllers and performance, both of which change when transitioning NAND architecture. Well fuck Sandisk they just pulled a scam out of OCZ old dusty, bankrupt playbook. People just get an MLC drive on eBay then until this sub 20nm Planar TLC thing actually proves itself. Reply hojnikb - Monday, October 10, 2016 - link Technically, it's not the same drive, because they changed the model number. SSD plus with tlc now ends with -G26, instead of G25 for the mlc model. Reply dsraa - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link Oh so this is supposed to be budget level SSD? because those numbers.....they don't look too high performance at all....

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple VR in 2016 a Bust, But Oculus' Wireless Headset Will Change Everything Mark Spoonauer Editor in Chief Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)October 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share I couldn't believe my eyes. I was Batman. I had his cowl. I had his toys, including a wicked Batarang I could throw. And I even had his face. I saw my scowl in a virtual mirror as I payed Batman: Arkham VR on the new PlayStation VR. It was amazing, until I tripped over a wire. This was supposed to be a breakthrough year for VR, but despite some real technical triumphs from multiple companies, virtual reality remains a medium that's too still too geeky and burdensome for the masses. As delightful as it was playing the Caped Crusader, I felt tethered and a little claustrophobic. For the PSVR, there's a long wire that runs to a control box which gets attached to the console. There's also a headphone jack on the wire that runs to your ears. And there's a separate camera you have to set up. I don't see myself rearranging my living room for an optimal virtual reality experience. Then there's the Move controllers, which I found difficult to operate by feel due to the multitude of buttons. The PlayStation VR headset itself felt comfortable but also kind of bulky. MORE: PlayStation VR Review: Serious Fun for a Sane Price Don't get me wrong. The payoff was a blast, but I don't see myself rearranging my living room for an optimal virtual reality experience. On the PC front, the HTC Vive provides a higher fidelity experience, and you can actually walk around virtual environments. But it has issues of its own, such as the need for two room-scanning base stations that you must install (ideally by mounting them on a wall). You also need to place your PC so that the cable attached to the headset will reach the play areas. HTC recommends that you cover any windows. That's the trade-off for having 6.5 x 5 feet of play space. Did I mention the Vive is $799 and that a compatible PC costs about $1,400? Read More MORE: Best Gaming PCs Facebook-owned Oculus is the VR giant, and it has primarily focused on desktop VR and mobile VR as two separate areas with the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR. The Rift is coming along nicely, as the motion Touch controllers are finally going on sale this December for $199. The bundle will include an extra camera sensor for tracking, and you can buy a third sensor for $79 if you want a Vive-like room-scaling experience. But all of that is on top of the $599 for the headset and whatever you need to pay for a good VR-ready gaming desktop or laptop. And there's still the too many wires issue that keeps pulling you back to reality. This is the holy grail for VR. Deliver a truly immersive experience anywhere without having to worry about tripping over wires or emptying your bank account. The Gear VR is the closest thing yet to a mainstream VR experience. It's cheap at $99, and there are plenty of compelling games and experiences that don't even require a controller. When I played Land's End for the first time, for example, I felt like I was moving objects with my mind (it was my head) to solve puzzles. But even the partnership between Samsung and Oculus' hasn't yet yielded a killer app or broken through with a huge enough audience. Part of it the challenge is that you need a Samsung phone, an issue that Google is addressing with its Daydream platform. But it's not just that. The visuals just aren't as crisp or immersive as PC-based platforms. The PlayStation VR is somehwere in the middle in terms of quality. MORE: PS4 vs. Xbox One: Which Console Is Right for You? So is VR a fad? Not by a long shot. It's just evolving, and 2017 looks to be the year that it really takes off. At the Oculus Connect conference this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the company is working on a standalone VR headset that will not require a phone. He demoed a virtual reality device that's more powerful than the typical mobile experience yet not tethered like the Rift, Vive and PSVR are. Apparently, it won't be expensive as the Rift, either. CNET tried out the wireless prototype, codenamed Santa Cruz, and deemed it nearly as good as the tethered experience. This is the holy grail for VR. Deliver a truly immersive and high-fidelity experience anywhere without having to worry about tripping over wires, moving your coffee table, or emptying your bank account. But Oculus isn't the only company chasing this vision. Intel has been working on its Project Alloy platform, which is also wireless, but adds the company's RealSense depth-sensing cameras to let you use your hands as controllers. And Qualcomm's Snapdragon VR820 puts the company's Snapdragon 820 mobile processor into a cordless VR headset. The aim is to help manufacturers who want to make their own all-in-own head-mounted VR displays. As 2016 started, Oculus Rift inventor Palmer Luckey told me that it was going to be a pivotal year for the category, but he was cautiously optimistic for a reason. "It's not going to be the year that everyone gets interested in virtual reality, and I don't want people to get their hopes up too much on that," he told me. He knew, as we all do now, that there are serious technical hurdles to overcome to deliver a best-of-both-worlds VR experience that marries the freedom of mobile with the high frame rates and graphics quality usually reserved for computers. Facebook's Zuckerberg didn't say how much this VR wireless headset will cost or when it will ship, but it's what I'll be waiting for before I spend my own money to dive in. At that point, you won't be able to tear me away from my batsuit. Best Samsung Gear VR Games Oculus Touch Launching Dec. 6 for $199: Should HTC Worry?

The company announced a bunch of new, but necessary accessories for the platform, and also gave us a glimpse of the future of VR. Oculus Touch: It’s finally here Oculus may have made the best quality headset on the market, but leaving out VR-ready controllers was a huge mistake. The HTC Vive offered a competitive headset, but it was the Vive’s controllers and room-scale VR system that stole the show. While Facebook has teased the controllers before, they were officially announced yesterday at Oculus Connect 3. The design of the controllers hasn’t really changed much since we first saw them. Both controllers feature two, feather-touch triggers and an assortment of buttons. A bunch of LEDs on the front help the Oculus Camera keep track of their position. A controller kit will be available for pre-order worldwide on 13 October and it’ll ship on 6 December. The controllers are priced at $199 (around Rs 13,300). Oculus Camera: Now there are more The Oculus Camera is a tracking unit that comes with a Rift and it does double duty as a head tracker and controller tracker. Zuckerberg, however, added that you can add up to three cameras in a room and suddenly, room-scale VR becomes a reality! A three-camera setup will track your position in your room in 3D and in real-time. The camera tracking units will be available for $79 (around Rs 5,300). Oculus Earphones: You now have an option The Rift comes with headphones as part of the Rift package. They’re good, but if you wanted earphones, you didn’t have an option. Now you do. These earphones will retail for $49 (Rs 3,300). Oculus Santa Cruz: Look ma, no wires!   The Oculus Santa Cruz prototype is the most interesting announcement at Oculus Connect 3, but it’s not a unique concept. The headset sits between the Gear VR and Oculus Rift CV1 in terms of features, price and functionality. This headset packs in a PC within the headset itself (Intel and AMD had demoed this many months ago at GDC 2016) and integrates multiple cameras for keeping an eye on the world around you. This headset will have no wires since everything that’s needed is within the headset itself. Since the cameras are bundled on the headset, they’ll provide room-scale VR and tracking without the need for external sensors. The Santa Cruz is never going to be as powerful as the Rift, but it’s a stand-alone device that might offer the right compromise between price and features. It’s still a prototype, however, so it may not even develop into a fully-featured product.

No, the Oculus Rift itself isn’t getting a (much-needed) price cut, but cheaper computers capable of powering the Oculus are now on their way. So much so you’ll be able to pick up an Oculus Ready PC for just $499. Bargain. Virtual reality is going to work this time. For realz. Yes, we know you’ve heard this all before, but too many people have too much money invested in VR this time around for it to fail. Plus the technology is also much, much better than it has ever been before. The Oculus Rift Oculus Rift Review and Giveaway Oculus Rift Review and Giveaway Virtual Reality is not new, but it's finally affordable and within our grasp. After four year and two development prototypes, the final consumer edition of the Oculus Rift has arrived. Read More is testament to that. Here is a VR headset which looks and feels incredible. And which is capable of powering some truly astounding virtual reality experiences. The only problem is it doesn’t come cheap, with the Oculus Rift currently priced at $599. However, the computers capable of powering the Oculus Rift have been even more expensive than that. Until now… The New Minimum Specs for the Oculus Rift At today’s Oculus Connect 3 event, Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe announced a new, lower minimum hardware spec for computers running the Oculus Rift. Those new minimum specs include an Nvidia 960 graphics card, an Intel i3-6100 or AMD FX4350 processor, 8GB of RAM, and Windows 8.

Iribe hopes there will be hundreds of Oculus Ready PCs available within a few years. What’s making these lower minimum specs possible is a technology Oculus calls Asynchronous Spacewarp. This lets computers run games at 45fps while delivering them to the Rift at 90fps. The Asynchronous Spacewarp technology essentially fills in the gaps with synthetic frames.

Photo: Reuters Seoul: Samsung Electronics Co.’s operating profit topped analysts’ projections as demand for its high-margin memory chips and displays limited the impact of a global recall of its marquee Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. Shares of the world’s largest maker of phones and memory chips rose on Friday after reporting that operating income rose 5.5% to 7.8 trillion won ($7 billion) on a preliminary basis in the three months ended September. That compares with the 7.58 trillion-won average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. While the recall has dominated headlines since it was announced last month, Samsung worked to contain the fallout from exploding smartphones and insulate its component businesses. That helped maintain growth as new devices from rivals stoke demand for memory chips and displays. A fresh issue emerged this week when billionaire activist Paul Elliott Singer launched a campaign to get the family-controlled company to restructure. “The recall-related costs have surely taken its toll on its mobile business in the quarter but its other businesses, particularly semiconductors, have fared extraordinarily well, ” Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities Co. in Seoul, said before the earnings release. “Even Apple has placed a huge order for chips from Samsung, I heard, and it can’t even keep up with explosive demand from China ahead of the typically strong fourth quarter.” Sales were 49 trillion won in the quarter, the Suwon-based company said, compared with the 51 trillion won analysts expected. Samsung won’t provide net income or break out divisional performance until it releases audited results later this month. The company didn’t specify the financial impact of the recall. Analysts have estimated the cost at $1 billion to $2 billion. Samsung’s stock rose 0.9% to a record 1.706 million, fueled by the preliminary results and Singer’s proposal to split the company and return cash to investors. Singer has the Samsung group in his cross-hairs again, just a year after failing to torpedo a takeover that his firm deemed a bad deal. He’s now betting Samsung Electronics’ heir apparent, Jay Y. Lee, is so keen to modernize his family’s empire without losing control that he’ll embrace a complex plan to break up the company, people familiar with the matter said. The billionaire is proposing that Samsung split into an operating company and a holding entity, dual-list the former on a US exchange, pay shareholders a special dividend of 30 trillion Korean won, and take on three independent board members. Singer’s demands are broadly in line with changes that Samsung’s Lee himself had been contemplating, the Wall Street Journal reported. Only two weeks after Samsung introduced its large-screen Note 7 with more sophisticated features and a longer battery life, the company had to recall about 2.5 million phones after reports emerged of devices exploding. The Note 7, which many analysts expected to become the next big hit and help sustain its smartphone supremacy, turned into a debacle as the shares rose to a record. The crisis came just as Apple Inc. released its latest iPhones. Analysts have cut their estimates of Note 7 sales to 8 million units this year, 38% lower than the earlier projection of 13 million units before the recall, according to the average projections of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Operating income from the phone division probably was 2.7 trillion won in the quarter, according to the analyst survey. “The biggest swing factor for the earnings is how big Samsung has set its provisions for the Note 7 recall in the third quarter,” said Song Myung-sup, a Seoul-based analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co. “Regardless, it’s inevitable to see the sales decline of the Note continue into the fourth quarter.” Operating income at the semiconductor business probably was 3.3 trillion won in the third quarter on sales of 12.9 trillion won, largely helped by price rebound, according to the analyst survey. A slew of new smartphone releases and PC demand also helped to drive sales of Samsung’s cutting-edge semiconductors as well as flat displays. Signs of a demand recovery in semiconductors are also witnessed by Samsung’s bigger chip competitor Intel Corp. The world’s biggest maker of semiconductors said last month that it has raised its forecast for third-quarter sales, largely bolstered by growing optimism for the personal computer market, which helped boost prices. DDR3 4-gigabyte dynamic random access memory chips rose for a second straight quarter, reaching $2.01 on 30 September, according to data from inSpectrum Tech Inc. That compares with a 31 March price of $1.68. “The memory chip demand-supply condition looks tighter than thought. The strong memory demand stems from higher-than-expected smartphone demand in the US and in China,” KTB Investment & Securities Co. said in a September report. “The memory chip prices will rise sharply in the fourth quarter from the third.” The company’s display division, which also makes screens using organic light-emitting diodes, probably posted a profit of 760 billion won while the consumer electronics unit, which encompasses TVs and appliances, was estimated to be 76% higher at 635 billion won, according to analyst surveys.

"The global devices market is not on pace to return to single-digit growth soon,” Ranjit Atwal, research head at Gartner, said. Gartner has predicted a decline in PC sales, including mobiles for 2016. Photo: Gartner The research firm expects flat growth in the sector for the next five years. All segments of the PC industry are set to decline in 2016 except for the two extremes: entry-level smartphones and premium ultramobiles, which include tablets, ultrabooks and lightweight PCs such as the Apple MacBook Air and Microsoft Surface devices. The sales of basic and utility ultramobiles, which Gartner defines as devices like iPad, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 and Lenovo Yoga Tab 3, are expected to decline up till at least 2018. In Western Europe, the situation has worsened since the Brexit vote. Due to the depreciation of the euro and rising prices of PC devices, the market showed marginal degrowth (-0.9 percent) in the second quarter of 2016. Related Stories Intel Cutting 12,000 Jobs Globally PC Decline Continues, But Microsoft Promises A Brighter Future According to Atwal, the PC market should have cleared the inventory of Windows 8 devices, as large businesses are shifting to Windows 10. More affordable hardware and virtual reality content such as games, stories and entertainment will enable PC buyers to upgrade to experience these offerings. Even the mobile phone market is experiencing a 1.6 percent decline in shipments, and is expected to reach 1.5 billion units in 2016. The segment is expected to return to growth in 2017, but at a slower rate than before. "This is no surprise; the smartphone market is maturing, and reaching global saturation with phones that are increasingly capable and remain good enough for longer,” Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner, said. The Android market will be supported by Chinese vendors offering more affordable premium devices. But the analyst firm expects a weaker growth for Apple this year as volumes stabilize after a strong 2015. As a result, the total smartphone market is expected to increase by only 4.5 percent, while the premium smartphone segment will likely decline 1.1 percent in 2016.

Not if your name is Microsoft Your weekends may be safe, admins – IT giants tout 'zero outage' tech Canalys Channels Forum 2016 There isn’t much mystery in PCs these days - and not much margin either - but that could all be about to change if HP Inc’s prophecy on the bewildering range of payment options for device services proves right. The firm rolled out out a “from birth to burial” device-as-a-service package for customers in the summer and it is the second fastest business pipeline across the business, said CEO Dion Weisler. He told attendees at the Canalys Channels Forum that managed print services accounted for up to 80 per cent of its total printer business in some countries and the pattern for DaaS could be similar. “I think that is where the industry is going and that becomes interesting for markets that run through peaks and troughs as most businesses do.” Weisler said HP could lean on pal Intel to build a CPU that could double up as an i3 or an i7 as required, charged by the “click” but “not the chip”. “You put one machine into a customer and depending on what they are doing, they use more or less commute power… the business model changes, and now you could offer device-as-a-service based on the complexity of the task,” he said. With a full estate of PCs managed contractually in this way, the whole situation could “become even more complex”, and where’s the complexity there is some mystery, and where there’s mystery…. The HP exec was challenged to describe DaaS in fewer than 10 words. He failed that task, but said businesses wanted to take “assets off their balance sheet” and to pass management of them into a third party. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 5 Comments More from The Register Fujitsu seeks PC exit, finds willing buyer in Lenovo But can they fund the deal? 13 Comments Microsoft, Lenovo cross-licensing love-in: Android mobes knocked up with...

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Sony PlayStation VR vs. Oculus Rift: Virtual Reality Gaming Battle; Which VR Headgear is Better? Specs and Features Compared By Christian Ver Marcelo Oct 7, 2016 | 12:23 AM Gaming technology has really gone a long way. With virtual reality gaining momentum in the tech industry, giant companies were quick to adapt. Now, we take a look at the Sony PlayStation VR and the Oculus Rift. Design and Comfort There is no doubt that these two devices have premium and futuristic designs. They are both crafted for both function and comfort, so gaming experience would be as immersive as possible. They are also both well-designed to reduce all possible device intrusions and distractions while gaming. The Oculus Rift is a tad more comfortable than the Sony PlayStation VR due to the black fabric finish. However, the Sony headgear also has its own tricks up its sleeve. Some of the device's components have been positioned above the goggles, lifting weight from the users' cheeks and nose. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit This design allows for weight to be distributed more efficiently. Display The Sony PlayStation VR is equipped with a single 5.7-inch display and 1920 x 1080 screen resolution. It touts an OLED technology with RGB subpixels, coupled with a 120 Hertz refresh rate. The display is split into two, giving off a 960 x 1080 picture quality to each of the user's eye. The Oculus Rift, on the other hand, tops out at 90 Hertz of refresh rate. While this is already high and compensates for the requirements to avoid eye strain, the Sony offering does much better. However, the Oculus Rift has a larger 110-degree viewing angle as compared to the PlayStation VR's 100. Game Controls For game tracking, the Sony PlayStation Camera will be tracking nine LED sensors present around the headset. This occurs a thousand times per second and can even track the back of the user's head. The DualShock 4 controllers can also be utilized to interact with games. The Oculus Rift then uses Windows 10 as its platform. The paired computer must be capable of running current generation 3D games in at least 1080p resolution and 75fps. This entails at least an Intel i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and Nvidia GTX 970 or AMD 290 graphics card. The Oculus Touch is utilized to interact with the games Price The PlayStation VR will be launching on October 13 with a $399 price tag. There is also the option for a bundle with the PlayStation Eye camera and Move controllers. There would be a game disc with demos included in the package. There is also an option to bundle the headgear with the recently released PlayStation 4 Pro. Meanwhile, the Oculus Rift will be shipping with a heftier price. It will retail for $599, which already includes the shipping fee and taxes. The device will then be coming with free games and an Xbox One control pad.

(Reuters/Kim Hong-ji) Share Written by Josh Horwitz Obsession Batteries October 07, 2016 You’d think things couldn’t get worse for Samsung Electronics. About one month ago the company issued a recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 devices after consumers complained about devices exploding. Replacement phones with new batteries were supposed to fix the problem—but a recent accident on a Southwest airline suggests even this second batch of phones might be faulty. A second recall—unheard of in the industry—might be imminent. Surely, these incidents have caused some consumers to steer clear of Samsung products. But the explosions haven’t dampened investor enthusiasm one bit. The initial recall caused a sizable dip in Samsung Electronics’ share price, but since then the stock has recovered, and then some. Today (Oct. 7), in fact, it opened at $1,528 per share, an all time historic high, and its third such high this year. What explains the resilient share price? Phone sales are simply no longer that important to Samsung Electronics, or its investors. In a research note dated Oct. 9, just as news of the explosions surfaced, Nomura Securities analysts CW Chung and Chris Chang stated they expect the recall to result in an initial drop in revenue of about $1.5 billion from lost smartphone sales. But it still expects the company to bring in about $103 billion in smartphone sales in 2016, meaning the impact will be marginal. And selling smartphones is just one way Samsung Electronics makes money. The listed company, which is part of the larger Samsung Group, consists of four main divisions: IT and Mobile Communications, which includes mobile devices, desktops, laptops, digital cameras, and network equipment Display, which makes screens for mobile devices, computers, and televisions sold by Samsung and other manufacturers Semiconductors Consumer electronics, which makes appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, and televisions In 2012, just as consumers were ditching their flip phones for smartphones, Samsung’s profits came primarily from its IT and Mobile Communications unit. But that’s changed in recent years. Profits this year are expected to be split nearly 50-50 between mobile phones and the display and semiconductor units. The latter two will make up a majority of profits by 2017, according to Nomura. Two factors are drive this shift. Samsung’s smartphone profits are shrinking, because growth in global smartphones sales is slowing. Along the way, manufacturers are competing more fiercely for customers, which causes prices to go down, which causes profit margins to go down. Meanwhile, Samsung has a head start over the competition in display and semiconductors, just as the smartphone industry prepares to upgrade these components. It’s a market leader in OLED screens, a superior and more sophisticated screen technology than the LCD screens most phones have now. The company controlled about 95% of the market for OLED screens during Q1 2016, and demand is expected to increase as phone companies like Apple ditch LCD for OLED. Samsung also remains ahead of the competition in flash memory, which saves data when power is cut. In 2013 the company released the first 3D NAND chip, an improvement upon 2D planar NAND, roughly three years before competitors like Intel and Micron caught up. Investors see bright prospects for these divisions—so much so that they claim Samsung Electronics’ market cap is lower than it should be. On Oct. 5, activist shareholder Elliott Management issued a lengthy presentation arguing the company is undervalued by 30% to 70%. Samsung should split itself in two separate companies, Elliott said—a holding company that manages stakes in other Samsung divisions and an “operations company” that makes and sells electronics. The split would return more dividends to investors, and bring the company’s opaque corporate structure to something more in line with international transparency standards. If the exploding phones problem persists, will it eventually bring the stock price down? Nomura’s Chung suggests they could, if the ongoing phone sales drop has a “hard landing.” In Q2 2016, Samsung had 22% of the global market share for shipped smartphones, the world leader. If consumers look beyond the recall, and keep buying Samsung phones, the division’s stagnant revenues and profits will persist. But if Samsung’s brand image is tarnished beyond repair, income from phones could sink beyond the point where its components divisions can compensate.

Image: Oculus VR Oculus VR has revealed its hands-on approach to virtual reality with the $199 Oculus Touch, but will the tethered connections and pricey add-ons put some customers off? Like Hoover and Jeep, some brand names are so closely associated with a type of product that they become the name of the product themselves, and the Oculus Rift is certainly in that category. Having finally jumped the hurdle of launching the headset as a finished product, the company is now looking to the next stage – specifically the user’s hands – with the launch of Oculus Touch. Aimed at first-person shooters Revealed at its Oculus Connect 3 developer conference, the pair of controllers are certainly unique looking; with its circular band for the user to put their hand into, to allow for greater natural movement. They also come with a small joystick and buttons on each side of the small controller to select whatever option you might need. But perhaps the feature most likely to be used will be the trigger button towards the front of the controllers, which opens up the Oculus Rift to a serious back catalogue of first-person shooters. Demos of the controllers at the conference appear to show an ability to track the movements of your thumb, index finger and the remaining three fingers combined to allow a realistic version of your hand. Much like the parent headset, Oculus Touch works off a tethered system so there won’t be much scope for movement. However, it is working on an untethered stand-alone unit – with help from Facebook – putting it in competition with some newcomers like Intel and its Project Alloy. Accessories apply The decision taken by Oculus VR to release hand controllers for a virtual reality (VR) world was essentially a given, with many of its competitors (like the PlayStation VR and the HTC Vive) already announcing their own similar accessories. For those who already own an Oculus Rift, the company has also announced a release date of 6 December and a price tag of $199, but the product can be pre-ordered as of 10 October. There are some accessories that are certainly not small add-ons, such as a third sensor that allows the user to get room-scale support for their VR gear, costing an additional $79. When you put all of this together – from a first-time buyer’s perspective – it will set a person back $877. As for newly announced game releases, perhaps one of the most exciting is Arktika.1, a game set in a dystopian future where the world has frozen over. It is designed by the same studio that released the very popular Metro 2033 series.

In Q3 earnings guidance published today, Samsung said it expected an operating profit of approximately 7.8 trillion won (around $7 billion), on sales of approximately 49 trillion won (around $44 billion) — a profit increase of just over 4 billion won ($3.6 million) from the same quarter last year. That figure outstripped analyst estimates, but there are some signs that Samsung is feeling the effects of the Note 7 recall. Overall sales during the period from July to September are down on analyst projections, with the expected number of Note 7 smartphones sold drastically reduced after continuing problems with exploding batteries that first surfaced in September. The figures still project a year-on-year increase, but coming off the back of its biggest quarterly profit of the past two years, the company could have put in a stronger showing. "Samsung was originally expected to perform better and better this year," Nomura Holdings analyst Chung Chang Won told Bloomberg, specifying that the one-off recall costs will have put a dent in that plan. Samsung's semiconductor seems to have performed well But while the mobile side of the business is contending with an ongoing problem, Samsung's overall profits seem to have been buoyed by other sections of the company. Speaking before the guidance was released, Lee Seung-woo, a Seoul-based analyst at IBK Securities said that although the recall had likely "taken its toll" on the mobile division, Samsung's "other businesses, particularly semiconductors, have fared extraordinarily well." Semiconductor prices rose over the past few months — a trend also spotted by competitor Intel. "If its mobile unit doesn't get into further trouble from here and given the strong performance of its components businesses, Samsung shares will continue its upward march," Chung said, but it doesn't look like Samsung is in the clear with its Note 7 yet. Earlier this week, a supposedly safe replacement Note 7 caught fire on a Southwest Airlines plane shortly before takeoff, prompting a fresh investigation by US regulators.

Military Support for Innovation Is a Matter of Culture by Staff Writers McLean VA (SPX) Oct 07, 2016 General Paul J. Selva. When Defense Sec. Ashton Carter reached out to Silicon Valley a year ago, the move was lauded as a Washington paean to innovation. Instead, it was only the first step toward a cultural-change goal. "If we form a hypothesis and build an experiment, you have to be willing to be wrong," said Gen. Paul Selva, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Center for Strategic and International Studies on August 5. "Then we can discount that idea and move on to another one. My experience with commercial industry tells me that innovation in commercial industry is exactly that process." He contrasted the commercial industry-like process the DoD is running with its Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) outposts in Silicon Valley, Boston and, soon to open, Austin, Texas, with what he is dealing with now internally. The concept applies to commercial technology development all over the world, including the Washington, DC, metro area. "Failure is not an option," Selva said of ideas that come to him from the military. "Asking the hard questions is only acceptable if you know the answer, and none of that fosters innovation." It's something industry learned long ago. "When I have finally decided that a result is worth getting, I go ahead on it and make trial after trial until it comes," said Thomas Edison in an 1898 article in Success Magazine. This was after he acknowledged 3,000 trials before getting two answers he needed to invent the electric light. An article in the September 4 issue of Financial Times (subscription only) acknowledged DoD's history of support of Silicon Valley innovation. The concept of Siri, Apple's voice-recognition technology, began with funding by DoD at Stanford Research Institute. The Global Positioning System was developed by the military for missile guidance before it was transitioned to companies that have used it to help convert mobile phones to smartphones. But "Silicon Valley is a long way from its roots when it was funded by the DoD," Steve Blank, an entrepreneur and professor at Stanford University, said in the Financial Times article. So is innovation writ large. Technological advancements that will impact the services "are more likely going to come from innovation in the commercial sector than they will from real technological change inside our militaries," Selva said. Illustrations of that reality abound. They include the Intelsat EpicNG constellation of high-throughput satellites, built on a three-year time line to send data faster than ever before. Technological advances are continuous, and each of the satellites in the EpicNG constellation launched over the coming years will be more advanced than the last. The military is trying to change the development time limitation issue with a move back to prototyping, but success with such an effort will only come if the willingness to be wrong can be advanced by people like Selva and Carter. "Our mantra is to move fast and break stuff," said Josh Wolfe in the Financial Times article. He is a founder of Lux Capital, which invests in start-ups developing technology that has both military and commercial applications. Among the reasons that defense needs industry is investment dollars. In the mid-1980s, the U.S. government accounted for 50 percent of global research funding, but today that amount is less than one-tenth of one percent, a figure the Financial Times quoted from a New York University report. Still, said Carter in an April speech at Stanford, "our budget invests nearly $72 billion in R and D. Now, to give you a little context, that's more than double what Apple, Intel and Google spent on R and D last year combined." But he acknowledged that only $12.5 billion of that was DoD R and D dollars that went into labs and engineering centers. Ironically, some of that is invested in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which uses it to contract industry and academia to prove - or disprove - programs that can result in military technology. It is the same process that has produced commercial success - yet no other DoD agency conducts programs in this fashion. Industry is investing money in technology development that ultimately can benefit the military. It's up to the government to take advantage of that investment in ways such as more and better use of commercial satellite communications, hosted payloads and ground services. That is a cultural change the military doesn't have to go to Silicon Valley, Boston or Austin to adopt.

The company will install dark fiber infrastructure in an existing facility in the Vint Hill Business Park. Virginia successfully competed against North Carolina for the project, which will create 54 new jobs in Fauquier County.Governor McAuliffe and other Virginia officials met with OVH leadership during a June 2015 trade and marketing mission to Europe. “OVH’s decision to establish its North American headquarters in Virginia after meetings and discussions in Europe and Virginia further solidifies the Commonwealth’s global standing as the top player in the flourishing data center sector,” said Governor McAuliffe. “Thanks to our competitive IT infrastructure and skilled workforce, Fauquier County will be home to one of the most elite cloud providers in the world. OVH is a tremendous addition to the nearly 600 data processing and hosting centers in the Commonwealth, and we are proud that the company is part of our ongoing success in building a new Virginia economy.” “OVH is the leading cloud provider in Europe, and we are honored the company has chosen Fauquier County as its U.S. home,” said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Todd Haymore. “This significant project is a win-win, as OVH will invest in infrastructure enhancements to the Vint Hill Business Park, opening access to the development of nearly 150 acres with increased fiber, sewer, water and electrical capacity. It is exciting to watch Virginia grow as a leader in the data center industry, which has accounted for more than 7,600 jobs and $9 billion in capital investment since 2005.” Founded in 1999 in France, OVH has a long history of innovative technologies building its data center offerings from the processor up, leveraging technology partnerships with Cisco, Intel, Microsoft and VMware, among others. Today, OVH provides cloud infrastructure as a service with products including bare metal and virtual servers, networking, private cloud solutions and more. OVH operates 250,000 physical servers in 17 data centers and deploys its own fiber optic network of 7.3 Tbps bandwidth through three continents. OVH’s unique expertise and strong offerings drive its rapid growth which leads the company to deploy new data centers and network points of presence around the world. OVH customers range from web startups to global enterprises including Zipcar, Rogers, and Michelin. “The U.S. is a strategic market for OVH as we grow our business, and Virginia was a natural choice for our first presence in this new market,” said OVH CEO Laurent Allard. “Fauquier County offers a unique mix of a high-end, innovative digital infrastructure combined with a business and employee-friendly environment, along with a dedicated team that greatly facilitated our move.” The Virginia Economic Development Partnership worked with Fauquier County to secure this project for Virginia. Governor McAuliffe approved a $1.25 million grant from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund to assist Fauquier County with the project. The company will also be eligible to receive sales and use tax exemptions on equipment. Funding and services to support the company’s employee training activities will also be provided through the Virginia Jobs Investment Program. Fauquier County Board of Supervisors Chairman Christopher Granger added, “The County is delighted to welcome OVH, a worldwide leader in communications technology, to join our growing business community. To support this important project, Fauquier County stepped up with a comprehensive package of tax, infrastructure and workforce development incentives. We look forward to the company’s future success here.” “I am delighted that this center is locating in Fauquier,” said Delegate Scott Lingamfelter. “This will help our community and provide our young people with new job opportunities. It’s really great news.”   ### Governor Terry McAuliffe About The Governor The Administration Constituent Services Policy Priorities Newsroom Executive Actions Integrity Commission At Your Service ConnectVA eVA website Expenditures State Agencies Cities & Counties Elected Officials Site Resources Website Feedback Web Privacy Policy Accessibility Site Map Unsubscribe from email lists Stay Connected Governor Terry McAuliffe Common Ground for Virginia P.O.

Cable management is one of the biggest problems facing modern VR headsets. A big cord hanging off the back of your neck can have detrimental effects on immersion, and pose a tripping hazard. Yet wired is often preferred, as standalone mobile options, like the Gear VR and Google Cardboard, don’t offer nearly the resolution or performance found on tethered, desktop-based headsets. Wireless headsets also lack positional tracking. While spinning your head while sitting still is fine, the tracking starts to go wonky if you lean too far away from your original position. Related: Oculus Touch will be $199, but that’s just the beginning of what Oculus announced Oculus is striking right in between the two options with Santa Cruz, a prototype headset we had a brief chance to try out at Oculus Connect. It’s still an early prototype, but it already has us hopeful for its potential in upcoming VR experiences. Why now? On the eve of Oculus Connect 2 in 2015, founder Palmer Luckey took to Reddit to quash any hope of inside-out tracking coming to mobile virtual reality. “Our computing vision teams are doing some amazing work, but VR-grade inside-out tracking is not currently workable on mobile devices.” So what’s changed in the last year? Not much, according to Oculus’ Head of Mobile Max Cohen. Please enable Javascript to watch this video “The processors that we’re using are similar to what you’d find in regular mobile computation.” Instead, he says, it’s ambition, and a few clutch discoveries, that have brought the concept as far as the Santa Cruz prototype. “It’s just a lot of hard work, and some secret sauce.” So why show it off at Oculus Connect, when it’s so far from completion? Cohen says that “although this is just a feature prototype, it’s something that we think is going to be one of the most important aspects of VR.” Cutting the cord If you didn’t know any better, you might think the Santa Cruz prototype is just a Rift headset with some extra parts glued on. A small black box sat right on the back of the headset, comfortably falling right at the back of your neck. It also had a bulkier support structure on the headband, though that’s to be expected on a prototype. What wasn’t expected was how well comfortable the headset felt. Like the Rift, the balance between front and back weight, helped by the top strap, worked to make sure the headset was snug but comfortable. Without a cable, it’s much easier to feel totally immersed in a VR environment. Despite its resemblance to the consumer Rift headset, there are many differences under the hood. Four tiny cameras positioned around the outside edge of the screen capture the outside world, tracking user location without any help from external sensors, or even a computer. That means it also supports room-scale experiences, using the “Guardian” system to keep users in pre-determined bounds by showing the borders of the play space in VR. Admittedly, the content of the demo we saw wasn’t terribly exciting. We saw a short video referred to as “Paper Town,” which has been floating around the Oculus demo reel since the DK2 days. The version we saw at Oculus Connect 3 had a larger walkable area, with objects at the edge of the space to give you an idea of the usable areal without having to flash the digital boundary. Oculus Many of our questions about the technical aspects of the headset went unanswered, except to remind us that this a prototype. As Cohen says, “this is by no means anywhere near production ready, but we think it’s a pretty neat experience at this stage.” Conclusion What struck us about the Santa Cruz prototype isn’t the ability to fit all that power onto the headset, or that inside-out tracking works just as well as any sensor-based solution. What’s most impressive is how all the pieces come together to form a sum that’s greater than their parts. Without a cable, it’s so much easier to feel totally immersed in the environment. Add in full room-scale support, and you’ll forget the headset is even there at all, until the boundary pops up. Related: A rift in the Rift: Why room-scale VR is about to split Oculus fans apart Oculus isn’t the only company racing towards that goal. Google Tango is no longer a project, and while we have our doubts about its current performance, it’s clear the tech has legs for exactly this sort of project. This option is one that will live in harmony with existing Oculus offerings. “Mark [Zuckerberg] talked about standalone being in the middle, but the reality is that middle is very large.” Cohen says, “You’re going to see a lot of differentiation in the standalone category.” Intel is in this game too, with its Project Alloy. And Qualcomm has its VR820 headset, which we tried at IFA 2016. Suddenly, within the span of just a few months, wireless VR has gone from an affordable, mobile-centric solution to a serious possibility that’s being considered by some of tech’s most influential companies as the foundation for future VR headsets. If there’s one thing that’s absolutely certain about the state of virtual reality in 2016, it’s that things are still in flux. From best practices in game design, all the way down to hardware, everyone is experimenting and playing, and trying to break the rules. We’re just glad Oculus let us in on the process.

Reprints Reprints Samsung may face a second recall of its Galaxy Note 7. Credit: Samsung Most Popular Samsung might be grappling with the fallout from its exploding Note 7 smartphones, but as a key supplier of displays and memory chips, the South Korean company showed it can rely on other phone makers and PC manufacturers to drive sales and profit. The recall of the defective devices has dominated headlines since it was announced last month, and Samsung has worked to contain the fallout and insulate its component businesses. That helped maintain growth as new devices from rivals stoke demand for components. While Samsung appears to be remain on a firm footing amid the crises, a new challenge emerged this week when billionaire activist Paul Elliott Singer started a campaign to get the family-controlled company to restructure. That, in addition to Friday's estimate-topping preliminary earnings report, fueled a rise in Samsung's shares to a record. By midday, the stock was up 0.5 percent at 1.7 million won. Operating income rose 5.5 percent to 7.8 trillion won ($7 billion) on a preliminary basis in the three months ended September, exceeding the 7.58 trillion-won average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

Samsung Heir Apparent Jay Y to Join Board as Note 7 Crisis Deepens Attention Note 7 Users: Samsung Recalling Your Smartphones Due to Battery Fault "Without the one-off recall costs, Samsung was originally expected to perform better and better this year," said Chung Chang Won, an analyst at Nomura Holdings in Seoul. "If its mobile unit doesn't get into further trouble from here and given the strong performance of its components businesses, Samsung shares will continue its upward march." Still, there are signs that the exploding phone issue won't be going away anytime soon. Samsung may face an unusual second recall of its Note 7 smartphones if one that caught fire aboard an airliner this week is a replacement device as its owner says, according to two former U.S. safety officials. While the company didn't specify the impact of the recall of 2.5 million phones, analysts have estimated the cost at $1 billion to $2 billion. Sales were 49 trillion won, the company said, compared with the 51 trillion won analysts expected. Net income and divisional performance will be released when Samsung discloses audited results later this month. Analysts have cut their estimates of Note 7 sales by 38% to 8 million units this year, according to the average of six projections compiled by Bloomberg. "The recall-related costs have surely taken its toll on its mobile business in the quarter but its other businesses, particularly semiconductors, have fared extraordinarily well," Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities in Seoul, said before the earnings release. Samsung's business is at a point where it needs a major overhaul, according to the activist investor. Mr. Singer is betting that Samsung Electronics' heir apparent, Jay Y. Lee, is so keen to modernize his family's empire without losing control that he'll embrace a complex plan to break up the company, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Singer is proposing that Samsung split into an operating company and a holding entity, dual-list the former on a U.S. exchange, pay shareholders a special dividend of 30 trillion Korean won, and take on three independent board members. Mr. Singer's demands are broadly in line with changes that Samsung's Mr. Lee himself had been contemplating, the Wall Street Journal reported. Audited earnings are usually announced three weeks after the preliminary numbers. Operating income from the phone division probably was 2.7 trillion won in the quarter, according to the analyst survey. Operating income at the semiconductor business probably was 3.3 trillion won in the third quarter on sales of 12.9 trillion won, largely helped by price rebound, according to the analyst survey. Signs of a demand recovery in semiconductors are also witnessed by Samsung's bigger chip competitor Intel. The world's biggest maker of semiconductors said last month that it has raised its forecast for third-quarter sales, largely bolstered by growing optimism for the PC market, which helped boost prices. DDR3 4-gigabyte dynamic random access memory chips rose for a second straight quarter, reaching $2.01 on Sept. 30, according to data from inSpectrum Tech. That compares with a March 31 price of $1.68. The company's display division, which also makes screens using organic light-emitting diodes, probably posted a profit of 760 billion won while the consumer electronics unit, which encompasses TVs and appliances, was estimated to be 76% higher at 635 billion won, according to analyst surveys.
