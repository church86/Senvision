Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As I was saying, an 18-core CPU is obviously irrelevant for PC gaming. Actually, I was speaking then of AMD’s then-staggering 16-core Threadripper CPU. Two weeks later, Threadripper is already ancient news. It’s been comprehensively gazumped by a new 18-core CPU from Intel and suddenly the PC hardware landscape looks a little potty. I know I’ve been bleating for literally years about Intel’s carpet bagging and how we needed AMD to spice things up. But this is a bit ridiculous. Be careful what you ask for… First and foremost, this is a developing situation. Just two weeks ago, it seemed Intel was all set to unleash its first 12-core desktop CPU. Now the ante has been upped to fully 18 cores in an official announcement for the Computex tech fest in Taiwan. But the announcement was unusual in that it included some fully fleshed out details, including the full model names of the new chips along with core and thread counts, but excluded other critical items such as clockspeeds and power consumption ratings. It’s pure speculation on my behalf, but this feels to me like a very last-minute response to AMD’s CPU roll outs of late. Anywho, the short version of this rather unusual story is that Intel is wheeling out no fewer than nine new processors for its equally new high-end platform, the latter composed of, again, a new socket in the form of LGA2066 and yet more newness courtesy of the X299 chipset. Topping things off is the Core i9 (yup, the i9 family is new, too) 7980XE with 18 cores and 36 threads, but no known clockspeeds for now. It’s yours for $1,999 or very likely a painfully similar figure preceeded by a pound sign and is almost certainly irrelevant to all of us. Ryzen 9 begat Core i9 Intel, of course, has long had the ability to fire out this kind of CPU. It has offered Xeon CPUs with almost countless cores for several generations. But it has taken AMD to finally force its hand. How many of these CPus get sold into the high-end desktop market, I’m not sure. My sense is that chips like the 7980XE are as much or possibly more about ensuring bragging rights for Intel as actually generating sales revenue. The i9 line up also includes a range of nearly but not quite as exotic 16, 14, 12 and 10-core chips, the last of which seems almost accessible by comparison at $999. But it’s really the new core i7 models that are gamer-relevant. The new eight-core Core i7-7820X clocks in at $599 and has very healthy clockspeeds of 3.6GHz base, 4.3GHz Turbo and 4.5GHz Turbo 3.0 (that’s a special Turbo mode that actively determines which cores are capable of running at the highest stable frequency). If you can afford it, that does rather seem to offer a pretty comprehensive combo of single-threaded frequency and multi-core parallelism that should make light work of pretty much any game for a few years to come. But I’d say it’s the new Core i7-7800X that’s most interesting. It’s not exactly cheap at $389, but it is Intel’s most affordable six-core CPU yet and offers a decent Turbo speed of 4GHz. Certainly, it would be a tough choice between the 7800X and the lower end of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen 7 family. AMD still offers better value, to be sure. But Intel is at least more competitive at that rough price point. I count 20 cores. Like I said, a developing situation… As for the oddball Core i7-7740X and Core i5-7640X will sit in the bottom two rungs of Intel’s new LGA2066 range, I’m not sure what to make of them. My understanding is that they are the existing Kaby Lake quad-core CPU dies, as seen in the Core i7-7700K and Core i5-7600K for the mainstream LGA1151 socket, but rewired for LGA2066 and with the integrated graphics disabled. At $339 and $242 respectively, they’re price parity with their LGA1151 cousins – at least at pre-announcement pricing for the existing pair – though they offer very slightly higher baseclocks but not Turbo speeds. The only way I can see to make sense of them is as gateway CPUs for the LGA2066 platform. In other words, they help keep the overall up-front cost of upgrading to an LGA2066 PC under control and allow a future upgrade path to those big core count CPUs. As things stand right now, then, these latest developments from Intel and AMD arguably don’t have much direct impact on the choices most gamers must make when configuring a new PC. All the 10-core and beyond models are arguably too much money for far too little gaming relevance. Ermegerd, so many pins… Even Intel’s new six and eight-core CPUs are probably too pricey for the majority. Meanwhile, the new Intel quad-core models come with some expensive baggage in terms of requiring an X299 motherboard. In other words, the real-world choice remains that of Intel’s existing Core i5 and Core i7 chips for the LGA1151 socket, which offer the safest bet for ensuring good gaming performance in this very here-and-now, or AMD’s Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7s, which are clearly better value and might well prove more future proof thanks to offering more affordable six and eight-core options. Like I said, the situation is developing fast. I fully expect to see Intel add a six-core chip for its mainstream LGA1151 socket later this year and I’m hoping that will be part of a further re-jigging of prices that will see six cores slot in where Intel’s best quad-core chips currently reside in the price lists and those in turn become yet more accessible. Things are moving in the right direction, then. But I’d be holding out just a little longer to see how things develop later this year before pulling the trigger on that new gaming rig.

What most people don’t know is that single socket Xeons (previously branded as E5-1xxx) are generally overclockable. For example, when the i7-4960X was supposedly the baddest kid on the block, you could buy a 8C E5-1680v2 and overclock it. It even had better thermal properties, as it used a huge 12-core die with 4 cores disabled (whereas the 4960X used a small 6 core die). So, while it will probably be a weird OEM SKU us mere mortals can’t buy (as was the case with Haswell/Broadwell), an unlocked 24 core+ Skylake-e monster could exist.

IMO, they are so good that building with Intel right now is a mistake. Intel could have reacted to this in many ways, but I think they have done it in the worst possible way.

The cheaper skylake-sp lacks the fancy new Turbo Boost, and the clock rates are not great if you are in it for gaming. The $999 part seems to just have more cores and pci-e lanes. I’m not sure what the purpose of the Kaby Lake-X parts are, except perhaps to offer an entry point into the platform. You don’t get the four channel memory, nor increased pci-e lanes, nor the Turbo Boost 3.0, nor the AVX-512 instructions. Seems like it would be better to wait for Coffee Lake.

Log in to Reply 08/06/2017 at 23:48 ravenshrike says: Here’s the problem for Intel. The boards for X299 are probably going to start at around 200 dollars. Whereas you can get the 6 core Ryzen part and an overclockable motherboard for all of 320 bucks, 300 if you’re willing to go small form factor. This vs figure almost double for the 6 core Skylake-X and mobo. Log in to Reply 09/06/2017 at 00:53 Buuurr says: The problem you are siting has never been a problem for Intel. They hold 80% of the market share for processors. They have held this share for a good 15-20 years now. AMD has always been the cheap alternative, as it is the case now. The status quo has in no shape or form changed. How could this be defined as a problem for Intel? From a business standpoint it is off to the market as usual.

This has awakened that sleep and made it more greater than before and the future of the PC is still alive as long their is competitiveness and technological advances. I love Intel for their dedicated hard work. I love Nvidia for their dedicated hard work. all the rest are nags just helping the top two go faster. thanks nags.. p.s. boooo to consoles lol Log in to Reply 09/06/2017 at 02:33 Tuidjy says: I know a few definitions for carper bagging, and I cannot see any way any of them can match your use in the third sentence. It clearly has nothing to do with luggage or the American South. I cannot have anything to do with newcomers, because Intel has been around forever, and were founded explicitly to do what they have always done, i.e. they did not move or switch targets for a underhanded gain. And I finally, I even looked up the British meaning, which I knew was different from the American ones, and I cannot see how Intel is trying to demutualize any company. So how are Intel carper bagging? Arguably, someone could think that the processor scene needs some carpetbaggers, but Intel cannot play that role.

Both are slim, capable machines but with enough differences to make it a tough decision. At WWDC in June 2017, Apple updated the specs of both laptops. The new MacBook has Intel's 7th-gen Kaby Lake processors, but the MacBook Air still runs the Broadwell generation. The 12in MacBook is both smaller and lighter than the once “light as air” MacBook Air, which begs the question: which is the best lightweight laptop from Apple? In this article we will weigh up the pros and cons for both models, and look at the best upgrade options, and some alternatives that might suit your needs better. Read on for more detailed comparisons of Apple's newest lightweight laptops, specs, design and more. Read: New Retina MacBook release date, specs & UK pricing Also: Apple MacBook Air (mid 2017) review MacBook Air vs MacBook: Design, Dimensions and weight The MacBook comes in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and Space Grey, just like the iPhone. Judging by the popularity of the Rose Gold iPhone, for some the fact that the MacBook is now in that hue will be reason enough to buy it. However, if you’d prefer a more muted colour the silver or grey options may appeal. Alternatively, the MacBook Air comes in just the traditional aluminium.  While the MacBook might sound like it should be bigger, with its 12in display, lengthwise it is smaller by almost 2cm. You may notice that the width of the 11in Air is slightly less, but it’s only 45mm different, less than half a cm, and unlikely to make a big difference to how easily you can fit the Mac laptop in your bag. The 12in MacBook measures 28.05cm by 19.65cm, and is 0.35-1.31cm thick. The 13in MacBook Air measures 32.5m by 22.7cm and is 0.3-1.7cm thick. The MacBook is lighter than the 13in MacBook Air, which weighs 1.35kg. The 12in MacBook is undoubtedly the most portable and lightweight MacBook ever made at 920g. Read: MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro review: 13in Mac laptop battle | 13 ways to use Force Touch on the new MacBook BUYING ADVICE: Design, Dimensions and weight If it’s the lightest and smallest Mac you are looking for, then get the MacBook. Just remember that the MacBook Air still gives you a bigger screen. When it comes to design, only the MacBook offers you a selection of colour choices and that may be a big part of the buying decision for some. If you aren’t keen on Rose Gold or Gold then there is the choice of Space Grey or Silver – but if it’s Silver you are going for, perhaps the Air will fulfil your needs. It may seem an obvious choice at this point, but there are a number of other factors involved in the decision, including the specs of the machine, the ports and other features on offer, read on to find out more. There is also the significant difference in price, with the MacBook Air starting at £949 and the MacBook starting at £1,249. That’s £300 more, so the MacBook justify its higher price? Read on. MacBook Air vs MacBook: Specs comparison  The MacBook Air offers a 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor (capable of Turbo Boost to 3.2GHz) and comes with 8GB RAM and an integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000 graphics card. You'll have to pay £100 extra for 256GB compared to 128GB though. You can opt to upgrade at point of purchase to an i7 processor and up to 512GB SSD. That option costs £1,384. The 12in MacBook ships in two configurations. One features a 1.2GHz dual-core Intel Core m3 processor, which can Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz. The other costs £300 more and offers a 1.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, which can Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz. Both MacBooks offer 8GB RAM and Intel HD Graphics 615. If you want all the bells and whistles of an i7 processor, 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM it;ll cost you a whopping £1,864. The MacBook Air (above) is bigger and heavier than the MacBook, but only very slightly BUYING ADVICE: Specs comparison On the face of it the MacBook Air offers the best specs, with a faster processor, not just clock speed, but a Core i5 as opposed to a Core M at the base model level. Both offer 8GB RAM as standard. The main big difference is the fact that the MacBook ships with a 256GB flash drive, while the entry-level MacBook Air offers only 128GB. If it's specs you want for your money, then the MacBook Air is still better value. You'll get an i5 processor and 8GB RAM for £300 less than an m3 MacBook. If you only want 128GB storage, you can add an i7 processor for £135 and still spend nearly £200 less than the base MacBook. Wondering which Mac to buy? Read our best Mac buying guide MacBook Air vs MacBook: Processor comparison  Regarding that processor difference. How does the Core M stand up to the Core i5? The Core M is Intel’s newer generation of processors that run so cool that they can be fanless. Being fanless means that the computer in which they feature can be thinner and smaller than ever. That M in Core M stands for mobile, though, and these are processors destined for tablets and hybrid laptops, so don’t expect anything like the power of the Core i5. We'll have to wait till we get our hands on the machines for full benchmarks, but it's still safe to stay the MacBook Air is the better performer. That's not to say the 12in MacBook is a complete slouch; we have the 2016 version and rarely experience lag in everyday tasks, and the new 2017 model will be even quicker with the new Kaby Lake processor. However the full i5 processor rather than a mobile version in the MacBook Air is still more capable but hasn't benefitted from a Kaby Lake update - it's still on Broadwell. BUYING ADVICE: Processor comparison While the MacBook Air processor is faster than the MacBook in terms of clock speed there is some question of how big a difference that will make in real world testing. You don't want to edit video on the Core m3 MacBook, for example. If it’s a powerful laptop you are looking for you probably need to consider something other than the MacBook Air or MacBook. The MacBook Pro, which comes in 13in or 15in versions, offers a faster processor and when you consider the 13in models, there isn’t a big leap in price from the MacBook Air to the MacBook Pro. Read: MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro review: 13in Mac laptop battle. MacBook Air vs MacBook: Battery life   Apple went out of its way to fill every empty space in the MacBook with battery. The company describes how it used “every millimetre of space inside the slim MacBook enclosure.” Apple explains on its website how: “Traditional rectangular batteries leave unused space when placed in a curved enclosure, so we created a new type of battery technology that allowed for an innovative terraced battery cell, custom shaped to fit the specific contours of the enclosure.” As a result Apple has eked out 35 per cent more battery cell capacity than would have been possible without the innovation. Batteries actually sit on top of each other, as you can see in the below illustration. Apple claims the MacBook will offer a battery life of up to 10 hours. The 13in MacBook Air has more space in the chassis for battery - enough for 12 hours of battery life, it claims. The Air is certainly capable of even more than that from our experience, and is one of the industry leaders. Apple's MacBook batteries are layered in every available space BUYING ADVICE: Battery life  If you want to buy either of these computers and battery life is important to you, you will get more juice out of the MacBook Air. It's the kind of machine you can leave the house with without the charger. Confidence in the MacBook is slightly lower, though the latest generation will give more battery than previously. 10 hours is still impressive, but the results are less consistent.  MacBook Air vs MacBook: Screen & resolution    The biggest difference is the fact that the MacBook offers a Retina display. That display is LED-backlit display with IPS technology, and offers a 2304x1440 resolution at 226 pixels per inch, as well as support for millions of colours, and a 16:10 aspect ratio. The MacBook Air, on the other hand, offers 1440x900 resolution at 16:9 aspect ratio. The MacBook Air has attracted criticism for the quality of its screen, and the fact that the 16:9 aspect ratio means that the screen depth is much shallower – this matters to you if you want to see the maximum number of lines of a document on your laptop screen. Although it may suit those who watch widescreen movies as the 16:9 aspect ratio is suited to that kind of use.    The bezel around the edge is smaller on the 12in MacBook so you get more screen without having a bigger laptop.  BUYING ADVICE: Screen & resolution  The MacBook offers the superior display, both in terms of screen size and resolution. If it’s a good quality screen you need then the MacBook Air probably won’t cut the mustard. If you like to watch films on your laptop you may be thinking that the MacBook Air would be better with its 16:9 aspect ratio – but the quality of the display is poor in comparison so you probably wouldn’t benefit all that much. There are a couple of options if you are concerned about screen quality. Either plug your MacBook Air into an external screen when you are sat at your desk, or opt for the MacBook Pro with Retina display – at £999 the 13in entry-level model is still cheaper than the MacBook. It's not that the MacBook Air has a bad screen - but the MacBook's is better, if smaller. MacBook Air vs MacBook: Graphics     The MacBook sports the Intel HD Graphics 615 and supports dual display and video mirroring. It can support up to 3840x2160 pixels at 30Hz on an external display. The MacBook Air offers superior graphics: the Intel HD Graphics 6000 and supports dual display and video mirroring. It can support up to 2560x1600 pixels on an external display, less than the MacBook. The MacBook Air does offer Thunderbolt digital video output however. We've yet to test the latest MacBook Air, but we have tested previous generations extensively. When we ran the Batman: Arkham City benchmark test, the 2014 and 2015 MacBook Air models both averaged 29 frames per second in medium detail; and 24 fps in High detail. We haven't yet tested the latest MacBook's graphics, so we can’t comment on how good they are. However, like the Air, it seems unlikely that the graphics in the MacBook would be suitable for game play. BUYING ADVICE: Graphics    Both of these Macs have inferior graphics cards compared to the MacBook Pro, so if good graphics capabilities are necessary for you, you should consider opting for the MacBook Pro instead. However, of the two, the MacBook Air is still superior.  MacBook Air vs MacBook: Capacity      This is one area where the entry level MacBook Air lets itself down in comparison to the MacBook. The £949 MacBook Air ships with 128GB storage, while the entry level MacBook ships with twice the storage, 256GB, although it costs £1,249. £300 is a lot. For a better comparison, the £1,099 MacBook Air ships with 256GB, but that's still £150 less than the MacBook with the same storage. If you are looking for the most storage possible, the cheapest you can get a 512GB MacBook for is £1,549. To get that much storage in your MacBook Air you need to turn to the build to order options. To upgrade the base 128GB MacBook Air to a 512GB drive costs an extra £300, bringing the price to £1,249. That’s £300 less than the 512GB MacBook. BUYING ADVICE: Capacity    It's good that the base MacBook comes with 256GB where the MacBook Air only has 128GB, but the difference of £300 is a lot to justify if you're concerned about storage. Instead, you could opt for the base MacBook Air specced up to 256GB for £1,099.  In terms of storage, the MacBook Air represents better value. MacBook Air vs MacBook: Ports and input The most obvious difference between the MacBook and MacBook Air is the lack of ports on the former. The MacBook (in)famously features only a USB-C port and a headphone port. There isn’t even a Magsafe port for charging as charging is done through the USB-C which also supports USB 3.1 Gen 1 (up to 5 Gbps), Native DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA output using USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter (sold separately) and HDMI video output using USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (sold separately). The USB-C port may support a lot of peripherals, with the necessary adaptor, but there is still only the one USB-C port available and for many that will not be enough. As for the MacBook Air, the 13in model features two USB 3 ports (5Gbps), one Thunderbolt 2 port (up to 20 Gbps), and a MagSafe 2 power port. You also get a SDXD card slot for transferring the photos taken on your camera. The MacBook Air has Bluetooth 4,0 whereas the MacBook has version 4.2. One thing that the MacBook features that the MacBook Air doesn’t is the Force Touch trackpad. This trackpad (which also features on the MacBook Pro) is sensitive to varying degrees of touch pressure: you can set it to respond to harder/deeper presses to activate different features. It also provides what is known as haptic feedback, a tangible, tactile response that in theory allows you to 'feel' what you are interacting with, which means that you feel like you are pressing the trackpad in when actually the pad isn’t moving at all. Read: The new MacBook doesn't deserve the criticism it's getting Also: Best USB Type-C accessories for the Retina MacBook The USB-C port on the MacBook can be used for charging or data transfer BUYING ADVICE: Ports and input If you have a laptop right now and you use all the ports all the time then you may not be able to cope with only one port on the MacBook. However, if your concern is that you won’t be able to use your external mouse or plug in a hard drive while charging your Mac you may be worrying unnecessarily. Adapters are available that will extend the port so that you can plug in more than one thing at a time. The question is whether the tradeoff in ports is enough to justify the smaller, thinner design of the MacBook. And whether you really like the Force Touch trackpad; try one in store.  MacBook Air vs MacBook: Price  This the big difference between the MacBook Air and the MacBook. The entry level MacBook price starts at £1,249 while the entry level MacBook Air is £300 cheaper at £749. The difference in price might be acceptable if the MacBook was more powerful, but you are not paying that extra £300 for a more powerful machine. What you get for the £300 is a better display and a smaller and lighter laptop. While we think the display on the MacBook Air would benefit from improvement, we think £300 is a high price to pay for what is essentially a better screen.  And at the end of the day you could just plug your MacBook Air into an external display which would likely cost you less than £300 (and you’d have the necessary port to do so). That said, the money for the MacBook gets you a better looking, lighter piece of tech. BUYING ADVICE: Price If you are looking for a cheap Mac option then the MacBook is simply not for you right now. It is one of the most expensive Mac laptops as well as being the least powerful. This is a laptop for those who are looking for a status symbol to write their emails and presentations on. If money is no object and you have a penchant for gold then by all means buy a MacBook, but if you just want the cheapest Mac laptop the MacBook Air is a better deal.   MacBook Air vs MacBook: Build to order options    You can get the MacBook with either 256GB or 512GB with build to order specs - a more power i5 or i7 processor and/or up to 16GB RAM.  There are build to order options on the MacBook Air, which gives you a lot more flexibility to design the Mac that best suits your needs. Moving to a Core i7 from i5 will cost you £135. You can also upgrade to 256GB for £150 or 512GB for £300 (that's steep).  BUYING ADVICE: Build to order options For now we’d recommend that if it’s a light laptop you are after you stick with the MacBook Air, upgrading it at point of sale to include the extra RAM and if you can afford it, the faster processor. Read: 8 laptops that rival Apple's new MacBook OUR VERDICT For now it’s clear that the MacBook Air offers the better deal in terms of specs, presuming that you are looking for a light laptop – if weight isn’t an issue then there are even better options in the MacBook Pro range. The MacBook is, for now at least, priced higher than many would think a lower specced machine should be. But the price does not reflect the specs of the MacBook, the price reflects the new technologies that have gone into the first generation of this newly resurrected Mac. Like the MacBook Air, which when it launched cost a lot more than the other Mac laptops, but eventually came down in price to be the entry-level Mac it is today, the MacBook price will come down over time. Eventually it may even replace the MacBook Air. There will, no doubt, be some people who can’t wait to own the MacBook, just as there were some who rushed out to buy that first generation MacBook Air. If you are one of them then we are sure you will enjoy the new machine. But if you’d prefer to wait for the next generation nobody will blame you.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on June 9, 2017 01:23 PM Apple has once again unleashed a whole new collection of products during the opening ceremony of the WWDC 2017 event. Among the products released is the new iMac 2017 that now features the latest Kaby Lake processor from Intel. While these have been notoriously lacking in some aspects, Apple assured its consumer base that the new iMac 2017 has been improved from the ground up. New Intel processor Of course, an upgrade will not be complete without the proper processor from Intel. The previous iteration of the iMac used the Skylake processors. Now, iMac 2017s are equipped with the seventh generation Intel processor based on the Kaby Lake architecture. These new processors boasts a15-percent performance boost across the board. Furthermore, the new chip has native support for 4K video processing. Faster storage As with every iteration of iMacs, Apple tries to make the best of it in terms of storage. Although the basic model still features the spinning platter storage, users can still take advantage of faster solid state drive. This time around, Apple speed up the SSD technology by 50 percent and increased maximum storage size of 3TB. New iMac 2017 (via apple.com) Better and more powerful display For photographers and content creators, the iMac 2017’s new display is a welcomed treat. The new 4K and 5K displays are now 43 percent brighter than the previous model. And with Apple including 10-bit dithering into the mix, be ready to glimpse 1 billion colors from the impressive display. For media creators, such as 3D graphics, the new Radeon Pro 500 graphics cards will surely whet one’s appetite. The new on-board graphics is capable of handling just about anything that is thrown at it including five streams of 4K video on Final Cur Pro X. Virtual reality, finally The new iMac 2017 will be the first iMac to ever support virtual reality or VR. This is quite a good news especially for people who consume VR contents on a regular basis. As VR is getting more and more popular these days, it is just right that Apple includes this feature on the new iMac. In addition to a huge number of possible contents, the iMac 2017, along with Final Cut Pro X, will enable users to create 360-degree videos and cutting-edge VR contents easily. VR support on the new iMac (via apple.com) Upgradability For enthusiasts and people who want to save a few bucks, the iMac 2017, especially the 21.5-inch model, is once again upgradable. According to a recent teardown from iFixit, the small iMac 2017 sports a modular CPU and slots for SODIMM memory modules. Unfortunately, unlike the 27-inch model, upgrading the 21.5-inch version is not for the faint-hearted. Upgrading anything on the smaller iMac will still need a good amount of disassembly. Furthermore, doing it yourself will effectively void the device’s warranty. Nevertheless, for experienced iMac enthusiasts, this is surely a great news. As for the maximum size of memory, Apple still limits the RAM size for the 27-inch model to 32GB. However, as confirmed by OWC, the bigger iMac is indeed capable of supporting a maximum of 64GB of RAM. Thunderbolt 3.0 Thunderbolt 3.0 is finally supported on the iMac 2017. The good news is, Apple kept with the tradition of putting two high-speed ports on the new iMac. Consumers can connect as many as two 4K external display to both Thunderbolt 3.0 ports or one 5K display. In addition to external 4K and 5K display, Apple is also allowing users to attach third-party eGPU hardware to the iMac. Now that it features a faster Thunderbolt port, using an eGPU on a Mac is more exciting than ever. Gone are the days of bottle-necking and inefficient eGPU support for the iMac. Price Finally, there is the question of the price. For anyone using the older 21.5-inch 4K iMac, upgrading to the new version is a bit less painful on your pockets. Apple has given the said iMac a $200 price cut. Now, the smaller iMac 2017 is priced at only $1,299. Furthermore, its bigger brother can now be fetched for only $1,499. Data ports on the new iMac (via apple.com) Final verdict There are a lot of things to consider when it comes to upgrading to a new iMac. For one, the 2015 models are already Retina-ready and used quite impressive hardware inside. However, for those who want to experience VR on the iMac would need to upgrade to the new system. In addition to this, enthusiasts who like using eGPUs to improve their graphics handling performance will surely benefit from the iMac 2017’s Thunderbolt 3.0 ports. For those who feel that the AMD Radeon Pro 500 GPUs are still lacking, sticking in another GPU is as easy as inserting a cable to a port. A fast storage, especially for video editors, is very important. Upgrading to the new iMac will surely shorten your wait time when it comes to transferring videos for editing on your Mac. Again, for professional photographers, the new display will help make sure your images are true to their colors. The display’s increased brightness and wider colour gamut will ensure quality images every single time. As Apple has introduced some nice price reductions to both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMac 2017s, getting one is a bit less painful on your wallets. Selling your older unit and then toping it up for the new one is much easier than it will ever be. As an end note, if you are looking for an absolute beast of a machine, perhaps waiting until December for the iMac Pro is worth considering. For consumers who are price insensitive and is looking for the best iMac experience, the iMac Pro is the machine you are looking for.

Do Microsoft, Qualcomm and their PC partners make the cut? By Mary Jo Foley for All About Microsoft | June 9, 2017 -- 03:52 GMT (20:52 PDT) | Topic: Windows 10 At the end of what looked like a blog post simply celebrating Intel's 40-year anniversary of the launch of the first x86 processor, the Intel 8086, is a potential warning from the chip maker for those looking to emulate x86 on various processors. Credit: Microsoft The timing of the June 8 blog post is interesting, given Microsoft and Qualcomm have stated their intent to provide x86 emulation on coming Windows 10 on ARM-based PCs. Microsoft has yet to start testing publicly its Windows 10 on ARM release, but officials said recently that the first Windows 10 on ARM PCs are expected from OEMs like HP, ASUS and Lenovo sometime soon. Intel didn't name Microsoft, Qualcomm or any specific PC makers in its June 8 post entitled "X86: Approaching 40 and Still Going Strong." But there's definitely a hint of some possible intellectual property (IP) wranglings ahead. From Intel's post: "There have been reports that some companies may try to emulate Intel's proprietary x86 ISA without Intel's authorization. Emulation is not a new technology, and Transmeta was notably the last company to claim to have produced a compatible x86 processor using emulation ('code morphing') techniques. Intel enforced patents relating to SIMD instruction set enhancements against Transmeta's x86 implementation even though it used emulation. In any event, Transmeta was not commercially successful, and it exited the microprocessor business 10 years ago. Only time will tell if new attempts to emulate Intel's x86 ISA will meet a different fate. Intel welcomes lawful competition, and we are confident that Intel's microprocessors, which have been specifically optimized to implement Intel's x86 ISA for almost four decades, will deliver amazing experiences, consistency across applications, and a full breadth of consumer offerings, full manageability and IT integration for the enterprise. However, we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel's intellectual property rights. Strong intellectual property protections make it possible for Intel to continue to invest the enormous resources required to advance Intel's dynamic x86 ISA, and Intel will maintain its vigilance to protect its innovations and investments." I asked Intel if its post was intended to be a warning shot across the Microsoft/Qualcomm bow. A spokesperson's only response, was an emailed statement from Steve Rodgers, Intel Executive Vice President and General Counsel: "Intel respects intellectual property rights and we expect others to do the same. x86 technology is both proprietary and central to our business, and we're concerned any time it appears that others may be copying it inappropriately. We will thoroughly evaluate any products that claim to emulate x86 technology, and vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights if we believe they are infringed." I also asked for comment from Microsoft and Qualcomm officials. As of the time I posted this, there was no word back from either. Several years ago, Microsoft built a version of Windows 8 that ran on ARM processors. But that product, Windows RT, did not provide x86 emulation. Intel x86 emulation makes any Windows on ARM release more potentially marketable, as it will allow users who need particular Win32 apps that have not been ported to ARM to be able to run those apps. So far, Microsoft has not released to testers its promised Windows 10 on ARM variant, though it recently posted a video highlighting Windows 10 on ARM's performance. That video details exactly how the coming x86 emulation on Windows 10 on ARM is designed to work. (The slide embedded in this post above is from that video.) At Computex earlier this month, Microsoft and its hardware partners touted the coming Windows 10 "Always Connected" PCs -- running both Intel and ARM processors -- that will include support for the built-in LTE/eSIM technology Microsoft is adding to Windows 10. Acer, Dell, Huawei, HP, Lenovo and MSI also are building Always Connected Windows 10 PCs that will be Intel-based. see also Microsoft to PC makers: Let's make some Windows 10 ARM-based PCs Microsoft will bring a natively compiled version of Windows 10 to Qualcomm's ARM processors next year, plus an x86 emulation layer, designed to run on a new class of Windows 10 mobile PCs.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Stop that, it’s silly Home Hardware Intel’s 18-core CPU and, er, other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on June 8th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As I was saying, an 18-core CPU is obviously irrelevant for PC gaming. Actually, I was speaking then of AMD’s then-staggering 16-core Threadripper CPU. Two weeks later, Threadripper is already ancient news. It’s been comprehensively gazumped by a new 18-core CPU from Intel and suddenly the PC hardware landscape looks a little potty. I know I’ve been bleating for literally years about Intel’s carpet bagging and how we needed AMD to spice things up. But this is a bit ridiculous. Be careful what you ask for… First and foremost, this is a developing situation. Just two weeks ago, it seemed Intel was all set to unleash its first 12-core desktop CPU. Now the ante has been upped to fully 18 cores in an official announcement for the Computex tech fest in Taiwan. But the announcement was unusual in that it included some fully fleshed out details, including the full model names of the new chips along with core and thread counts, but excluded other critical items such as clockspeeds and power consumption ratings. It’s pure speculation on my behalf, but this feels to me like a very last-minute response to AMD’s CPU roll outs of late. Anywho, the short version of this rather unusual story is that Intel is wheeling out no fewer than nine new processors for its equally new high-end platform, the latter composed of, again, a new socket in the form of LGA2066 and yet more newness courtesy of the X299 chipset. Topping things off is the Core i9 (yup, the i9 family is new, too) 7980XE with 18 cores and 36 threads, but no known clockspeeds for now. It’s yours for $1,999 or very likely a painfully similar figure preceeded by a pound sign and is almost certainly irrelevant to all of us. Ryzen 9 begat Core i9 Intel, of course, has long had the ability to fire out this kind of CPU. It has offered Xeon CPUs with almost countless cores for several generations. But it has taken AMD to finally force its hand. How many of these CPus get sold into the high-end desktop market, I’m not sure. My sense is that chips like the 7980XE are as much or possibly more about ensuring bragging rights for Intel as actually generating sales revenue. The i9 line up also includes a range of nearly but not quite as exotic 16, 14, 12 and 10-core chips, the last of which seems almost accessible by comparison at $999. But it’s really the new core i7 models that are gamer-relevant. The new eight-core Core i7-7820X clocks in at $599 and has very healthy clockspeeds of 3.6GHz base, 4.3GHz Turbo and 4.5GHz Turbo 3.0 (that’s a special Turbo mode that actively determines which cores are capable of running at the highest stable frequency). If you can afford it, that does rather seem to offer a pretty comprehensive combo of single-threaded frequency and multi-core parallelism that should make light work of pretty much any game for a few years to come. But I’d say it’s the new Core i7-7800X that’s most interesting. It’s not exactly cheap at $389, but it is Intel’s most affordable six-core CPU yet and offers a decent Turbo speed of 4GHz. Certainly, it would be a tough choice between the 7800X and the lower end of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen 7 family. AMD still offers better value, to be sure. But Intel is at least more competitive at that rough price point. I count 20 cores. Like I said, a developing situation… As for the oddball Core i7-7740X and Core i5-7640X will sit in the bottom two rungs of Intel’s new LGA2066 range, I’m not sure what to make of them. My understanding is that they are the existing Kaby Lake quad-core CPU dies, as seen in the Core i7-7700K and Core i5-7600K for the mainstream LGA1151 socket, but rewired for LGA2066 and with the integrated graphics disabled. At $339 and $242 respectively, they’re price parity with their LGA1151 cousins – at least at pre-announcement pricing for the existing pair – though they offer very slightly higher baseclocks but not Turbo speeds. The only way I can see to make sense of them is as gateway CPUs for the LGA2066 platform. In other words, they help keep the overall up-front cost of upgrading to an LGA2066 PC under control and allow a future upgrade path to those big core count CPUs. As things stand right now, then, these latest developments from Intel and AMD arguably don’t have much direct impact on the choices most gamers must make when configuring a new PC. All the 10-core and beyond models are arguably too much money for far too little gaming relevance. Ermegerd, so many pins… Even Intel’s new six and eight-core CPUs are probably too pricey for the majority. Meanwhile, the new Intel quad-core models come with some expensive baggage in terms of requiring an X299 motherboard. In other words, the real-world choice remains that of Intel’s existing Core i5 and Core i7 chips for the LGA1151 socket, which offer the safest bet for ensuring good gaming performance in this very here-and-now, or AMD’s Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7s, which are clearly better value and might well prove more future proof thanks to offering more affordable six and eight-core options. Like I said, the situation is developing fast. I fully expect to see Intel add a six-core chip for its mainstream LGA1151 socket later this year and I’m hoping that will be part of a further re-jigging of prices that will see six cores slot in where Intel’s best quad-core chips currently reside in the price lists and those in turn become yet more accessible. Things are moving in the right direction, then. But I’d be holding out just a little longer to see how things develop later this year before pulling the trigger on that new gaming rig.

One who is not of the herd cannot help but be fascinated by the blind obedience and trust. In short, the chips are not released yet. Intel has most always NOT been a disappointment in their releases. There is no evidence that this will be any different. What we have are fan boys with empty pockets crying yet again.

What most people don’t know is that single socket Xeons (previously branded as E5-1xxx) are generally overclockable. For example, when the i7-4960X was supposedly the baddest kid on the block, you could buy a 8C E5-1680v2 and overclock it. It even had better thermal properties, as it used a huge 12-core die with 4 cores disabled (whereas the 4960X used a small 6 core die). So, while it will probably be a weird OEM SKU us mere mortals can’t buy (as was the case with Haswell/Broadwell), an unlocked 24 core+ Skylake-e monster could exist.

IMO, they are so good that building with Intel right now is a mistake. Intel could have reacted to this in many ways, but I think they have done it in the worst possible way.

Log in to Reply 08/06/2017 at 23:17 sandineyes says: If I were in a position to make a new build, the $599 i7-7820X would seem to be the best of the line-up for the price. The cheaper skylake-sp lacks the fancy new Turbo Boost, and the clock rates are not great if you are in it for gaming. The $999 part seems to just have more cores and pci-e lanes. I’m not sure what the purpose of the Kaby Lake-X parts are, except perhaps to offer an entry point into the platform. You don’t get the four channel memory, nor increased pci-e lanes, nor the Turbo Boost 3.0, nor the AVX-512 instructions. Seems like it would be better to wait for Coffee Lake.

Whereas you can get the 6 core Ryzen part and an overclockable motherboard for all of 320 bucks, 300 if you’re willing to go small form factor. This vs figure almost double for the 6 core Skylake-X and mobo. Log in to Reply 09/06/2017 at 00:53 Buuurr says: The problem you are siting has never been a problem for Intel. They hold 80% of the market share for processors. They have held this share for a good 15-20 years now. AMD has always been the cheap alternative, as it is the case now. The status quo has in no shape or form changed. How could this be defined as a problem for Intel? From a business standpoint it is off to the market as usual.

This has awakened that sleep and made it more greater than before and the future of the PC is still alive as long their is competitiveness and technological advances.

It clearly has nothing to do with luggage or the American South. I cannot have anything to do with newcomers, because Intel has been around forever, and were founded explicitly to do what they have always done, i.e. they did not move or switch targets for a underhanded gain. And I finally, I even looked up the British meaning, which I knew was different from the American ones, and I cannot see how Intel is trying to demutualize any company. So how are Intel carper bagging? Arguably, someone could think that the processor scene needs some carpetbaggers, but Intel cannot play that role.

By Mauro Huculak Thursday, Jun 8, 2017 at 11:00 am EDT 14 Comments The never ending question: which one should I buy? In this guide, we'll help you decide whether you should get a Surface Pro (2017) or a Surface Book. After a long wait, Microsoft has now introduced the Surface Pro 4 successor, but it's not called the "Surface Pro 5," instead it's simply called the "Surface Pro" without a number. Although this feels more like a refresh, the new Surface Pro (2017) is lighter and thinner than its predecessor with rounded edges. The new version also sports the latest Intel processors. Some models have a fanless design, the kickstand goes down further, and you can expect longer battery life. Indeed, it's the best Surface Pro yet, but it's not the only one. If you've been looking to get a Surface, you probably came across the Surface Book, which is also a 2-in-1 that packs some serious horsepower in a sleek and compact design that can make your buying decision a bit more difficult. While Microsoft is targeting these devices to different audiences, the decision to which one to buy can come down to design, graphics, battery life, and pricing. Updated June 8, 2017, to reflect the comparison between Surface Book and Surface Pro (2017). Design When you first look at the Surface Book, it's not hard to realize that the laptop has a design inspired by the Surface Pro line. However, the Surface Pro (2017) is 7.93mm thick while the Surface Book is 22.8mm on its thickest point (when you detach the display, you'll end up with a 7.7mm thin clipboard). Additionally, the Surface Book can be as heavy as 3.48 pounds when you get it with the discrete graphics processor, and the Surface Pro can be as light as 1.69 pounds (without the Type Cover). In other words. If you pick a Surface Pro, you'll probably never notice that you're carrying a computer in your backpack, while the Surface Book will make a statement. The Surface Pro sports a 12.5-inch display, while the Surface Book includes a 13.5-inch screen. And even though, you're getting a larger viewing real estate with the laptop, interesting enough, both provide the same 267 pixels-per-inch (PPI) density, 3:2 aspect ratio, 100 percent sRGB color, and support for the Surface Pen. You also get a multi-position kickstand that now goes down up to 165 degrees with the Surface Pro, which improves functionality while using the Surface Dial. The Surface Book doesn't include a kickstand, but you get a keyboard base with a dynamic fulcrum hinge design that helps with stability and "lapability." However, because you can use it as a tablet as well, the device includes a new hinge design, which is not as steady as those found on traditional clamshell laptops. Hardware specifications is another aspect to consider, while the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book included similar specifications, the Surface Pro (2017) has more updated components. The Surface Pro and Surface Book sport the same 8-megapixel rear-facing and 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and they both offer support for Windows Hello. These two devices come with a wide variety of configurations, but the biggest difference will be in the processor. The Surface Book uses Intel's sixth generation (Skylake) processors, while the Surface Pro (2017) includes Intel's seventh generation (Kaby Lake) processors, which run faster, snappier, cooler, and they get better battery life. Also, the Surface Book only offers the choice of Intel's Core i5 and i7 with 8GB or 16GB of memory, while the latest Surface Pro gives you the choice of Core m3, i5 and i7 with the option of 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB of memory. In addition, thanks to the improvements on the Kaby Lake processors, you can now get the Surface Pro with Core m3 and i5 with a fanless design. Aside from the processor, both devices offer configurations up to 16GB of memory and up to 1TB of SSD storage. The Surface Book comes with a the "best in class" full-size keyboard. The touchpad also works great, it's very accurate, and it's made of the same glass material found in the Type Cover. If you go with the Surface Pro, you'll need to purchase a Type Cover separately, which this time around comes in three new colors (platinum, cobalt blue, and burgundy). Of course, that's if you pick the one covered with Alcantara fabric. You're not getting USB Type-C on either device, but the Surface Book features two USB 3.0, SD card reader, and Surface Connect port. In the Surface Pro, you only get one USB 3.0, microSD card reader, and Surface Connect port. Battery life When it comes to battery life, the Surface Pro now offers up to 13.5 hours of video playback, unlike the 12 hours with the Surface Book. The company was able to increase the battery life as a result of new improvements on Windows 10, a new technique to integrate the storage into the motherboard, and thanks to the new Intel processors. But... If you throw in the Performance Base version of the Surface Book, you're looking at up to 16 hours of video playback. If you go with the Surface Book, you can detach the screen and use it as a tablet, but you'll only get 3 hours of battery. You'll need to keep the display attached to the base to get the claimed 12 hours (or 16 hours with the Performance Base). If you'll be using the device more like a tablet, then your best option would be a Surface Pro. Graphics On graphics, there is not doubt that the Surface Book delivers the most graphics performance. You don't get one, but two graphics chips, including an Intel HD Graphics 520 inside the display and an optional NVIDIA processor on the base. In the Surface Book with the Performance Base, you get even more performance with a NVIDIA GTX965M chip. If you're in the market for a device that can handle graphics intensive applications, then you'll appreciate the benefits with the Surface Book. Microsoft Surface Book Performance Base review: The price of power and performance It's not all about work. With outstanding graphics, you can also use the laptop for gaming. Of course, you don't have to expect flawless 60FPS on graphical intensive video games, but overall games will look good on the Surface Book, and even better on the Surface Book with Performance Base. The Surface Pro wasn't designed for graphics demanding applications, but it includes the Intel's latest graphics processors, and you'll get very decent experience playing games. The Core m3 model of the Surface Pro includes Intel's HD Graphics 615, which offers similar performance than the HD Graphics 520 in the Surface Book. The Core i5 model sports Intel's HD Graphics 620, and the Core i7 features an Intel Iris Plus Graphics 620, which are more powerful than the chip integrated into the Surface Book. Pricing The money you'll spend is another factor that will play a role in the decision. Both devices offer different configurations and different price points, but the Surface Pro will always be the choice if you're looking for value. A Surface Pro (2017) base model comes with a Core m3 processor and 4GB of memory, and it starts at $799 without the Type Cover or Surface Pen, compared to the $1,499 starting price for the Surface Book with a Core i5 and 8GB of memory. You can always max out the Surface Pro with an Core i7 processor, 16GB of memory, and 1TB SSD for $2,699, while a similar Surface Book configuration, but using an Intel sixth generation processor, starts at $3,199. The Surface Book with Performance Base starts at $2,399 with a 256GB SSD storage and 8GB of RAM, and it maxes out at $3,299 for the 1TB SSD and 16GB of RAM.

It's now the time to pick one, but remember that these devices belong to different categories, and you can only compare them up to a certain point. While both devices share many similarities, they're built for different audiences, and we're also comparing devices that have been released at different times. The Surface you want to get will depend on the type of work you'll be doing. If you'll be working with graphics intensive applications, or playing games, you'll benefit from the NVIDIA graphics processor. Also, if you're looking for a device that includes a full-size keyboard and stylus with better "lapability," then the Surface Book may be the right choice. If you need even longer battery life and better graphics, then the Surface Book with Performance Base could be the one. If you won't be working with hardware intensive applications, and you'll be doing everyday tasks like document editing, video streaming, web browsing, and you like a smaller device with long battery life, then the new Surface Pro is probably your best bet. In addition, the Surface Pro has a LTE option that will be available later this year, if you're looking for a device with on-the-go connectivity. The Surface Pro (2017) will be available starting June 15, and pricing starts at $799 in the United States, and with the Surface Pen and Type Cover (Alcantara fabric), you're looking at $1,058.98. The Surface Book is available now, and pricing starts at $1,499 for the based model and $2,399 for the Performance Base.

There's some BIG differences betwen the older version & the newest one, makes sense to only talk about the newest, just as you are for the Surface Pro (in my country tis the only version still sold -not sure about the US). 1 13 hours ago Reply kobe_mvp Does it actually have 13.5 hours battery life?

The "proof will be in the pudding" though... 0 11 hours ago Reply Andrew G1 7 hours if you're lucky, and MS claimed 9 hours! Microsoft claims in the footmotes of their Surface Pro site that they got the 13.5 hour number from testing on an i5. That might suggest the m3 doesn't do as well. So if in real life usage it's 25-30 percent worse than what's claimed, that's still about 10 hours for the i5, worse for the i7, and maybe also worse for the m3. -2 12 hours ago Reply nohone It all depends on what you are doing with it. If you are writing code and running compilers, debugging, etc. it will get less time. If you are just watching a video, that is the time you will get. All device makers use watching video as their way of determining battery life. The thing is, even Microsoft hating web sites have reported that Microsoft devices actually get more than advertised on that metric, while the fruity competition get less than they advertise. -1 12 hours ago Reply Heatnup Surface book is far superior, I absolutely love it.

The latest release in the Intel NUC family is the model NUC6i7KYK, also known as Skull Canyon, and it packs a ton of features into a tiny form factor. We recently acquired two of these units to serve as a test platform for a wide range of software technologies. The small form factor device is only 28 mm tall and 166 by 211 mm on the edges. That works out to 1.1 inches tall and 6.54 by 8.31 inches around the outside. The functionality you get in that space makes this device a portable powerhouse. It also comes with VESA mounting brackets should you choose to mount the box to your favorite monitor. Skull Canyon Hardware While the Skull Canyon doesn’t have the most powerful CPU in the Intel arsenal, it does come with a Core i7-6770HQ, sporting a total of four cores running at 2.6 GHz (see Figure 1). The PassMark CPU benchmark gives it a 9679 rating, putting it at about a third of the current price / performance leader, the Core i7-2630QM. Memory capacity is a hefty 32 GB, which we populated with two Crucial 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMMS. Inside the little box you’ll find two M.2 SSD slots, where we installed a Crucial 1 TB and a Sandisk 256 GB SSD. The smaller device is used as the OS boot disk while the larger drive serves as bulk storage. The front of the case offers an SD card slot, two USB 3.0 ports (including one charging port), a headphone jack, and a consumer infrared sensor. On the rear you’ll find the power jack, a TOSLINK audio port, a RJ-45 gigabit Ethernet port, two more USB 3.0 ports, one version 1.2 Mini DisplayPort, one full-size HDMI 2.0 port, and a single Thunderbolt 3 port (see Figure 2). This NUC supports up to three 4K monitors with the embedded Intel Iris Pro Graphics. To top it all off you get dual-band Wireless-AC and dual mode Bluetooth 4.2 support as well. Software Windows 10 is currently the most supported operating system in the way of drivers. For our purposes we wanted to take full advantage of the Thunderbolt 3 ports for high-speed networking, and the latest Windows 10 drivers work just fine. Windows 10 offers support for Hyper-V and Docker containers, making it the perfect development and test platform for these technologies. No longer do you need a dedicated server box to test out your container or virtualization projects. We used two of these devices to test a number of storage virtualization products designed to work on top of Hyper-V. While all of the products tested were designed for the Windows Server version of Hyper-V, we were able to install and run them on our NUCs running Windows 10 Creators Edition. All three of the vendors would be quick to point out that this is not a supported configuration, but it does work. Intel provides a number of drivers for a variety of operating systems on their support website. Currently supported desktop OSes include the 64-bit versions of Windows 10, 8.1, and 7. On the server side they offer some driver support for Windows Server 2012 R2 and a limited number for Windows Server 2012. Noticeably missing from the Server versions is a driver for the Thunderbolt 3 port. This is a disappointing deficiency as it limits the amount of testing that can be accomplished for things like failover clustering using the high-speed networking capability. Hopefully this will be rectified in the future. We were able to configure the NUC to dual boot Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 using the boot-to-VHD technique for booting into Windows Server. This works quite well with the exception of the missing Thunderbolt 3 driver. The advantage to this approach is the ability to use the large 1 TB SSD from both Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. This comes in handy when using large Hyper-V virtual machine disk images. Wrap Up The advantages of having two server-class machines that fit in your carry-on luggage are numerous. For presentation and training scenarios this setup works quite well. A single machine can handle just about any Hyper-V or containers scenario you can throw at 32 GB of memory. So far we haven’t been able to oversubscribe the memory with limited testing. We’ve even used some of Microsoft’s memory-hungry data science virtual machines with no problems. Limitations on the Windows Server side primarily surround the lack of driver support for the Thunderbolt 3 port. It is possible to add additional Ethernet ports using the USB 3.0 ports and the proper adapter. With this approach you could accommodate up to five 1 GB Ethernet ports if you used Bluetooth for keyboard and mouse. The base price for the NUC Skull Canyon is under $600 from a variety of vendors. Our units as tested came to just over $1100 for 32 GB of memory and the two SSD devices. Not bad for a totally portable workhorse of a system.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As I was saying, an 18-core CPU is obviously irrelevant for PC gaming. Actually, I was speaking then of AMD’s then-staggering 16-core Threadripper CPU. Two weeks later, Threadripper is already ancient news. It’s been comprehensively gazumped by a new 18-core CPU from Intel and suddenly the PC hardware landscape looks a little potty. I know I’ve been bleating for literally years about Intel’s carpet bagging and how we needed AMD to spice things up. But this is a bit ridiculous. Be careful what you ask for… First and foremost, this is a developing situation. Just two weeks ago, it seemed Intel was all set to unleash its first 12-core desktop CPU. Now the ante has been upped to fully 18 cores in an official announcement for the Computex tech fest in Taiwan. But the announcement was unusual in that it included some fully fleshed out details, including the full model names of the new chips along with core and thread counts, but excluded other critical items such as clockspeeds and power consumption ratings. It’s pure speculation on my behalf, but this feels to me like a very last-minute response to AMD’s CPU roll outs of late. Anywho, the short version of this rather unusual story is that Intel is wheeling out no fewer than nine new processors for its equally new high-end platform, the latter composed of, again, a new socket in the form of LGA2066 and yet more newness courtesy of the X299 chipset. Topping things off is the Core i9 (yup, the i9 family is new, too) 7980XE with 18 cores and 36 threads, but no known clockspeeds for now. It’s yours for $1,999 or very likely a painfully similar figure preceeded by a pound sign and is almost certainly irrelevant to all of us. Ryzen 9 begat Core i9 Intel, of course, has long had the ability to fire out this kind of CPU. It has offered Xeon CPUs with almost countless cores for several generations. But it has taken AMD to finally force its hand. How many of these CPus get sold into the high-end desktop market, I’m not sure. My sense is that chips like the 7980XE are as much or possibly more about ensuring bragging rights for Intel as actually generating sales revenue. The i9 line up also includes a range of nearly but not quite as exotic 16, 14, 12 and 10-core chips, the last of which seems almost accessible by comparison at $999. But it’s really the new core i7 models that are gamer-relevant. The new eight-core Core i7-7820X clocks in at $599 and has very healthy clockspeeds of 3.6GHz base, 4.3GHz Turbo and 4.5GHz Turbo 3.0 (that’s a special Turbo mode that actively determines which cores are capable of running at the highest stable frequency). If you can afford it, that does rather seem to offer a pretty comprehensive combo of single-threaded frequency and multi-core parallelism that should make light work of pretty much any game for a few years to come. But I’d say it’s the new Core i7-7800X that’s most interesting. It’s not exactly cheap at $389, but it is Intel’s most affordable six-core CPU yet and offers a decent Turbo speed of 4GHz. Certainly, it would be a tough choice between the 7800X and the lower end of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen 7 family. AMD still offers better value, to be sure. But Intel is at least more competitive at that rough price point. I count 20 cores. Like I said, a developing situation… As for the oddball Core i7-7740X and Core i5-7640X will sit in the bottom two rungs of Intel’s new LGA2066 range, I’m not sure what to make of them. My understanding is that they are the existing Kaby Lake quad-core CPU dies, as seen in the Core i7-7700K and Core i5-7600K for the mainstream LGA1151 socket, but rewired for LGA2066 and with the integrated graphics disabled. At $339 and $242 respectively, they’re price parity with their LGA1151 cousins – at least at pre-announcement pricing for the existing pair – though they offer very slightly higher baseclocks but not Turbo speeds. The only way I can see to make sense of them is as gateway CPUs for the LGA2066 platform. In other words, they help keep the overall up-front cost of upgrading to an LGA2066 PC under control and allow a future upgrade path to those big core count CPUs. As things stand right now, then, these latest developments from Intel and AMD arguably don’t have much direct impact on the choices most gamers must make when configuring a new PC. All the 10-core and beyond models are arguably too much money for far too little gaming relevance. Ermegerd, so many pins… Even Intel’s new six and eight-core CPUs are probably too pricey for the majority. Meanwhile, the new Intel quad-core models come with some expensive baggage in terms of requiring an X299 motherboard. In other words, the real-world choice remains that of Intel’s existing Core i5 and Core i7 chips for the LGA1151 socket, which offer the safest bet for ensuring good gaming performance in this very here-and-now, or AMD’s Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7s, which are clearly better value and might well prove more future proof thanks to offering more affordable six and eight-core options. Like I said, the situation is developing fast. I fully expect to see Intel add a six-core chip for its mainstream LGA1151 socket later this year and I’m hoping that will be part of a further re-jigging of prices that will see six cores slot in where Intel’s best quad-core chips currently reside in the price lists and those in turn become yet more accessible. Things are moving in the right direction, then. But I’d be holding out just a little longer to see how things develop later this year before pulling the trigger on that new gaming rig.

So how are Intel carper bagging? Arguably, someone could think that the processor scene needs some carpetbaggers, but Intel cannot play that role.

Macs & Mac OS X | 06 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (15) Apple Beefs Up iMac and MacBook Lines, Teases the iMac Pro by Adam C. Engst At WWDC 2017 today, Apple devoted a non-trivial segment of the keynote to new Mac hardware, showing off improved iMacs and performance-enhanced MacBook Pros and mentioning a speed bump to the MacBook Air in passing. After running through all the changes to today’s models, Apple gave a sneak preview of the iMac Pro, a workstation-class version of the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display that’s scheduled to ship at the end of the year. No mention was made of the Mac mini or Mac Pro, though Apple has already said that the Mac Pro is in the middle of a major redesign that won’t be done until 2018 at the earliest (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017). iMac -- The workhorse of Apple’s desktop line has long been the iMac, which Apple continues to offer in three basic models: a 21.5-inch non-Retina version, a 21.5-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, and the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display. On the CPU front, each model receives a speed bump thanks to Apple using Intel’s 7th generation “Kaby Lake” processors and increasing clock speeds. You can see the specifics on Apple’s Tech Specs page, but the summary is that Apple is focusing more effort on the 21.5 Retina iMac, offering just a single configuration of the non-Retina model. Benchmarks will show how much faster the combination of new CPUs and higher clock speeds will be, but I suspect purchases will mostly be based on price. Although the iMac Retina displays are already gorgeous, Apple claims to have improved them even more in both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch sizes, increasing brightness 43 percent to 500 nits and supporting display of up to 1 billion colors. The non-Retina iMac model drives its screen with the integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, but all the Retina models now take advantage of Radeon Pro GPUs, the 555 and 560 for the 21.5-inch models and the 570, 575, and 580 models for the 27-inch models. The notable win here is for the 21.5-inch Retina models, which were previously limited to integrated Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200. Apple has made the Fusion Drive standard in more configurations, and the company claims that the SSDs available in 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB capacities are up to 50 percent faster. You can also configure the top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with a 2 TB SSD for a whopping $1400. When it comes to RAM, all base models still ship with 8 GB. The non-Retina iMac and low-end 21.5 Retina model remain limited to 16 GB, but the high-end 21.5-inch Retina model can now take 16 GB or 32 GB, a welcome improvement. Similarly, the low-end 27-inch model still maxes out at 32 GB, but the two higher-end models can take 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. RAM in the 21.5-inch iMac models cannot be upgraded by the user, but you can install memory in the 27-inch model yourself. Unsurprisingly, Apple replaced the previous models’ Thunderbolt 2 ports with a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports that support DisplayPort for external screens, Thunderbolt at up to 40 Gbps, USB 3.1 Gen 2 at up to 10 Gbps, and various other protocols via adapters (see “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between,” 3 November 2016). All these changes are welcome for anyone in the market for a new iMac. I doubt they’re significant enough to warrant trading in an existing Retina iMac, unless Thunderbolt 3 is a necessity. The most interesting changes are actually in the 21.5-inch models, which move past the RAM and graphics limitations of the previous configuration while introducing a cheaper config. The 21.5-inch non-Retina iMac remains priced at $1099, with the two Retina configurations starting at $1299 and $1499. The 27-inch model comes in three configurations: $1799, $1999, and $2299. They’re all available now. Perhaps I’m just boggled by the number of changes Apple announced in the WWDC keynote, but I couldn’t see how to give more context for the changes in relation to previous configurations because the matrix of what models get which build-to-order options was just too complicated. If you want to price out different possibilities, I recommend opening several browser windows so you can compare the configurations side by side. MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air -- As with the iMac, Apple updated the processors in the MacBook and MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake processors running at higher clock speeds. That should improve performance, although likely not by that much. The MacBook Pro models also get improved graphics processing, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro models using Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 and 650, and the 15-inch models switching to Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs on top of Intel HD Graphics 630 and 640. You can now buy a MacBook with 16 GB of RAM, up from the previous limit of 8 GB, and Apple claims that the MacBook’s onboard SSD is up to 50 percent faster. That might make the MacBook a more attractive option, given that lackluster performance was one of its main disadvantages. Despite rumors to the contrary, the MacBook Air lives, but it sees the least change, replacing its stock 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with a 1.8 GHz model. It remains upgradeable to an Intel Core i7 running at 2.2 GHz. Although these changes are all positive, they do nothing to simplify the difficulty of choosing between the three models. Each falls into the three-dimensional graph of price, performance, and size in a different spot. You’ll have to decide what’s most important to you — cost, speed, or portability — and figure out which of Apple’s notebooks best fits your needs. As with the new iMac models, these updated notebooks are all available now. iMac Pro -- During the private media meeting in which Apple executives confessed to the company’s sins with regard to the Mac Pro, mention was made of pro-related announcements about the iMac coming this year. Apple has now revealed more of what that means, pulling back the curtains on the iMac Pro. Due in December 2017, the iMac Pro retains the same form factor of the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display, but swaps the brushed aluminum look for a space gray finish that extends to the Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, Magic Mouse 2, and an optional Magic Trackpad 2. The goal of the iMac Pro is to provide workstation-class performance within the iMac design. The hardest part of that is dealing with heat, because the iMac Pro will feature Intel Xeon processors in 8-core, 10-core, or 18-core configurations. Also playing into the necessary thermal architecture redesign is Apple’s use of a new Radeon Pro Vega GPU, which reportedly features a next-generation compute core and up to 16 GB of on-package high-bandwidth memory (HBM2). Apple says that the iMac Pro with Vega GPU delivers up to 11 teraflops of single-precision compute power for real-time 3D rendering and high frame rate VR. For half-precision computation that’s reportedly ideal for machine learning, the iMac Pro can deliver up to 22 teraflops of performance. (No, we don’t really have a sense of what that means, either, but Apple PR did a good job of making it sound impressive.) The iMac Pro will come with 32 GB of RAM by default, but for a machine in this class, the fact that it’s configurable to 64 GB or 128 GB is more important. A 1 TB SSD is also standard, with 2 TB and 4 TB SSDs as options. Unsurprisingly, the iMac Pro sports four Thunderbolt 3 ports, which enables it to drive up to two 5K displays and two high-performance RAID arrays at the same time. Other connectivity options mimic what’s on the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display now, with the exception of Ethernet. Instead of gigabit Ethernet, the iMac Pro will include 10 Gb Ethernet, which could be a big deal when transferring huge amounts of data between machines. How much will all this cost? A lot, with the base iMac Pro configuration starting at $4999. Apple claimed that a comparable workstation would cost about $7000, without a 5K display. Even still, given the high price of large SSDs and RAM, we anticipate that a loaded iMac Pro will easily meet or exceed that $7000 mark. But that won’t stop the audience for the iMac Pro. If you need the maximum performance from a Mac, the iMac Pro will provide it. At least until a new Mac Pro makes its debut, and many of those who live and die by the teraflop won’t want to wait.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Cohen   2017-06-06 10:48 And if anyone out there thinks the iMac Pro means that a Mac Pro ISN'T also coming, Apple's press release on the iMac Pro puts that misconception to rest: "In addition to the new iMac Pro, Apple is working on a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest-end, high-throughput system in a modular design, as well as a new high-end pro display." Reply Mackay Bell  2017-06-07 20:38 It seems that part of the reason they revealed that they were working on an expandable Mac Pro (and apologizing for the trash can version) is they wanted people to get excited about the iMac Pro, and not suck up all the air complaining about the lack of an expandable system. By getting that story out before the release, they could get a little more excitement going for the coming of the iMac Pro. Reply Alan Forkosh   2017-06-06 11:09 It's noteworthy that Apple didn't mention anything about the Touch Bar. As it stands now, Touch Bar is an orphan, present on only on the MacBook Pro line. It strikes me as something that can't really be considered a standard until there is a desktop version of it also--either a new keyboard or a standalone item to be paired with a keyboard. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 12:00 In fact, it turns out that Apple did release a new wireless Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. But not with a Touch Bar. Boo! http://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-has-a-new-wireless-magic-keyboard-with-a-full-numeric-keypad/amp/ Reply Paul Ellis  2017-06-06 13:53 The Touch Bar is a gimmick. It breaks all the rules of ergonomics and focus. It might possibly make some sense when positioned close the the screen, and therefore point of focus, on a laptop, but makes little sense for a desktop. If I were a developer, which thankfully I'm not, I wouldn't be wasting any time developing for it, and certainly not if I'd previously been stung by OpenDoc, QuickTime VR, etc. etc. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:57 I like what Apple is doing with the iMac and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assuming they'll make things right with the new Mac Pro once it finally arrives. The MBP seems fine. I still don't see what TouchBar is supposed to accomplish - I also think it's mainly a gimmick with poor ergonomics. Apple didn't spend any time on it at this WWDC. Does anybody think it might disappear during the next overhaul? I don't really get why Apple is keeping the MBA around instead of just trying to make an inexpensive entry-level MB instead. Since there is no inexpensive entry-level MB, I assume that means the MB is targeting the middle/high-end of the compact/light market. So with that in mind, why in the world did they not replace that USB-C with TB3? If this were a budget Mac at $999 targeted at schools and students, fine. But since this is a midrange Mac we're talking about, why leave it stuck with USB-C? Nothing TB3 offers can't be done with USB-C, but TB3 is just more versatile and it is no doubt the new standard across Macs - well almost, sigh. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:59 (cont.) My only real gripe on the Mac side is the Mac mini. How can Apple just let it sit there to die? Either kill it off already (so people know they'll have to go Hackintosh) or update it. But just leaving it sit there without a clear plan makes we wonder what message Apple is trying to send. It reminds me of the Mac Pro situation before pressure from pros and tech journalists forced Apple to take a stand. I see a lot of potential for the Mac mini, from cheap servers to simple office computers, offering a low-price entry point to the Mac universe, schools, home media servers, etc. I'm afraid all of that is "too techy" and not sexy enough for the new Apple. I really hope I'm wrong. I'm holding onto my trusty Core i5 Mac mini, but with its 4 GB of RAM (could be upgraded) and 500 GB HDD (could also be upgraded, but is that worth it?) its days are numbered even as my home media server. Reply Bertrand Morin  2017-06-06 19:27 Is the memory (RAM) upgradable in the iMac 27in. by the user, as it wad older iMac… Reply James  2017-06-08 07:58 Did you read the product page for the 27" iMac? If not, go back and read it again. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-07 01:08 Is there any indication yet if the new iMac models (both 21.5" and 27") have user upgradable RAM? There is some wording on the Apple page that you can upgrade the 21.5" RAM after purchase through Apple or an authorized dealer, but it not 100% clear. And the page for the 27" is completely silent. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 09:59 The 21.5-inch models are NOT user-upgradeable, but the 27-inch model is. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191 Reply Bob  2017-06-08 18:02 Scott, MacRumors reports "iFixit has published a teardown of the new 4K 21.5-inch iMac, which reveals that – surprisingly – Apple's smallest all-in-one desktop machine has both removable RAM and a Kaby Lake processor that's not soldered onto the logic board." Note though, updating is an involved process. Certainly not user-replaceable by the average owner. But at least users aren't irrevocably locked in to what they originally purchased. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:28 I guess that I should have been a little more accurate with my question. I was more trying to determine if the RAM in both the 21.5" and 27" is upgradable, whether user upgradable as officially supported by Apple or even just upgradable but only officially by Apple or an Apple ASP (which means a user can do it if they are afraid to open up their Mac and maybe end up having Apple not provide support under the warranty if there is a problem). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:32 Good to know. I am not afraid to open up a Mac even for supposedly no user upgradable items at least officially in Apple's eyes. On my original 2006 MBP, I replaced a fan that was squealing due to the bearings and also upgrade the WiFi card, neither of which was consider user upgradable by Apple (certainly not the fan at least...not sure about the WiFi card). It likely would not matter as if I were in the market for an iMac (I am currently not), I would be going for a 27" model anyway. I am kind of used to the 27" Thunderbolt display that I have, so going back to what would seem like a freakishly small (to me) 21.5" screen would not really be an option. Reply Simon  2017-06-08 18:20 I wonder if the non-retina 21.5" iMac will have the same SO-DIMM slots? I guess the replaceable CPU is a given because apparently Intel does not offer desktop Kaby Lake with BGA (i.e. soldered).

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Stop that, it’s silly Home Hardware Intel’s 18-core CPU and, er, other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on June 8th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As I was saying, an 18-core CPU is obviously irrelevant for PC gaming. Actually, I was speaking then of AMD’s then-staggering 16-core Threadripper CPU. Two weeks later, Threadripper is already ancient news. It’s been comprehensively gazumped by a new 18-core CPU from Intel and suddenly the PC hardware landscape looks a little potty. I know I’ve been bleating for literally years about Intel’s carpet bagging and how we needed AMD to spice things up. But this is a bit ridiculous. Be careful what you ask for… First and foremost, this is a developing situation. Just two weeks ago, it seemed Intel was all set to unleash its first 12-core desktop CPU. Now the ante has been upped to fully 18 cores in an official announcement for the Computex tech fest in Taiwan. But the announcement was unusual in that it included some fully fleshed out details, including the full model names of the new chips along with core and thread counts, but excluded other critical items such as clockspeeds and power consumption ratings. It’s pure speculation on my behalf, but this feels to me like a very last-minute response to AMD’s CPU roll outs of late. Anywho, the short version of this rather unusual story is that Intel is wheeling out no fewer than nine new processors for its equally new high-end platform, the latter composed of, again, a new socket in the form of LGA2066 and yet more newness courtesy of the X299 chipset. Topping things off is the Core i9 (yup, the i9 family is new, too) 7980XE with 18 cores and 36 threads, but no known clockspeeds for now. It’s yours for $1,999 or very likely a painfully similar figure preceeded by a pound sign and is almost certainly irrelevant to all of us. Ryzen 9 begat Core i9 Intel, of course, has long had the ability to fire out this kind of CPU. It has offered Xeon CPUs with almost countless cores for several generations. But it has taken AMD to finally force its hand. How many of these CPus get sold into the high-end desktop market, I’m not sure. My sense is that chips like the 7980XE are as much or possibly more about ensuring bragging rights for Intel as actually generating sales revenue. The i9 line up also includes a range of nearly but not quite as exotic 16, 14, 12 and 10-core chips, the last of which seems almost accessible by comparison at $999. But it’s really the new core i7 models that are gamer-relevant. The new eight-core Core i7-7820X clocks in at $599 and has very healthy clockspeeds of 3.6GHz base, 4.3GHz Turbo and 4.5GHz Turbo 3.0 (that’s a special Turbo mode that actively determines which cores are capable of running at the highest stable frequency). If you can afford it, that does rather seem to offer a pretty comprehensive combo of single-threaded frequency and multi-core parallelism that should make light work of pretty much any game for a few years to come. But I’d say it’s the new Core i7-7800X that’s most interesting. It’s not exactly cheap at $389, but it is Intel’s most affordable six-core CPU yet and offers a decent Turbo speed of 4GHz. Certainly, it would be a tough choice between the 7800X and the lower end of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen 7 family. AMD still offers better value, to be sure. But Intel is at least more competitive at that rough price point. I count 20 cores. Like I said, a developing situation… As for the oddball Core i7-7740X and Core i5-7640X will sit in the bottom two rungs of Intel’s new LGA2066 range, I’m not sure what to make of them. My understanding is that they are the existing Kaby Lake quad-core CPU dies, as seen in the Core i7-7700K and Core i5-7600K for the mainstream LGA1151 socket, but rewired for LGA2066 and with the integrated graphics disabled. At $339 and $242 respectively, they’re price parity with their LGA1151 cousins – at least at pre-announcement pricing for the existing pair – though they offer very slightly higher baseclocks but not Turbo speeds. The only way I can see to make sense of them is as gateway CPUs for the LGA2066 platform. In other words, they help keep the overall up-front cost of upgrading to an LGA2066 PC under control and allow a future upgrade path to those big core count CPUs. As things stand right now, then, these latest developments from Intel and AMD arguably don’t have much direct impact on the choices most gamers must make when configuring a new PC. All the 10-core and beyond models are arguably too much money for far too little gaming relevance. Ermegerd, so many pins… Even Intel’s new six and eight-core CPUs are probably too pricey for the majority. Meanwhile, the new Intel quad-core models come with some expensive baggage in terms of requiring an X299 motherboard. In other words, the real-world choice remains that of Intel’s existing Core i5 and Core i7 chips for the LGA1151 socket, which offer the safest bet for ensuring good gaming performance in this very here-and-now, or AMD’s Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7s, which are clearly better value and might well prove more future proof thanks to offering more affordable six and eight-core options. Like I said, the situation is developing fast. I fully expect to see Intel add a six-core chip for its mainstream LGA1151 socket later this year and I’m hoping that will be part of a further re-jigging of prices that will see six cores slot in where Intel’s best quad-core chips currently reside in the price lists and those in turn become yet more accessible. Things are moving in the right direction, then. But I’d be holding out just a little longer to see how things develop later this year before pulling the trigger on that new gaming rig.

What most people don’t know is that single socket Xeons (previously branded as E5-1xxx) are generally overclockable. For example, when the i7-4960X was supposedly the baddest kid on the block, you could buy a 8C E5-1680v2 and overclock it. It even had better thermal properties, as it used a huge 12-core die with 4 cores disabled (whereas the 4960X used a small 6 core die). So, while it will probably be a weird OEM SKU us mere mortals can’t buy (as was the case with Haswell/Broadwell), an unlocked 24 core+ Skylake-e monster could exist.

IMO, they are so good that building with Intel right now is a mistake. Intel could have reacted to this in many ways, but I think they have done it in the worst possible way.

Log in to Reply 08/06/2017 at 23:17 sandineyes says: If I were in a position to make a new build, the $599 i7-7820X would seem to be the best of the line-up for the price. The cheaper skylake-sp lacks the fancy new Turbo Boost, and the clock rates are not great if you are in it for gaming. The $999 part seems to just have more cores and pci-e lanes. I’m not sure what the purpose of the Kaby Lake-X parts are, except perhaps to offer an entry point into the platform. You don’t get the four channel memory, nor increased pci-e lanes, nor the Turbo Boost 3.0, nor the AVX-512 instructions. Seems like it would be better to wait for Coffee Lake.

Log in to Reply 08/06/2017 at 23:48 ravenshrike says: Here’s the problem for Intel. The boards for X299 are probably going to start at around 200 dollars. Whereas you can get the 6 core Ryzen part and an overclockable motherboard for all of 320 bucks, 300 if you’re willing to go small form factor. This vs figure almost double for the 6 core Skylake-X and mobo. Log in to Reply 09/06/2017 at 00:53 Buuurr says: The problem you are siting has never been a problem for Intel. They hold 80% of the market share for processors. They have held this share for a good 15-20 years now. AMD has always been the cheap alternative, as it is the case now. The status quo has in no shape or form changed. How could this be defined as a problem for Intel? From a business standpoint it is off to the market as usual.

It clearly has nothing to do with luggage or the American South. I cannot have anything to do with newcomers, because Intel has been around forever, and were founded explicitly to do what they have always done, i.e. they did not move or switch targets for a underhanded gain. And I finally, I even looked up the British meaning, which I knew was different from the American ones, and I cannot see how Intel is trying to demutualize any company. So how are Intel carper bagging? Arguably, someone could think that the processor scene needs some carpetbaggers, but Intel cannot play that role.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks With Mobileye-Like Return Potential Intel paid a 30% premium for Mobileye. Our contributors think it's possible the same could happen for these three stocks. Jason Hall, Neha Chamaria, and Reuben Gregg Brewer (TMFVelvetHammer) Jun 8, 2017 at 4:41PM The financial media, including many of our Foolish colleagues, panned the March announcement that Intel was paying $15.3 billion to buy Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY). However, the big premium resulted in 30% overnight returns for recent buyers and has seen anyone who bought shares earlier this year enjoying gains of more than 60%.  Instead of debating whether Intel overpaid or made a smart move, we asked our contributors to describe three stocks that could also deliver Mobileye-like returns if they are targeted for acquisition. They offered up recent Alcoa spinoff Arconic Inc. (NYSE:ARNC), and two recent tech IPOs that could be better off as part of a bigger company in GoPro Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) and Fitbit Inc. (NYSE:FIT).  Image source: Getty Images. Not only is there acquisition upside for these three stocks, but there's also something to like about the businesses behind them. Keep reading to learn why they stood out to our contributors.  Activist investor involvement makes Arconic a must-watch Neha Chamaria (Arconic): Mobileye wasn't really a red-hot tech stock until Intel bought it out. So when I was asked to pick a stock with Mobileye potential, Arconic, the company that was separated from aluminum giant Alcoa late last year, came to mind right away. The reason: There's a chance Arconic might be put up for sale. And if it isn't, there's a chance management will pull out all the stops to improve Arconic's margin to win investor confidence back, which could drive the stock higher. To the first point, Arconic has been a high-drama stock of late, with management at loggerheads for several months now with activist investor Elliot Management. Arconic CEO Klaus Kleinfield -- who also formerly led Alcoa and oversaw the Arconic spinoff -- has stepped down, and the bitter battle between management and Elliot is apparently over. But you can never fully predict an activist investor's motives or moves, and Elliot Management has had a history of selling companies or parts thereof after acquiring representation on their boards. It has already put four companies up for sale just this year. Also, Berkshire Hathaway's purchase of Arconic competitor Precision Castparts for 3.3 times its sales last year has been a talking point for some time, with Elliot pushing erstwhile Alcoa management to bring what is now Arconic's margin to Precision's levels. With automotive and aerospace increasingly adopting lightweight aluminum components and parts, Arconic has tremendous growth potential. I wouldn't be surprised to see Elliot Management now focused on turning Arconic's business around to improve its competitive position in the industry and then maybe even propose to sell it. Either or both these developments could have Arconic stock sharing Mobileye's trajectory. GoPro is better off getting bought Reuben Gregg Brewer (GoPro): As with Mobileye, a buyout could happen at GoPro. That said, GoPro is a troubled company, bleeding red ink and burning through cash. GoPro made its name selling high-end cameras meant to film "extreme" activities. It's a niche product -- some might say a fad. But GoPro has a great name brand and a loyal following. A larger company in either the technology or consumer product space could add the brand to a broader portfolio without much trouble, and without the need to reach beyond the niche GoPro products currently serve -- a task that is basically behind GoPro's current struggles. Despite six consecutive quarters of red ink, with more likely, GoPro has no long-term debt to complicate a takeover. But with a cash balance of $75 million, down from roughly $190 million a year ago, it's getting to the point where something has to happen. Founder and CEO Nicholas Woodman controls roughly two-thirds of voting power at GoPro, so there's probably an ego thing going on. But with cash running out, throwing in the towel and cashing out could start to look increasingly desirable.     As fellow Fool Leo Sun recently noted, GoPro is no longer seen as an innovative company. That means it's just a name brand at this point. But that brand could really shine at a larger company. With cash running short, GoPro could soon find it has little choice but to sell itself. Another "one-trick pony" that could have big acquisition upside from here Jason Hall (Fitbit): As an avid Fitbit user, I still think the company's products have a lot going for them, and I'm also convinced that wearables are only going to continue getting more capable and functional over time. After all, a current $150 wearable the size of a small watch already has more computing power than a $2,000 home computer did a couple of decades ago, and that doesn't even include all the amazing sensory capabilities. Fast-forward another few years, and these devices will be light-years more functional than they already are today.  But as a shareholder and someone who has followed the company more closely in recent quarters, I have reservations that it will be able to go it alone, especially considering the company competes against much bigger, better-capitalized players in the space. That list includes Apple, with its entire ecosystem of iGadgets and loyal users (including myself); performance athletics apparel company Under Armour, which has made a big push into wearable tech; and Garmin, a more diverse company that sells wearables along with a broad range of other special-purpose GPS devices.  Furthermore, wearable sales have proved to be very cyclical so far, with Fitbit seeing sales fall sharply in recent quarters and profits become losses. If this cyclicality continues, it could make it even harder for the company to be successful without other product categories to help smooth out the lumpiness of its sales.  But with that said, Fitbit probably doesn't need to be acquired. It generates positive cash flows from its operations, though it has consumed more cash than it has generated the past couple of years, largely from investments in future growth.  I'll continue to hold my shares because I love the product and prospects for wearables, and Fitbit is a solid company and industry leader. And with the stock at 0.63 times sales, I'd be more likely to buy than sell. At the same time, I think that also makes it an attractive buyout target, and a Mobileye-like premium would still be a reasonable price to pay. That suggests decent upside for investors.   Jason Hall owns shares of Apple, Berkshire Hathaway (B shares), Fitbit, Intel, Under Armour (A Shares), and Under Armour (C Shares).

Here's what's new and prices of models.More Apple launched its new range of Macs at the World Wide Developer Conference 2017 Monday. While the company hasn’t totally revamped the 2016 MacBook, it has introduced some pretty significant changes in the 2017 models. Read: WWDC News: MacBooks and iMacs Refreshed, macOS High Sierra Introduced Here is how the two MacBook models match up: Design: In terms of design, the MacBook Pro 2017 might seem pretty similar to its predecessor. It is the third time that Apple has used an ultra-slim chassis for the MacBook, which it had introduced back in 2015. The 2017 MacBook has the dimensions as its predecessor — it weighs around 920 grams and measures 0.52 inches in thickness. Apple also addressed complaints about the keyboard’s functioning on the 2016 MacBook Pro being under-responsive. The company has added some new butterfly switches such as the new Esc key. Display: While the 2017 MacBook Pro has the same 13-inch retina display as the 2016 MacBook Pro, but is supported by better graphics hardware. It will use an Intel Iris Graphics 640/Graphics 650 processor replacing the Intel Iris Graphics 540/ Graphics 550 processor in the 2016 MacBook Pro. The 15-inch model will also get an upgrade from an Intel HD Graphics 530 processor to Intel HD Graphics 630 processor. The discrete graphics will also be updated; the 2017 MacBook will have a 2GB Radeon Pro 555 or a 4GB Radeon Pro 560 replacing the 2GB Radeon Pro 450/455 or 4GB Radeon Pro 460 on its predecessor. Memory: Apple stated at WWDC2017 that the solid state drives (SSDs) on the 2017 MacBook Pro would be 50 percent faster than SSDs in previous models. Processor:  This might be the biggest change — the 13-inch MacBook 2017 comes with Intel’s 7th generation Kaby Lake 26GHz quad-core Intel i7 processor replacing the 29GHz Intel i5 dual-core processor on the 2016 model. The 15-inch MacBook Pro now has a 2.9 GHz seventh-generation i7 processor replacing the sixth-generation 2.7 GHz Core i7 processor on its predecessor. According to GeekBench 4 benchmarks, the new 15-inch MacBook Pro scored single-core and multi-core scores of 4,632 and 15,747 in single and multi-core tests, which is way more than the 2016 MacBook Pro’s scores of 4,098 and 13,155. This means that the 2017 MacBook Pro is 13 percent faster than the 2016 MacBook Pro in single core tests and 19.7 percent faster in multi-core tests. Touch Bar: Strangely enough, unlike the 2016 MacBook Pro, the MacBook Pro currently available in the stores does not have a touch bar. A model with the Touch Bar is expected to be available later.  Ports: The company has retained the single USB-C port from the 2016 MacBook Pro. Read: MacBook Pro Touch Bar Problems: Apple Users Complain Of 'Popping' Sound Coming From Laptop In addition to this, you can now configure the MacBook to add 16GB of RAM. Furthermore, it can now support a 4K desk monitor. While it is not known yet, the battery life on the new MacBook models is expected to be better than the 2016 models.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search Is Now a Good Time to Buy an AMD CPU or Motherboard? By Michael Crider on June 8th, 2017 Despite the wise acquisition of ATI’s Radeon graphics card division and some interesting diversification on the APU market, AMD has been playing second fiddle to market leader Intel for over a decade. But things have been looking up for the underdog as of late: the company’s Ryzen series of CPUs is a bona fide hit with both critics and consumers. Is now the time to invest in an upgrade for your CPU, and possibly a compatible motherboard to go with it? Short answer: Yes. AMD’s improved strides with the latest CPU models make them well worth the money for an upgrade, especially if you can match them up with your existing components. But since the Ryzen chips are new and AMD’s combined APU platform is due for an upgrade, bargain hunters should probably wait a few months. Ryzen Gives Great Performance Improvements The Ryzen class of processors was launched earlier this year on the AM4 socket, itself only introduced in September of 2016. At the moment there are only seven CPUs in the line, four in the mid-range Ryzen 5 branch and three in the high-end Ryzen 7, but entry-level Ryzen 3 and super-high-end Ryzen Threadripper chips are coming after this year. AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su, looking appropriately pleased with the Ryzen CPU. At similar price points and market segments, Ryzen is closing the gap with Intel’s Core series processors. The current top-of-the-line model, the Ryzen 7 1800X, can’t quite get a knockout victory over Intel’s comparable Core i7-7700K. But with eight processor cores to Intel’s four, it’s notably better at multitasking, and its single-task performance isn’t so far behind that it’s an automatic non-contender (as some previous AMD designs have unfortunately been). With the insane 16-core Ryzen Threadripper CPU expected to come out in the summer of 2017, AMD will have some potent competition and an aspirational top-of-the-line CPU for gamers and enthusiasts. The AM4 Socket Will Probably Be Around for Quite a While Perhaps as a side-effect of its budget-focused market position, AMD’s CPU socket designs (and the motherboards that rely on them) have lasted longer than their Intel counterparts. The AM3+ socket was first introduced way back in 2011, and was compatible with the previous generation of AMD chips, in addition to being backwards-compatible to AM3 designs. The FM2+ socket, used with the company’s integrated APU designs, had a similar lifespan. That being the case, it’s reasonable to assume that the AM4 socket released for the Ryzen family will also be used for upcoming “Zen” chips, with upgrade options continuing for at least four years and possibly more. That means it’s a great time to invest in a high-end AM4 motherboard, safe in the knowledge that you’ll be able to swap in a more powerful Zen processor well down the line. The AM4 socket supports DDR4 memory, the fastest and latest available in 2017, but might be at a disadvantage next year when the DDR5 standard becomes finalized. That said, an AM4 motherboard will probably benefit more from a processor upgrade than it would from faster RAM in any case. Penny-Pinchers Should Hold Off With a new socket and a new CPU family, Ryzen chips are currently more expensive than their Intel counterparts, and it will take a while for those prices to come down. AMD is the sole vendor of the parts, and at the moment the company is simply trying to match output to demand. So while prices from retailers like Amazon and Newegg may fluctuate, they’re unlikely to dip below MSRP for several months at the very least. Compatible motherboards might be less expensive—they come from multiple licensed vendors that have to compete with one another—but the combined savings of a CPU and motherboard will still be limited. AMD’s more budget-friendly “Accelerated Processing Unit” or “APU” series is not a wise choice for anyone at the moment. APUs are central processing units designed specifically to work as a combined graphics processor (GPU) as well, dispensing with the need for integrated GPUs and, in some cases, matching the performance of low-power discrete graphics. But the last revision of the desktop APU standard, “Bristol Ridge,” came out in September of last year. AMD’s APUs will be upgraded with cores based on the Zen architecture (the same design powering the Ryzen CPUs currently on the market) and DDR4 memory support sometime in the fourth quarter of 2017. Even if you intend to build a new APU-based computer with contemporary parts, you should hold off for the Zen-based Raven Ridge APUs to hit the market. Not only will you have more options to choose from, the current Bristol Ridge processors and motherboards will be easier to find on sale as retailers clear their older inventory.

In fact, it’s an opportunity: it’s never been easier to tweak your processor to achieve big performance gains. Here, we take you through the basics, busting confusing jargon and offering the essential advice needed to get you started. With no extra cash required to get that performance boost, it’s certainly worth investigating. But it's worth remembering that knowledge is king – so this guide will explain the key concepts of overclocking and how to get started. What is overclocking and how does it help performance? First, a little science. The most important overclocking concept is the clock itself, which is measured in Hertz and most usually written as megahertz (a million Hertz, MHz) or gigahertz (a billion Hertz, GHz). This refers to the speed of the tiny oscillator inside a processor that regulates the electronic pulses that flow through the chip. We’re talking here about billions of pulses per second, and it’s these pulses that handle everything a processor does. The pulses run in cycles, and overclocking refers to the process of speeding up the internal clock. As more cycles are completed, a greater number of tasks are accomplished – which means the processor will be faster. Related: Best gaming PC specs to build yourself This brings numerous benefits. If you run intensive productivity tools or high-end multi-tasking, for example, your work will get done faster. Gamers love to overclock to give the latest titles a boost, and thousands of people treat overclocking like a sport – no surprise, because there’s big money available for those who reach the highest speeds. There are benefits for modest systems, too. Overclocking can be a free alternative to upgrading an older CPU, and simple tweaks can breathe new life into an older system. Of course, the benefits come with risks. Overclocking can potentially void a processor’s warranty, and the extra electrical and thermal demands can also heat up the processor, potentially shortening its lifespan. As a result, overclocking is always undertaken at your own risk – although if you play it safe, it's unlikely you'll run into terminal trouble. Key concepts of overclocking A bit of research will reveal that there are important ideas that govern all processor overclocking, no matter the chip. The overall clock speed is key, and that figure is calculated by multiplying twonumbers together: the base clock and the multiplier. The base clock – often called the BCLK – is the reference speed used by the processor, memory and PCI connectors on your motherboard; it needs to be low to enable those different components to work in sync. On modern motherboards it’s set to 100MHz. It’s combined with the multiplier to determine a processor’s advertised clock speed. Here’s an example. Intel’s Core i5-7600K has a base clock of 100MHz (0.1GHz) and a multiplier of 38 – multiply the two, and you get its official clock speed of 3.8GHz. Related: Best pre-built desktops No processor works without electricity, and overclocking can require more voltage than usual. Processors are relatively efficient, so we’re only talking about tiny amounts of electricity – but increases to clock speed will increase the electrical demands of the chip significantly (relatively speaking). Take the Core i5-7600K again: at its standard speed it will typically consume just under 1V, but overclocking to nearer 5GHz will require around 1.4V. AMD’s chips are hungrier: the Ryzen 7 1800X runs at 3.6GHz and needs around 1.2V by default, with that rising to around 1.45V depending on your overclocking ambition. What you’ll need The first thing you’ll need is a processor with an unlocked multiplier. On the Intel side, that means a chip with a K suffix – such as a Core i5-7600K or a Core i7-7700K. These parts are more expensive than their locked-down equivalents, but can offer some heady performance gains. On the AMD side, all of the firm’s new Ryzen processors are unlocked, and older chips can be overclocked if they’re Black Edition parts. That’s a vital first step, but it isn't just about the processor. You’ll also need a motherboard that supports overclocking. To find out if your board cuts the mustard, check its chipset. Intel chipsets such as the H170, H270 and H110 don’t support overclocking, but higher-end silicon such as the Z170 and Z270 does. On the AMD side, the X370, X300 and B350 chipsets can be overclocked, but A320 and A300 don’t include this feature. It's easy to determine the chipset you're running, because your model name of your motherboard will include it. Motherboards have other attributes that make them suitable for overclocking. Larger heatsinks will do a better job of keeping components cool if you’re using a higher voltage, and gaming and enthusiast motherboards have specialist buttons and displays for tweaking and diagnosing problems. The increased electrical demands of an overclocked processor must be considered. The extra heat means it’s sometimes sensible to have a more capable third-party cooler; Intel and AMD’s standard coolers aren’t really designed for the rigours of overclocking. However, this needn't mean a big investment: a decent cooler can be purchased for about £20. Check out our list of the best CPU coolers for some fine examples. Increased electricity also means greater power consumption, so make sure your power supply can cope. We’d recommend a 500W PSU as a bare minimum, but 600W would be more comfortable, especially for high-end rigs with powerful graphics cards. It's always better to have headroom for future power demands, too. Overclocking requires the right software, too – and plenty of patience. Before you start, install a free benchmark such as Cinebench R15 to test single- and multi-threaded performance. It’s perfect to run before and after an overclock, so you can find your original performance level and measure the gain. Software such as CPU-Z and Coretemp can display your revised clock speeds and new temperatures, which are important for ensuring a stable overclock. Also download Prime95, which stresses the processor at 100% load – if your overclock survives this test, it’s stable. Finally, before you start tweaking, make sure your PC’s drivers and BIOS are updated. If you’re unsure, visit your motherboard manufacturer’s website to find the latest versions. How to overclock safely Most overclocking takes place in the BIOS, which is the piece of software that can be accessed before a PC has booted into Windows. You usually access it by pressing the Escape, F2 or F12 key repeatedly before Windows starts to boot. Check your motherboard's manual for guidance. Every BIOS looks different, so don't be alarmed if it doesn't look this fancy. If your board supports overclocking then you'll find the options in there somewhere Most BIOS applications now include sections that are dedicated to tweaking – look for Advanced Frequency Settings, Overclocking Settings or Extreme Tweaker, for example. Once you’ve opened that page, look for settings that sound like the following. The CPU frequency and multiplier could be called something like the BCLK frequency or CPU Core Ratio. Make sure the ratio setting is set to synchronise all cores to the same speed, and find the voltage settings for later – the CPU voltage might be listed as VCore instead. Note the 1-core ratio limit. In this case, it's the setting you're looking for, but other boards vary. Begin my making a modest improvement. If you’re overclocking the Core i5-7600K, for instance, try raising the multiplier from 38 to 39. Leave the voltage at its default level, since it shouldn’t need raising for a modest overclock. Save your BIOS changes and boot into Windows – if the chip co-operates, CPU-Z will report a revised speed of 3.9GHz. Once you’re in Windows, run Cinebench and Prime95 to see if your overclock is stable. Keep an eye on the temperature to ensure it’s within safe limits; lower is better, and anything below 70°C is fine. If the PC runs well, reboot, head into the BIOS again, and increase the multiplier by another step before running the same tests. Patience is key: if you try to be too ambitious at the start then you risk damaging the processor. Note that every processor will have a different overclocking ceiling. Take small steps to find the point where the chip becomes unstable. You'll know it's unstable because your PC will freeze, crash or restart. Once instability kicks in, try increasing the voltage – but only increase the VCore by 0.01V at a time. Once your PC is stable again, you can go back to upping the multiplier and the voltage levels. Eventually, the processor will simply refuse to run properly. At that point, dial the chip back to its last stable point – make a note each time it runs in a stable manner – and make sure it can withstand benchmarks and stress tests. Don’t expect the kind of miracles you see in record-setting overclocking competitions: the best Intel chips peak at around 5GHz with a solid air-cooler or water-cooling unit, while most AMD Ryzen chips top out below 4GHz – although they do start with a lower base clock, so you’re getting a similar leap. Overclocking with Intel The basic principles of overclocking are the same between Intel and AMD’s processors, but minor differences exist between the two companies. Thankfully, for most of Intel’s modern processors, you follow the same basic blueprint: head into the BIOS, leave the base clock alone, and fiddle with the multiplier and the core voltage until you achieve a solid, stable tweak. Haswell and Skylake processors peak at 105°C, while Kaby Lake tops out at 100°C. These figures will be elementary, though, since no overclocked processor should hit those levels if you’re being sensible. Skylake and Kaby Lake have a couple of other innovations. It’s possible to get unlocked processors for laptops. Advanced users will be keen to explore the properly unlocked base clock, too, which allows for greater fine-tuning since you’re not locked to multiples of 100MHz. Overclocking with AMD Ryzen AMD’s Ryzen processors have shaken up the CPU world as a result of the combination of great performance and low prices, but these chips also have a new approach to overclocking thanks to an application called Ryzen Master. This tool runs in Windows, and is designed to make processor tweaking far easier and more accessible. Once it’s installed, activate the app’s OC Mode, then dive in. Sliders allow for core speeds to be adjusted individually or across the entire processor, and they’re paired with arrows to boost or reduce the CPU voltage. Real-time graphs monitor your processor’s speed, load and temperature, and memory can be adjusted from within Ryzen Master. Ryzen Master is welcoming to beginners, but keep applying familiar overclocking principles: a step-by-step approach is best, and test overclocks to ensure they’re stable. If you’re a little more confident, we’d still recommend going through the BIOS. You’ll continue to use the basic ideas of adjusting the multiplier and core voltage, but you’ll get more of a benefit – that’s because Ryzen Master will use more of your CPU’s resources when it’s running in Windows. Conclusion These days, overclocking is far easier than it once was, which means it’s possible to get huge performance gains without spending a penny – or, at least, without shelling out for an expensive new processor. It’s tempting, then, and our guide has introduced the basic concepts and the steps you'll need to get started. So, once you’re ready, we’ll see you in the BIOS. 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

King, known as one of the Senate’s more genial members, reached a breaking point more than an hour into the hearing after Michael Rogers repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether President Trump tried to interfere in the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s actions and possible collusion with his campaign. Rogers declined to answer questions about reports of his interactions with Trump throughout the morning, telling a visibly frustrated King that he didn’t feel it was appropriate. “What you feel isn’t relevant, admiral,” King said back at the NSA chief. Later, when Rogers said he did not mean for his answer to King's question to sound confrontational, King said he did mean to sound confrontational.

Is there an invocation of executive privilege?” King demanded. “I’m not satisfied with, ‘I do not believe it’s appropriate’ or ‘I do not believe I should answer.’ ” “I’m not sure I have a legal basis,” Coats said at one point, adding that he would provide as much information as he was able behind closed doors. Rogers indicated that while he and Coats have had conversations with the White House about a potential claim of executive privilege, he said that they had not gotten a definitive answer. McCabe and Rosenstein both cited the ongoing federal investigation, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, arguing that it is longstanding Justice Department procedure not to discuss anything that might be under active investigation. “I don’t understand why the special counsel’s lane takes precedence over the lane of the United States Congress,” King said. At issue was whether any of the officials had any evidence that Trump may have inappropriately attempted to curtail the FBI's investigation. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Trump had asked Coats to intervene with then-FBI Director James Comey to limit the probe. Both Coats and Rogers denied feeling pressured by Trump to intervene in the handling of intelligence in any inappropriate way but refused to answer specific questions about their interactions with the president. “I’m willing to come before the committee and tell you what I know and don’t know,” Coats said. “What I’m not willing to do is share information I think ought to be protected in an opening hearing.” In a clear sign of the level of frustration in the room, Democrats repeatedly interrupted and talked over officials’ claims that they couldn’t respond to certain lines of questioning. The argumentative exchanges on more than one occasion prompted Sen.

The chip has officially been overclocked to a scarily fast 7.5GHz thanks to the Gigabyte company. Recently revealed at Computex, the i7-7740K was used by Gigabyte’s HiCookie, who paired the processor with the company's own X299-SOC motherboard to put the new Intel chip to the ultimate test. Related: Microsoft E3 Press Conference 2017: Everything you need to know The chip was able to reach a mighty 7.5GHz thanks to the liquid helium cooling system, which allowed the system to crank up a super-fast overclock in an environment that was sitting at -250ºC. Gigabyte also managed to smash previous records held for the 3DMark06 benchmark by creating a system seen running at 7.1GHz, with liquid nitrogen cooling to thank once again for the ridiculously fast overclock. This particular system also featured a Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Xtreme Edition graphics card. Both of these incredible overclocks show the capabilities of Intel's new X-series of chips when pushed to their very limits. It will be very interesting to see how these new chips perform for the average user who opts for a water or air cooling method for their PC. Are you going to get your hands on any of Intel’s new X Series of chips?

The giant chipmaker made the announcement as it reported lower-than-expected sales for the first quarter. This as industry analysts say an extended slide in global PC sales is showing no signs of leveling off. Intel, which has long been the world’s leading maker of PC chips, is now trying to expand into other types of computing. “It’s time to make this transition,” CEO Brian Krzanich told analysts. While calling the job cuts “difficult,” he said they would help the company sharpen its focus in new areas. The latest cuts follow an earlier reduction of about 5,000 jobs announced by Intel in 2014, and analysts say they may not be the last. “These companies are so big that it takes time” — and sometimes multiple rounds of restructuring — to change direction, said Patrick Moorhead, a longtime industry expert at Moor Insights & Strategy. Krzanich has been pushing Intel to change its focus from PCs to other computing segments that are growing and providing more profit. These include making microprocessors for “cloud computing” data centers, along with chips for Internet-connected gadgets, wearable devices and drones. “We are evolving from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices,” he said in a statement. Intel said the job cuts will include “voluntary and involuntary departures” over the coming year, some of them occurring as Intel consolidates some of its PC chip operations into fewer locations. A spokeswoman declined to say exactly which jobs or locations would be affected. Intel has large campuses in Portland, Oregon; Chandler, Arizona; Rio Rancho, New Mexico; and Santa Clara and Folsom, California. It also has facilities in countries including Israel and China. Most of the affected workers will be notified in the next 60 days. The cuts are likely to involve divisions making and selling chips for traditional desktop and laptop computers, Moorhead said. He noted Intel has signaled its plans to continue investing in chips for gaming consoles and new “two-in-one” devices that resemble tablets with detachable keyboards. Those devices are still seeing strong sales growth. Krzanich has been trying to change Intel’s focus since he became CEO in 2013, and he’s replaced several top executives in recent months. Intel said Tuesday that longtime Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will transition to a new position in coming months. But aside from the data center business, which now contributes nearly a third of Intel’s revenue, the markets for Intel’s other new products are still “very embryonic,” according to Mark Hung, an industry analyst at the Gartner research firm. “It’s going to take two to three years before they provide meaningful growth for the company,” Hung said. Krzanich cited Intel’s first-quarter financial performance as evidence the transition is working. Intel reported revenue of $13.70 billion for the first three months of 2016, up 7 percent from the same period a year earlier. That was slightly lower than the $13.73 billion that analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting. Global demand for PCs fell 9.6 percent in the first quarter, according to figures released earlier this month by Gartner. The industry has been in decline for the last four years, Hung noted, but some analysts had expected PC sales to level off this year. Instead, he noted quarterly PC shipments fell below 65 million for the first time since 2007.

David has written articles for » More about me Learn how you can contribute How to upgrade your system BIOS using FreeDOS Upgrading your BIOS can seem tricky for free software users, but it doesn't have to be. Posted 08 Jun 2017 David BothFeed 9up 1 comment Image by :  ajmexico. Modified by Jason Baker. CC BY-SA 2.0. It is not often that most of us need to update the BIOS in our host computers. In fact, most motherboard manufacturers, including Intel, recommend against upgrading BIOS unless there is a specific problem that an upgrade to a specific BIOS level will fix. Most sysadmins also would agree that "if it is not broken, don't fix it." Upgrading BIOS just to get to the latest level is counter-productive in terms of the time it takes, but also can cause problems that did not previously exist. But sometimes it does become necessary. And that can be a problem for those of us who don't use Windows in any form, like me. There is a Windows application that can install BIOS upgrades on modern computers while Windows is running but that is obviously not an option for me. So I need to approach BIOS upgrades a bit differently. The objective This all started one day recently when I decided to upgrade two of my older Linux systems. I have been running BOINC for several years to participate in various distributed computing environments and have been using those two computers almost exclusively as compute platforms for that purpose. I decided that I wanted to add more computing power to those tasks so decided to update some of my older computers rather than purchasing new ones. After all, these are perfectly good computers with yet untapped capabilities. And—being the geek that I am—I also just wanted another hardware project with at least some little bit of justification. You all know what I mean, right? I originally used these two identical systems in a classroom environment where raw performance was not an issue. I purchased them several years ago from the local Intrex computer store with Intel DH61BE motherboard that supports third-generation Core i3, i5, and i7 processors in the LGA1155 package at up to 3.5GHz. At the time these were pretty close to state of the art but not top of the line. I installed Core i3 G620 CPUs with 2 cores and no hyperthreading at 2.6GHz. They worked perfectly for my classroom. These days both of these systems run BOINC. In addition, I use one for testing Fedora upgrades and other new software, and I use the other as a firewall and router for my network. To upgrade, I purchased a pair of unlocked Intel 17-3770K at 3.5GHz processors to replace the existing ones. These are the fastest ones available for those motherboards and my research on the Intel website revealed that these processors would work. I also purchased non-standard CPU coolers with a higher cooling capacity than the ones that come packaged with the CPUs. The problem After receiving the replacement processors I installed one in the test system because it does not perform any tasks critical to my network. Upon attempting to power up the system, I received nothing but a repeating pattern of three one second beeps from the motherboard speaker. The motherboard documentation—yes, I download and keep it—translated that as meaning the system had a memory error. Of course, it was perfectly good memory right in the middle of the spec for the new processor. At this point, I could not get to the BIOS to do any configuration so I removed the new CPU and put the old one back in. This at least allowed the system to boot and let me get to BIOS to check the BIOS version level and, using the Intel support website, found that to be many levels behind the most current. There is another way to locate the BIOS level from the Linux command line and I rebooted into Fedora 25 and used the dmidecode command to locate the current BIOS. The -t option specifies the type information to be displayed, in this case, type 0 is for BIOS information.

 Listing 1: Using the dmidecode command to locate BIOS information. The output of the dmidecode command shown above shows the BIOS version of BEH6110H.86A.0048.2012.1105.1520. This information is from one of the hosts I upgraded after doing the BIOS upgrade. Well, I wasn't thinking about writing about this at that point in my travails. We can decode most of the fields in this version number by assuming that the dots are field separators. The first field is the board model number and the second is probably an engineering release level. The third field, 0048, is the actual BIOS version level, and is what appears in the Intel web pages; if someone says you need to be at BIOS version 48, that is the number to look at. Field number four is the year and field five is the month and day in MMDD format in which the BIOS was released. I don't know for certain what the last field is, but I think it might be a time in 24-hour format so that the last three fields represent the date and time the BIOS was compiled. My original BIOS was version 23 and, according to the Intel website, the most current version is 120. Note that not all of the intervening BIOS version numbers were released to the public, but there were still 20 versions posted and 17 were more recent than mine. So I downloaded the most recent and tried to use the F7 option at boot time to upgrade the BIOS. What this means is that the initial BIOS display at boot time includes an F7 option in addition to F2 to enter BIOS configuration and F10 to enter the Boot options menu. I pressed F7 and selected the BIOS file that I had placed on a FAT formatted USB stick. That failed and the system just locked up when I tried that. Some additional searching with Google and in particular on the Intel website provided me with a bit more information. First, my BIOS version did not actually support F7 at boot time despite the fact that the option did appear on the BIOS screen. Second, a very obscure response to another user indicated that not all BIOS versions would install directly, and it would be necessary to install multiple BIOS revisions in sequence. If I had a copy of DOS I could use one of Intel's other programs for updating BIOS, iFlash.exe. In order to overcome that problem without spending any money, I performed a fruitless search and discovered that I did not have a copy of DOS. FreeDOS At this point, I remembered that Opensource.com's own Jason Baker had written an interview with FreeDOS developer, Jim Hall, Keeping DOS alive and kicking with open source. After rereading that article, I went to the FreeDOS website and checked it out. FreeDOS is open source software and is licensed under the GPL. With a little more googling I also discovered a website titled, Creating a FreeDOS bootable USB stick to upgrade BIOS, which sounded like exactly what I needed. The instructions there are quite clear and include all of the necessary commands required to create the bootable FreeDOS USB stick. I copied the *.BIO files to the USB device. The FreeDOS that is downloaded using these instructions is version 1 which is a bit old. But is works and that is all that is necessary. The current version is 1.2. Doing the update After I created my FreeDOS bootable USB stick, I copied the BIOS files to the USB stick, used the boot menu to boot from the USB device, and ran the iflash.exe program according to the instructions on the Intel website. The only thing you really need to know from that page is to use the command IFLASH2.EXE /PF XXX.BIO where XXX is the name of the BIOS file. My first attempt did not work because I still skipped too many BIOS versions for it to work. So I went back even further, to the revision immediately after the one on my system and that one worked just fine. It only took a couple minutes and the computer rebooted itself before starting the actual upgrade and then again after. I then upgraded to the minimum version I needed to support my CPU which, according to the Intel website, was BIOS version 48. I installed the new CPU and rebooted successfully. BIOS rev 48 is also the version required to enable further BIOS upgrades using the F7 option. I did not upgrade any further even though there are still several newer versions available. The Intel website, as well as most sysadmins I know, always recommend only upgrading the BIOS if absolutely necessary. Intel also recommends only upgrading to the minimum version required to resolve the extant problem. So that is what I did. Final thoughts My Chrome browser automatically renamed the *.BIO files to *.BIN and I have no idea why. Just be sure to rename them to *.BIO or the iflash program will not recognize them. Research in advance the compatibility of any hardware you want to use to upgrade your system. Be certain that you understand the problems you might face while hacking your hardware. It is not possible to always discover all the pitfalls, especially if you are not sure what to look for but you should always be able to determine whether the manufacturer supports a particular motherboard, memory, and CPU combination. If you run into problems, more Internet searches can usually lead to one or more clues about how to proceed or where to look further. I have never used unlocked processors before but I found no real difference in getting them installed and configured. Mine work very well and I really like the performance improvement. I monitor the CPU temperatures but so far the temperatures are remaining in the mid-70s (Celcius), which is well within the normal operating range. I do enjoy hardware hacking and in this case, it was definitely cheaper than purchasing a new motherboard, CPU, and memory combination for two computers. It was also more fun and a very enlightening learning experience. It was particularly enlightening because I learned that I can use open source software to upgrade BIOS on Intel motherboards and that was one of my main objectives. Oh, by the way—does anyone need a couple used Intel i3 G620 CPUs?

By Liam Tung | June 8, 2017 -- 13:53 GMT (06:53 PDT) | Topic: Security Microsoft has demonstrated how hacking group Platinum abuses Intel's AMT Serial-over-LAN for invisible communications. Image: Microsoft Microsoft has discovered a group of advanced hackers it calls Platinum using Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT) Serial-over-LAN (SOL) to conceal communications from the firewall. AMT is included in Intel's network chipset to support remote management capabilities. One of its features, AMT-SOL, creates a virtual serial port that can be used to send and receive data from an authenticated management console. It's a powerful tool that can, for example, be used to scroll the mouse or navigate Windows even when a PC's network drivers are disabled, so long as the device is still physically connected to the network. Microsoft's malware researchers found that Platinum recently adopted AMT-SOL as part of a file-transfer tool to make its communications "invisible" to a host's firewall and network monitoring applications. As Microsoft explains, the malware abuses AMT Serial-over-LAN's method of communicating with the management console. Instead of communications passing through the host's networking stack, where a firewall could block this traffic, SOL traffic is diverted to the AMT chipset and virtual serial driver. Intel and Microsoft confirmed the malware doesn't exploit a vulnerability in AMT SOL, but rather it misuses the feature within already compromised networks. The feature also requires the attacker to already have administrative privileges on targeted systems. It's the first time Microsoft has observed any hackers using AMT SOL in this way and it's only been observed on a handful of computers. The sparing use of this malware is consistent with Platinum's advanced attacker profile. The group has been in action at least 2009, and typically spearphishes targets, which have mostly been ISPs, government agencies and defense organizations in southeast Asia. The group has used 'hot patching', or patching actively running processes, to cloak custom backdoors already planted in PCs. They also have a number of keyloggers and data stealers in their toolkit and have used several zero-day exploits against targets. Microsoft notes that SOL functionality requires that AMT has been provisioned on a device, while a SOL session also requires a username and password. So, either Platinum has already acquired these credentials to start a session, or Platinum itself provisioned AMT on targeted systems after gaining administrative privileges for that system and using host-based provisioning. "The most straightforward is host-based provisioning (HBP), which can be done from within the host Windows OS itself and requires administrator permissions. During the provisioning process, Platinum could select whichever username and password they wish," Microsoft notes. Linux machines with Intel's chips may also be exposed to this malware. Microsoft notes the technique used by Platinum is OS independent. Microsoft's Windows Defender ATP can alert networks admins to malicious attempts at using AMT SOL but only for Windows PCs.

But they refused to answer specific questions about their interactions with the president. "This elaborate 'we won't answer' — they were in fact implying that there was something to discuss," King said on MSNBC. "If the answer was, no, there was no discussion, that would have been really easy. No, no discussion ... All this dancing around suggesting there was something there." ADVERTISEMENT None of the Trump administration officials were able to satisfy Democrats or King, who caucuses with Democrats, on the legal justification for their silence. During the hearing, King snapped at the head of the NSA after Rogers repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether Trump tried to interfere in the FBI's investigation into Russia's actions and possible collusion with his campaign. Rogers declined to answer questions about reports of his interactions with Trump throughout the morning, telling a visibly frustrated King that he didn’t feel it was appropriate. “What you feel isn’t relevant, admiral,” King said back at the NSA chief. It wasn’t the only showdown during King’s five-minute round of questioning, as he repeatedly pressed Rogers, Coats, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe on the legal justification for their silence. “Why are you not answering these questions? Is there an invocation of executive privilege?” King said. “I’m not satisfied with, ‘I do not believe it’s appropriate’ or ‘I do not believe I should answer.’ ” “I’m not sure I have a legal basis,” Coats said at one point, adding that he would provide as much information as he was able behind closed doors.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts Apple’s new 21.5″ iMac with 4K Retina screen has user replaceable RAM and modular CPU Christian Zibreg on June 8, 2017 5 Apple during the Worldwide Developers Conference refreshed the iMac lineup with faster Intel chips and updated internal architecture. Good folks over at iFixit have now taken Apple’s new $1,299 21.5-inch iMac model that has a 4K Retina display, discovering something really interesting. The machine features both removable RAM (via a pair of removable SO-DIMM slots) and Intel’s Kaby Lake processor that—surprisingly—sits in a standard LGA 1151 CPU socket rather than being soldered onto the logic board. The modular CPU design suggests owners of the all-in-one desktop might be able to replace or upgrade the CPU in the future without a reflow station. The last time the 21.5-inch iMac had user-replaceable RAM was back in 2013. 2012 models of the 21.5-inch iMac also came with a modular CPU. The stock configuration they tore apart had Intel’s SR32W Core i5-7400 Kaby Lake chip, 8GB of 2400MHz DDR4 memory, a Radeon Pro 555 graphics card with 2GB of VRAM and a 1TB 5400-RPM hard drive. According to iFixit: Our teardown confirms that the new 21.5-inch iMac with 4K display has both removable RAM and a modular CPU. Of course, Apple would say neither is user-replaceable. Accessing and replacing these components isn’t exactly easy, but we’re saying it’s possible. Maybe even probable. A tinker-happy user (armed with the right tools and guide) could at least double the base 8 GB of memory, turning their new iMac with Retina Display into an iMac Semi-Pro. Here’s the machine’s socketed CPU. Other teardown highlights: A warranty void sticker on the heat sink discourages users from removing the modular CPU underneath. The Retina display is manufactured by LG Display. There’s a single microphone below the display vs. dual microphones on previous models CMOS battery is replaceable A built-in 3.5-inch SATA hard drive is upgradeable There’s no SSD connector on the board And here’s the user-replaceable RAM module. Despite the upgradable RAM and CPU, iFixit gave the machine a 3/10 for repairability. That’s because the computer is difficult to open as everything is buried under “a finicky glass panel,” in iFixit’s own words. A speciality pizza-cutter-like tool is required to breach the adhesive before any repair. And because the cover glass and the Retina display itself are fused together, the cost of a display replacement will be high. At any rate, this is still good news for anyone in the market for a new iMac. Upgradability is paramount with all-in-one designs like iMac’s. And with replaceable RAM and CPU, customers will be able to get more use and more years out of their computer.

Trying Intel Kabylake Graphics With Dawn of War III Vulkan Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 8 June 2017 at 08:39 AM EDT. 17 Comments Keeping in mind that Intel graphics are not officially supported for Dawn of War III on Linux, I couldn't help but to see if/how it ran with Kabylake HD Graphics... As of a few days ago, Intel ANV received a rendering fix for Dow3, so you will need to be using Mesa 17.2-dev Git in the past few days for this to work out... Intel's OpenGL driver -- like the Radeon and Nouveau drivers -- do not yet support this newest Feral-ported game on Mesa 17.2-dev master due to lacking ARB_bindless_texture support. Mesa 17.2 should get bindless texture support by its release hopefully, but for the next few weeks at least RadeonSI users will need to be using the branched code while now bindless-texture implementation exists yet for the other Mesa/Gallium3D drivers. When trying Linux 4.12 + Mesa 17.2-dev latest Git on the Intel Core i7 7700K with the HD Graphics 630... Sure enough, the Intel "ANV" Vulkan driver was indeed rendering Dawn of War III correctly on Ubuntu. But the frame-rates aren't really playable... Not unexpected as Feral isn't officially supporting Intel graphics with this game, but was surprised at least to see Intel Vulkan rendering things right albeit slowly for this demanding game. See our 18-way GPU comparison from this morning if trying to find a discrete GPU to play this highly-anticipated Linux game port. 17 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

While the company hasn’t totally revamped the 2016 MacBook, it has introduced some pretty significant changes in the 2017 models. Read: WWDC News: MacBooks and iMacs Refreshed, macOS High Sierra Introduced Here is how the two MacBook models match up: Design: In terms of design, the MacBook Pro 2017 might seem pretty similar to its predecessor. It is the third time that Apple has used an ultra-slim chassis for the MacBook, which it had introduced back in 2015. The 2017 MacBook has the dimensions as its predecessor — it weighs around 920 grams and measures 0.52 inches in thickness. Apple also addressed complaints about the keyboard’s functioning on the 2016 MacBook Pro being under-responsive. The company has added some new butterfly switches such as the new Esc key. Display: While the 2017 MacBook Pro has the same 13-inch retina display as the 2016 MacBook Pro, but is supported by better graphics hardware. It will use an Intel Iris Graphics 640/Graphics 650 processor replacing the Intel Iris Graphics 540/ Graphics 550 processor in the 2016 MacBook Pro. The 15-inch model will also get an upgrade from an Intel HD Graphics 530 processor to Intel HD Graphics 630 processor. The discrete graphics will also be updated; the 2017 MacBook will have a 2GB Radeon Pro 555 or a 4GB Radeon Pro 560 replacing the 2GB Radeon Pro 450/455 or 4GB Radeon Pro 460 on its predecessor. Memory: Apple stated at WWDC2017 that the solid state drives (SSDs) on the 2017 MacBook Pro would be 50 percent faster than SSDs in previous models. Processor:  This might be the biggest change — the 13-inch MacBook 2017 comes with Intel’s 7th generation Kaby Lake 26GHz quad-core Intel i7 processor replacing the 29GHz Intel i5 dual-core processor on the 2016 model. The 15-inch MacBook Pro now has a 2.9 GHz seventh-generation i7 processor replacing the sixth-generation 2.7 GHz Core i7 processor on its predecessor. According to GeekBench 4 benchmarks, the new 15-inch MacBook Pro scored single-core and multi-core scores of 4,632 and 15,747 in single and multi-core tests, which is way more than the 2016 MacBook Pro’s scores of 4,098 and 13,155. This means that the 2017 MacBook Pro is 13 percent faster than the 2016 MacBook Pro in single core tests and 19.7 percent faster in multi-core tests. Touch Bar: Strangely enough, unlike the 2016 MacBook Pro, the MacBook Pro currently available in the stores does not have a touch bar. A model with the Touch Bar is expected to be available later.  Ports: The company has retained the single USB-C port from the 2016 MacBook Pro.

By Liam Tung | June 8, 2017 -- 11:08 GMT (04:08 PDT) | Topic: Laptops Early benchmarks suggest the new MacBook Pro may give a 13 percent better single-core performance and a 20 percent improvement in multi-core than last year's equivalent model. Image: Sarah Tew/CNET Early benchmark results of the new MacBook Pro with Intel's Kaby Lake family of processors indicate significant performance gains over last year's models with the same configuration on Intel's Skylake chips. Geekbench 4 comparisons compiled by MacRumors suggest some of the newer models could be up to 20 percent faster than last year's MacBook Pros. Last year's high-end stock configuration 15-inch MacBook Pro came with a 2.7GHz sixth-generation Core i7 and has average single-core and multi-core scores of 4,098 and 13,155, respectively. The new high-end stock configuration 15-inch model comes with a 2.9GHz Core i7 and has so far recorded respective average scores of 4,632 and 15,747. The new model's scores are only based on a handful of tests, but the early results suggest that for the same price as last year's equivalent model, you may get a 13 percent better single-core performance and a 20 percent improvement in multi-core. The high-end 15-inch MacBook Pro costs $2,799. The base configuration of the new 15-inch MacBook Pro has a 2.8GHz Core i7. Although there's currently only one Geekbench result for it, here too it points to a 9.5 percent improvement on the 2016 equivalent, which featured a 2.6GHz Core i7 sixth-generation processor. This model costs $2,399. Apple upgraded the processors across its entire MacBook lineup for 2017, but little else changed from the 2016 lineup. The 12-inch MacBook got the largest makeover with a new 16GB RAM option, up from a maximum of 8GB, Kaby Lake processor, and inherited the keyboard mechanism from the 2016 MacBook Pro. Apple also added a new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar with 128GB storage, which costs $1,299. Last year's 13-inch model started at $1,499 however it had 256GB storage. Essentially, Apple reintroduced the $1,299 entry point for the previous 13-inch MacBook with retina display. More on Apple and MacBook Pro Will your Mac run macOS High Sierra?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation CEO Talks 10-Nano, 7-Nano Manufacturing Tech Commentary from Intel CEO Brian Krzanich reveals uncertainty around the company's future 7-nanometer chip-manufacturing technology. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 8, 2017 at 7:30AM At a recent investor conference, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich provided a small update on the company's progress and plans with respect to new chip-manufacturing technologies. Indeed, Intel often touts its chip-manufacturing prowess as a competitive advantage that helps it build more efficient and more cost-effective products than its competitors can, so it's worth keeping tabs on the progress the chipmaker reports here. Image source: Intel. Without further ado, here's what Krzanich had to say. 10-nanometer coming at the end of the year Intel began commercial shipments of the first chips built on its 14-nanometer technology in the second half of 2014. The company had originally planned to begin volume shipments of products built using its next-generation 10-nanometer technology in 2016, but development issues led to the push out of those first products. According to Krzanich, Intel plans to begin the first commercial shipments of processors built using the first iteration of its 10-nanometer technology by the end of the year, with more robust volume shipments happening as 2018 progresses. 7-nanometer in either 2020 or 2021 Krzanich also offered some insight into when we should expect to see the company ship the first products based on its 7-nanometer technology, noting that such shipments should happen between two and three years after the first 10-nanometer shipments occur. Two years after the first production shipments of 10-nanometer chips would put the first production shipments of 7-nanometer chips at between early 2020 to early 2021. Not much change on 10-nano, uncertainty around 7-nano What Intel has disclosed here with respect to its 10-nanometer technology isn't much different from what the company already said a few months back. The company had previously indicated that it would begin its first 10-nanometer product shipments by either the end of this year or the beginning of next year, and it seems the company is still on track to that. With respect to 7-nanometer -- which Intel didn't really address at its Technology and Manufacturing Day -- it seems to me that there's a high degree of uncertainty. Reading between the lines a bit, I sense that Intel aspires to get this technology into volume manufacturing in early 2020, but it's putting the appropriate plans in place to be able to handle a slip into early 2021. Intel has said it intends to move to a "data-center first" strategy, whereby it transitions its products aimed at data-center applications to new manufacturing technologies first, with products for its other segments, such as the client computing group and the Internet of Things group, transitioning to those technologies later. I suspect that Intel isn't betting on shipping non-data-center products using the 7-nanometer technology until the 2021 time frame anyway, so the impact here is probably going to be exclusively on Intel's data-center product strategy. If I'm reading into this correctly, Intel is going to need a "Plan A" as well as a "Plan B" with respect to the data-center products it launches in the 2020 time frame. The "Plan A" would presumably consist of chips using Intel's 7-nanometer technology, while the "Plan B" could consist of chips built using Intel's 10-nanometer++ technology. We'll see how Intel ultimately executes, but given that past performance is a reasonable, though not foolproof, indicator of future success, I expect that we won't see the first 7-nanometer products from Intel until 2021.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Science & Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Interview: From dual camera modules to LTE feature phones, Spreadtrum's going for a home-run Spreadtrum Communications is growing its image beyond affordable chip maker to a premium one. Sami Khan   June 8, 2017 12:55 IST Spreadtrum CommunicationsFacebook/Spreadtrum There's competition everywhere. From mobile phone makers to telecom operators, everyone is fighting to stay on top by connecting with consumers in most unique ways possible. The chipset industry, which largely comprises of two names – Qualcomm and MediaTek – is also headed in the direction of intense competition. Spreadtrum is one of the key players in the chipset industry, but its strong association with affordable smartphones has kept it away from the spotlight. While Qualcomm, MediaTek and Samsung are speaking of high-performance octa-core and quad-core chips, Spreadtrum made strides in the ultra-affordable chips by making LTE feature phones a reality. Spreadtrum's chips for affordable mobile devices isn't going to define the company for long. The Chinese chip maker is also brainstorming ideas to accommodate new features such as dual camera, iris scanner and more. International Business Times, India, sat down with Spreadtrum Communications head of India operations – Neeraj Sharma – for a quick interaction about company's strategic plans and goals for India & Asian region. Below are the edited excerpts from our interaction with Sharma. Spreadtrum Communications, Country Head - India, Neeraj SharmaSpreadtrum Press IBTimes, India: After Jio making 4G data affordable, do you think it's about time phone makers tune their strategies to build cheaper devices to support LTE and VoLTE? Neeraj Sharma: There is no doubt that to achieve the ambitious vision of a truly Digital India, increasing the affordability and accessibility of devices with 4G/LTE and VoLTE capabilities has to be a priority for mobile phone manufacturers in the country. However, the challenge that India faces today is not restricted to enabling better access to high-speed internet and VoLTE devices. There is also a pressing need to make Indian consumers aware about how the data can be best utilised, particularly in tier-2 and tier-3 cities and rural areas. This can only be done through strong collaborations between device manufacturers and network operators, the two key stakeholders in the telecommunications space. In order to popularise LTE and VoLTE capabilities across India, mobile brands are looking at exploring strategic partnerships and tighter integrations with chipset manufacturers to develop more affordable VoLTE-enabled devices. One promising development in this regard has been the launch of highly affordable 4G/VoLTE feature phones offering internet-based features like support for social networking, email, internet browsing, music, camera, etc. On their part, telecom operators are also looking at exploring sustainable measures of making high-speed data packages available to their subscribe whilst also educating them about how to best utilise the network data at their disposal. IBT: Spreadtrum has largely been associated with affordable smartphones, how does it compete against rivals Qualcomm and MediaTek? Sharma: With our focus on technological innovation and improvement, Spreadtrum has today firmly established itself as one of the global leaders in the chipset domain. But while we have been particularly dominant in the affordable smartphone space, our cutting-edge technological capabilities extend to quad-core and octa-core phones as well. We have been constantly innovating and upgrading by developing smarter and faster chipsets with advanced features like eMBMS, VoWiFi, Dual Camera, Carrier Aggregation, etc., and are also coming up with high-performance octa-core chipsets. Additionally, Spreadtrum has recently launched SC9861G-IA, a 14nm octa-core 64-bit CAT 7 high-end LTE chipset in collaboration with Intel. This augmentation of our technological expertise is what is helping us carve out a niche in the highly-competitive chipset market. Spreadtrum SC9861G-IA chipFacebook/Spreadtrum IBT: How does Spreadtrum's partnership with Intel help accelerate its growth? Sharma: Intel is the most dominant player when it comes to powerful PC processors and is renowned for its innovations and capabilities for larger devices. Through the collaboration with Intel, we are trying to develop similarly high-performing chipsets for mobile phones. We have been using Intel's foundry for fabricating our processors. At the recently concluded Mobile World Congress, Spreadtrum in collaboration with Intel launched SC9861G-IA, a 14 nm, 8-core, 64-bit LTE chipset that has a very efficient power-management design and delivers a delightful experience to users worldwide. Spreadtrum's SC9853, a LTE CAT 7 SoC with Intel Airmont Architecture CPU is another high-end chipset that we have launched with Intel. IBT: As Spreadtrum works with Samsung, Jio, Micromax, Lava and Intex, which of these companies have stepped up the pace in bringing cheapest 4G VoLTE feature phones to market? Sharma: At Spreadtrum, our aim is to enable better access to the latest mobility technology to consumers across the world. This is why we are partnering with leading mobile brands like Samsung, Reliance, Micromax, Lava, Intex and Zen for a faster and greater penetration of 4G/VoLTE services across India. Each brand has its own core competencies and USPs, and all are committed to providing the best and most relevant devices to the consumer segments that they cater to. IBT: What are your immediate plans for India? Sharma: From quad core processors to octa core processors, Spreadtrum has a diverse range of affordable and powerful mobile chipset solutions on offer. Constant reinvention is paramount for us, which is why we keep enhancing our product portfolio by integrating innovative features like eMBMS, VoWiFi, Carrier Aggregation and Dual Camera into our chipsets. Enabling high-quality mobile cameras is a core focus area for us, which is why dual camera modules will be permanent fixtures in our product portfolio going forwards. Through our partnership with Intel, we are looking to break through the cost barrier and bring higher processing power – which has hitherto been restricted to high-end devices and will bring to mainstream devices. With wireless financial transactions increasing exponentially with every passing day, we are also actively integrating advanced security and payments solutions on a hardware level. We have been working on algorithms for iris scanner and fingerprint recognition to facilitate a smoother rollout of turnkey solutions, while better and more secure payments solutions are also being enabled through integrated Near Field Communication (NFC) capabilities. We have also been constantly enhancing our LTE feature phone portfolio with innovative integrations.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on June 8, 2017 04:27 PM PHOTOGRAPH: Kiko Antonio | Apple is about to wrap up its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, CA in a few days. During the kick off ceremony, Tim Cook and his band of merry men unveiled a number of new products to the event’s guests. One of these products is the updated MacBook; now with Intel Kaby Lake processor. Many would know by now that, by far, the MacBook is the most basic Mac laptop in Apple’s entire lineup. In terms of performance, it goes below the MacBook Air with its Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor. MacBook vs iPad Pro The MacBook still features Intel’s line of mobile processors. The top-tier model of the laptop sports an Intel Core m7 processor that runs on a base clock of 1.3GHz. On the other side of the spectrum, the iPad Pro is also equipped with a mobile processor. However, the one on the laptop is totally different in architecture from the one on the tablet. For one, the iPad Pro’s chip is based on the ARM architecture rather than Intel’s x86 architecture. These two are quite different in structure as well as internal features. MacBook (via apple.com) Another major difference is the type of market where the chips are used. Intel’s mobile chips. are mainly used on low-end ultra-light laptops like the MacBook. Meanwhile Apple’s ARM chip is used only on iPhones and iPads. Nevertheless, a recent GeekBench benchmark somewhat shed a mysterious light on the relevance of the MacBook compared to the iPad Pro. It’s all in the core performance A GeekBench result appeared recently on the Internet showing just how good the new iPad Pro is. From the results, on can see that the single core performance of the new A10X Fusion chip is quite phenomenal; managing 3832 points. Comparing this to the most recent MacBook GeekBench benchmark score, the iPad Pro actually managed to outstrip the laptop by a few points. Apple’s ultra-light laptop managed only 3700 points on single core processing. iPad Pro (via apple.com) What is even more interesting is the multicore comparison between the two devices. The MacBook managed a meagre 7133 on GeekBench while the iPad Pro got a whopping 9091. To break it down further, that is a 27 percent performance gain in favor of the iPad Pro. But why? These jaw-dropping gaps in performance are due to a couple of important factors. First, the MacBook’s Intel m7 chip runs at a slower pace of 1.3GHz. On the other hand, the iPad Pro’s A10X Fusion chip purrs at an impressive 2.36GHz clock. This is why the single core score of the iPad Pro is greater than the MacBook. Finally, it has something to do with the core count. The Intel Core m7 chip on Apple’s laptop only has two physical cores and with hyper threading enabled, a total of four virtual cores. The iPad Pro, however, packs a total of six physical cores working hand in hand to give it the performance boost it needs. Intel Core m processor (via theverge.com) Why would I need a MacBook then? Perhaps the next question now is “why the heck would I buy a MacBook if I can get the iPad Pro instead?” Well, there is a grain of truth to that. To add insult to injury, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage is still cheaper, by a mile, than the MacBook. The former racks at around $1,029 while the latter is priced at $1,299. Furthermore, it has a touch display, support for Apple Pencil, and a lot of macOS apps are also now on iOS. We could go on and on and all that it will ever prove is that the iPad Pro out trumps the MacBook. That may be the case right now. Although this might still be debatable since Apple is yet to release the new MacBook with Kaby Lake processors. Nevertheless, knowing Intel, the performance increase on the new processor will only be around 15 percent compared to the Skylake line. This is still not enough to outperform the iPad Pro. Intel would need to add more cores to its Core m line as well as increasing the base clock in order to compete with the A10X Fusion. Unfortunately, this will not happen as Intel has already released its lineup for the new Kaby Lake architecture. Debunking Apple’s marketing strategy At the end of the day, the MacBook is still a full-fledged computer. It runs macOS, the best desktop operating system there is. In terms of performance, value-added features, and robustness, the macOS is still far superior than the iOS. There are hundreds of applications that are available on the macOS and not on iOS. Applications like emulation, Boot Camp, will remain to be with the macOS. Apple A10X Fusion chip (via appleinsider.com) Perhaps this is the idea behind Apple’s strategy. The macOS is deeply rooted in the company’s history. Therefore, it is only fitting that it remains to be one. Apple still wants to highlight the major differences between its mobile and desktop products. Although, in hindsight, the company is marketing the iPad Pro as a laptop of notebook replacement. It will still take a considerable amount of time before we see the merge between a mobile and a desktop operating system. Until then, these two will continue to coexist with each other. Professional users will still rely on the macOS for much of the heavy lifting. Things like 3D rendering, video processing, and more. These are real world scenarios that go far and beyond synthetic tests like the ones on GeekBench. Meanwhile, for simpler tasks, the iOS and the iPad Pro are there to pick up the slack.

BENGALURU: Now one can dot that planet in the name of Sahithi Pingali, a Grade 12 student from city's Inventure Academy. She will be sharing the space with other luminaries in the Milky Way by having a minor planet named after her. This milestone is part of her winning streak at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) in Los Angeles, where she has been on a roll. Earlier this month at ISWEEEP (The International Sustainable World Engineering Energy Environment Project) Olympiad held in Houston, Texas, Sahithi won the Gold Medal for her research on 'An Innovative Crowdsourcing Approach to Monitoring Freshwater Bodies' which was based on city lakes. She has also researched on Varthur lake with her school team especially. The Lincoln Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which has the right to name minor planets, decided to name a planet after her. At the INTEL ISEF international finals, she won 3 special awards in addition to placing overall second in the category Earth and Environmental Sciences which included The ASU Rob and Melani Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives Special Award; A Special Award from King Abdul Aziz and his Companions for Giftedness and Creativity and US Agency for International Development Special Award Sahithi, after her winning her Gold Medal at ISWEEEP, said, "The interesting thing about my project is that it's all about crowdsourcing; getting students and citizens to contribute scientific data. OLOV was the inspiration for this - it was the dedication and commitment of my team members at Inventure that convinced me that high school students were capable of gathering such reliable data, while increasing their environmental awareness and knowledge of science. I hope students all over Bangalore will take this as a call for action to adopt lakes and lead the way for the rest of the world." Sahithi was first exposed to the impact of development on Bangalore's lifeline - our network of lakes - in July 2015, when she won a scholarship from Inventure to participate in the American India Foundation (AIF) program, to study the impact of urban development on scarce resources. Sahithi was also part of the Inventure team that participated in the Our Lakes Our Voice (OLOV) (an Inventure Change Maker initiative) aimed at students from AIF and Inventure doing an experiential case study on Varthur Lake, a 450-acre water body in Inventure's vicinity. She is currently pursuing an internship at the University of Michigan, where she's working with PhD students and professors in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department.

Blog Intel 3D XPoint Found in Optane Module Jeongdong Choe, Senior Technical Fellow, Techinsights 6/8/2017 00:01 AM EDT  3 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet TechInsights recently acquired and tore down an Intel Optane M.2 80mm 16GB PCIe 3.0 and discovered a 3D X-Point memory die in the package. This is the first commercial 3D Xpoint product from Intel and Micron. The Intel 3D X-Point memory package size is 241.12 mm2 (17.6 mm x 13.7 mm) and a single X-Point Memory die is contained within. The 3D X-Point Memory die measures 206.5 mm2 with a 16.16 mm length and a 12.78 mm width. Memory efficiency in the die is 91.4% which is higher than the Samsung 3D 48L V-NAND (70.0%) and the Intel/Micron 3D FG NAND (84.9%). Memory density of the 3D Xpoint Memory is 0.62 Gb/mm2 which is lower than commercial 2D and 3D NAND products (2.5 Gb/mm2 for Toshiba/SanDisk and Samsung 3D 48L TLC NAND, and 1.28 Gb/mm2 for Toshiba/SanDisk 2D 15nm TLC NAND). However, compared to DRAM products, the 3D Xpoint memory density is 4.5 times higher than DRAM products with the same 20 nm technology or 3.3 times higher than Samsung’s 1x nm DDR4. Xpoint Memory products use 20 nm technology node for both WL and BL with 0.00176 µm2 cell size which is about half of the DRAM cell size. This is due to a stackable memory cell and 4F2 instead of 6F2 being used for memory cell array design. Figure 1: Xpoint Memory Package (Source: Intel 3D XPoint, TechInsights) Figure 2: Xpoint Memory Die (16 GB) (Source: Intel 3D XPoint, TechInsights) Intel Xpoint Memory is a PCM (phase change memory) with a double storage-selector stacked memory cell between metal 4 and metal 5. GST-based materials are used for the storage, while As (arsenic) doped chalcogenide materials (Se-Ge-Si) are used for the selector in which As might be used to suppress crystallization. This is likely a type of Ovonic Threshold Switch (OTS) structure. We found that the 3D Xpoint memory layers are placed between metal 4 and metal 5 and connected with a few selector contact plugs on metal 4. We’ll be digging deeper into the device to find more innovative technology, and we’ll share that with you in the near future.

It also seems to confirm my suspicion that n layers of 3dxpoint memory cells requires at least 2n+1 lithography + SADP steps, which I think puts a pretty heavy limit on its vertical scalability.

Now we found that it's a PCM (Phase Change Memory), not the other memory types such as ReRAM. Two years ago, Micron announced at FMS that it was a brand new PCM. We found it's a GST-based PCM. It's not brand new, from PCM materials view point. However, since it has a double stacked and double layered 'PCM + OTS' memory/selector structure, we would say it's a brand new one.         Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board Most Recent Comments                 6/9/2017 12:50:43 AM resistion Well, I would be impressed if they can pull this off and call it a relatively "cheap" process.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Toppc breaks another world record overclocking… Toppc breaks another world record overclocking G.Skill's Trident Z RGB memory By Kevin Parrish — Updated June 8, 2017 1:08 am Subscribe Share Think inside the box with these tricked-out shipping container homes The best part of this minimalist Pacific Northwest cabin is outside the window Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you To the mainstream PC gamer, this is a good example of how G.Skill's memory can be overclocked in a controlled environment, but don't expect these speeds in a typical air/water-based setup. Update 6/7/2017 8:39PM: We clarified information regarding Double Data Rate and the reported 5.5GHz speed. On Wednesday, G.Skill International said that a team of professional overclockers managed to speed up its DDR4 memory to 5,500MHz, the fastest frequency (speed) to date. Conducted by Taiwan-based Toppc, the team used a system based on MSI’s X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC motherboard and an Intel Core i7-7740K processor. The team broke the 5GHz barrier last year using G.Skill’s DDR4 memory too. “DDR4 5.5GHz has been our next target after we achieved DDR4 5GHz last year. We are extremely excited to finally make it happen together with Samsung components, MSI X299 motherboard, and Intel Core X-series processor,” says Tequila Huang, corporate vice president of G.Skill International. As seen here, the record was validated by HWBOT. The team kept the processor and memory cooled using liquid nitrogen, meaning the average PC gamer won’t see the overclocked speed using standard air and water-based cooling. The overclocking record relied on a single 8GB stick of G.Skill’s Trident Z RGB DDR4 memory, which is sold as 8GB or 16GB sticks in kits of 16GB and more. G.Skill’s 8GB stick actually overclocked to 2,750MHz, but the number is doubled because DDR memory (Double Data Rate) can handle two chunks of data per clock signal, which is a method of synchronizing the flow of data. It had a latency of CL14-14-14-34, indicating that the memory stick ran at 1,500MHz or 1,600MHz before the overclocking process. The quad-core Intel “Kaby Lake-X” processor used in the test bed had a stock base speed of 4.30GHz, and a boost speed of 4.50GHz. G.Skill introduced its Trident X RGB series at the end of 2016. As the name implies, these DDR4 sticks include RGB lighting that’s customizable through the company’s free desktop software. They include aluminum heat spreaders with a hair-line finish, and a fin-based design for better heat dissipation. Each stick consists of Samsung memory chips soldered on a 10-layer circuit board supporting overclocked speeds. “We are seeing amazing overclocking potential for these newly released hardware and we believe that more overclocking benchmark records will be achieved very soon by professional overclockers worldwide,” Huang added. Toppc initially broke the 5GHz speed barrier using a single G.Skill Trident Z DDR4 memory stick (4GB), MSI’s Z170I Gaming Pro AC mini-ITX motherboard, and a sixth-generation Intel Core i5-6600K processor slowed down to 968.17MHz (originally it runs at 3.50GHz).  The HWBOT info shows that the CPU was cooled by liquid nitrogen, and presumably the memory chip was as well to hit the overclocked 2,501.2MHz speed. Then during Computex 2016, G.Skill memory was used to break Toppc’s record, hitting 2,594.6MHz (aka 5,189.2MHz). This speedy feat was accomplished by Splave, who used the ASRock Z170M OC Formula motherboard and a sixth-generation Intel Core i7-6700K processor. Splave walked away from G.Skill’s OC World Cup Competition with $10,000 and knowing that he achieved a new world record for memory speed. Guess it’s time for another attempt.
Digital Trends Home > Computing > Gigabyte managed to push an Intel Core i7-7740K to… Gigabyte managed to push an Intel Core i7-7740K to a record-breaking 7.5 GHz speed By Mark Coppock — Updated June 7, 2017 5:42 pm Subscribe Share Think inside the box with these tricked-out shipping container homes Get your Sagan on with these 43 awe-inspiring photos of the final frontier Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you With Intel and AMD continuing to one-up each other in the CPU wars, your next PC is guaranteed to be faster than ever. Intel has responded to AMD’s highly competitive Ryzen CPU line with lower prices on some Core processors and an aggressive rollout of its own high-end chips. The X299 chipset and Core-X series of CPUs are the latest Intel response to the sudden increase in competition in the company’s most important market. PC component maker Gigabyte has a vested interest in knowing exactly how well all of these new processors and chipsets perform. One way of accomplishing that objective is to push them to their limits, which is exactly what it did with the Intel Core i7-7740K in a recent record-setting overclocking session, according to The Tech Report. Gigabyte has its own overclocking experts on staff, including the one known as HiCookie, who has his own team of five overclockers. This group put the Core i7-7740K to the test running on Gigabyte’s X299-SOC Champion motherboard, and used some fairly aggressive cooling techniques. Specifically, liquid helium at -220 degrees C was paired with a Corsair AX 1500i power supply. The team also used 16GB of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-4333MHz memory for the CPU test, as well as  G.Skill Trident Z 3600C17 RAM and dual Gigabyte Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPUs for the 3DMark tests. The results were impressive. First, the team managed to overclock the CPU to a staggering 7.5 GHz, which is a record-setting speed. The 3DMark results also set new records, scoring 356,678 points in 3DMark03, 71,928 points in 3DMark06 with a single GTX 1080 Ti, and 71,176 points in 3DMark06 with two GTX 1080 Ti cards. These are some impressive results for sure, and demonstrate that Intel remains firmly ensconced in the high-end of the CPU market. AMD has yet to release its full line of new CPUs based on the Zen architecture that includes the 16-core Threadripper, and Intel itself has its own even more aggressive Core-X processors on the way. Combine those with with AMD’s upcoming Vega architecture of GPUs, and it’s clear that PC performance has significant room for growth.

Macs & Mac OS X | 06 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (15) Apple Beefs Up iMac and MacBook Lines, Teases the iMac Pro by Adam C. Engst At WWDC 2017 today, Apple devoted a non-trivial segment of the keynote to new Mac hardware, showing off improved iMacs and performance-enhanced MacBook Pros and mentioning a speed bump to the MacBook Air in passing. After running through all the changes to today’s models, Apple gave a sneak preview of the iMac Pro, a workstation-class version of the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display that’s scheduled to ship at the end of the year. No mention was made of the Mac mini or Mac Pro, though Apple has already said that the Mac Pro is in the middle of a major redesign that won’t be done until 2018 at the earliest (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017). iMac -- The workhorse of Apple’s desktop line has long been the iMac, which Apple continues to offer in three basic models: a 21.5-inch non-Retina version, a 21.5-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, and the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display. On the CPU front, each model receives a speed bump thanks to Apple using Intel’s 7th generation “Kaby Lake” processors and increasing clock speeds. You can see the specifics on Apple’s Tech Specs page, but the summary is that Apple is focusing more effort on the 21.5 Retina iMac, offering just a single configuration of the non-Retina model. Benchmarks will show how much faster the combination of new CPUs and higher clock speeds will be, but I suspect purchases will mostly be based on price. Although the iMac Retina displays are already gorgeous, Apple claims to have improved them even more in both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch sizes, increasing brightness 43 percent to 500 nits and supporting display of up to 1 billion colors. The non-Retina iMac model drives its screen with the integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, but all the Retina models now take advantage of Radeon Pro GPUs, the 555 and 560 for the 21.5-inch models and the 570, 575, and 580 models for the 27-inch models. The notable win here is for the 21.5-inch Retina models, which were previously limited to integrated Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200. Apple has made the Fusion Drive standard in more configurations, and the company claims that the SSDs available in 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB capacities are up to 50 percent faster. You can also configure the top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with a 2 TB SSD for a whopping $1400. When it comes to RAM, all base models still ship with 8 GB. The non-Retina iMac and low-end 21.5 Retina model remain limited to 16 GB, but the high-end 21.5-inch Retina model can now take 16 GB or 32 GB, a welcome improvement. Similarly, the low-end 27-inch model still maxes out at 32 GB, but the two higher-end models can take 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. RAM in the 21.5-inch iMac models cannot be upgraded by the user, but you can install memory in the 27-inch model yourself. Unsurprisingly, Apple replaced the previous models’ Thunderbolt 2 ports with a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports that support DisplayPort for external screens, Thunderbolt at up to 40 Gbps, USB 3.1 Gen 2 at up to 10 Gbps, and various other protocols via adapters (see “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between,” 3 November 2016). All these changes are welcome for anyone in the market for a new iMac. I doubt they’re significant enough to warrant trading in an existing Retina iMac, unless Thunderbolt 3 is a necessity. The most interesting changes are actually in the 21.5-inch models, which move past the RAM and graphics limitations of the previous configuration while introducing a cheaper config. The 21.5-inch non-Retina iMac remains priced at $1099, with the two Retina configurations starting at $1299 and $1499. The 27-inch model comes in three configurations: $1799, $1999, and $2299. They’re all available now. Perhaps I’m just boggled by the number of changes Apple announced in the WWDC keynote, but I couldn’t see how to give more context for the changes in relation to previous configurations because the matrix of what models get which build-to-order options was just too complicated. If you want to price out different possibilities, I recommend opening several browser windows so you can compare the configurations side by side. MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air -- As with the iMac, Apple updated the processors in the MacBook and MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake processors running at higher clock speeds. That should improve performance, although likely not by that much. The MacBook Pro models also get improved graphics processing, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro models using Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 and 650, and the 15-inch models switching to Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs on top of Intel HD Graphics 630 and 640. You can now buy a MacBook with 16 GB of RAM, up from the previous limit of 8 GB, and Apple claims that the MacBook’s onboard SSD is up to 50 percent faster. That might make the MacBook a more attractive option, given that lackluster performance was one of its main disadvantages. Despite rumors to the contrary, the MacBook Air lives, but it sees the least change, replacing its stock 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with a 1.8 GHz model. It remains upgradeable to an Intel Core i7 running at 2.2 GHz. Although these changes are all positive, they do nothing to simplify the difficulty of choosing between the three models. Each falls into the three-dimensional graph of price, performance, and size in a different spot. You’ll have to decide what’s most important to you — cost, speed, or portability — and figure out which of Apple’s notebooks best fits your needs. As with the new iMac models, these updated notebooks are all available now. iMac Pro -- During the private media meeting in which Apple executives confessed to the company’s sins with regard to the Mac Pro, mention was made of pro-related announcements about the iMac coming this year. Apple has now revealed more of what that means, pulling back the curtains on the iMac Pro. Due in December 2017, the iMac Pro retains the same form factor of the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display, but swaps the brushed aluminum look for a space gray finish that extends to the Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, Magic Mouse 2, and an optional Magic Trackpad 2. The goal of the iMac Pro is to provide workstation-class performance within the iMac design. The hardest part of that is dealing with heat, because the iMac Pro will feature Intel Xeon processors in 8-core, 10-core, or 18-core configurations. Also playing into the necessary thermal architecture redesign is Apple’s use of a new Radeon Pro Vega GPU, which reportedly features a next-generation compute core and up to 16 GB of on-package high-bandwidth memory (HBM2). Apple says that the iMac Pro with Vega GPU delivers up to 11 teraflops of single-precision compute power for real-time 3D rendering and high frame rate VR. For half-precision computation that’s reportedly ideal for machine learning, the iMac Pro can deliver up to 22 teraflops of performance. (No, we don’t really have a sense of what that means, either, but Apple PR did a good job of making it sound impressive.) The iMac Pro will come with 32 GB of RAM by default, but for a machine in this class, the fact that it’s configurable to 64 GB or 128 GB is more important. A 1 TB SSD is also standard, with 2 TB and 4 TB SSDs as options. Unsurprisingly, the iMac Pro sports four Thunderbolt 3 ports, which enables it to drive up to two 5K displays and two high-performance RAID arrays at the same time. Other connectivity options mimic what’s on the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display now, with the exception of Ethernet. Instead of gigabit Ethernet, the iMac Pro will include 10 Gb Ethernet, which could be a big deal when transferring huge amounts of data between machines. How much will all this cost? A lot, with the base iMac Pro configuration starting at $4999. Apple claimed that a comparable workstation would cost about $7000, without a 5K display. Even still, given the high price of large SSDs and RAM, we anticipate that a loaded iMac Pro will easily meet or exceed that $7000 mark. But that won’t stop the audience for the iMac Pro. If you need the maximum performance from a Mac, the iMac Pro will provide it. At least until a new Mac Pro makes its debut, and many of those who live and die by the teraflop won’t want to wait.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

The MacBook and MacBook Pro also get new CPUs, the MacBook becomes more expandable, and the MacBook Air receives a small speed bump. The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michael E. Cohen   2017-06-06 10:48 And if anyone out there thinks the iMac Pro means that a Mac Pro ISN'T also coming, Apple's press release on the iMac Pro puts that misconception to rest: "In addition to the new iMac Pro, Apple is working on a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest-end, high-throughput system in a modular design, as well as a new high-end pro display." Reply Mackay Bell  2017-06-07 20:38 It seems that part of the reason they revealed that they were working on an expandable Mac Pro (and apologizing for the trash can version) is they wanted people to get excited about the iMac Pro, and not suck up all the air complaining about the lack of an expandable system. By getting that story out before the release, they could get a little more excitement going for the coming of the iMac Pro. Reply Alan Forkosh   2017-06-06 11:09 It's noteworthy that Apple didn't mention anything about the Touch Bar. As it stands now, Touch Bar is an orphan, present on only on the MacBook Pro line. It strikes me as something that can't really be considered a standard until there is a desktop version of it also--either a new keyboard or a standalone item to be paired with a keyboard. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 12:00 In fact, it turns out that Apple did release a new wireless Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. But not with a Touch Bar. Boo! http://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-has-a-new-wireless-magic-keyboard-with-a-full-numeric-keypad/amp/ Reply Paul Ellis  2017-06-06 13:53 The Touch Bar is a gimmick. It breaks all the rules of ergonomics and focus. It might possibly make some sense when positioned close the the screen, and therefore point of focus, on a laptop, but makes little sense for a desktop. If I were a developer, which thankfully I'm not, I wouldn't be wasting any time developing for it, and certainly not if I'd previously been stung by OpenDoc, QuickTime VR, etc. etc. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:57 I like what Apple is doing with the iMac and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assuming they'll make things right with the new Mac Pro once it finally arrives. The MBP seems fine. I still don't see what TouchBar is supposed to accomplish - I also think it's mainly a gimmick with poor ergonomics. Apple didn't spend any time on it at this WWDC. Does anybody think it might disappear during the next overhaul? I don't really get why Apple is keeping the MBA around instead of just trying to make an inexpensive entry-level MB instead. Since there is no inexpensive entry-level MB, I assume that means the MB is targeting the middle/high-end of the compact/light market. So with that in mind, why in the world did they not replace that USB-C with TB3? If this were a budget Mac at $999 targeted at schools and students, fine. But since this is a midrange Mac we're talking about, why leave it stuck with USB-C? Nothing TB3 offers can't be done with USB-C, but TB3 is just more versatile and it is no doubt the new standard across Macs - well almost, sigh. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:59 (cont.) My only real gripe on the Mac side is the Mac mini. How can Apple just let it sit there to die? Either kill it off already (so people know they'll have to go Hackintosh) or update it. But just leaving it sit there without a clear plan makes we wonder what message Apple is trying to send. It reminds me of the Mac Pro situation before pressure from pros and tech journalists forced Apple to take a stand. I see a lot of potential for the Mac mini, from cheap servers to simple office computers, offering a low-price entry point to the Mac universe, schools, home media servers, etc. I'm afraid all of that is "too techy" and not sexy enough for the new Apple. I really hope I'm wrong. I'm holding onto my trusty Core i5 Mac mini, but with its 4 GB of RAM (could be upgraded) and 500 GB HDD (could also be upgraded, but is that worth it?) its days are numbered even as my home media server. Reply Bertrand Morin  2017-06-06 19:27 Is the memory (RAM) upgradable in the iMac 27in. by the user, as it wad older iMac… Reply James  2017-06-08 07:58 Did you read the product page for the 27" iMac? If not, go back and read it again. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-07 01:08 Is there any indication yet if the new iMac models (both 21.5" and 27") have user upgradable RAM? There is some wording on the Apple page that you can upgrade the 21.5" RAM after purchase through Apple or an authorized dealer, but it not 100% clear. And the page for the 27" is completely silent. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 09:59 The 21.5-inch models are NOT user-upgradeable, but the 27-inch model is. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191 Reply Bob  2017-06-08 18:02 Scott, MacRumors reports "iFixit has published a teardown of the new 4K 21.5-inch iMac, which reveals that – surprisingly – Apple's smallest all-in-one desktop machine has both removable RAM and a Kaby Lake processor that's not soldered onto the logic board." Note though, updating is an involved process. Certainly not user-replaceable by the average owner. But at least users aren't irrevocably locked in to what they originally purchased. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:28 I guess that I should have been a little more accurate with my question. I was more trying to determine if the RAM in both the 21.5" and 27" is upgradable, whether user upgradable as officially supported by Apple or even just upgradable but only officially by Apple or an Apple ASP (which means a user can do it if they are afraid to open up their Mac and maybe end up having Apple not provide support under the warranty if there is a problem). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:32 Good to know. I am not afraid to open up a Mac even for supposedly no user upgradable items at least officially in Apple's eyes. On my original 2006 MBP, I replaced a fan that was squealing due to the bearings and also upgrade the WiFi card, neither of which was consider user upgradable by Apple (certainly not the fan at least...not sure about the WiFi card). It likely would not matter as if I were in the market for an iMac (I am currently not), I would be going for a 27" model anyway. I am kind of used to the 27" Thunderbolt display that I have, so going back to what would seem like a freakishly small (to me) 21.5" screen would not really be an option. Reply Simon  2017-06-08 18:20 I wonder if the non-retina 21.5" iMac will have the same SO-DIMM slots? I guess the replaceable CPU is a given because apparently Intel does not offer desktop Kaby Lake with BGA (i.e. soldered).

So far, Microsoft says, the attack (which uses a variant of 2016's Platinum file transfer tool) has only been spotted in Asia, and fortunately it can only be exploited if an attacker tricks a sysadmin into providing administrative credentials. As Redmond points out, the new wrinkle doesn't create a new attack vector, but rather it “misused AMT SOL within target networks that have already been compromised to keep communication stealthy and evade security applications”. The feature being misused is AMT's Serial-over-LAN (SOL), attractive to an attacker because it's independent of the host operating system. It could be spotted by a separate standalone firewall, but it wouldn't be picked up by a host-based firewall. Another attraction to an attacker is that the embedded processor is designed to provide remote out-of-band capabilities like power cycling and KVM, even if the main processor is powered down. SOL can also communicate over the LAN if a physical connection exists, regardless of whether networking is enabled on the host. Microsoft also offers the hypothesis that if Platinum infected a system that didn't have AMT enabled, it could use stolen admin credentials and the technology's host-based provisioning to fire up a subset of AMT (including SOL) using its own credentials. Whether using stolen credentials and full ATM access, or the limited access offered by a host-based provisioned machine, Platinum then exploited SOL to transfer malware over the LAN. If you can exploit AMT's serial-over-LAN channel, the operating system won't see you Microsoft says it worked with Intel to analyse the Platinum variant, and says Windows Defender ATP can detect the activity. Intel's AMT got unwelcome attention in May, when critical vulnerabilities in the management technology first discovered in March became public. ® Tips and corrections 6 Comments MORE Microsoft Intel Vulnerability Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Microsoft raises pistol, pulls the trigger on Windows 7, 8 updates for new Intel, AMD chips Don't want to use Windows 10?

That allows digital signage system integrators / network operators to faster deploy systems in higher volumes at lower cost. In addition, the interchangeable modular and cableless plug-in design also simplifies the device installation, usage, maintenance and upgrade by simply plugging or replacing a pluggable player, instead of an entire display unit as well as a web of complicated cables. Quanmax OPS-2002 and OPS-2050 Series, two new models of OPS-compliant digital signage players, are exactly the products to satisfy this segment of digital signage business. But more than that, they offer full for 4K Ultra HD content playback in processing / graphics performance, memory transfer rate and display refresh rate. First of all, a powerful enough processing and graphics chip is the most essential factor to drive 4K Ultra HD video playback. Both players are powered by 6th Generation Intel® Skylake Core™ i processors with higher-performance GPU integrated inside, more than capable of handling 4K resolution. The difference is that OPS-2002 is integrated with an U-Series ultra-low-power processor while OPS-2050 Series is powered by a HQ-Series high-performance-graphics quad-core processor more suitable for heavy usage. In addition, the data transfer speed should be considered as well since insufficient bandwidth may result in video lag and discount the effect delivered to the audience. two players are equipped with the next-generation data transfer interfaces, including DDR4 SO-DIMM memory sockets for providing more bandwidth to data-heavy 4K content to eliminate laggy playback, and HDMI 2.0 video output interface for delivering 4K video output at a smooth fast 60 frames per second. (The rate of 4K is limited to 24 frames per second in HDMI 1.4.) The three features mentioned above can create more lifelike viewing experience to grab customers' attention and help drive sales effortlessly. Finally, remote management is another critical issue especially for large-scale area-wide digital signage deployment, for example, within a mall, a chain, a corporate, a city, a country or even multiple countries. That allows administrators to create, schedule and publish the contents or maintain, repair and update the software from a remote location, which can reduce the need for costly human on-site support. In addition to 2 GbE LAN ports, both players reserves mPCIe and/or M.2 slots for Wi-Fi / 3G / 4G wireless networking connection.

THE SPIN12 hours ago Trump Lawyer’s Response: Comey Made ‘Unauthorized Disclosures’ Yuri Gripas/Reuters President Trump’s personal lawyer on Thursday responded to James Comey’s Senate Intel testimony by going after the former FBI chief for his “unauthorized disclosures” of “privileged information” in feeding his memos to the press after his firing. “Mr. Comey’s testimony... makes clear that the president never sought to impede the investigation into attempted Russian interference in the 2016 election,” the president’s attorney Marc Kasowitz said in the public statement. Despite Comey testifying that Trump demanded loyalty from him during a private meeting, Kasowitz said it never happened, further adding that “the Office of the President is entitled to expect loyalty from those who are serving in an administration, and, from before this President took office to this day, it is overwhelmingly clear that there have been and continue to be those in government who are actively attempting to undermine this administration with selective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications. Mr. Comey has now admitted that he is one of these leakers.” He continued: “Comey admitted that he unilaterally and surreptitiously made unauthorized disclosures to the press of privileged communications with the President... Comey admitted that he leaked to friends his purported memos of these privileged conversations, one of which he testified was classified. He also testified that immediately after he was terminated he authorized his friends to leak the contents of these memos to the press in order to “prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” The leak of the Comey memos, Kasowitz concluded, “appears to [sic] entirely retaliatory.” Read it at USA Today Cheat Sheet ® 1.

The chipmaker’s original plan was to jump from the 14nm Skylake directly to the 10nm Cannon Lake as per its tried-and-true Tick-Tock release cadence. Unfortunately, that’s not how things played out. Manufacturing difficulties forced Intel in mid-2015 to delay the launch of Cannon Lake and ultimately introduce a third family of CPUs built on the 14nm process to bridge the gap. Thus, Kaby Lake was born. Cannon Lake is still “on track” according to a fresh tweet from Intel on Thursday. Specifics weren’t mentioned although one could reasonably assume that Intel means it’s still on track with its guidance to manufacture Cannon Lake in the second half of 2017 (with volume shipments coming in the first half of 2018). Intel’s tweet also noted that they’ve now “taped in” Ice Lake, its second-generation 10nm product. According to The Guru of 3D, a tape-in is the second to last stage in the design process of a chip. This is in contrast to the tape-out where the physical production of the initial engineering batch wafer samples takes place. Curiously enough, Intel’s tweet didn’t mention Coffee Lake, the fourth 14nm CPU family that’s expected later this year (perhaps as early as August). It is believed that this family will offer additional minor refinements to the 14nm process, much like Kaby Lake did over Skylake.

ASUS has done a good job of improving the Republic of Gamers' product stack from one that only sat at the top of the hill to one that is available to even the budget conscious buyer. ROG is not just a motherboard line now, with a full set of products from motherboards to video cards, monitors, peripherals, and even complete systems. The ROG product stack is as wide as the day is long and just keeps getting better. The ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming motherboard is built for use with Intel's Core I7 socket 2011-v3 processors, like the 10 core i7 6950X. By no means a budget board at $319, the fact that this is an Extreme Series processor-based product, it's not that bad overall. Packed full of ROG specific features, such as AURA lighting, Gamer's Guardian, exceptional connectivity, Supreme FX audio, an amazing software suite, and one click overclocking, it's tough to argue with the package that ASUS has put together. Let's dig a bit deeper into the ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming motherboard to find out if it can live up to the expectations of the ROG brand.   ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Closer Look: The front of the package features an image of the motherboard with the STRIX branding in bold, RGB coloring running diagonally across the box. You know this is an ROG offering by the small logo in the top right corner. Along the bottom you see that AURA lighting is a supported feature, with the board supporting multi-GPU strategies from both the green and red teams. As an X99-based board, the ROG Strix X99 Gaming is built around the Intel X99 PCH and 2011-v3 socket. The back side of the package hits on the basic specifications of the board along with some of the ROG specific features, like SafeSlot, AURA lighting headers, and an exceptional connectivity feature set.     Inside the box are two layers that include the board on the top level, with the accessory bundle taking up residency underneath. Much like every other ROG offering I have looked at, the Strix X99 Gaming accessory bundle is a significant part of the package with both the documentation and hard parts. You get a user's manual, driver and software disc, data cable labels, fan hub, and STRIX specific decals. The hardware includes six data cables using both straight and 90 degree ends, wire ties for improved wire management, Q-Connector, Q-Shield, CPU installation tool, and a 2x2 dual-band 2.4/5GHz antenna for up to 867Mbit/s* wireless transfer speeds.        Using an all-black theme with red accents, the board makes a good backdrop for the LED accents on the Q-Slots and the PCH heat sink. Designed for use with Intel's Broadwell-E processors, like the Core i7 6950X, and DDR4 memory, the board uses ASUS' own 2011-v3 OC socket. A plastic shroud covers the I/O connectivity and the Supreme FX sound solution creating a strong visual on the board. The back side of the board is fairly clean, with only an ROG labeled IC and heat sink over the Digi+ VRM components. The ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming is an ATX form factor motherboard that should easily fit in any chassis supporting the form factor.     First up, we start with the rear I/O area. The USB BIOS Flashback button is at the top, or left in this view. This button is used to flash the BIOS with minimal hardware loaded into the motherboard. Rear connectivity starts with a quartet of X99 PCH controlled USB 2.0 ports paired up with a dual function keyboard/mouse compatible PS/2 port. An Intel I218V-controlled Gigabit LAN port provides your hardwired network connectivity. ASUS has its own LAN Guard protection system using ESD guards to offer up a 1.9X-greater tolerance to static electricity and 2.5X-greater protection (up to 15KV) against current surges. Underneath the LAN port are four USB 3.0 ports. One is controlled by the Intel X99 PCH and three by an ASMedia controller. USB 3.1 connectivity consists of a single Type A and single Type C port. Wireless network connectivity is handled by an 802.11ac WiFi with 2x2 dual-band 2.4/5GHz antennas for up to 867Mbit/s* transfer speeds that supports the latest MU-MIMMO clients. Wrapping things up are the analog and digital sound output connections for the Supreme FX 8-channel high definition sound solution. ESD Guards have long been used on all of the inbound connection points on the PCB to prevent a current surge from static electricity from taking out any of the installed hardware. Hidden between the top PCIe slot and the furthest left Q-DIMM slot is a 4-pin high amp fan header that supports fan loads of up to three amps. There are a total of four 16x PCIe slots and two PCIe 1x slots to cover slotted expansion cards, like video cards and PCIe-based solid state drives. Slot 1, 4, and 6 are your PCIe 3.0 slots, while slots 2, 3, and 5 are your PCIe 2.0 slots. Up to 3-Way multi-GPU solutions are supported in the 16x PCIe 3.0 slots when using a 40 PCIe lane processor, like the Core i7 6950X or 5960X. The primary graphics slots are protected by part of ASUS' Gamer's Guardian package called "SafeSlot." A SafeSlot is a PCIe 16x slot used for a primary graphics card that has a metal shield that provides greater shear resistance and retention force. In front of the PCIe slots and along the bottom left corner of the PCB is where you will find the bulk of the hardware used for the ASUS Awesome Supreme FX audio solution. ASUS uses its isolated circuitry solution to ensure that you get the best possible audio solution without any interference from the electronics on the rest of the PCB, with split layers covering the left and right channels. On the ROG Strix X99 Gaming, ASUS chose to use the tried and true ALC1150 8-channel audio processor covered by EMI shielding. Once again, Japanese Nichicon audio grade capacitors are used to deliver exceptional sound quality out of this 115dB signal-to-noise ratio rated version of ASUS' Supreme FX audio.        The bottom of the PCB is pretty busy. From the left are the Nichicon capacitors and op-amps for the sound solution, the analog audio front panel audio connection, serial port, AURA RGB LED lighting header, power and reset buttons, and the Q-Code diagnostic LED. That last one is an ROG staple. Next is the TPM header, a USB 3.0 header, and the ROG Extension header for use with multiple ROG accessories. The right side of this connection doubles as a USB 2.0 header to give you the potential to connect up to four ports with the USB 2.0 header next to the ROG connection. The front panel header is next. You can hook the front panel wiring up directly to the header, or you can use the included Q-Connector for an easier path to installing the front panel wiring. The right hand corner is really packed with one of the PWM fan headers, the 5-pin fan extension card header, CLR CMOS jumper, Thunderbolt connection, EZ XMP switch, over voltage jumper, and a header for use with a thermister for thermal monitoring. Last, but not least, is the M.2 slot that supports PCIe Gen 3.0 x 4 NVMe drive solutions.     Another PWM controlled fan header starts the connectivity on the right side of the PCB. Storage options include the M.2 slot that supports type 2242/2260/2280/22110 devices and a U.2 slot that supports PCIe Gen 3.0 x 4 NVMe drives. Six SATA 6Gb/s ports and one SATA Express connection are pulled from the X99 chipset  and support RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10 configurations with Intel® Rapid Storage Technology. The SATA Express port can double as an additional pair of SATA 6Gb/s ports. A second USB 3.0 port is up next and is an uprght connection instead of  being laid over on the side for a smoother look when wiring up the chassis. It is not in a position to interfere with a video card in the top slot, so this really comes down to a preference. Another pair of SATA 6Gb/s port controlled by the X99 PCH only adds additional drive connectivity. Another of the six PWM or DC mode fan headers is next to the 24-pin ATX power connection. At the top corner is the Mem OK button that can get your system started if you are having memory compatibility problems by running the system through a few algorithms that change the voltage and settings to get a bootable solution with the installed memory. Between the 24 pin power connection and the first Q-DIMM slot are a series of bright diagnostic LEDs that can clue you in to where the boot sequence is seeing a stoppage when you cannot boot the system.      The top of the PCB is usually a barren spot with the top of the cooling solution, a couple power connections, and fan headers. That's just we get here with the 4 and 8-pin EATX 12v power connections, as well as the Extreme Engine DIgi+ components under the robust aluminum heat sink. One of the Digi+ VRM controllers sits to the left of the 8-pin EATX power plug with several of the 10K black capacitors that are part of the Digi+VRM circuitry. The three fan headers are designed for specific purposes and are able to be controlled via PWM or DC options in the BIOS. Additionally, they can be managed through ASUS' Fan Xpert 4 software. The left two fan headers are the CPU optional fan header and the CPU fan header, while the right hand 4-pin header is used to support water pumps on the latest AIO water cooling solutions.      Eight Q-DIMM slots surround the socket and support quad channel memory packages of up to 128GB of DDR4 3333(O.C.)/3300(O.C.)/3000(O.C.)/2800(O.C.)/2666(O.C.)/2400(O.C.)/2133 MHz Non-ECC, Un-buffered Memory. ASUS uses its T-Topology to deliver equal length traces to each slot to reduce electronic noise and provide improved overclocking margins. ASUS uses a special OC socket that includes a few more pins in the socket connected to an ASUS specific circuit to improve DDR4 memory overclocking margins. Additionally, these extra pins help reduce voltage and allow the use of a cache bus voltage again to drive higher overclocking margins. ASUS makes use of an 8-phase all-digital VRM circuit managed by the Extreme Engine Digi+ controllers to provide a clean, consistent power supply to the CPU and DRAM. The chokes use a finned design to improve cooling when the power circuits are hit hardest. Two heat sinks are used to cool the PCH and Digi+VRM. At the top of the board is an angular aluminum part, while the PCH heat sink is flat and features an RGB LED lighting system that is used with the AURA lighting controls to display one of 10 different lighting schemes.     Visually, the board does not feature all the shrouds and flash out of the box that the Rampage V 10th Anniversary Edition does, but it does put on one hell of a light show once you hit the power button. Let's see how well the ROG Strix X99 Gaming does in the performance and overclocking testing. --- Article Quick Nav ---1 » ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming: Introduction & Closer Look2 » ASUS ROG Strix CX99 Gaming Closer Look: Programs & Applications3 » ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Closer Look: The BIOS4 » ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming: Specifications & Features5 » ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: Setup & Overclocking6 » ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: PCMark 8, SiSoft Sandra 20167 » ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: Cinebench R15, X.265, AIDA 648 » ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: CrystalDiskMark, ATTO 2.479 » ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: iPerf, RMAA10 » ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: Gaming11 » ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming: Conclusion Next page » Article Index Email Link Print Article ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming: Introduction & Closer Look ASUS ROG Strix CX99 Gaming Closer Look: Programs & Applications ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Closer Look: The BIOS ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming: Specifications & Features ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: Setup & Overclocking ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: PCMark 8, SiSoft Sandra 2016 ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: Cinebench R15, X.265, AIDA 64 ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: CrystalDiskMark, ATTO 2.47 ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: iPerf, RMAA ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Testing: Gaming ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming: Conclusion Related Products ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Review Recent Articles Serious Statistics Review ASUS ROG Strix X99 Gaming Review ECS LIVA Z Review VIVO CASE-V07 Review Galactic Civilizations III: Crusade Review ECS LIVA Z Plus Review Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion - Producer Interview XFX Radeon RX 580 8GB GTS Black Edition Review MSI GTX 1080 Ti Armor 11G Review XFX RX 460 4GB Slim Single Review » all reviews Forum Posts Time to sell those old AMD cards!

Late-night hosts have taped the day’s programs and are about to get their crack at Comey’s performance, which had held the country captive for nearly three hours. Related Donald Trump 'Not A Liar,' Says Sarah Huckabee Sanders After James Comey Testimony Says Otherwise The Comey Show was a barn-burner. It had Russian hookers, and a murdered saint. Comey called Trump a liar. Trump called Comey a leaky liar. A good time was had by all. Right-wing news outlets pronounced Trump the hands-down winner.  More liberal media called it a very bad day for Trump and a big win for Comey, handing him special-merit badges for his “Lordy, I hope there are tapes!” gag, and for explaining he had not wanted to talk to reporters camped out at the end of his driveway after his firing because “I worried that it would be like feeding seagulls at the beach.” Fantasy casting already is underway, with Kevin Smith suggesting Nathan Fillion is the only possible person to play Comey in the inevitable premium-cable movie, while others favored Kyle Chandler, Vince Vaughn, or, yes, Tom Cruise. Pundits who compared this to the Watergate and the McCarthy hearings did not oversell. The former FBI director’s mesmerizing account of his interactions with Trump already had been forecast to be the stuff, ratings-wise, of the M*A*S*H finale and latter-day Super Bowls rumored to have broken sewage systems in major markets as viewers glued to their seats throughout the proceeding finally all got up simultaneously to relieve themselves. It was so big the broadcast networks dumped their daytime fare to cover. So big that Nielsen plans to issue a collective audience stat on Friday, an exercise usually reserved for presidential inaugurations and State of the Union Addresses among Washington-set events. In maybe the most stunning revelation, Comey revealed that, after he was sacked and Trump tweeted at him ominously… James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! …Comey woke up at 2 in the morning and realized leaking to the press was just the right touch, turning over memos he’d written about his conversations with Trump to a pal, so they could be leaked to the New York Times. Comey testified he’d hoped that might trigger appointment of a Special Counsel to investigate. Walking up to Thursday’s The Comey Show, Trump flew to Cincinnati to celebrate Infrastructure Week on Wednesday. While Trump had his back turned, Comey dramatically announced to the world that he had been fired because Trump had demanded his loyalty after informing him meaningfully that loads of people wanted his job, and had pressed him to drop a probe into Trump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and had repeatedly pressured him to publicly declare Trump was not under investigation – and, most tantalizingly, had insisted to Comey he did not hang out with Russian hookers. Comey pulled off this stunt with flair, asking the intel committee to release to the public the remarks he’d send them that were billed as his opening comments for Thursday’s committee appearance. RelatedRead James Comey’s Opening Remarks To Senate Intelligence Committee But Comey chose not to perform those seven gripping pages at the top of Thursday’s The Comey Show. Instead, looking as attractively haggard as Jimmy Stewart in his big scene in Mr Smith Goes To Washington, the ousted FBI director opened with a passionate message: In sacking him, Trump “chose to defame me and the FBI saying the organization was in disarray and poorly led” and that “he had lost confidence in its leader.” “Those were lies, plain and simple…I’m so sorry the FBI workforce had to hear that,” Comey added, ever more Capra-esquely. “I want the American people to know this truth: The FBI is honest, the FBI is strong and the FBI is, and always will be, independent,” concluded the guy Trump called a “showboat” and “grandstander” to Lester Holt – and a “nut job” to the Russians, when he had them over to the Oval Office. Saying he would like to take a moment to address his former FBI colleagues – since Trump had sacked him while he was recruiting at FBI HQ in Los Angeles and not allowed the chance to say goodbye to them in person – Comey said into the TV cameras: “I am sorry I did not get the chance to say goodbye to you properly.” He called his service with them, “the honor of my life.” REX/Shutterstock “I will miss it for the rest of my life. Thank you for standing watch, and thank you so much for doing so much good for this country.” In one of the most highfalutin moments of the made-for-TV testimony, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) asked Comey if, when a President of the United States in the Oval Office says something like “I hope” or “I suggest” in re knocking off the Flynn probe, “do you take that as a directive?” “Yes, yes, it rings in my ear as kind of ‘Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?’ ” Comey responded, to the delight of King, who chimed in, “I was just going to quote that in 1170, December 29, Henry II said, ‘Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?’ and the next day he was killed, Thomas Becket.” “That’s exactly the same situation,” King added enthusiastically. “We’re thinking along the same lines,” he beamed. After Thursday’s testimony wrapped, Trump’s personal lawyer had held a presser to call Comey a leaky liar, and called for Comey to be investigated over his having leaked what he insisted were privileged docs to the press. Marc Kasowitz also insisted the New York Times began quoting leaked intel before Trump’s tweet, though CNN fact-checked that one and declared it Fake News. And, anyway, Comey got in the final punch of Thursday when, during the closed hearing with the committee that followed his public testimony, the senators learned of an alleged undisclosed third meeting between Trump’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Russians. Sessions, you’ll recall, recused himself from Russia probes after failing to disclose two other meetings with Russians that occurred when he was part of Trump’s election effort. During his public testimony, Comey took some heat for not blowing the whistle when Trump buttonholed him and said he’d like the Flynn probe dropped. Comey said he had gone to the AG, but had gotten stiffed, declining to discuss Sessions further. In the closed hearings, senators learned the bureau is investigating whether Sessions met with Russians a third time, based on intercepted Russia-to-Russia communications. The Comey Show ended with a bang as news outlets began describing Sessions in terms of being Trump’s key “problematic” figure.

Updated June 8, 2017 10:35AM SHARE ALSO SEE Server Data Center IDC Cloud Computing Intel Skylake Hewlett-Packard Dell IBM Slower investment in servers by the likes of Facebook, Amazon, and Google is causing a big slowdown in the data center server market, according to a new report by International Data Corp. (IDC). Vendor revenue has dropped to $11.8 billion in the first quarter of this year, a decline of 4.6 percent year-over-year, according to IDC’s latest Worldwide Quarterly Server Tracker. Much of that slowdown in investment is being driven by customers deciding to wait until Intel's new Skylake server processors start arriving in new server models sometime in the second half of the year, IDC said. Cloudy, with a Chance of Shifting Deployment However, the wait for new high-end chips is not the only trend dragging down server sales. The tech industry is also seeing a major shift from onsite data center deployments to cloud service companies selling infrastructure as a service. With more companies opting to use cloud services rather than building their own data centers, there may be less overall demand for new servers. This shift in the way server resources are deployed is also causing much greater consolidation among server purchasers, with fewer companies now responsible for the lion's share of server sales. In fact, according to IDC, a single customer bought more than 10 percent of all servers that were shipped in the first quarter, representing approximately a quarter of a million units. IDC said it suspected such a large investment by a single company indicated that the purchaser is is investing heavily in infrastructure to expand its capabilities as a cloud service provider. But the move to the cloud is not the only factor having an impact on server sales. DRAM pricing issues have also had an effect on demand for high-end server systems, leading the drop in demand for the sector with a year-over-year decline in revenue of 29 percent, down to $1 billion. No Change in the Forecast Hewlett Packard Enterprise claimed the top spot by revenue among server makers, generating $2.86 billion in sales in the first quarter for a 24.2 percent share of the market, according to IDC. But that's down 15.8 percent from the same period last year. Dell, which came in second in sales for the quarter with $2.37 billion, claimed 20.1 percent of the market. Dell was the only major server company to see revenue climb year-over-year, up 4.7 percent from last year. Cisco, IBM, and Lenovo were all ranked in a statistical tie for third place. IBM suffered the worst drop in sales year-over-year, facing a decline of 34.7 percent to $745 million and its market share plummeted from 9.2 percent to 6.3 percent. IDC said the results for the quarter were perfectly in line with its forecasts, and that it expects continued long-term declines in high-end system revenue for the foreseeable future.

At a recent Gigabyte event, overclockers were able to hit a whopping 7.5GHz with the Core i7-7740K*. That’s the upcoming Kaby Lake chip on Skylake-X’s platform. That wasn’t all. The overclockers paired the board with Corsair DDR4-4333, a Corsair AX 1500i power supply, and Gigabyte’s X299-SOC Champion motherboard. The CPU managed to set world records in 3DMark03, 3DMark06, and Aquamark, which is a bit like saying that a modern-day PC managed to set CPU benchmark records in the original Doom, Doom II, and Quake. Granted, it’s not quite that bad, but the reason a lot of these benchmarks use vastly older tests is almost certainly because they respond to CPU clock gains particularly well. Nothing wrong with that, but that’s why you don’t see more modern benchmark results. The caveat, of course, is that it takes liquid helium, with its -250C temperature, to hit these kinds of targets. There’s a diminishing marginal return at the extreme end of overclocking, where the amount of cooling you need to apply is inversely proportional to the gain from applying it. Lab501 did a comparison of the Core i7-4790K and the Pentium G3258 a few years back, to see how they would handle under overclocking pressure. These are just test results for single CPUs, so neither should be taken as being the absolute best (or worst) overclock you might experience with these parts. For our purposes, however, that’s irrelevant. What matters is the temperature at which these overclock figures are being hit. Air, Air Xtreme, and water all-in-one (also referred to as a closed loop liquid cooler, or CLLC) can’t bring the CPU temperature below the ambient temperature of either the air in the room or the water in the liquid cooler. To do that, you have to add below-ambient cooling to the system, and that’s exactly what Lab501 did with its “water extreme” results. To quote the site: How do we get under 0 oC with a watercooling rig, you might ask? Good question. Instead of using a radiator, we will be using a regular solid thermal bag (the ones you use when you go to a picnic to keep your beer cold) and in that we will put our thermal agent, which is a mix of water, ice and antifreeze. The mix of water with ice and antifreeze can get down to – 10 / – 20 oC (depending on how much ice do you use) so we can talk about a first step into extreme cooling. That also means that we have to start thinking about insulation, because condensation will occur when we go down bellow 0 oC. When using an AIO cooler, the load temp on the Pentium G3258 was 99C. Using dry ice, load temperature under identical circumstances was 10C. That’s a huge shift in temperature for a relatively small (1.16x) change in frequency. We can’t compare the LN2 results, unfortunately, because the site stopped running Prime95 and resorted to only testing Super Pi. This makes the last data point in the graph invalid, because it’s fundamentally comparing a different scenario. But the point is made — even if the LN2 data were accurate, the gains from using LN2 (and bringing the CPU temperature down as low as -120C) are only 20 percent more than the gains from the “Air Extreme” cooler. With -250C liquid helium and what were almost certainly ideal-case binned CPUs to drive the event, it’s not surprising Intel and Gigabyte managed to smash overclocking records. But it’s also not something that end-users can reasonably duplicate at home. To make a long story short: As interesting as results like this are, they don’t actually tell us very much about how chips will overclock in conventional systems or when using the equipment that normal overclockers are likely to use. The amount of energy you have to dump into the cooling system to hit extreme temperatures grows significantly as clock rates rise, from simple air cooling, all the way up to dry ice, LN2, and beyond. Single-stage freon units are probably the highest-end equipment it’s reasonable to deploy on a high-end CPU. Anything past that, and you’ll be constantly adding coolant to the system to keep the temperature low. And all of this ignores that CPUs are fundamentally not designed to run at such low temperatures, or the high voltages required to break overclocking records. There’s little evidence that slapping a modest OC on a CPU meaningfully shortens its life, but the same can’t be said for the chips that get used at these overclocking events. *–Note:  We reached out to Intel about whether or not the CPU Gigabyte tested should be referred to as a 7740K or a 7740X. The 7740K branding on this chip means Gigabyte is using an engineering sample for its test results. The retail versions of the CPU will be identified as 7740X.

Connor Abbott Is Valve's Latest Linux Graphics Driver Developer Written by Michael Larabel in Valve on 8 June 2017 at 07:06 PM EDT. 4 Comments Valve has hired another prominent open-source graphics driver contributor. The name Connor Abbott may not immediately ring a bell with most of you, but as diehard Phoronix readers will know, he's the one that started contributing to the Lima graphics driver (ARM Mali reverse-engineered) while being a high school student a number of years back. He's presented at FOSDEM, developed the NIR intermediate representation now used by Intel and other Mesa drivers, he developed NIR while he was an intern at Intel fresh out of high school, previously had the Flatland IR proposal, and has also been involved with SPIR-V as the IR used by Vulkan and OpenCL 2.1+. Quite a number of accomplishments for this young developer. His latest achievement, as noted by a sharp-eyed Phoronix reader, is that he's now working for Valve. Connor appears to be on Valve's team that has been working on the open-source Linux graphics drivers. He hasn't formally announced his new position, but his latest Mesa patches are coming from a Valve Software email address. He does appear to still be attending university, so this may be his new summer job. Update: I've been able to confirm Abbott is indeed working at Valve as a summer job/internship while he will be going back to university in the fall. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Roston - Jun 8, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Intel subsidiary Wind River has announced a new collaboration with The Ohio State University, Transportation Research Center, and the City of Dublin in Ohio to further progress with self-driving cars and related autonomous technologies. The collaboration will happen in the Columbus region, according to a statement from Wind River, and will involve, among other things, testing ’emerging technologies’ with the goal of figuring out how these cars can be used alongside infrastructure for the betterment of communities. The planned collaboration will include the testing of communication between both vehicles with other vehicles and vehicles with nearby infrastructure. The team will also work with related technologies, such as smart sensing, smart mapping, and connected cockpit software, as well as the data collection necessary for these technologies to work best. Overall, Wind River explains that the collaboration’s main goal for its initial phase will be both the development and the testing of self-driving cars that they call rolling laboratories. An important part of the collaboration and testing will involve the 33 Smart Corridor, a span of 35 miles of highway that run between East Liberty north of Columbus and the city of Dublin. This area is being fitted with high-capacity fiber optic cable so that researchers can get data from sensors positioned along the road. The fiber optic is being installed by the state’s Department of Transportation, which is one part of many who are working together to further these technologies. Wind River explains that this corridor will be a vital part of testing autonomous technologies that will eventually go live on roads around the world. Also utilized with be the Transportation Research Center’s 7.5-mile high-speed oval and its 4,500 acres of road courses. Wind River’s Marques McCammon discussed the new collaboration recently, saying: The Central Ohio region is an emerging hub for smart city and smart vehicle technologies, and our unique ensemble approach—uniting minds from academia, the public sector, and the tech industry—can set a standard for how communities can innovate mobility and use the learnings to impact vehicle development and deployment best practices. To realize autonomous driving for the masses, a variety of players must come together with an aligned understanding.

Trent Lott in 1996 to “bring a little southern charm to the Capitol.” A few years after inventing this great holiday, Lott resigned as Senate Republican leader after publicly revealing himself to be a hugely racist Strom Thurmand stan, but the tradition has, for some reason, cheerily carried on, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein—ranking member of the Intel Committee—will not be stopped from donning her favorite lightweight cotton suit. Nobody else on the Intel Committee appears to be wearing seersucker today, but that’s fine—more seersucker for Sen. Feinstein, assholes! Louisiana Sen.

Susan Collins during Thursday’s Senate Intel hearing, former FBI Director James Comey revealed that after Trump published a tweet indicating that he had recordings of conversations they’d had, he decided to leak the contents of his memo in the hopes that a special prosecutor would be appointed. “Did you give copies of those memos to anyone outside of the Department of Justice?” she asked. Advertisement “Yes,” Comey replied. He explained: “The president tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there’s not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn’t dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our original conversation, there might be a tape. So my judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square, so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter—didn’t do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” This, as the Washington Post has underlined, is a fairly unusual thing for someone in Comey’s position to do—though Comey’s position was beyond unusual—and demonstrates a rather extreme degree of concern (although Donald Trump, Jr., who has been tweeting heavily in his father’s notable absence, took it in a different, more deranged direction). The friend in question, the Post confirmed, is former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richmond, who leaked the contents of the memo to Michael Schmidt at the New York Times. Sponsored Meanwhile, the webpage for Columbia Law School’s faculty appears to have crashed.

There's also a cheaper 13-inch MacBook Pro with function keys starting at $1,299 with 128GB storage, compared to $1,499 for the previous base model. Beyond that, the 2017 MacBook Pro is nearly identical to the 2016 MacBook Pro in both design and other tech specs. The update arrives just eight months after Apple redesigned the MacBook Pro with features such as the Touch Bar, Touch ID, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a shallower keyboard with a second-generation butterfly mechanism. Prior to then, the MacBook Pro had gone over 500 days without an update. For prospective buyers of the 2017 MacBook Pro, here's how the new models stack up against the 2016 MacBook Pro. Mobile users: tap this link to view the full-size image Geekbench results suggest the 2017 MacBook Pro is up to 20 percent faster than the 2016 MacBook Pro in CPU performance, but the difference is likely lower in real-world usage and given the apparent optimizations that Apple has made to last year's MacBook Pro between its launch and now. Apple began accepting online orders for the new MacBook Pro on Monday, and delivery estimates currently range between June 12 and June 22 in the United States. The notebooks are also available today at most Apple Stores, and customers have the option to reserve a model for in-store pickup on Apple's website.

I think people are commenting on the fact that your internal storage is non-upgradable and you will have 128GB as your storage size for as long as you own this computer. When you are buying hardware of this price you would hope to use it for a while. 128GB is not that much storage, and if you do anything with HD or 4K Video your space will be gone before you know it. Also the OS and Programs get larger and larger every year. Next year 128gb will feel totally small as you try to install more applications and use them properly. IMHO 128GB is a joke and shouldn't be even a baseline option for a "high end" laptop. 256GB should be the Minimum.

Or add one goddam millemeter of thickness and make the battery as robust as it was on the 2015 macbook pro. But I know, nobody would buy a laptop that ridiculously thick.

By Mark Hachman Senior Editor, PCWorld | Jun 8, 2017 1:36 PM PT Table of Contents Pricing and release date Performance and battery life Frequently asked questions First impressions Specs and features Show More With the the Surface Pro, Microsoft reboots its flagship Surface product, arguably the leading 2-in-1 even if Microsoft’s now trying to call it a laptop (more on that later). It’s also shedding the numerical designations of prior products. If you’ve owned a Surface Pro 3 or Surface Pro 4, however, you already have a good idea of what Microsoft has in store for you with the Surface Pro.  We’ve assembled everything we know about the new Surface Pro: the price and release date, the specs, and (soon) what we think of it in our official review. We’ve also answered some of the questions we think you’ll have about Microsoft’s new device. Microsoft Microsoft wants you to call the Surface Pro a laptop, though the ‘lapability’ of the tablet’s kickstand has always been an issue. Plus, the keyboard isn’t included. Pricing and release date You can preorder the Surface Pro now. Though Microsoft hasn’t officially posted the release date, Microsoft says most SKUs will begin to ship on June 15, the same day as the Surface Laptop. (As of June 8, the two exceptions are the two most expensive Core i7 versions—the 16GB RAM/512GB SSD and the the 16GB RAM/1 TB SSD—which will ship on June 30.) The Surface Pro will launch in 26 markets—including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, India, Taiwan, and more. Our news story from the Surface Pro launch has many more details. [ Further reading: Our picks for best PC laptops ] Microsoft’s Surface products have never been cheap, and the Surface Pro’s base model is $100 more expensive than the base model for the Surface Pro 4. Keep in mind that the prices below include the Surface Pro tablet only. Microsoft doesn’t bundle it with any accessories at all, not even a keyboard, unless there’s a special promotion. Intel Core m3, Intel HD Graphics 615, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD: $799  Intel Core i5, Intel HD Graphics 620, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD: $999  Intel Core i5, Intel HD Graphics 620, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD: $1,299  Intel Core i7, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD: $1,599  Intel Core i7, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD: $2,199  Intel Core i7, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD: $2,699 Mark Hachman / IDG Microsoft’s Surface Pro Signature Type Cover ships in three colors. Accessory pricing Though you can use a Surface Pro as a simple tablet, you’ll almost certainly want to buy some of the accessories, all of which cost extra. Keyboard: We’ll start with the one everyone will want—a Type Cover keyboard. Microsoft offers two: the Surface Pro Signature Type Cover ($159), clad in fancy Alcantara fabric, and the primarily plastic Microsoft Surface Pro Type Cover ($129).  Pen: Unlike the Surface Pros 3 and 4, Microsoft doesn’t include a new Surface Pen, which costs $100 extra. Both the Pen and Signature Type Covers ship in three colors:  platinum, burgundy, and cobalt blue. The generic Surface Pro Type Cover is available only in black. Mouse: Though both Type Covers include a trackpad, an optional Surface Arc Mouse will be available at launch for $80. Surface Dock: The Surface Dock, a port expander which adds four additional USB ports and two miniDP connections, is $200. While it’s not available now, Microsoft says it will ship a version of the Surface Pro with integrated LTE later this year. A version with the new Windows 10 S operating system, rather than the usual Windows 10 Pro, is also planned. Mark Hachman / IDG Two of the optional Surface Arc Mice. Performance and battery life All of the Core i5 and Core i7 chips used in the new Surface Pro (2017) are from Intel’s most recent, seventh-generation (Kaby Lake) family of CPUs. Microsoft says the processors offer 20 percent more performance than the Surface Pro 4, 2.5 times more computing performance than the Surface Pro 3, and 1.7 times the compute power of Apple’s iPad Pro. Once we get a unit in for review, we’ll confirm those claims. Microsoft also says the Surface Pro will last for 13.5 hours of continuous video looping, up from 9 hours with the Surface Pro 4. Again, this needs to be tested, but it’s an impressive figure and just short of the 14.5 hours of battery life promised for the Surface Laptop. Frequently asked questions Microsoft’s reboot of the Surface Pro name follows Hollywood’s trend of “rebooting” movies, from Godzilla to Spider-Man to Ghostbusters. It’s all a bit confusing, so we’ll try to clear up some of the mysteries. Why isn’t it called the Surface Pro 5? Our understanding is that Microsoft wanted to refocus itself on the Surface Pro lineup, making a clean break from prior models. It forces us (and you) to use the awkward Surface Pro (2017) terminology, though.  Microsoft The Surface Pro’s kickstand can drop to 165 degrees, to what Microsoft calls “Studio mode.” Who should buy the Surface Pro (2017)? Two years ago, the Surface Pro would have been the tablet for the masses. Now, perhaps in an attempt to distance the Surface Pro (2017) from a struggling Windows tablet market, Microsoft’s calling this a “laptop,” even though the keyboard is an optional accessory. We wish Microsoft would let go of this baffling conceit. In any case, if you’re a mobile professional, the new Surface Pro may be for you.   What are PCWorld’s first impressions? After using it a scant few minutes at a briefing, I can say it seems to be a beefed-up Surface Pro 4. Slightly more rounded edges and more recessed cameras are barely noteworthy. I like the kickstand, which reclines a full 165 degrees. Microsoft calls this “Studio Mode” because it mimics the Surface Studio, the Surface Pro’s all-in-one cousin.  Basically, if you’ve used a Surface Pro 4, this will be familiar territory. But if you want a more traditional notebook, consider the Surface Book or Surface Laptop instead. How does the Surface Pro differ from the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Book, and the Surface Laptop? Surface Pro 4: The Surface Pro improves upon its predecessor in a few key ways. The updated Kaby Lake CPU boosts performance and battery life. The wider range of the kickstand adds functionality, including the ability to use the Surface Dial. Surface Laptop: If you’re looking for something comparable to the Surface Pro in a true notebook form factor, you should check out the Surface Laptop. Note that its operating system is the classroom-focused Windows 10 S, but it’s upgradable to the same Windows 10 Pro that the Surface Pro uses. Surface Book: Like the Surface Pro, the Surface Book is a two-in-one with a detachable keyboard. The Surface Book offers a lot more oomph, however, especially with the associated Performance Base. It’s the only Microsoft notebook or 2-in-1 with discrete graphics, too. How much does the Surface Pro (2017) cost? Prices range from $799 to $2,699, and that’s just for the tablet. You’ll probably want to buy either a Surface Pro Signature Type Cover ($159) or the Microsoft Surface Pro Type Cover ($129) as a keyboard, and then the optional $100 Surface Pen. A Surface Dock ($200) is another possibility if you want additional ports. First impressions The Surface Pro (2017) is a Surface Pro, plain and simple: tablet, magnetically-attached Type Cover keyboard, kickstand. If you were to put a Surface Pro next to a Surface Pro 4, about the only way to tell the difference would be to look at the attached Surface Pen, which lacks the clip of its predecessor. Mark Hachman / IDG The new Surface Pen (below) features 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, about double that of its predecessor (above). Even though I only had it in my hands for a few minutes, I was impressed by the greater range of the kickstand. I’m not sure potential buyers will care as much as I do about the fact that you can now use the Surface Dial peripheral onscreen, though it’s a nice touch. We’ll want to give it all a thorough examination once we get a review unit.  Specs and features While the Surface Book offers a bit more physical space to pack in battery and discrete GPUs, the Surface Pro maintains an emphasis on portability. The key upgrade for the Surface Pro (2017) refresh are the Intel Kaby Lake CPUs, which bring several fundamental improvements in speed and battery life. If you want something a bit slower and a lot cheaper, try the Core m model: The performance should be satisfactory for basic office tasks. CPU 1GHz Core m3-7Y30 2.6GHz Core i5-7300U (Kaby Lake) 2.5GHz Core i7-7660U (Kaby Lake) Memory Memory options will vary, depending on your choice of Surface Pro (2017). Note that there is no 8GB option for the Core i7 at this time. 4GB: Core m3 8 GB: Core m3 or Core i5 16 GB: Core i5 or Core i7 Storage Your SSD size will vary: 128GB (Core m, Core i5) 256 GB (Core i5, Core i7) 512 GB (Core i7) 1TB (Core i7) Graphics The Surface Pro offers only integrated graphics. Graphics performance will increase along with processor power:  Core m: Intel HD Graphics 615 Core i5: Intel HD Graphics 620 Core i7: Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 Display Corning Gorilla Glass 12.3-inch (diagonal) PixelSense Display Resolution: 2736x1824 pixels, 267 PPI 3:2 aspect ratio Surface Pen-enabled (sold separately) 10-point multi-touch Keyboard The new Surface Pro’s keyboard features 1.3mm of key travel, slightly less than the 1.5mm of travel used by the Surface Laptop. If you buy the Surface Pro Signature Type Cover, you’ll get an Alcantara-clad deck that's laser-cut to fit snugly around the keyboard keys, in either platinum, burgundy, or cobalt blue. Otherwise, you can buy a standard Type Cover, in black. Software  Though the Surface Pro (2017) uses Windows 10 Pro, Microsoft says a version of the Surface Pro (2017) will ship later on with Windows 10 S installed. Ports and connectivity Somewhat surprisingly, Microsoft has chosen to stick with its established Surface Connector for charging, rather than use USB-C. Supposedly, that’s for reasons of backward compatibility with existing Surface chargers, as well as in response to people who complained that the micro-USB-powered Surface 3 took forever to charge.  USB 3.0 Type A mini DisplayPort 3.5mm headphone jack Surface Connector for charging Wi-Fi: 802.11ac, IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n compatible Bluetooth 4.1 microSD card reader Mark Hachman / IDG The right side of the tablet houses the three main ports: the Surface connector, USB-A, and the microDP port. Like other Surface devices, a microSD slot hides behind the kickstand. Audio/visual (Unchanged since the Surface Pro 4) 5MP (front), Windows Hello-compatible 8MP (rear) Stereo microphones Stereo speakers Battery life At 13.5 hours, the battery life of the Surface Pro (2017) is just an hour shorter than the 14.5 hours claimed for the Surface Laptop. Microsoft bases its claims on video rundown tests, the same metric PCWorld uses. Exterior dimensions 11.50 x 7.9 x 0.33 inches Weight 2.37 pounds to 2.41 pounds, with Type Cover. The exact weight will vary by model. The Core m model is the lightest. Chassis Aluminum Colors The Surface Pro (2017) ships in just one color.

Related Perfect Casting Helps Make 'The Comey Show' A Hit Trump’s attorney returned the favor this afternoon. Trump never told Mr. Comey to “let go” the FBI’s investigation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, nor did Trump tell Comey he expected Comey to pledge his “loyalty” to Trump.  POTUS’s outside counsel Marc Kasowitz said at a news conference at which he declined to take questions. The attorney also suggested launch of an investigation after Comey said in testimony he had caused to be leaked to the NYT his notes about a conversation. Comey said he gave his memo to a friend after Trump tweeted about recordings of their conversation. Kasowitz claimed NYT began quoting from the memo before Trump’s tweet. Not true, said CNN, which truth-checked the timeline and dismissed the remark as fake news. Trump, in late May, retained Kasowitz to represent him in all matters related to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Here is Kasowitz’s statement, read at the presser: I am Marc Kasowitz, President Trump’s personal lawyer. Contrary to numerous false press accounts leading up to today’s hearing, Mr. Comey has now finally confirmed publicly what he repeatedly told the President privately: The President was not under investigation as part of any probe into Russian interference. Mr. Comey also admitted that there is no evidence that a single vote changed as a result of any Russian interference. Mr. Comey’s testimony also makes clear that the President never sought to impede the investigation into attempted Russian interference in the 2016 election, and in fact, according to Mr. Comey, the President told Mr. Comey “it would be good to find out” in that investigation if there was “some ‘satellite’ associates of his who did something wrong.” And he, President Trump, did not exclude anyone from that statement. Consistent with that statement, the President never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone, including the president never suggested that that Mr. Comey “let Flynn go.” As he publicly stated the next day, he did say to Mr. Comey, “General Flynn is a good guy, he has been through a lot” and also “asked how General Flynn is doing.” Admiral Rogers testified  today that the President never “directed [him] to do anything . . . illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate” and never “pressured him to do so.” Director Coats said the same thing. The President likewise never pressured Mr. Comey. The President also never told Mr. Comey, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty” He never said it in in form and he never said it in substance. Of course, the Office of the President is entitled to expect loyalty from those who are serving in an administration, and, from before this President took office to this day, it is overwhelmingly clear that there have been and continue to be those in government who are actively attempting to undermine this administration with selective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications. Mr. Comey has now admitted that he is one of these leakers. Today, Mr. Comey admitted that he unilaterally and surreptitiously made unauthorized disclosures to the press of privileged communications with the President. The leaks of this privileged information began no later than March 2017 when friends of Mr. Comey have stated he disclosed to them the conversations he had with the President during their January 27, 2017 dinner and February 14, 2017 White House meeting. Today, Mr. Comey admitted that he leaked to friends of his, purported memos of these privileged conversations, one of which he testified was classified. Mr, Comey also testified that immediately after he was terminated he authorized his friends to leak the contents of those memos to the press in order to, in Mr. Comey’s words, “prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” Although Mr. Comey testified that he only leaked the memos in response to a tweet, the public record reveals that the New York Times was quoting from those memos the day before the referenced tweet, which belies Mr. Comey’s excuse for this unauthorized disclosure of privileged information and appears to be entirely retaliatory. We will leave it the appropriate authorities to determine whether this leaks should be investigated along with all those others that are being investigation In sum, it is now established that there the President was not being investigated for colluding with, or attempting to obstruct any investigation. As the Committee pointed out today, these important facts for the country to know are virtually the only facts that have not been leaked during the long course of these events.

Comey never admitted there is no evidence that a single vote changed. He clearly said he was not part of the government and he is not in the position to make statements regarding the evidence, whether it exists or not. Fundamental lack of ethics in this administration and it’s hired guns. Reply tripledipper • on Jun 8, 2017 12:17 pm HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! Yeah. Ok. Reply AJ • on Jun 8, 2017 12:34 pm I love how Trump and his people are so hung up on the part where he personally wasn’t under investigation, as if that’s somehow the end of it. The word “currently” clearly hung over every utterance of it by Comey (or, less generously, the word “yet”.) Nothing makes you look more innocent than asking “Am I personally linked to this? I’m not? Then why don’t we stop it right now and not dig any farther.” Reply Jay • on Jun 8, 2017 12:37 pm A liar representing another liar. Just great!

Reply eye roll • on Jun 8, 2017 12:47 pm It doesn’t matter how Trump, his lawyer or his surrogates try to spin this now. HIs goose is already cooked. Trump can’t take back how he tried to obstruct justice. And who knows what else — yet. As much as Trump would like to frame this as over, it’s only the beginning. The Comey testimony is only one part of the mosaic. It will be matched up to the testimony of others. This is how perjury cases are built. This is how smaller fish flip and point to bigger fish. Evidence is continuing to be gathered by the two congressional committees and by the special prosecutor. In business, Trump would pay off those who would have the resources and tenacity to sue him (like the Trump University case) — or leave others holding the bag while he ran away (like his bankruptcies.) When you’re president there are a different set of rules — it’s called the Constitution. And breaking those rules have consequences that no money or lawyered-up maneuvering can fix.

Richard BurrRichard BurrWinners and losers from Comey’s testimony Five takeaways from Comey’s dramatic testimony Reporter finds GOP senator's bank card in Capitol ATM MORE (R-N.C.) left his bank card at an ATM in the Capitol on Thursday, according to a reporter who said she found it. BuzzFeed News reporter Emma Loop wrote in a series of tweets that Burr was using an ATM in the Capitol subway while speaking to reporters after former FBI Director James Comey's testimony, but he forgot his card in the machine when he walked away. ADVERTISEMENT “He grabs his cash and leaves. I notice the ATM is still beeping, though. So I look and he's left his card in the machine!” Loop tweeted. “A staffer (I think from gallery) grabbed it for safe keeping. So [Burr] come get your bank card!" Loop and another reporter present noted that Burr asked the assembled journalists to look away when he entered his PIN. Burr chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, which hosted Comey's testimony Thursday. The former FBI director told the panel that President Trump defamed him and told "lies." A funny thing just happened at the subways in the Capitol. Burr was leaving but, as reporters asked questions, decided to stop at the ATM.— Emma Loop (@LoopEmma) June 8, 2017  So he starts using the machine and we keep asking questions. When he has to out his pin in, he turns to us and tells us not to look lol— Emma Loop (@LoopEmma) June 8, 2017 He grabs his cash and leaves. I notice the ATM is still beeping, though.

The latest news on the street comes from a tweet in which the company says its Cannon Lake chips are "on track" and that its Ice Lake follow-up chips have been "taped in," which is to say that they've potentially reached the final design milestone before being sent to the company's foundries. Another milestone for 10nm: Cannon Lake on track and we’ve now taped in Ice Lake, our 2nd-generation 10nm product. pic.twitter.com/DUDm3MsBaB — Intel Official News (@intelnews) June 8, 2017 By "on track," Intel seems to be reinforcing its guidance that Cannon Lake chips will begin shipping in the second half of this year. Shipments of Cannon Lake in volume will begin in the first half of 2018, according to transcripts of Intel CEO Brian Krzanich by Ashraf Eassa at the Motley Fool. The tweet didn't offer any further information about Coffee Lake, the company's fourth 14-nm CPU family that's expected to launch later this year. Although we didn't cover it at the time, Intel claimed that a 15W Coffee Lake CPU would offer 30% better performance than an equivalent Skylake part as part of its Core X-series launch. Since it's taken from the Sysmark benchmark, that figure likely represents across-the-chip improvements instead of a per-core increase. We'll just have to sit tight for more Coffee Lake details.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Market Stats Show Data Center Server Market Slowing By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: JUNE 08 2017 Slower investment in servers by the likes of Facebook, Amazon, and Google is causing a big slowdown in the data center server market, according to a new report by International Data Corp. (IDC). Vendor revenue has dropped to $11.8 billion in the first quarter of this year, a decline of 4.6 percent year-over-year, according to IDC’s latest Worldwide Quarterly Server Tracker. Much of that slowdown in investment is being driven by customers deciding to wait until Intel's new Skylake server processors start arriving in new server models sometime in the second half of the year, IDC said. Cloudy, with a Chance of Shifting Deployment However, the wait for new high-end chips is not the only trend dragging down server sales. The tech industry is also seeing a major shift from onsite data center deployments to cloud service companies selling infrastructure as a service. With more companies opting to use cloud services rather than building their own data centers, there may be less overall demand for new servers. This shift in the way server resources are deployed is also causing much greater consolidation among server purchasers, with fewer companies now responsible for the lion's share of server sales. In fact, according to IDC, a single customer bought more than 10 percent of all servers that were shipped in the first quarter, representing approximately a quarter of a million units. IDC said it suspected such a large investment by a single company indicated that the purchaser is is investing heavily in infrastructure to expand its capabilities as a cloud service provider. But the move to the cloud is not the only factor having an impact on server sales. DRAM pricing issues have also had an effect on demand for high-end server systems, leading the drop in demand for the sector with a year-over-year decline in revenue of 29 percent, down to $1 billion. No Change in the Forecast Hewlett Packard Enterprise claimed the top spot by revenue among server makers, generating $2.86 billion in sales in the first quarter for a 24.2 percent share of the market, according to IDC. But that's down 15.8 percent from the same period last year. Dell, which came in second in sales for the quarter with $2.37 billion, claimed 20.1 percent of the market. Dell was the only major server company to see revenue climb year-over-year, up 4.7 percent from last year. Cisco, IBM, and Lenovo were all ranked in a statistical tie for third place. IBM suffered the worst drop in sales year-over-year, facing a decline of 34.7 percent to $745 million and its market share plummeted from 9.2 percent to 6.3 percent. IDC said the results for the quarter were perfectly in line with its forecasts, and that it expects continued long-term declines in high-end system revenue for the foreseeable future.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 9 o'clock in New York City and this is "The Five." We're just 13 hours away from one of the most highly anticipated Senate hearings in recent memory. Tomorrow, former FBI Director James Comey will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss his private conversations with President Donald Trump. It will be the first time Mr. Comey has spoken publicly since the President fired him on May 9th. We are already getting a preview about what to expect from Mr. Comey. And chief national correspondent Ed Henry has the details from the White House tonight. Ed, what do we say? ED HENRY, FOX NEWS: Well, good evening, guys. A pretty good day for President Trump today because top Intel officials testified and sort of a preamble to this on The Hill and suggested that the commander-in-chief did not improperly pressured them to interfere with this Russia probe and the teaser we are getting of James Comey's testimony tomorrow -- backs up the commander-in-chief's account that then FBI director told him several times he was not under investigation. And even when Comey will detail his February Oval Office meeting with the President where Mr. Trump asked that he let the probe of General Michael Flynn go, Comey and top advisors did not share this with FBI agents. Comey says, because, quote, "We also concluded that given that it was a one-on- one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account." Signaling that even he admits it's a high bar to prove obstruction of justice. But even so, there could be real political damage to this president as Comey testifies about their January dinner, for example. He is going to testify, quote, "A few minutes later, the President said I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. I did not move, speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence." Awkward and a bit dramatic perhaps from Comey which is why advisors for the President are telling me tonight they are bracing for two things tomorrow. Number one, even if it turns out to be a nothing-burger, the mainstream media can build up the drama so much to make it look like it was devastating for the President and the other thing is, even if it turns out to be a relatively good day for the President, he can mess it up by live tweeting the hearing and making matters worse -- guys. WATTERS: Ed, thanks a lot. You didn't know but nothing-burger is a band phrased by Gutfeld. (LAUGHTER) GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I think I just popped a vessel. WATTERS: Kimberly, Trump's attorney just came out and says, the President feels totally vindicated, based off of these prepared remarks that Comey is supposed to deliver. You know, based off his remarks, Trump might not even have to live tweet tomorrow because this is pretty good news for the President for the most part. Do you agree? KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yes, and that's why the attorney came out and made these the President feels vindicated because what so far that we have been able to review and that prepared statement which is quite detailed is that the statements are consistent with what the President said transpired between the two of them. So, if there were any other witness there, any other recording, there really isn't anything to contradict or provide an inconsistent statement to what the President said occurred in the conversation and by this way, multiple times, multiple occasions, he was assured in fact that he was not the subject of an investigation, so it shows them truthfulness on the part of the President and I think it diminishes any kinds of supposed, you know, motive or intent to say that oh, he wanted to fire Comey because, you know, he was under investigation by the Russians. So, at least in terms of the President, that gives him some cover there and validates his statement. So, I think that was important. WATTERS: Yes. He did come away and validated based off of these prepared remarks. Dana, the networks and all the cables have decided they will going to go live tomorrow. DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Yes, including -- GUILFOYLE: Dana Perino! WATTERS: Oh, Dana! PERINO: Yes. I will be on in the morning. WATTERS: I walked right into that plug. I didn't even realize it. PERINO: Even though you were insulting us at the same time. WATTERS: Do you think these prepared remarks take the wind out of the sails of some of this intense excitement, from some of these baffling network? PERINO: Yes, I do. I actually think that that's why Senator Byrd, a Republican on the Senate Committee and Director Comey agreed to release it today. WATTERS: Okay. PERINO: Because they don't want it to be -- I think that they don't want it to -- GUILFOYLE: I don't think -- PERINO: -- they wanted to be that dramatic. I'm not going to say that word that Greg hates because I would like him too much for him to pop another vessel. I do think that the Democrats' high hopes for James Comey are going to be dashed again. WATTERS: Uh-hm. PERINO: He is like losing the football with them. However, I do think that based on the written testimony, I can understand both sides of this. I can understand the President wanting to clear his name saying that this investigation is a cloud. I wanted to be cleared and couldn't you just publicly say what you are telling me? WATTERS: Yes. PERINO: I also understand the separation of powers and I respect them and I think that the independent judiciary is so important and I believe that FBI Director Comey was prudent and how he handled it and I think that's what we will see tomorrow, is that a public servant caught up in a situation where you have Hillary Clinton doing this terrible thing of, you know, having her private email server. Then running for president. Him having to get in the middle of that. Making I think a mistake -- GUILFOYLE: Uh-hm. PERINO: -- to comment on that and not recommend a prosecution and then getting himself into this situation. Because what he said in the written testimony is that, he wanted to avoid a duty to correct. If, in fact, it changed -- WATTERS: Right. PERINO: -- that he became a subject of investigation. Which could be worse for the President in the long run. So, I think that the director was being prudent. I don't think it's necessary for the White House to trash Comey's reputation and I think that they should go tomorrow, have a great infrastructure event and just forget about it. Let the lawyers statements stand and let your story gets handled. WATTERS: Greg, speaking of forget about it. GUTFELD: Uh-hm. WATTERS: There's a moment according to James Comey's recollection where the President of the United States sent across him and demanded loyalty, is that how people in New York talk? Is that kind of par to the course because Chris Christie came out and said, that's how bosses around time in the city frame things? Are you buying that or not? GUTFELD: Kind of, I think what we learned is that Trump is guilty of being Trump. WATTERS: Yes. GUTFELD: Every time something comes up that supposed to be egregious, you find out that maybe he was inappropriate or blunt. WATTERS: Uh-hm. GUTFELD: But unlawful? No. So, this is not earth shattering although I really thank Comey for releasing this helpful study guide -- GUILFOYLE: Uh-hm. GUTFELD: Beforehand. It's like now we can be prepared for this exam. It's like a program you get for a local musical. Yes. But the biggest loser here is CNN. WATTERS: Yes. GUTFELD: For predicting, according to sources, Comey was going to testify that he never said Trump wasn't under investigation. WATTERS: I think we had it right there. GUTFELD: Oh, really? So, they weren't just wrong ones. They are wrong three times because he testified three times. So, that raises a question - - GUILFOYLE: Three strikes, you are out. GUTFELD: Who was CNN's source? I think it was Kathy Griffin. Because, you know -- (LAUGHTER) She was there just hanging around. By the way, the problem with Trump being Trump is that part of it is his responsibility. But every time I was hired for a job, there was always an employee orientation day where they kind of tell you the rules. But apparently, you know, the rules, number one, don't meet along with the FBI. Number two, don't demand loyalty. You did that in real estate, you did that in Queens but you can't do it here. But the thing is, this is the mark of somebody who is not a politician. And this is what happens. I just want to add another note about this Comey memo. It's like a golden corral buffet. There's something for everyone. PERINO: Yes. GUTFELD: So, if you don't like Trump, you can bring up the demanding loyalty thing. You can also bring up lots of other stuff that's in there. WATTERS: I'm sure Juan will bring it up. GUTFELD: And then, if you like Trump, you can say that Comey vindicated him on that last part and that he didn't interfere. So, it's like, you can look at it, it's amazing when you look at how other people in the media are going oh, my God, impeachment and then everybody else is like going, no. GUILFOYLE: There's nothing though. GUTFELD: Yes. Don't say what it is. GUILFOYLE: Okay. GUTFELD: It is a nothing taco. WATTERS: Nothing taco. (LAUGHTER) GUILFOYLE: I am not interested in the nothing taco. GUTFELD: I don't know. WATTERS: We are going to leave that one alone. (CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: Okay. WATTERS: Juan, Janet Turley (ph), law respected legal, said that although some of these comments by President Trump were maybe not mature, there is nothing criminal about them. Do you agree? JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: Yes. Absolutely. There is nothing criminal as of yet. I mean, the closest we could congest is the idea that there is a basis for saying that he was trying to interfere with an ongoing investigation by asking FBI director, can you see your way to let this go? WATTERS: Right. WILLIAMS: That Mike Flynn is a good guy. But the question then becomes one of intent. And for people like Turley, that is the measuring stick and can you prove that the President had intent to block or interfere with an ongoing federal investigation? WATTERS: And that's a very high bar. WILLIAMS: It's a very high bar as he said and I think Kimberly said this. That given that there is no independent corroboration -- WATTERS: Right. WILLIAMS: Or maybe Ed Henry say, how are you going to prove that? I will say this, it's very interesting to me that we had a story out indicating that President Trump was asked by Attorney General Sessions, do you want my resignation? And the reason for this apparently is that President Trump was upset with his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. And then we have also news that FBI Director Mueller went to the Attorney General and said, you know what? I'm uncomfortable being with this president. I feel like he's trying to -- PERINO: Being alone. WILLIAMS: Yes. Being alone. PERINO: To preserve the independence of the judiciary. It's what he was hoping for. WILLIAMS: Yes. And it preserve the independence and integrity of the investigation. So, this would indicate that he did feel to some extent that this guy, he was after something. He says, in fact, one of the conversations, that the President told him, I am trying to lift this cloud. Which I am told this, the New York business term. Right? I am trying to lift this cloud, can you help me, right? We'll talk about the -- in the next segment more conversations with intelligence community officials but today they get in trouble because they won't even say. PERINO: They wouldn't say it in public session. WILLIAMS: Correct. WATTERS: Right. And they said they would say it in private session because they don't want to say these things in front of a worldwide audience and that makes perfect sense. GUTFELD: In New York, lifting a cloud is smoking a joint. PERINO: Really? GUTFELD: Yes. WATTERS: How would you know, Greg? GUTFELD: I watched it. (LAUGHTER) GUILFOYLE: But I think what's important here is that there isn't any time that Comey thought that the President was trying to get them to stop an investigation. WATTERS: Right. GUILFOYLE: It wasn't in anyway colluding. It wasn't in anyway obstructing justice. So, you don't have that there. So, how are you going to prove that? You are going to just imagine it? Because the person who was in the room, that was the subject of that discussion and that conversation is telling you that it wasn't problematic, that it didn't rise to the level because straight shooter Comey, if it was, then he would have had to report it and actually make it the subject of an investigation and say that this is something that was improper. So, as far as it goes, saying that it was concerning. That was it. But never did he feel that this was something that he had to do or was compelled, you know, to do. When you hear President Trump talking about, you know, expecting -- that is who he is. Anybody who knows him. Loyalty is a big thing to him. WATTERS: Right. GUILFOYLE: That's his deal. That is the way he rolls. That's his say. Comey also gave you his further insight to back up what Greg said which is, you know, this is the man, I think that he didn't quite understand what was appropriate to discuss with the FBI director. WILLIAMS: Yes. I agree. GUILFOYLE: But that does not show any kind of, you know, specific intent to commit a crime or do anything. He saying, I don't think that this is a president or a man that actually quite kind of knew the ropes, as to how we do things around here. WILLIAMS: But I would just add, go ahead. PERINO: So, he has been the CEO of a private company for a long time. I just don't think that that's necessarily -- not understanding basic rules of the road when it comes to government and separation of power. When you work for the government and when you're head of the government, you pledge your loyalty to the United States of America. Not to any one man. And that's is just a fundamental principle of America. That is not something that you have to learn during the transition. That's just something -- GUILFOYLE: Right. PERINO: -- that we, that founding fathers put that in the constitution for a reason and it helps them. GUTFELD: I don't think I would know that. Honestly, if I ran for president, I would be treating it just like everything else I did. If I thought that somebody was like, you know, after me, I would say, why are you doing this? Can you, you know, lighten up. I think that's how New Yorkers talk to New Yorkers. GUILFOYLE: President Obama had done that. And excuse us, well, he is new to the Senate and -- GUTFELD: Yes. Believe me. They did use that excuse. They did use that excuse a lot. WATTERS: But I also think President Obama assumed that Eric Holder had his back. GUTFELD: Right. WILLIAMS: No. Sessions is a longtime leading supporter, early supporter of President Trump. But I think, just to pick up on what Dana was saying, I think what we are seeing here is a president who feels very isolated. Nobody he can trust. He can't trust Jeff Sessions? Wow. And the second thing is, he just doesn't have -- I think everybody at the table said this tonight, he doesn't have a sense of how you have a responsibility bigger than loyalty. When you are the President of the United States. WATTERS: I think he's very loyal to the country and I think that's why people put him in office. GUILFOYLE: He has a core group that he trusts I think. You know, that surrounds them. WATTERS: That's right. GUTFELD: It's Jared. WATTERS: Coming up. The nation's top intelligence officials appeared on Capitol Hill today. Where they had some surprising things to say about the Russia investigation, details ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PERINO: All right. The Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers testified today on Capitol Hill. Were they disappointed many senators by refusing to comment on any personal conversations they had with President Trump as we were saying in the first block. Rogers and Coats said it would be appropriate to disclose discussions with the President in an open session but they were more forthcoming when asked if the White House ever tried to influence an investigation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA.: Are you aware of any efforts by anyone in the White House or the executive branch looking for advice from other members of the intelligence community about how to potentially influence an investigation? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're talking about me? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. RUBIO: Has anyone ever come forward and said, I just got a call from someone at the White House asking me, what is the best way to influence someone on an investigation? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I never received anything. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no direct knowledge of such a call. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: All right. So, Juan, let me start with you. I talked to a Democrat today who is friendly with some of the Democrats on the Senate investigation, you know, on the Intel Committee. And they think that after today's testimony and what they know about what former FBI Director Comey will say tomorrow, they don't think that there's going to be anything new. They think it actually continues to be a distraction. And in drumbeat, they said that it's like putting another log on the fire but this is not going to be at an end-all be-all. So, do you think the Democrats are little disappointed with the buildup to this hearing? WILLIAMS: Well, I think you have to be disappointed if you saw it as CNN reported that there was going to be testimony from, you know, the FBI director, suggesting that in fact the President had said something explicit in terms of "don't do it." And that if there was a clear evidence of intent, which would then lead to obstruction of justice, which would then lead to impeachment, so, if you were not a Trump fan, this was going to be your nirvana. You're going to get rid of this guy. That's not happening apparently on the basis of anything that transpired today or likely that transpired tomorrow. PERINO: Right. WILLIAMS: What we do see Dana that I think that you and I will disagree on is in the testimony from Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence, and Mike Rogers, the National Security Council guy -- that they refuse to answer questions. So, the Democrats -- but I would also say, Marco Rubio and the Independent Angus King of Maine, became infuriated with them. And said, wait a second, why are you unable to come before our committee as we are trying to review the facts and then say oh, we can't talk about this. We will tell you privately. But of course there are no private hearings scheduled. PERINO: Well, I do think that Kimberly, the President benefits from having people around him who are experienced and established in Washington who don't overreact to things when President might have said, hey, what do you think about this? So, they didn't overreact. So, they don't think it's that big a deal but I guess an argument could be made that if this is all going to be repeated in in the press anyway, should they have just been able to say that in public session today and put it to bed so that there's not speculation about what they said behind the scenes? GUILFOYLE: I guess, I think, you know, it's hard, because you want to kind of get the right position which is -- tell the truth, be transparent about what happened but don't even engage in set of things that are not, you know, relevant. Or that seem to kind if be more like, you know, Russian gossip. You know, the kind of thing that people are looking for this -- very distracting. The Democrats you can see were getting very frustrated today because they wanted to get something there. And everybody was have it, make it their moment to expose it. But the problem is, Comey went ahead and leaked his own testimony. Right? PERINO: Right. GUILFOYLE: He went ahead in conjunction with the chairman, Senator Burr. GUILFOYLE: Well, absolutely. And so, that's what happened. And so now, you have people like CNN, who completely reported false information, it's a complete letdown -- is Comey going to radically change his statement tomorrow and make some kind of wild, inconsistent statement? I don't think so. I think he is going to stick to his script and exactly what he said today which is based on his accounts that he took. That were right after contemporaneous in time with his conversations with the President. So, there you, that suggests reliability, and credibility. And you are hearing it from the man himself. This is what happens. These are the facts. And I will also tell you subjectively what I felt at the time, which was that he didn't feel that any other action should be taken going forward, that he didn't find any wrongdoing on the part of the President and he didn't think that the President was trying to end an investigation or, you know, influence him in that way. PERINO: Yes. Greg, you can imagine these two gentlemen have enormous responsibility and protecting us from threats of all sorts, foreign and domestic. So, can you imagine if they are probably sitting and they're thinking, we've got a lot to do? GUTFELD: Yes, I mean, Iran got hit. PERINO: Right. GULFED: Stuffs going on in this world and they're dealing with this stuff and it kills me to watch politicians getting angry over people who are acting just like them. You know, they learned it from the best. GUILFOYLE: They all used to be there. GUTFELD: Yes. This hearing was nothing more than a bunch of old people asking the same question over and over again. It was like, you know, a bunch of -- GUILFOYLE: (INAUDIBLE) GUTFELD: Yes. I'm getting there. It's like a 24-hour diner and somebody keeps asking how late you are open. They shouldn't call it hearing. They should call it a hard of hearing. They need hearing aids. And everybody showing so much respect, they would have to wind up to get to the question. If you cut all of that stuff out and got to the meat and bones, it would be shorter than a Ramon's song from the first album. But it is, it's about one group of people going after another group of people and they're relentless. I have to give the Democrats credit. They are absolutely relentless. I wish the Republicans were like this with the real scandals during the last eight years. The real Democrat scandals, if they were like this, who knows. PERINO: Last word to you, Jesse. WATTERS: Well, I mean, what happened during this real Democratic scandals I think Eric Holder -- he say, invoked executive privilege when they were trying to get to the bottom of "Fast and the Furious," you had Lois Lerner taking the fifth on the IRS scandal, you had Hillary basically wiping her server claim. That was more evasive I think than some of the answers that were given today. Of course these guys don't want to go up there and say what their private conversations were with the commander-in-chief, in front of the entire world. That's obvious. Today was just another nail in the coffin for this so-called Russian-Trump conspiracy. Everybody out there on that table, said that there is no effort by anybody at the White House to influence any of their investigations. This post-story is fake news. It didn't happen. So, I think a lot of Democrats are sitting around just waiting for the next thing to happen because they don't have anything going on right now. PERINO: Which post story? WATTERS: Remember they said that President Trump tried to influence the DNI and the NSA guy, they say, hey, Comey, slow down this investigation -- WILLIAMS: They wouldn't say it. WATTERS: They said they were not influence but they didn't say what the conversation was. WILLIAMS: Right. So, let's be clear. PERINO: And that's what I am saying, he benefits from people who don't overreact and that are prudent and experienced in Washington. Like, okay, we are not going to talk about that, sir. We're going to move on. WATTERS: Right. PERINO: Okay. And we're going to move on. Directly ahead, we will tell you why authorities aren't tracking enough terrorists. We've got that, stay tuned. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUTFELD: Today's hearing was supposed to be about surveillance. Since they didn't get around to it, I will. The civil liberties faction who hate surveillance operate on a lie: that security infringes on freedom. No, security enhances freedom, which insures our survival. Especially now when we are at war with a disease. Now, libertarians love to twist the Ben Franklin quote when he said that, "Those who would give up liberty to purchase safety deserve neither." It's not about surveillance. But a tax dispute over who pays for frontier defense in Pennsylvania. Ben would have been fine with the NSA. What civil libertarians miss is our enemies realize that our love of liberty makes us vulnerable to their apocalyptic goals. They use our dedication to freedom to infiltrate, kill and then inevitably rid us of that very same freedom. So, what's the answer? We must realize that the survival of liberty requires a coexisting exception, one that allows us to stop the attacks on said liberty. This co-existing exception should sit beside our rights. Think of it as a bouncer whose job is to stop those people whose belief systems run counter to our freedom. So these anti-terror programs are not in conflict with liberty but act as a tougher, more muscular pal, there to help, making sure that you are safe from dirty nukes, bio-terror and beheadings. Because it's hard to be free when you are dead. K.G., are you tired of hearing this security infringing freedom argument? You're supposed to stop there and never one dark, all, maybe they go together? GUILFOYLE: This is the problem. When you think about it, someone in your life, being harmed, losing their life, been injured or maimed due to terror that could have been preventable if you actually had the will and the stomach to allow for a little bit of an investigation or intelligence gathering? Do you have a problem with that? Why does human life -- why is it valued so much lower than the right to go ahead and get some information to someone to prevent a loss of life? This is what bothers me so much. How much do we need to see in London and Manchester and here on our own soil in San Bernardino, and in Orlando? How much is going to be enough? That is not. It was do something about it, it sounds like Theresa May has actually come to terms and groups with this and is saying enough is enough. We've got to do something about this. Be very clear about what they intend and they will go to any length to be able to commit acts of jihad across the world to accomplish their roles. What a real are we willing to do? Is a small sacrifice too much to ask? GUTFELD: It is interesting, you know Jesse, and they know our system so well. They know our system allows them to actually work within it. They want Sharia law. Radical Islamists want -- they don't want freedom. Because we are free, we allow competing ideas into our country even ideas that destroy us. WATTERS: It's a catch-22. That is why a lot of these people can come here and fly under the radar plot plan, because we don't survey you mosques. We allow freedom of expression and religion. We don't banned hates -- you hit the nail on the head. Privacy is worthless if you are in a coffin. It's funny how the conversation has changed, since the beginning of the Bush administration. When the initial surveillance was unveiled or reported, I think it was The New York Times who broke that story -- it was huge news and civil libertarians were furious and there were protests on the streets and President Bush was a tyrant, shredding the constitution and then President Obama expanded the program. Trump is now reauthorizing the program. He might have been the victim of some of the abuses of the program. I think right now and the threat changes you have to change the tools in your toolbox. And that is what we're doing. That is just smart. GUTFELD: Dana, even in the hearing there was one point when they said the programs they were talking about saved countless lives internationally. Oh, you don't have to worry about America -- there haven't been people coming from this country or that country since 1975. These programs have actually extended people's lives, saved lives internationally. PERINO: Right, because the monitoring happens between emails from overseas into the United States or vice versa. We are able to share with our partners if we are able -- and have a good relationship and ability to protect people or to disrupt plots. At that something you don't want them to say in open sessions. Because we don't want them to know how we do it. What Ed Snowden did was so damaging. As Jesse was saying, the terrorist's threats, they evolve with the technology so we have two as well. It doesn't mean we have to give up our civil liberties but we have to honest about what we are going to accept as President Trump is actually calling for the re-authorization of the section 702 program. I think it would be good to have the debate and make all of these members of congress vote on it before the August recess. GUTFELD: What do you think, Juan, is the 702 collection valuable? WILLIAMS: I was just thinking why can't, Greg and I talk about climate change and have a big blow up on this show? I know how to have a blow up on this show. What we should tell the audience is in fact, the reality is, the biggest threat to re-authorization came from President Trump and Republicans, allies who said Mike Flynn was unmasked under the private act of section 702 and ask a ton of question today about isn't proper to unmask people and they had been told by the intelligence community, gee, we keep a strict record of who we talk to, who request unmasking or normally the names of Americans are redacted in this transactions, you are just monitoring conversations. WATTERS: That is unfortunate for Democrats that there's a paper trail of the unmasking. WILLIAMS: No there is not, I think they are glad there is, Jesse. This is nothing unusual and nothing improper was done. But I would say to you, that this is the threat. That somehow, they have politicized this issue and not in the way that you described, Greg, but they politicize it to be somehow an attack on President Trump. If that is what it has ever been about. GUTFELD: I will resist the blowup that you so badly want to -- WILLIAMS: I think you should feel a little chillier. GUTFELD: I am. I feel very cold. A trash Trump tour abroad, headlined by President Obama, Vice President Biden and former Intel Chief James Clapper, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUILFOYLE: After President Trump won the White House, President Obama said he would do everything he could to help him succeed. Sadly, he has not honored that pledge. He was trashing his successor while abroad and his Vice President and former Intelligence Chief piled on from overseas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: In Paris, we came around to fight climate change. An agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership, it will still give our children a fighting chance. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: United States has had moments of turning inward in the past. We have always overcome it, just as we will overcome this. FORMER INTELLIGENCE CHIEF JAMES CLAPPER: I think if you compare the two, Watergate pales in my view. Compared to what we are confronting now. (END VIDEO CLIPS) GUILFOYLE: Tough. PERINO: Especially on that last one, with Clapper. If you find yourself in a situation, you can say in front of an international audience, something that is true. Which is, there are two investigations that are underway, there is a special counsel, Robert Mueller and that the Intel committee. I will refrain to comment and I know it's hard when you get asked questions like that but I think there's a way to try to avoid it. I'm thinking back to 2009. When President Obama's team worked to try to dismantle the legacy and programs from President George W. Bush on the global war on terror, in particular, Gitmo and saying some pretty harsh things about it. President Bush was very quiet. But Vice President Dick Cheney was not. He was extremely effective. The dual speech he had against President Obama? He is going to want to defend his legacy. Even if it's veiled, it still hurts. On foreign soil, it's still hard to take. GUILFOYLE: All right Greg, proper or improper? And what is it expected? GUTFELD: Has there ever been any topic that has warranted and caused more conversation in our modern lifetimes than Donald Trump? Not even the weather. People talk about Trump as though it is a separate weather event. Wherever you go, people are going -- the house the Trump over there? Pretty strong, we had a lot of trouble last night. We had to dig it out and shovel to Trump out of our driveway. It keeps piling up. I wasn't upset with that stuff because it's just what people talk about. President Obama talking about the Paris Accords, we need to give our children a fighting chance. It's not predictable, cheap happy clich, that the left always uses. If you come out against something, kids are going to die. But if you look at the Paris accords, that would be more harmful to children, because it's diverting trillions and trillions of dollars away from clean water, cleaner air -- all sorts of causes that could use that money. It will have almost negligible effects on the climate over a hundred years so actually if you vote against the Paris accord, you are trying to give children a fighting chance. And if you are for the Paris accord, you want children to die. How do you feel? GUILFOYLE: Just say it. WILLIAMS: I think Greg Gutfeld is going to burst. GUTFELD: I'm using your toolbox. WILLIAMS: No you are not, because you want to pretend -- let's move on. Facts don't exist. GUTFELD: I am giving you 20 seconds to give a fact. WILLIAMS: How about his, 5 of the last six years have been the hottest in history. What happens when Jim Clapper says oh, you know what? The president says the people in Intelligence Community All right Nazi that is pretty strong language coming from the president. GUTFELD: He started that trend. WILLIAMS: He is the president, Greg. WATTERS: Jim Clapper also said there was no evidence of any collusion between Trump and the Russians and now he says it's Watergate. So get your story straight. WILLIAMS: No, no, no when you are going after America Institution. WATTERS: It doesn't have anything to do about the testimony he gave about collusion. Let me just finish, I think President Obama obviously a little upset, because his library is going to be empty. In Chicago, after President Trump has proved to dismantle his legacy. No Obamacare, no Paris, the only thing left is the Iran deal. No one wants to visit that wing. And then you have Biden out there saying we need to be more engaged. Biden was the one that pulled out of Iraq and let Syria unravel and didn't protect our allies. PERINO: Are you worried about Biden running, Jesse? GUILFOYLE: He practiced that all night. All right, straight ahead, full- grown full-blown Trump derangement syndrome and not just on the set, but from some Democrats today, details after this break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WILLIAMS: Whether its climate change, Sanctuary cities or the travel ban, Democrats had been opposing President Trump in nearly every turn, but it hasn't been enough for Democratic Congressman Al Green of Texas. He wants to take things to the next level. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AL GREEN, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN: I have engaged in the process of drafting articles of impeachment. By articles of impeachment, they are being reviewed. At some point, if no one else does -- I will file articles of impeachment to impeach President Donald J. Trump for obstruction of justice. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAMS: You have Green joint behind thereby sure Sherman Congressman from California, Kimberly and the argument is that by trying to get Comey to lay-off of Mike Flynn, there's a basis for a charge of obstruction of justice. GUILFOYLE: That is laughable. He can take as articles of impeachment and help me with my winning pad for my dog and line it everywhere. There is no evidence to support that. They have over promised and under delivered. There will not be in impeachment of President Trump. There's no evidence that shows any collusion, any obstruction of justice, anything of the sort. Now, what are the Democrats going to do? What are they going to say to the constituents after they've been huffing and puffing, having the Russia vapors. GUTFELD: Weaning pad? GUILFOYLE: It keeps the house clean. WILLIAMS: Kimberly's point is well taken by a number of Democratic leaders. Adam Schmidt on the Intelligence Committee, Linda Sanchez, one of the leaders it says too early. Not enough facts. WATTERS: You guys have been saying that for quite some time. That is fine. I think you guys keep saying that. Push impeachment, behead people, and boycott this. WILLIAMS: They say don't do it. They are saying Green is wrong. WATTERS: Oh, they are saying Green is wrong? PERINO: Jesse. GUILFOYLE: Jesse... WATTERS: He is like the guy at the bar at 2:00 in the morning. And he tries to buy everybody a shot, but all his friends are not there anymore, he is that guy. Not even Pelosi -- is trying to buy -- -- WILLIAMS: Dana right now the polls had 43 percent of Americans want to see Donald Trump impeach and by the way this is just for Gregg but let him in on it, 63 percent professors want impeachment. PERINO: They will have to deal with headlines like this every day. They will miss opportunities to comment on the health care bill that -- there will be a vote before the August recess in the senate. That will go to President Trump for his signature. They need to not be so consumed with his impeachment. WILLIAMS: So Gregg, how would you impeach him, Greg? GUTFELD: It's like how you would spend your money when you win the lotto. It's never going to happen. Donald Trump is a fork. Republicans see them as a spoon and Democrat see him as a fork. WILLIAMS: But is like Lotto, you got to play to win. GUILFOYLE: Somebody won the lotto again today, somebody who didn't need the money, President Trump. WILLIAMS: Control, "One More Thing" up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WATTERS: Time now for "One More Thing." Kimberly. GUILFOYLE: We want to wish a very happy birthday to the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence. He is 58 years young. And he looks fabulous. GUTFELD: I hate it when people say 58 years young. I banned that phrase. GUILFOYLE: They decorated with balloons and he is with his buddies and sent a nice tweet out today. He addressed NASA's newest class of astronauts. He is a very, very nice man. WATTERS: He is the president soon, if Al Green gets his way. Dana. PERINO: In the New York City subway, I have learned to use it. They don't let dogs on this. If you have a service dog, it is ok or if your dog can fit in a bag. I love New Yorkers because they figured out a way to put all these big dogs in really big bags. I got a little help from our fans. We are going to try it tomorrow. GUILFOYLE: That is hilarious. PERINO: I'm working on it. GUTFELD: Greg's amazing plugs. And no, they are not on my head. I got an article up on FoxNews.com/opinion it is my thoughts on terror, once again. Also, my podcast is up. It is Foxnewspodcast.com. It's an interview with Susie Breitbart. We talk at length about her husband and what she has been up to. I think it's the first time she is ever spoken in an interview. WILLIAMS: Check this out. All right everybody, check this out, in Los Angeles, a female peacock walks into a liquor store. Sounds like Dana's corny joke. No, this actually happened. The bird walks in. A store manager says he wasn't aware of the situation until the customer says, what about that big bird over there? The bird caused 500 hundreds of dollars worth of damage in 90 minutes. GUTFELD: Certainly no thunderbird. WATTERS: This is a resort in Ochoa Rios, Jamaica. This is one of the lifeguards sliding out of the water slide, apparently. This is not a fake video. He has been practicing this for two years. GUTFELD: It is fake! WATTERS: This is tearing up the internet right now. He crosses his legs and sits upright. GUTFELD: You are not listening. WATTERS: I choose to believe! GUILFOYLE: Did they investigate this? WATTERS: Hopefully not, because I want to believe this is true. Thanks for watching, "Hannity" is up next. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Harris questions James Comey Start coming Elena thank you you are now a private citizen and you are enduring a senate Intel senate committee. Gearing down when he does get seven minutes to set of five is yesterday asking questions of thank you know. For and I am between opportunities right now so William you're that you are. I'm sure he'll have he tapped Cheney you know you and I both of them former prosecutors. Not gonna require you need anti Islamic a statement that in in my. My eight experience of prosecuting. Cases when a robber. Held a gun to somebody's head and then set I hope you'll give me your wallet. The word hope was not the most operative word at that moment but out you don't have to respond to that point. I have a series of questions ask you and and there are no start with are you aware of any meetings between the trump administration officials and Russian officials. During the campaign that have not been acknowledged by it those officials and the White House. That's not a even if I remember clearly that's not a question I can answer no concerning are you aware of any efforts by trump campaign officials are associates of the campaign. To hide their communications. With Russian officials through encrypted communications or other means I have to give you the same answer senators are. And the course of the FBI's investigation did you ever come across anything that suggested that communications records documents or other evidence had been destroyed. The again even the same answer 'cause if he would touch on investigative matters. And are you aware of any efforts our potential efforts to conceal communications between campaign officials and Russian officials. We got to give you the same answer senator thank you. And as a former attorney jive that series of questions about. Your connection with the attorney general during the course of your I'm ten years as director. What is your understanding of the parameters of general sessions recusal from the aggressor Russian investigation. I think it's described in a written. Release or statement from DOJ which I don't remember sitting here but the gist was he would be your cues from all matters relating to. Russia and that and the campaign or activities of Russia and that sixteen election I think some like that. Is so is your knowledge of the extent of his refusal based on the public statements he's made on correct okay. So is there any kind of memorandum. Issued from the attorney general or the Department of Justice to the FBI outlining the parameters of his refusal now to a more. And do you know if you reviewed any FBI or DOJ documents pertaining to the investigation before he was accused. I don't I don't know. And after he was accused him assumes the same answer the same answer. And as this aside from any notice or memorandum that was not central was what mechanism our process c.'s prime place to ensure that the attorney general would not have any connection with the investigation. Two knowledge. I don't know for sure that I know that he had consulted with career ethics officials the no had a runner accuse bush DOJ but I don't know what mechanism they set up. And the attorney general recused himself from the investigation but do you believe it was appropriate for him to be involved in the firing of the un chief investigator of that. Case of that and Russia into parents. At some I can't answer sitting here it's a it's a reasonable question but. The that would depend a lot of things I don't know like what did he know what was he told did he realize that the president was doing it because of the rush investigation things like that I just don't know the answer. You've mentioned in your written testimony in here that the president essentially asked you for a loyalty pledge are you aware. Of him making the same request of any other members of the cabinet. I'm not. Do you know what one way or another what he I don't know homer and other I've never ending about it. And you mentioned that on you have the conversation. Where he hope that you would let the fun matter go on February 14. It there are thereabouts. It's my understanding that mr. sessions was refused. From any involvement in the investigation. About a full two weeks later. See your knowledge that was the attorney general. And it did he had access to information about the investigation in those in turn two weeks. I don't I think in theory sure because he's the attorney general I don't know whether he had any contact with any materials related to that. To your knowledge was there any directive that he should not have any contact with any information. About the Russian investigation between the February 14 date and the day he was ultimately recused a recused himself on March 2. Not to my knowledge I don't know one way or another. And did you speak to the attorney general about the Russia investigation before his recusal. I don't think so no. Do you know if anyone in the department in the FBI. To forwarded any documents or information are memos of any sort. To the attention of the attorney general before his accused of I don't. I don't know of any remember any sitting here if it's possible but I I don't remember any. Do you know if the attorney general was involved in fact involved in any aspect of the Russian investigation after his accuse saw on the second of march. I don't I would assume not but -- don't I don't let me say this where I don't know of any information or leave me to believe he did something. To touch the rush investigation after the refusal. In your written testimonial indicate that you. When you after you left alone with the president. You mentioned that it was inappropriate Internet never happen again to the attorney general. And apparently he did not replying you write that he did not reply what did he do. If anything but did he'd just look it she was or pause for a moment what happens. I don't remember real clearly act I have a recollection of him just kind of looking at me and there's a danger I'm projecting on to him so this may be a faulty memory but I kind of got. His body language give me dissents like what am I gonna do. It is shrug. Night I remember clearly I think the reason I have that impression is have some recollection of almost informant they're in perceptible like. What am I gonna do but it and a have a clear recollection of that he didn't say anything. And none of that same February 14 meeting you said you understood the president to be requesting that you dropped investigation after that meeting however you received two calls from the president. March 30 and April 11. Where the president talked about a cloud over his presidency. Has anything you've learned in the months since your February 14 meeting changed your understanding of the president's request I guess it would be what he has a pub in public. Documents aren't public interviews correct. And is there anything. About this investigation. That you believe is in any way. It didn't. Biased. Or is is is not being informed by a process of seeking the. Truth. Note that the department of a special counsel should offer great especially given who that person is. Great comfort to Americans no matter what your political. Affiliation is. That this will be done independently confidently and honestly and do you believe that he should have full authority mr. Mahler. To be able to pursue that investigation. Yes and I'm and knowing him well over the years. If there's something that he thinks he needs he will he will speak up about it do you believe he should have full independence. Aaliyah. And he wouldn't be part of it if he wasn't gonna get full independence thinking. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Related Perfect Casting Helps Make 'The Comey Show' A Hit Asked if he thought Trump recorded any of the nine conversations Comey had with Trump, as detailed in his prepared remarks to the committee,  Comey said., ”It never occurred until the president’s tweet. And, I’m not being facetious, I hope there are. I all I can do is hope. The President surely knows whether he taped and, if he did, my feelings aren’t hurt, release all the tapes; I’m good with it.” The president took to Twitter in May, after sacking Comey, to tell him to think twice, in case he’s mulling whether to publicly contradict Trump’s assertion that the now-former FBI director three times assured Trump he was not under investigation, at a dinner and on the phone. POTUS told NBC News’ Lester Holt in an interview that Comey had asked to have dinner with him in January because he wanted to hang on to his job. At today’s hearing, Comey said that was not true and that he did not initiate the dinner or any of their phone conversations. During that dinner, Trump said Comey first assured him he was not under investigation as part of the bureau’s probe of possible Trump campaign collusion in Russia’s election meddling: James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017  Trump’s tweet seemed to suggest Trump had recorded those conversations, though he refused to elaborate in a Fox News Channel interview days later.  The tweet triggered TV news pundit to talk – again – of Richard Nixon and Watergate. Those pundits thought Trump ought to know that if he did record that dinner or those two phone calls he does not own them; they are federal records, thanks to Nixon.   Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 2 2 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

That was the beginning of the end for Tricky Dick. Reply Breal • on Jun 8, 2017 12:53 pm Who records on tape anymore? I’m sure you’ll hear Trump say “there are no tapes” when in reality, there are recorded files on hard drive.

It does not have a vertically oriented value chain. It stretches horizontally across multiple industries and markets such as Industrial automation, Automotive, Medical, environmental monitoring, and many more. The use-case for these industries are quite diverse. At the front-end of the applications are end-nodes or sensors, which monitor the ambient conditions and pass on the data down the chain. These end-nodes will be scattered in billions in various industries. Rise of Custom processors As mentioned in my earlier post ARM vs Intel: The new war frontiers, COTS processors will not be ideal for building these end-nodes, as the latter are application-specific. Companies would be inclined to custom-processor, as it offers flexibility to assemble only required parts. These parts can include analogue sensor, DSP or proprietary IP, etc. Further, custom processors substantially reduce BoM cost and die-size, which will minimize power dissipation. It also helps companies to differentiate their product from those of competitors. The low entry cost and pervasive presence of IoT industry will encourage many start-ups and small companies to build products for niche applications. With custom processors, these companies can further optimize the cost. Failing Moore’s Law In addition to the proliferation of the IoT devices that will give a huge boost to the custom processors, another influencing factor is questionable existence of Moore’s Law. For more than five decades, Moore’s Law acted as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Semiconductor companies raced to make this law a truth, irrespective of whether the market needs high performance processors. There are always the innovators and early-adopters that are desperate to use products based on leading process nodes. However, the mass market takes time to switch to these new products. With high-performance, reduced power consumption, and cost reduction, Moore’s Law ensured that technology played a dominant role. However, currently the economic equation that is guaranteed by this law, is failing. Leading process nodes are becoming complex to design, with long lead time for commercialization, thus the cost equation does not hold true. The quest for cost optimization forced the industry to look for alternatives, as shrinking nodes is no longer economically beneficial. Customization is the answer, as it can reduce the BoM cost significantly. The billions of end-nodes does not need leading process nodes, custom processors at matured nodes will be good enough. ARM’s response ARM is a monopoly in smartphone processor market. In the embedded and IoT space, there is no dominant architecture yet. ARM is ideally poised to fill up this vacant position, as it already has a strong presence with CPU IP offerings at diverse power, performance, and price options. With DesignStart license for Cortex-M0, ARM has enabled custom processor design at low cost with less risk. This program will be really useful for start-ups and small companies, as they get an access to proven architecture and IPs at low licensing cost, complemented along with an extensive ecosystem of IPs, software support and silicon partners that can massively reduce the time-to-market for products. How we can further optimize cost of custom processors? Enter RISC-V Open Source Software (OSS) has played a vital role in democratization of the software industry. One of the most popular examples of OSS is Linux operating system. OSS enables innovation and differentiation, at a low cost of adoption. This promotes small firms, start-ups to build products based on OSS such as Linux. A large community of developers supports the software development, so there is no risk of vendor-locking or obsolescence of proprietary technology. The collective efforts of the community ensure a large ecosystem, and this benefits all the users. Linux has gained enormous presence in diverse applications such as embedded, PC, etc. Network effects can also be leveraged, as more users start using Linux, more features, and utilities are added. RISC-V extends the open-source movement into CPU ISA. It is an open-source ISA that is license-free and royalty-free. As RISC-V is void of any licensing, the ISA can be used for building custom processors with zero licensing cost. RISC-V is gradually building an ecosystem. In Embedded World 2017, RISC-V showcased the extensive ecosystem with FPGA solutions, security IPs, debug infrastructure, etc. Few ARM customers have already started using RISC-V for designing custom processors. Now, SoC design companies can develop custom processors at a low cost, without the paying licensing rents. With some NRE investment, these firms can develop the SoC and get it manufactured in fabs. Thus, the price of the processor will be lesser than those based on ARM IPs. At the face value, it looks like we have found an ideal candidate that has the potential to become the dominant ISA for IoT industry. With customization & zero licensing cost, RISC-V looks like a winner. Is it really that simple? Are there free lunches? Linux is a quite successful with billions of deployment in diverse products. Although, it needs considerable effort and expertize in using Linux for commercial products, the benefits weigh over the man hours. Linux offers unmatched flexibility. The enormous community provides a good ecosystem around the OS, with extensive support for peripherals, 3rd party software, etc. However, extending the concept of open-source to chip design is a different ball game, owing to the basic differences between software and hardware. Unlike software, which needs only time and effort to be developed, hardware involves tangible components, for which someone has to pay. Secondly, you can rework on the software any number of times after testing on the hardware, emulator, etc. Bugs can be fixed with only investment in time and effort, maybe with minimal cost. However, bugs in the hardware can be a million dollar loss! Multiple spins of a processor can shoot cost substantially. Finally, hardware design is more complex than software development. Let us consider the case of open source RISC-V. In a SoC, CPU IP is just one part; there are many other physical IPs and peripherals needed. So, an extensive IP and EDA ecosystem is needed around the CPU IP. You can only get the CPU IP without licensing rents; however, the surrounding ecosystem is gone cost you. IP vendors should see a viable business case to add support for RISC-V in their portfolio. Let us assume that a strong community backs the RISC-V, and it offers all the IPs and tools needed for building SoCs. However, the question remains whether companies building custom SoCs, will take the risk of using a community backed ISA? Bugs can lead to multiple tape-outs, which add huge cost. Finally, designing a SoC is complex and needs good expertize in multiple areas such as implementation, physical design, packaging, etc. With ARM ISA, most of the issues mentioned above are alleviated. You get access to proven IPs, robust ecosystem (software, cloud services, security solutions, silicon vendors, fabs), and committed support, instead of community support offered by open-source ISA. Design complexity is reduced; however, still some expertize in SoC design is needed for building custom processors. Who will build RISC-V based SoCs? The idea of open-source is disruptive, as it enables a level-playing field to companies, with limited budget, to compete against big players. Although the concept of open-source ISA is revolutionary, it may not have a disruptive effect in democratizing chip design. In my view, it is unlikely that small companies and start-ups addressing some niche application in the IoT space, will invest time, effort and money in building custom processors based on a community-backed ISA, as they have to validate whether the entire system meets their specifications. It would be a safe bet for them to use licensed ISA, as they get a proven system, complemented with a robust ecosystem. Multiple tape-outs of the SoC can add substantial cost. A matured ISA with some initial cost would be a good starting point, instead of a free fledging ISA. SoC design is not their core activity, so hiring a diverse team for chip design, may not be a pragmatic decision. ARM is used widely across the industry, so the design part can be outsourced to some small companies, specializing in ARM-based SoC design. EDA tools and fabs are costly. EDA vendors and fabs already support ARM-based IPs; they should see economic benefits for adding support for RISC-V. Until RISC-V reaches a critical mass adoption, it’s like a chicken-and-egg situation. Multi-homing adds cost for any company be it a fab, EDA vendor, design firm, or an app developer. Low volume business will attract higher rents. All these cost overheads have to be factored while building RISC-V based SoCs. Market leaders in the SoC design will definitely develop RISC-V-based SoCs, as it increases their buying power by having some alternative to ARM. However, I believe that these companies will not be interested in engaging with low-volume customers, who needs custom processors. Owing to their large overhead, it makes business sense to sell millions of standardized SoCs. Summing from above, in my view RISC-V, in its current state, cannot significantly disrupt the semiconductor market structure. One of the key virtues of open-source movement is minimize entry barriers into a market by offering a good enough base, in comparison to licensed entities. Although, RISC-V will offer flexibility for building custom SoCs at low cost, the ecosystem is not yet ready to accept it. The whole semiconductor industry need to work in sync to make RISC-V successful. Conclusion It is too early to pronounce the verdict on RISC-V. Any new idea takes time to flourish. I am sure the people at RISC-V are smart enough that they would have foreseen the issues that I have mentioned above and many of the issues would have been already mitigated internally. In my view, RISC-V should focus on one segment such as IoT end-nodes or something else, and then offer this segment a compelling and complete solution, along with a holistic ecosystem, rather than focusing on the entire IoT and embedded industry. Once they achieve mass adoption in one segment, it is easier to spread into other segments, as new users have a great case study or example to look upon. What should ARM do better to be perceived as a leader in the embedded and IoT segments? I do not have any answer for this, as from an external perspective things look pretty well now for ARM, with a huge installed base. The upward trend will continue in future as well. Extending DesignStart license to other Cortex-M IPs would be a good option for further adoption. However, the main forte should be the strong ecosystem of OS support, cloud services, security, IPs, debug toolchain, EDA, silicon partners, etc. All these play a vital role in building a successful product based on a custom processor at low cost. Low-cost and customization are often mutually exclusive. Any ISA addressing both these ends will play a dominant role in the IoT industry. My views are limited to my knowledge. I believe there will be many lacunae in this post, so I look forward to the improvement areas. I do not have any professional obligations toward any companies mentioned in this post. The views expressed are completely personal.

enables a broad set of commercial-ready solutions such as the FRINX FD.io Distribution; Inocybe's High Performance Packet Processing Stack; and Netgate's pfSense News provided by FD.io 08 Jun, 2017, 12:00 ET Share this article SAN FRANCISCO, June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- FD.io ("Fido"), relentlessly focused on data IO speed and efficiency supporting the creation of high performance, flexible, and scalable software defined infrastructures, today announced the availability of its 17.04  software release, further cementing its position as the Universal Dataplane. The project's fourth release contains a set of new features to enable commercial-ready solutions for software-defined infrastructures. Created to address the gaps that exist in the open networking stack to deliver dynamic data plane services for dynamic computing environments like cloud, containers and NFV, the design of FD.io is hardware, Kernel, and deployment (bare metal, VM, container) agnostic.  Comprised of new and updated features across segments –including Dataplane Management Agent, Packet Processing, Network IO, and Testing – the 17.04 release delivers even more speed, efficiency, and resiliency to better support a modular and extensible IO services framework. Key features include the initial release of a User Space stack, Segment Routing, Service Function Chaining (SFC), and IPSec acceleration. With these new features, Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) within Container deployments – as well as highly-scalable IPSec workloads supported by a high-performing, low-latency IO connectivity – are now possible. "As the universal dataplane, FD.io is helping enable the developer community achieve the highest performance, throughput, and resource efficiency in networking across all deployment environments," said David Ward, FD.io Board Chair and SVP, CTO and Chief architect of Engineering, Cisco. "The latest 17.04 release delivers enhanced capabilities for packet forwarding, cloud, NFV infrastructures, and more. I am pleased to see the innovation momentum from the FD.io community." Key tenets of FD.io and the 17.04 release include: Hardware Acceleration. Improved IPSec performance addresses the increasing need to encrypt and authenticate data, control, and management traffic as it traverses public networks, including in NFV-hosted scenarios. 17.04 release includes the integration of the DPDK Cryptodev library within the VPP project bringing software and hardware encryption acceleration to the IPSec processing. DPDK Cryptodev allows VPP to take advantage of hardware acceleration from multiple vendors. Cloud Infrastructure. A key use case for the Universal Dataplane, the 17.04 release expands and improves FD.io's support for cloud infrastructure. Specifically: IPSec Security Gateway benefits from the highly- performing IPSec processing in 17.04. IPv6 is of increasing importance in cloud globally. FD.io supports this transition via improved support of more sophisticated IPv6 Security Groups. Further improvements in Network Address Translation (NAT) for passthrough protocols like Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Improved integration with the OpenDaylight (ODL) controller, including progress in support by the ODL netvirt project. Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVi). NFVi places additional demands on the network beyond those of cloud infrastructure. To address those demands, FD.io 17.04 includes several projects – such as Network Service Header_Service Function Chaining (NSH_SFC); In-band Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (iOAM); and Segment Routing, among others. Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). VNF vendors leveraging FD.io can now focus on developing core application functionality without needing to learn and develop network connectivity logic such as sophisticated Routing, VRFs, Switching, Segment Routing, or Service Function Chaining (SFC). By providing a userspace networking stack, FD.io facilitates the migration of VNFs from VMs to containers- based microservices. Containers. Containers offer the industry the opportunity to make innovative new choices in networking. FD.io 17.04 enables innovative support of container networking, which expands VPP use to enterprise and cloud deployment needs. Specifically, 17.04 introduces an experimental TCP Host Stack which provides a downpayment on moving the entirety of container networking into userspace for increased performance and scalability. Performance. Maximum performance continues to be a key priority for FD.io and its consumers. The 17.04 release retains this focus by increasing key use case performance from 10 to 19 percent beyond best-in-class performance witnessed in 17.01 release. This includes a 19 percent performance increase in vhost user performance – critical to cloud and NFVi deployments. A 4x performance gain in IPSec performance with use of Intel® AES New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI) and 14x gain with use of Intel® QuickAssist Technology (Intel® QAT) hardware acceleration. Maintaining that performance is achieved by the 120 unit tests, 258 system functional tests, and 679 system performance tests run automatically as part of the FD.io Continuous Integration (CI) process. This process ensures that each patch that comes into the system does not break functionality or degrade performance. In the 16 months since launching, FD.io has brought together more than 173 contributors from over 45  different organizations including network operators, service  providers, chip vendors, and integrators who are collaborating to enhance and innovate around the Vector Packet Processing (VPP) technology. The FD.io community has expanded beyond the initial VPP project to include an additional 16 projects –  addressing diverse requirements and usability needs across a variety of deployment environments. For more information or details on how to participate in the FD.io Project, please visit: https://fd.io. FD.io will host a Mini-Summit in Beijing, China on Tuesday, June 13. The event will be co-located with the OPNFV Summit, June 12-15. Comments from end users FRINX "FRINX is excited about the recent FD.io 17.04 release," said Gerhard Wieser, CEO FRINX.  "The FD.io team is continuously expanding its lead in data plane performance and advanced features for NFV applications and has established a new benchmark that has yet to be matched by the industry. FRINX offers 17.04 as part of our supported FRINX FD.io distribution with ML2 support." Inocybe Technologies "Our High-Performance Packet-Processing Stack, powered by FD.io's VPP component, is a powerful way for operators to invigorate their network and support cloud and accelerated NFV and SDN deployments," said Mathieu Lemay, Chief Executive Officer of Inocybe Technologies. "One of our mobile operator customers has been particularly looking forward to leveraging the new IPv6 Segment Routing features of the 17.04 release to route traffic and increase packet pushing capabilities." Netgate "We are very excited about FD.io's progress. VPP and DPDK are key to upcoming high performance releases of pfSense – and the Release 17.04 advancements made around IPsec, Cryptodev, NFVi, and VNFs dovetail into those efforts extremely well," said Jim Thompson, CTO of Netgate. "Specifically, we are just around the corner from new pfSense software that delivers up to 40 Gbps IPsec throughput and 42.6 million packets per second L3 routing using 64 byte packets – on commodity hardware. The number of serious enterprise class customers shifting to open source SDN is only going to increase as word of FD.io's progress gets out."

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links About PC Gamer Search Popular E3 2017 Battlegrounds Games of 2017 PC Gamer Club Far Cry 5 Hardware Guides Apple's new iMac Pro costs $5000, but is it overpriced? By Tuan Nguyen We attempt to put together the new iMac Pro for less. Comments Shares Near the end of the company's World Wide Developer's Conference yesterday, Apple announced a new desktop PC. No, not a new Mac Pro like many were hoping for, but a new all-in-one iMac... Pro. Here are the specs: 27-inch 5K display with 500 nits brightness and P3 color 8-Core Intel Xeon CPU, configurable up to 18-Core 32GB of 2666MHz DDR4 ECC RAM, configurable up to 128GB 1TB PCIe SSD, configurable up to 4TB SSD AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56 GPU with 8GB of HBM2, configurable to Vega 64, 16GB Front 1080p FaceTime HD camera Built-in stereo speakers, with 4 microphones, 3.5mm headphone jack 10GbE Ethernet Four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports Four USB 3.0 ports 802.11ac wireless with Bluetooth 4.2 SDXC card slot with UHS-II As far as specifications go, the iMac Pro is a pretty beefy PC, and in all the right places. It's got one heck of a CPU, and a yet to be announced AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56. Apparently from the iMac Pro specs page, AMD is going to announce a Pro Vega 64 as well. We reckon that these GPUs will be based on AMD's Vega Frontier edition, and not the consumer version of Vega that is supposed to be announced sometime in August. Apple says that the $5000 base price for the new iMac Pro is a good deal, comparing its new computer to similar systems, specifically HP, which Apple said would have costed you $7000 for a similar system. Could it work for gaming? Probably. Would it be the best gaming PC that Apple has ever released? Yes. Based on the CPU and GPU alone, the new iMac Pro would be a fantastic gaming PC. But the old adage is that Apple computers are overpriced for what they are and that if you DIY, you can get an equivalent system for cheap. So let's try it! We went to our friends at PCPartPicker and built a system that attempted to match the new baseline iMac Pro feature for feature, to see how much we would actually save: PCPartPicker part list: CPU: Intel - Xeon E5-2620 V4 2.1GHz 8-Core Processor ($408.99) CPU Cooler: NZXT - Kraken X62 Liquid CPU Cooler ($158.99) Motherboard: Asus - X99-E-10G WS SSI CEB LGA2011-3 Motherboard ($649.00) Memory: Crucial - 32GB (1 x 32GB) Registered DDR4-2133 Memory ($253.81) Storage: Samsung - 960 EVO 1TB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive ($479.99) Video Card: Zotac - GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB Founders Edition ($678.99) Case: Silverstone - TJ04B-EW ATX Mid Tower Case ($151.90) Power Supply: SeaSonic - PRIME Titanium 1000W 80+ Titanium Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply ($242.89) Operating System: Microsoft - Windows 7 Professional ($134.99) Monitor: LG - UltraFine 5K Display 60Hz Monitor ($1299.95) Other: ASUS Model ThunderboltEX 3 Expansion Card ($69.99) Keyboard: Apple - MB110LL/B Wired Standard Keyboard ($49.00) Mouse: Apple - MB829LL/A Bluetooth Wireless Laser Mouse ($79.99) Speakers: Logitech - Z130 5W 2ch Speakers ($18.99) Card reader: Kingston - Digital MobileLite G4 USB 3.0 card reader ($9.24) Total: $4686.71 What we end up with is an awesome PC that would give our high-end build competition. We also have a system that's a productivity powerhouse as well. Our build has Wi-Fi, 10-gigabit Ethernet ports, USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, and even Apple's own keyboard and mouse—although not the cooler space gray versions. Unfortunately, we only saved $313 by building it ourselves and that's only after sending in $25 worth of mail-in rebates. If you can build the exact same specs as the new iMac Pro, let us know in the comments. Specs aside, we're not going to get the svelte design of Apple's new iMac Pro, and its admittedly good manufacturing build and design. But you go into DIY knowing this from the get-go. What you do get in return though is the ability to expand internally, which the iMac Pro doesn't offer.  If you use NZXT's new BLD system, you actually end up paying NZXT more to build a machine than the $313 you would be giving to Apple to build the iMac Pro. This is also in-line with what system builders will charge, and in many cases you'll end up paying even more for higher-end boutique builders. So if we're comparing builders, Apple's actually a deal! Of course, $1,300 of our price tag is wrapped up in the 5K monitor. It's an understandable cost for Apple's build, especially when you consider the all-in-one design, but you can save a considerable amount of money—and still have a kick-ass gaming monitor—by building separately. For pros editing 4K video, the 5K display makes sense. This is the demographic the iMac Pro is targeting. For the average enthusiast though, a cheaper 4K display will suffice. While Apple may have charged a big premium for its computers years ago, it looks like this is no longer the case today. If you're in the market to spend this kind of money on gaming though, you'd obviously be better off with our extreme gaming PC build guide than an iMac Pro.

Related White House Questions James Comey's Timing In Early Release Of Hearing Remarks Committee chairman, GOP Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, and committee top Dem, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, have weeded out the fair-weather viewers with their opening remarks. Burr wondering if President Donald Trump repeatedly lifting Comey to lift the “cloud” of the FBI’s investigation into former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn in any way altered that probe. Warner insisted the hearing is “not about religitagting the election” and reminded America that Trump, who sacked Comey, called him a nut job, and publicly said that the firing took the heat off him, Russia probe-wise. Comey did not read his yeasty opening remarks released Wednesday for the committee, as expected, about his interacting with President Donald Trump in the weeks leading up to being sacked by POTUS. Clever Comey had the committee release them one day before testifying, as Donald Trump was in Cincinnati celebrating Infrastructure Week. Comey’s known as quite a performer at these clambakes. Who can forget his show-stealing “mildly nauseous” speech in May, when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, stoutly defending his decision to “walk into the world of ‘really bad’,” and go public about the bureau’s investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails just 11 days before the election!

By Ajay Kumar June 8, 2017 09:00am EST 10 Comments The new iPad Pro has a powerful processor and new multitasking functionality, but can it match the Microsoft Surface Pro for productivity? Apple's new 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the 12.3-inch Microsoft Surface Pro have more in common than just size. As the "Pro" in their names indicate, both tablets are targeted toward professional users—people who need a slate for media consumption and productivity. With both devices, you get a keyboard, stylus, powerful processors, and tons of storage, potentially allowing them to serve as laptop replacements. Read on to see how the two powerful tablets compare. Name Apple iPad Pro (12.9 inch, 2017) Microsoft Surface Pro (2017)   Lowest Price %displayPrice% %seller% $799.00 MSRP %displayPrice% %seller% $799.00 MSRP Editor Rating Dimensions 12.0 by 8.68 by 0.27 inches 11.5 by 7.9 by 0.33 inches Screen Size 12.9 inches 12.3 inches Weight 1.49 lb 1.73 lb Screen Resolution 2,732 by 2,048 pixels 2,736 by 1,824 pixels CPU Apple A10X Intel Core m3-7Y30 Operating System Apple iOS 10 Microsoft Windows 10 Screen Pixels Per Inch 264 ppi 267 ppi Camera Resolution 12MP Rear, 7MP Front-Facing 8MP Rear, 5MP Front-Facing   Read the Review Read the Review Design and Ports The iPad Pro and Surface Pro differ in form factor but have some elements in common. With the iPad Pro, you get Apple's classic, slim aluminum-unibody build with rounded corners, a glass front, and a range of color options including Space Gray, Rose Gold, Gold, and Silver. The Surface Pro similarly boasts a premium design with a platinum-colored magnesium alloy exterior, but its edges are more square and there's no additional color choice. On the other hand, you can buy Alcantara-clad Signature Type Covers ($160) that come in Platinum, Burgundy, and Cobalt Blue, providing a unique look and cushy suede-like surface around the keys and touchpad. Both are high-quality, good-looking slates, so aesthetics will largely come down to personal preference. Size is the bigger differentiator. The iPad Pro measures 12.0 by 8.68 by 0.27 inches (HWD) and weighs in at 1.49 pounds for the Wi-Fi model and 1.53 pounds for LTE. The Surface Pro is slightly smaller, measuring 11.5 by 7.9 by 0.33 inches and weighing 1.73 pounds without the Type Cover keyboard case. Both are lightweight enough to be portable, but you'll likely want a carrying case or bag. When it comes to ports, the Surface Pro makes a stronger argument as a laptop replacement. You get a USB 3.0 port, a mini DisplayPort, a 3.5mm audio jack, a microSDXC card reader, and a connector for power and docking. There's also a built-in kickstand. The only things missing are USB-C or Thunderbolt 3. By contrast, the iPad Pro has only an Apple proprietary Lightning port and a 3.5mm audio jack, so you can't hook up an extra monitor or wired accessories. Both devices have dual stereo speakers on both sides. Display Display resolution on both slates is excellent. The Surface Pro has a 12.3-inch Pixel Sense Display with a 2,736-by-1,824 resolution (267 pixels per inch), the same as the previous generation. Colors are bright and viewing angles are top notch. Contrast is high and the screen cuts down on the glare, with text and video looking crisp. That's good because the built-in kickstand lets you tilt it to a full 165 degrees when placed on a flat surface. The iPad Pro features a 12.9-inch Retina panel with a resolution of 2,732 by 2,048. That gives it a density of 264ppi, slightly less than the smaller Surface Pro screen. You'll also get excellent color reproduction and contrast due to the wide color gamut, True Tone, fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, lamination, and anti-reflective coating. It's also brighter and dynamically adjusts white balance for better outdoor viewing. Where the iPad Pro might have the advantage is fluidity and screen responsiveness. It has ProMotion, a technology that allows for a refresh rate of 120Hz. This makes scrolling more fluid, and reduces latency when using the Apple Pencil to draw. ProMotion can also reduce power consumption by adjusting display refresh rate to match the movement of the content, increasing refresh when playing games and reducing it for basic web browsing. We'll have to take a look at both slates side by side, but if smoothness and outdoor visibility are important to you, the iPad Pro may have the advantage. Processor, Battery, and Camera Performance is difficult to judge without running benchmarks and because the Surface Pro has a number of different configurations. In its fully specced-out configuration, you can have a seventh-gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, an Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 card, and a 1TB SSD. There's also dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. All this makes for a pretty powerful device, which should be 20 percent faster than last year's Surface Pro 4, which was powerful enough to run games like Civilization and Football Manager. The iPad Pro is no slouch either. While it doesn't have a desktop-grade chipset, the Apple A10X Fusion is a powerful processor with 64-bit architecture. It outstrips the blazing fast A10 on the iPhone 7 and should be able to handle just about anything you can throw at it in terms of multitasking and gaming. There's also dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. According to Microsoft, the Surface Pro should last for nine to 13 hours of usage, which is an impressive runtime for a large, bright display and should exceed the battery life of its predecessor. Apple claims a similar figure for the iPad Pro, claiming 10 hours of usage when surfing the web on Wi-Fi, watching video, or listening to music. We'll have to reserve judgment until we get a chance to run our battery tests. See How We Test Tablets The Surface Pro has an 8-megapixel rear camera that's capable of 1080p video. That's not as high as the 12-megapixel rear camera and 4K video capabilities on the iPad Pro. Not only that, but Apple has added optical image stabilization, cutting down on blurry shots and improving low-light shooting. The iPad similarly has a 7-megapixel front-facing camera, letting it take sharper selfies and video than the Surface Pro's 5-megapixel front sensor. Software and Accessories Software ecosystem is the biggest differentiator between the Surface Pro and iPad Pro. The Surface Pro comes running Windows 10 Pro with enterprise security and protection from the Windows Hello logon that uses an IR camera to scan your face. There's no fingerprint sensor, though. Where the Surface Pro really shines is that you can run the entire Microsoft Office suite, along with Lightroom, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro, which lets you do everything from editing Word documents to cutting video. Accessories include the wireless Surface Pen, Keyboard, and Mouse. The iPad Pro runs iOS 10, but it will get an update to iOS 11 in the fall, letting it take advantage of multitasking, drag and drop, and improved split-screen viewing of apps. Microsoft and Adobe apps provide similar functionality on the Surface Pro, but because the iPad runs iOS you won't be able to run any full version of a desktop application. Security is provided by Touch ID's fingerprint sensor. Accessories are similar to the Surface Pro; you can get the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard. There's no compatible mouse, though, again emphasizing that the iPad Pro runs a mobile OS and is not intended for desktops. All this means that for productivity, the Microsoft Surface Pro just can't be beat. Comparisons and Conclusions The new Surface Pro is available in a variety of configurations. The most affordable model starts at $799 and gives you a 128GB SSD, Intel Core m3 processor, and 4GB of RAM. If you need more power, the highest specced model has a 1TB SSD, Intel Core i7 processor, and 16GB of RAM for $2,699. Related Apple's New iPad Pro: Should You Upgrade? Apple's New iPad Pro: Should You Upgrade? The iPad Pro has a similar starting price. For $799, you can get the 64GB Wi-Fi-only model; 512GB of storage will cost you $1,099 (Wi-Fi) or $1,299 (LTE), making it more affordable than the comparable Surface Pro, which is $2,199 for 512GB. That said, the two slates have different capabilities. Despite the new multi-tasking features coming this fall, the iPad Pro can't run desktop apps and doesn't work with a mouse. If you plan to do some serious typing, spreadsheets, and video editing, the Microsoft Surface Pro will give you more mileage. On the other hand, if you want a slate that gives you the best of both worlds with an equal focus on media consumption and productivity, the iPad Pro is a good option, especially if you're already in Apple's ecosystem.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print COMEY HEARING STARTS AT 10 A.M. – Washington wonders: Will Trump tweet? – RYAN’S DEBT CEILING DILEMMA – Dozens of Democrats to sue Trump 06/08/2017 07:49 AM EDT By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) COMEY COMES TO CAPITOL HILL — Life inside the Beltway will come to a halt today as everyone tunes in to former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The hearing, which kicks off at 10 a.m., will be broadcast by the major networks and several local bars will carry the much-hyped event live. Comey’s testimony, the first time he’s speaking publicly since being fired last month, “has the power to plunge Donald Trump’s presidency even deeper into crisis,” Kyle reports this morning. Story Continued Below We already have some idea of what Comey will say, given that the Intel panel released his written statement yesterday. In it, Comey describes several uncomfortable interactions with Trump from January until April in which the president demanded loyalty, asked him to end the FBI investigation into Michael Flynn and at one point even called on Comey to “lift the cloud” around his administration by publicly denying Trump was under investigation. Comey’s statement: http://bit.ly/2rEvpgI THE BIG QUESTION — Will Trump lash out at Comey on Twitter? The president doesn’t have anything on his public schedule until noon. That’s two hours after the hearing starts and plenty of time for Comey to rattle Washington depending on how far he goes beyond his written testimony. “White House aides are trying to keep Trump busy Thursday morning with meetings so he won't watch TV and tweet during the hearing,” Matthew Nussbaum, Josh Dawsey, Darren Samuelsohn and Tara Palmeri report. “But if he wants to watch it, it's not like we can say, ‘oh, the TV doesn't work,’" one official said. More: http://politi.co/2rExc5q Even if Trump doesn’t tweet, the Republican National Committee circulated its talking points last night and has a team of 60 staffers ready to go on the offensive during the hearing, the Wall Street Journal’s Michael Bender and Peter Nicholas report. “Mr. Trump may be relatively new to Washington, but Mr. Comey is not,” write Peter Baker and Glenn Thrush for the New York Times. “A savvy veteran of the capital who has worked in high positions in multiple administrations, [Comey] has usually emerged on top in any internal power struggle. And in the month since his dismissal, Mr. Comey has shown why presidents are normally loath to fire F.B.I. directors.” FIVE THINGS TO WATCH TODAY, via Kyle Cheney, who will be in the hearing room: 1. How much will Comey say beyond his written statement? Top intelligence officials testifying Wednesday refused to detail their conversations with the president – including whether he asked them to pressure the FBI to end its Flynn investigation. Similarly, Comey could clam up on certain questions, citing the ongoing special investigation led by Robert Mueller. 2. Comey will have to square his opening statement with his previous testimony about the Russia investigation and his interactions with Trump. 3. The prospect of a Trump counterpunch, via Twitter or through surrogates, looms. 4. How will Senate Republicans question Comey? And will any go to bat defending Trump? And 5. Will Comey detail all of his conversations with Trump? Comey's written statement says he had nine one-on-one conversations with the president but only describes five in detail. Much more: http://politi.co/2rEyuNO WELCOME TO COMEY DAY, Thursday, June 8. Thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. WEDNESDAY’S MOST READ: Senate Democrats backing off calls for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s recusal, brought to you by Seung Min and Kyle, was the winner. STUCK BETWEEN A ROCK AND A DEBT CEILING — Speaker Paul Ryan is in an awkward spot: Does he back the clean debt ceiling hike now endorsed by the White House or does he stand with members of his conference, who are balking at the idea of raising the debt limit without spending cuts to match? “180 Democrats and 35 of us in the Tuesday Group will carry the heavy burden,” predicted centrist Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a Trump ally. “That’s what always happens, isn’t it?” Rachael with more: http://politi.co/2rEtclq RUSSIAN SANCTIONS THREATEN IRAN BILL — There’s a growing consensus in the upper chamber that senators should vote to punish Russia for meddling in the U.S. election as part of a broader bipartisan Iran sanctions bill. But senators have yet to coalesce around one of the many competing Russian sanctions proposals, and the lack of agreement is threatening to imperil the Iran bill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) “warned Wednesday that without a deal to vote on punishing Russia, Democrats would find it ‘very difficult’ to cast a vote on passage of the Iran bill,” Elana reports. More: http://politi.co/2rElnfn Senators are also expected to vote on an amendment blocking Trump’s weapons deal with Saudi Arabia as soon as today. The amendment is expected to fail, Elana reports, but will likely get more support than a similar proposal aimed at President Barack Obama last year. “Several senior Democrats who voted to allow Obama's Saudi sale are now shifting to oppose Trump's weapons deals, which are being rolled out without the humanitarian or political pressure that the previous White House had exerted on Riyadh.” More: http://politi.co/2rEBHgd Related tweet du jour: @ChrisMurphyCT: I know Comey hearing is the thing, but don't sleep on a possible Senate vote tomor on Saudi arms sale. I'm hustling for votes as we speak. I NEED YOU BUT I DON’T WANT YOU — Senate Republicans have a big problem: They are determined to make their Obamacare repeal more generous than the House version but they’re struggling with how to pay for it. Now some senators are saying they should keep Obamacare’s taxes in place for a few more years – something Republicans have long railed against – to fund the GOP replacement. “But the approach won't sit well with conservatives, particularly in the House. The House-passed repeal bill would have rolled back almost every Obamacare tax retroactively to Jan. 1, 2017,” Jen Haberkorn, Burgess and Adam Cancryn report. More: http://politi.co/2r8SjJv Related: Trump is “all in” on the Senate’s repeal plan but he’s taking a much softer approach in the upper chamber’s healthcare negotiations, Burgess and Josh Dawsey report. “Trump is impressing on party leaders the importance of success, yet is not directly engaged in the details of the bill and is not yet calling up wavering senators.” More: http://politi.co/2rEmewC DEMS TO SUE TRUMP — Dozens of Democrats are planning to sue Trump in the coming weeks, saying he’s breaking the law by continuing to profit from his sprawling real-estate empire while serving as president. “We’ll be suing to stop his violations of the emoluments clause,” senior House Judiciary member Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) confirmed to Huddle. Nadler said nearly 80 House Democrats and 25 Democratic senators have signed onto the lawsuit so far, which is being led by the Constitutional Accountability Center.

Jason Chaffetz’s exit from Congress later this month. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) is the favorite and widely expected to win. The real question is when Gowdy will take over for Chaffetz, who has resisted members’ calls to step aside. Chaffetz said he will “probably” give up the gavel before he leaves Congress June 30, the Hill’s Scott Wong reports. GIANFORTE’S MEA CULPA — Montana GOP Rep.-elect Greg Gianforte issued a lengthy apology Wednesday night for his “physical response” to Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs. Gianforte is facing assault charges after allegedly body-slamming Jacobs the night before the election. Gianforte said in the letter his actions were “unprofessional, unacceptable and unlawful.” “[You] did not initiate any physical contact with me, and I had no right to assault you,” Gianforte wrote to Jacobs. He’s also donating $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The Guardian: http://bit.ly/2r92PQR THE INNOVATION ISSUE: How should Washington think about innovation? What’s its role in the economy—and what does it take for government to foster new technologies that help the whole nation, not just a favored few?

In 2016 TTB processed a historic high 161,000 label applications and more than 14,500 formula applications. TTB is handling hundreds of trade practices and product integrity field investigations, and last year alone the agency collected $457 in tax revenue for every dollar it spent on enforcement. TTB is a model agency and America’s family-owned wine and spirits wholesalers are proud of our decades-long record of successful partnership with our regulator, guaranteeing product integrity and public safety.

Story Continued Below THE PRESIDENT’S THURSDAY -- Trump speaks at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to the Majority Conference at 12:15 p.m., and then will host governors and mayors at the White House for an infrastructure summit at 3:30. -- NOTES: The president has nothing before his 12:15 speech. Some of the newsiest bits of the hearing will be at the top. THE PRESS BRIEFING TODAY is with Sarah Huckabee Sanders and it will be off camera. Speaker Paul Ryan is holding his weekly press conference at 11:30 a.m. today in the Capitol. REMEMBER THIS -- Comey isn’t constrained by traditional political considerations. Today will shape his legacy. Our reporting tells us that members of Congress don’t expect him to accuse the president of a crime, but expect him to be extremely open about what transpired behind closed doors. We are told that he will, at times, go beyond what he wrote in his statement. THE BIG PICTURE -- NYT, A18 -- “Comey’s Political Shrewdness Is on Display in Tussle With Trump,” by Peter Baker and Glenn Thrush: “The morning, at least, seemed to go reasonably well for President Trump. He announced a new F.B.I. director, and two intelligence chiefs told Congress the president had never pressured them to interfere in the investigation into Russian election meddling. “And then James B. Comey … dropped the hammer. By authorizing the immediate release of the opening statement he plans to give in his much anticipated appearance before a congressional committee on Thursday, he instantly changed the conversation back to his assertion that the president tried to shut down part of the F.B.I. investigation. “Mr. Trump may be relatively new to Washington, but Mr. Comey is not. A savvy veteran of the capital who has worked in high positions in multiple administrations, he has usually emerged on top in any internal power struggle.

For those wondering: No, there will not be a limit. ‘We’ll give out 20 rounds’ if the president tweets 20 times, Ashley Saunders, the bar’s general manager, said.” http://nyti.ms/2rXKSc3 THIS TOWN -- “White-collar lawyers see opportunity in Trump scandals,” by Darren Samuelsohn and Andrew Restuccia: “More than a dozen attorneys and crisis communications specialists have already started working for Trump associates touched by the unfolding Russia scandal, according to a POLITICO tally. People close to the probes say that number is only expected to grow as more than 20 other senior campaign aides and White House officials begin receiving subpoenas, grand jury summons and other requests from special counsel Robert Mueller as well as congressional committees.” http://politi.co/2qYR2Wa ACROSS THE POND -- BRITISH ELECTION TODAY -- “Polls open in UK election after campaign marred by attacks,” by AP’s Danica Kirka in London: “Polling stations opened across Britain on Thursday for national elections, amid heightened security worries following a series of terror attacks in what one senior police official described as ‘unprecedented times.’ The public is being asked to be alert and to report concerns to police as voters choose 650 lawmakers for the House of Commons. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D’Orsi acknowledged concerns about Thursday’s general election.” http://apne.ws/2qYLB9t ANNIE KARNI: THE FIRST FAMILY -- “Melania Trump set to make her D.C. move next week: Staffers hope the first lady will be a stabilizing presence in a White House that's been consumed by scandal and infighting”: “With the school year over, first lady Melania Trump and the couple’s son Barron are expected to finally make their official move to Washington on June 14, according to people familiar with the planning. ... Over the past few weeks, the often stiff-in-her-role first lady has been spending more time in the White House, building out her East Wing staff, preparing the residence for the family and slowly increasing her schedule of public events. ... [T]he June 14 date is seen as a major marker on the White House calendar — when the first lady puts away the full matching set of Louis Vuitton luggage that she travels with and settles in for good.” With cameos by Sam Nunberg, Chris Ruddy and Anita McBride http://politi.co/2simMJL -- US WEEKLY COVER: “IVANKA TAKES A STAND … WHY I DISAGREE WITH MY DAD” (h/t Brian Stelter).

The story http://usm.ag/2rYva0u CAPITOL HILL WATCH -- “Trump ‘all in’ on Senate Obamacare repeal,” by Burgess Everett and Josh Dawsey: “At a meeting with congressional leaders on Tuesday, Trump urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to follow through on an aggressive timetable for repealing the law in order to quickly turn to tax reform and help avoid a calamitous autumn full of key fiscal deadlines, according to multiple sources familiar with the meeting.” http://politi.co/2rOpxzU -- IT’S IMPORTANT TO NOTE: Senators don’t like being told by Trump, or really any president, about how to run the Senate. While Republican senators have been working their way through how to pass a health care bill, GOPers across the ideological spectrum have been pessimistic about legislation actually passing. But most insiders note: don’t count out Mitch McConnell. THE JUICE … -- SPOTTED LAST NIGHT AT TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin with Tom Barrack, Vincent DeVito, Brandon Clark, Andrew Giuliani, Corey Lewandowski, Nick Owens, Lynne Patton, Jason Osborne, Jerry Pierce and Tim Rupli. -- FIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- MoveOn will formally call for impeachment proceedings this morning in anticipation of the Comey hearing. -- SEN.

Luther Strange.” http://bit.ly/2r8rTHR -- THE NRCC reported another $545,541 in spending against Jon Ossoff in Georgia’s 6th congressional district. Playbook Reads New Window CARTOON DU JOUR by Matt Wuerker. DRAIN THE SWAMP! -- “Trump White House lacks waivers for longtime lobbyists: Critics are questioning whether White House officials with broad portfolios can truly steer clear of conflicts of interest,” by Theo Meyer: “At least a half-dozen former lobbyists are working in President Donald Trump’s White House even though they haven’t received waivers from the administration’s ethics rules, raising questions about how much the rules do to prevent conflicts of interest. ... “The Trump administration has granted exemptions from the rules for a handful of staffers, as President Barack Obama’s administration did. But at least six former lobbyists now working in the White House haven’t received such waivers, meaning they must recuse themselves internally from any issue where they have conflicts, according to the White House. ... Five of the lobbyists POLITICO identified who haven’t received waivers work in Pence’s office.” http://politi.co/2sicWYj NEW TIME COVER -- “The Swamp Hotel: How Trump’s D.C. outpost became a dealmaker’s paradise for diplomats, lobbyists and insiders,” by Alex Altman: “[The hotel] is the new town square in Donald Trump’s Washington. Tourists perch on the blue velvet sofas in the lobby, snapping cell-phone pictures as power players stream across the dark marble floors and cream carpets: international businessmen, Republican operatives, wealthy donors, foreign diplomats, former Trump campaign aides, the occasional Administration official. That’s partly because a President who once promised to ‘drain the swamp’ of influence peddling now owns the city’s newest bog.” http://ti.me/2s72K5i ...

From the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954 to the Iran Contra hearings in 1987, House and Senate committees have held ordinary citizens in rapt attention. ... Comey’s testimony is in this sense an absolutely American phenomenon.” http://politi.co/2rY5nFI NICK SCHMIDLE in The New Yorker, “James Comey’s Intellectual History”: “Comey has told associates that he never tried to lure Trump into improprieties. ‘It wasn’t like Jim was going to the Mob boss, all wired up, trying to secretly extract a confession,’ one associate told me. Yet, in Comey’s view, Trump’s behavior toward him repeatedly crossed the line, making him ‘an obstructor.’ Based on Comey’s prepared remarks, his Senate testimony will lay the basis for this legal claim, without explicitly making the charge. His testimony is likely to be supremely assured. A senior intelligence official said of Comey, ‘He likes the stage. He takes politicians’ questions apart. He loves the fact that he’s smarter than them.’” http://bit.ly/2sGe9pz RICH LOWRY, “Comey’s fizzle”: “The document has considerable entertainment value in its dead-pan account of a profound mismatch, a Washington buddy movie gone bad. It’s a tale of a bureaucratically agile and self-serving careerist matched against an institutionally ignorant and self-serving outsider. One is careful, memorializing every conversation and calculating his every more; the other is blundering around in the dark — and eventually blows the whole thing up.” http://politi.co/2rNXfFB BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “GOP candidate [Ashley Moody] for Florida Attorney general once sued Donald Trump in federal fraud case,” by Florida Playbooker Marc Caputo: http://politi.co/2rOO1Jn THE INNOVATION ISSUE: In a month long Special Report, POLITICO’s The Agenda takes a deep look at the surprising new politics of innovation, and ideas for how to drive it in a new era.

Except in this case, that's wrong. G.Skill sent us a line informing us that professional overclocker (what a job, eh?) Toppc achieved a stunning 5.5 GT/s memory transfer rate using an Intel Core i7-7740K CPU astride an unspecified X299 motherboard. The new record is verified by HWBot and is a 500 MT/s improvement over Toppc's 5 GT/s record from last year. The memory used by the Taiwanese talent was obviously G.Skill's own, and the company confirmed that the modules in question were assembled using Samsung DRAM ICs. There's no real surprises to be found here; Intel promised that the Core i7-7740K would offer the highest gaming performance possible and as we've come to understand lately, memory performance can be a big part of that. Achieving that insanely high clock rate required insane cooling—in this case, liquid nitrogen. The achieved result isn't extremely useful in practice, because to hit that high number Toppc had to disable all but one core of the Kaby Lake-X CPU. That isn't unusual for these world-record overclocking attempts, though. The point isn't to create a usable overclock, it's simply to reach the highest number possible. Clock rates like this won't be coming to mere mortals like you or me anytime soon. You can get pretty close, though. The company announced limited availability of 4800 MT/s kits at Computex. We reckon that ought to offer some pretty solid performance in DayZ. Tags: Memory Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

(AMD) Stock Should Be Takeover Bait Dana Blankenhorn InvestorPlace June 7, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has risen from the dead under CEO Lisa Su, but it remains a small fry within the semiconductor space. It’s supposed to compete directly against Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphics chips, but Nvidia is worth $85 billion in market capitalization, versus just $10.4 billion for AMD stock. It is supposed to be the most direct competitor to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in microprocessors, but Intel is worth nearly $170 billion. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Should Be Takeover BaitMore Source: Shutterstock AMD is outgunned no matter where it turns. It only has the financial capacity to place a few bets. And while the new chips it showed off at Computex in Taiwan were impressive, it left unanswered questions about follow-up. The last time I wrote about AMD stock, I called it “trader” bait. That’s because just as Advanced Micro can go from $2 to $13 on good news, it can also go back down from $13 to $10 on bad news. Those kinds of swings are a trader’s dream, and an investor’s nightmare. Now it’s time to talk about what kind of trader it is bait for. Someone Needs to Buy Advanced Micro Devices It is time for someone else to own AMD. 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $10 The much-hyped assault by Advanced Micro against Intel’s gaming chip castle was barely noticeable because AMD lacks the financial capacity to follow up. Its Radeon graphics technology might work well in clouds, and its Ryzen line might look good in game machines, but AMD lacks the cash to pursue the breakthrough. A buyer with imagination — and more important, a lot of cash — could. If Softbank Group Corp (OTCMKTS:SFTBF) could see $31 billion in value from ARM Holdings, allowing its microprocessor designs to be tweaked before manufacture and controlled by OEMs in distribution, how much is AMD worth? A Chinese buyer of AMD like Lenovo Group Ltd. (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) would gain intellectual property, and the engineers who created it, that could make a wholesale assault on Intel possible. A Korean buyer like Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) would get designs to fill its fabrication plants. An American buyer like Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) would get the ability to enter new markets. There are a lot of potential buyers out there. Moore’s Second Law What I have long called Moore’s Second Law — the fact that chip equipment costs rise exponentially with their complexity, even while complexity makes their processing cheaper — has forced the semiconductor industry to scale financially, beyond AMD’s capabilities. Only four companies now have the wherewithal to build their own chip plants, and even the “fab-less” chip companies, which only design their processors, require enormous amounts of capital to compete. NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) is getting bought by Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) in large part because its radio chips need Qualcomm’s financial scale to compete. That should also be true for microprocessors. AMD, while it can make headlines and sales, and deliver good designs to the market, lacks the financial muscle to make a profit. It made a little money in the June quarter of 2016, but it has only come close since, and that’s with the power of Ryzen and Radeon behind it. Let the Auction for AMD Stock Begin There are two ways this auction can start. Either AMD can let it be known that it is willing to talk about a buyout, or someone in private equity can take a sizable stake and start pounding the table for one. Should You Buy Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Word of an auction would deliver a good pop in the AMD stock price, even before a deal was done. This is especially true if some of the bidders are Chinese, with all the implications of losing intellectual property to China that entails. What investors should know is that this column is pure speculation. I have no evidence that AMD is for sale. Wait for news, or at least a reliable rumor from a big trading house, before you move. Wait for it, then pounce. Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

"There is no way in hell that Jeff Sessions could preside over an investigation of a campaign that he was part of."  "If President Trump is listening tonight, Jeff Sessions had no alternative, Mr. President, as a lawyer. He had to get out of the way of the investigation because he was so close to your campaign. The American people would not tolerate somebody part of the campaign investigating the campaign. That was obvious to me." ADVERTISEMENT Graham's comments came amid reports that Sessions had offered recently to resign from the Justice Department after Trump became upset with him over his decision in March to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Tensions between the two men reportedly grew last month when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. While that announcement is said to have taken both Trump and Sessions by surprise, the president reportedly lashed out at the attorney general, blaming his recusal decision for Mueller's appointment. Sessions said in March that he would step away from the investigation after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak while he was a high-profile campaign surrogate for Trump.   Tags Lindsey Graham Jeff Sessions   View the discussion thread.

At Computex, Gigabyte hosted an X299 OC gathering that brought together nearly half a dozen of the world’s top enthusiasts including the company’s own senior overclocker, HiCookie. Utilizing liquid helium at -250° Celsius, the team was able to push Intel’s Core i7-7740K CPU to 7,500MHz (multiplier of 75 and a bus speed of 100MHz) on a Gigabyte X299-SOC Champion motherboard. A 16GB kit of Corsair Vengeance LPX 4,333MHz memory was also used, as was a Corsair AX 1500i power supply. The same CPU (albeit clocked a little lower), board and PSU combo was also used with an AORUS GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Xtreme Edition 11G graphics card and G.Skill Trident-Z 3600C17 RAM to set new world records in 3DMark03, 3DMark06 and Aquamark benchmarks. With a second 1080 Ti, the group was also able to reach the global first place position in 3DMark06 with a score of 71,176. While this type of extreme overclocking is largely for bragging rights and doesn’t imply that you’ll achieve similar results, it’s interesting to see just how far modern silicon can be pushed in the hands of experts with non-practical cooling techniques. Overclocking at such a high level is an art form, really.

News & Analysis DARPA Funds Development of New Type of Processor Worlds 1st Non-Von-Neumann R. Colin Johnson 6/9/2017 01:01 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet LAKE WALES, Fla. — A completely new kind of non-von-Neumann processor called a HIVE — Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit — is being funded by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) to the tune of $80 million over four-and-a-half years. Chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm are participating in the project, along with a national laboratory, a university and a defense contractor North Grumman.  Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Richland, Washington) and Georgia Tech are involved in creating software tools for the processor while Northrup Grumman will build a Baltimore center that uncovers and transfers the Defense Departments graph analytic needs for the what is being called the world's first graph analytic processor (GAP). Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) uses a sequence that begins with the multi-layer graphical representations of data (see figure) that open the way for graph analytic processing to identify relationships between data within and perhaps between the layers. (Source: DARPA) "When we look at computer architectures today, they use the same [John] von Neumann architecture invented in the 1940s. CPUs and GPUs have gone parallel, but each core is still a von Neumann processor," Trung Tran, a program manager in DARPA’s Microsystems Technology Office (MTO), told EE Times in an exclusive interview. "HIVE is not von Neumann because of the sparseness of its data and its ability to simultaneously perform different processes on different areas of memory simultaneously," Trung said. "This non-von-Neumann approach allows one big map that can be accessed by many processors at the same time, each using its own local scratch-pad memory while simultaneously performing scatter-and-gather operations across global memory." The patchwork of dies represents work funded by DARPA. "Beyond Scaling: An Electronics Resurgence Initiative" is pushing for a new era of microsystem structures and capabilities. (Source: DARPA) Graph analytic processors do not exist today, but they theoretically differ from CPUs and GPUs in key ways. First of all, they are optimized for processing sparse graph primitives. Because the items they process are sparsely located in global memory, they also involve a new memory architecture that can access randomly placed memory locations at ultra-high speeds (up to terabytes per second). Today's memory chips are optimized to access long sequential locations (to fill their caches) at their highest speeds, which are in the much slower gigabytes per second range. HIVEs, on the other hand, will access random eight-byte data points from global memory at its highest speed, then process them independently using their private scratch-pad memory. The architecture is also specified to be scalable to up to however many HIVE processors are needed to perform a specific graph algorithm. "Of all the data collected today, only about 20 percent is useful — that's why its sparse —making our eight-byte granularity much more efficient for Big Data problems," said Tran. The Giga Traversed Edges Per Second Per Watt needed for realtime graphic analysis that identify relationships as they unfold in the field is 1000-times faster (green) than the fastest GPU (blue) or CPU (red) today. (Source: DARPA) Together, the new arithmetic-processing-unit (APU) optimized for graph analytics plus the new memory architecture chips are specified by DARPA to use 1,000-times less power than using today's supercomputers. The participants, especially Intel and Qualcomm, will also have the rights to commercialize the processor and memory architectures they invent to create a HIVE. The graph analytics processor is needed, according to DARPA, for Big Data problems, which typically involve many-to-many rather than many-to-one or one-to-one relationships for which today's processors are optimized. A military example, according to DARPA, might be the the first digital missives of a cyberattack. A civilian example, according to Intel, might be all the people buying from Amazon mapped to all the items each of them bought (clearly delineating the many-to-many relationships as people-to-products). "From my standpoint, the next big problem to solve is Big Data, that today is analyzed by regression which is inefficient for relations between data points that are very sparse," said Tran. "We found that the CPU and GPU leave a big gap between the size of problems and the richness of results, whereas graph theory is a perfect fit for which we see an emerging commercial market too."

Project Wing, its experimental drone delivery project operating under the company’s secretive ‘moonshot factory’ simply dubbed X, has successfully deployed a prototype drone control system capable of managing flight paths for multiple drones from different providers at the same time. The tests were organized by NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and included three of Wing's delivery drones, flown by one person; two Intel Aero Ready to Fly drones flown by another person and an automated DJI Inspire drone doing a search and rescue mission. Wing's co-leader James Ryan Burgess explains, "Operators have historically had to steer their aircraft away from obstacles manually; instead, we demonstrated yesterday that our UTM (UAS Air Traffic Management) platform can automatically manage the flight paths of all these different types of UAS, planning new, clear routes for each aircraft if and when conflicts arise." The system leans heavily on other Google products like Maps, Earth and Street View to navigate drones around obstacles and plan routes. There’s a lot of work to be done before authorities clear commercial use for widespread drone deliveries, but this is a big step in the right direction. Going forward Wing will be looking to add support for more simultaneous flights and testing traffic in more complex environments — though not likely in urban areas just yet. Google is not alone in testing a traffic control system from drones. NASA showed off its own drone navigation system in 2015, while Amazon, Uber, GoPro and Airmap are all working on their own solutions.

Wind River®, a subsidiary of Intel® Corporation and a leader in delivering software for the Internet of Things (IoT), has engaged with the Transportation Research Center (TRC), The Ohio State University (OSU), and the City of Dublin to advance smart, connected, and autonomous technologies. The planned collaboration—focused around the Columbus region in central Ohio—aims to accelerate learning in the automotive community. The group looks to develop strategies and technologies that safely and securely increase the pace, quality, development, testing, and deployment of self-driving and other connected vehicle technologies. “The Central Ohio region is an emerging hub for smart city and smart vehicle technologies, and our unique ensemble approach—uniting minds from academia, the public sector, and the tech industry—can set a standard for how communities can innovate mobility and use the learnings to impact vehicle development and deployment best practices,” said Marques McCammon, general manager of Connected Vehicle Solutions at Wind River. “To realize autonomous driving for the masses, a variety of players must come together with an aligned understanding.” “Software is core to today’s automobile, and the automobile is a central part of our communities, so it is essential to be highly inclusive and collaborative when undertaking autonomous research. This makes a city like Dublin—which embraces technology and is already one of the most connected smart cities in the U.S.—such a natural partner,” adds McCammon. The group is planning to test emerging technologies to discover how a symbiotic relationship between vehicles and infrastructure can improve the lives of community residents. In addition to the self-driving cars themselves, the group plans to test technologies such as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, connected vehicle cockpit software, smart sensing and mapping, and the associated data collection. With Ohio State students, researchers, and faculty to play a key role, the collaboration is also intended to further develop the next generation of expert automotive minds. The key objective for the project’s initial phase includes joint development and testing of autonomous vehicles or “rolling laboratories.” Applying its expertise from the aerospace and defense, industrial, and automotive industries, Wind River plans to spearhead the project development and contribute its proven software for safety-critical systems. TRC is the largest independent proving ground and vehicle testing organization in the Americas. It is home to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Vehicle Research and Test Center and acts as a one-stop research and development source for the entire auto industry. With expertise in areas such as crash, emissions, and durability testing, TRC can lead the validation process for the collaboration’s vehicles and be the hub for build and rigorous testing on its 4,500 acres of road courses and 7.5-mile high-speed oval. Dublin, which has created high-speed connectivity for its businesses through more than 125 miles of underground fiber optics, is one of the end points for the 33 Smart Corridor —35 miles of highway between Dublin and East Liberty (northwest of Columbus), where the Ohio Department of Transportation is equipping high-capacity fiber-optic cable to link researchers with data from sensors along the road. The 33 Smart Corridor is primed to safely test technologies that can transform the way people and products are transported in Ohio and around the globe. The OSU Center for Automotive Research (CAR) team can provide hands-on support, leveraging its experience in autonomous vehicle research. OSU CAR focuses on energy, safety, and the environment, with an aim to improve sustainable mobility. With a concentration on preparing the next generation of automotive leaders, CAR emphasizes systems engineering, advanced and unique experimental facilities, collaboration on advanced product development projects with industry, and a balance of government and privately sponsored research. In the planned collaboration, CAR faculty and students would be instrumental in the algorithm development and integration of the collaboration’s test vehicles. In addition to supplying leadership for the overall program, Wind River can provide its expertise which has served the aerospace, industrial and defense applications for more than three decades. The Wind River portfolio of automotive products, Wind River Helix™ Chassis, includes technologies addressing infotainment, telematics, and digital cluster systems; safety-oriented systems such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems; and cloud-based development tools and enhancements for the applications. “From Mars rovers to trains, cars, and commercial and military aircraft, Wind River’s core business is developing and delivering mission-critical software. In exposing Ohio State and its students to this type of software and the processes that support the development of mission-critical applications, we hope their innovations can find a faster path to production,” said McCammon.

Of course, as everyone is familiar with most of Apple’s products, consumers would also want to know how well they perform. And right now, the iPad Pro is getting all the attention as it was just released a few days ago. One crucial thing to note about the new iPad Pro’s A10X Fusion chip is the fact that it shows promising performance for the iPhone 8’s A11 chip. So far, the chip has shown that it can go head to head with Intel’s line of mobile processors; which are installed on the updated MacBooks. The first evidence that shows the raw power one might have on the iPhone 8 is the GeekBench score for the A10X Fusion. Yesterday, there were numerous reports showing the impressive score of the new Apple ARM SoC. The chip on the new iPad Pro managed to grab scores of 3832 and 9091 for single and multicore, respectively. At the moment, the A10X Fusion chip sports a total of six cores per die. Taking this into consideration, if Apple chooses to add two more cores to the A11 chip, consumers could be looking at more than 10000 score on the multicore processing. The 9091 score is impressive enough, but when a multicore score reaches 10000, it is a whole new thing altogether. Apple A10X Fusion chip on the new iPad Pro (via apple.com) Another popular benchmarking tool used by many enthusiasts today is Antutu. This tool is used on almost all mobile devices like a smartphone or a tablet. It can test various features of a device which includes processor and graphics performance. On the said benchmarking tool, the A10X Fusion scored a total of 234082 points. This is a massive improvement in comparison to the iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion chip which managed a meagre 185494 points. To put this into context, that is a 26-percent increase in performance. Furthermore, when compared to the Samsung Galaxy S8, the A10X Fusion is still better by 14 percent. On the subject of the iPhone 8’s A11 SoC, if Apple decides to keep the 26 percent performance boost, consumers could be looking at an Antutu score close to 300000 points.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 9 June 2017 | MYT 11:49 AM Companies which will gain the most from cryptocurrency rush Cryptocurrencies rally spreads - Bloomberg MINING references generally evoke images of picks and shovels. For advocates of bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies surging in value, the gold may be in the shares of the companies that produce the computer processors and chips used to create the digital currencies in the process that’s become known as mining. Digital coins can only be created by using computers to solve complex mathematical problems. The difficulty increases as more of the problems get solved, prompting the miners to require even more powerful hardware. With digital coin prices soaring, demand for the components is surging as miners are able to recoup their initial investment quicker. A complete mining rig, which is made up of graphics cards, a processor, power supply, memory, cabling and a fan, costs between $2,400 to $3,800 on Amazon.com. The Antminer S9, which is estimated to mine 0.29 bitcoin per month, and retails for $2,795, which means you can break even in about four months with bitcoin at $2,700, without taking into account electricity costs. Miners typically buy complete rigs or build them themselves. The following are some of the companies that make the parts: Nvidia Corp The Santa Clara, California-based company manufactures graphic processing units used by gamers and increasingly, by digital-currency miners. GPUs listed in Nvidia’s website can cost as much as $1,200. The rig-mining market can grow to about $1.3 billion, and with GPUs making up approximately 2/3 of coin mining costs, the demand for GPUs can increase to $875 million, according to a RBC Capital Markets report on June 6. If Nvidia gets half of that, it represents a 10 percent increase on its GPU sales, RBC analyst Mitch Steves said in an interview. The company currently has about 75 percent of the GPU market, according to a Jon Peddie Research report. The complexity of mining bitcoin has increased to the point that GPUs aren’t powerful enough, and miners are mostly using application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices don’t make. Tech news website Digitimes reported Nvidia and AMD are planning to release GPUs specifically designed to mine bitcoin. Shares of Nvidia have climbed 45 percent this year, and have more then tripled in the past year. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, as the company is known, also makes graphics cards used for mining ethereum and other coins. The Sunyvale, California-based company’s shares have rallied the most in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in the past week, in part thanks to a PCWorld article that said it’s almost “impossible” to get AMD’s Radeon graphics cards after a surge in demand from ethereum miners.  The company also builds the processors typically used to build mining rigs, and its Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference its product compete with bigger rival Intel Corp. The shares are up 27 percent in the past month, and have almost tripled over 12 months. Intel Corp. Digital currency mining has the potential to boost demand for Intel’s processors, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. While AMD CPUs are popular among miners, Intel is the traditional leader in the sector and is taking steps to counter its fledgling rival. The company’s shares have lagged rivals, with a gain of 17 percent in the past year. Micron Technology Inc. Boise, Idaho-based Micron is the largest U.S. maker of memory chips, one of the components of a mining rig, so it also stands to benefit, Cassidy said. Micron shares have surged almost 50 percent this year, and have more then doubled in the past 12 months. - Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Economy , Forex Related Stories You May Be Interested Hong Kong, Singapore rivalry hobbling Asia in $100b fintech race Bain replacing KKR in Japan govt-backed bid for Toshiba chip unit Breath of fresh air: 4 ways to improve air quality at home 10 last-minute IKEA styling tips for Raya 5 superpowers that makes mum a hero 6 places you must visit in your lifetime Others Also Read We must not waste any time negotiating Brexit - Germany SoftBank unit buys robotics businesses from Alphabet Inc Double win for AirAsia at World Travel Awards Property Related advertisement Latest News Venture capitalist DST Global sees US$4 trillion of new internet firms by 2025 Hong Kong, Singapore rivalry hobbling Asia in $100b fintech race Oil stabilises after steep falls, but supply glut prevails French central bank tweaks growth estimates higher, sees budget rule break EU fears Brexit delay, uncertainty after shock UK vote Most Viewed in Business UK election upset pummels pound, dn 1.5% to ringgit Malaysian ringgit to rally to eight-month high, top banker says EU fears Brexit delay, uncertainty after shock UK vote Tenaga again lifts KLCI, banks advance, ringgit firm JF Tech share price surge draws query from Bursa Hua Yang maps out strategy Moody’s: Merger plan is credit positive for AmBank Oil stabilises after steep falls, but supply glut prevails Rising foreign holdings of MGS Media Prima clarifies appointment of chairman advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

NBC News’ Kasie Hunt cited two unnamed sources who said the meeting is set for mid-June but did not name a specific date. According to Hunt, the meeting is a first step toward Kushner providing documents to the panel and answering its questions. NBC News: Jared Kushner will meet with Senate Intelligence Committee staffers mid-month, two sources tell NBC's @kasie Hunt — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) June 8, 2017 BREAKING ON NBC: Jared Kushner will meet with Senate Intel staff mid-month, 1st step in agmt to also provide docs & take senator qs — Kasie Hunt (@kasie) June 8, 2017 The Washington Post reported in May that Kushner, who is President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, spoke in December to Russia’s ambassador to the United States about setting up a communications backchannel between Trump’s transition team and Moscow. Reuters reported the same day that on his application for a security clearance, Kushner failed to disclose at least three contacts he had with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Kushner’s meetings with a Russian banker are also under scrutiny, according to a report by the New York Times, and the congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election — including the Senate Intelligence Committee — reportedly want to question Kushner about whether he sought Russian financing for his family’s Manhattan tower from the banker. Trump said in May that he had “total confidence” in Kushner, but appeared to joke in June that he was less than pleased with Kushner’s increased visibility. “Jared’s actually become much more famous than me,” Trump said, to laughter. “I’m a little bit upset about that.” ABOUT THE AUTHOR Esme Cribb Follow @emquiry Esme Cribb is a newswriter for TPM in New York City.

When the company launched the virtual SAN software some three years ago it was a comparatively barebones product developed to provide virtual SAN storage by aggregating the physical directly-attached storage on a cluster of VMWare host nodes and then present it as a shared block-access resource pool. Fast forward to today and VMware vSAN now a much more sophisticated product, having been regularly updated by VMware with new versions offering enhanced features and capabilities. The sixth and most recent version, VMware vSAN 6.6, was announced in mid-April. So what does vSAN 6.6 have to offer? Many things. One of the key changes is increased performance: vSAN 6.6 offers up to 50% better all-flash IOPS performance compared to the previous version, according to the server virtualization technology company. That means performance on the order of 150,000 IOPS per host, which translated means it is certainly no slouch. It will come in handy for mission-critical workloads, and newly validated architectures now provide support for Hadoop, Citrix XenApp, InterSystems Cache, and Splunk. That performance boost is due to the use of "optimized data service algorithms," according to VMware. What exactly does that mean? Specifically, some of these performance enhancements include: Reduced overhead of checksum Improved deduplication and compression De-staging optimizations Object Management improvements iSCSI for vSAN performance improvements vSAN 6.6 also now supports Intel's high speed 3D XPoint-based Optane SSDs, which can help boost the performance of write-intensive applications like big data and streaming analytics. What Else Is New in VMware vSAN 6.6 What else is new? Well, VMware has also beefed up the security of vSAN with some new encryption capabilities. "In order to deploy vSAN and accommodate compliance requirements, some companies require data encryption at rest," Michael Haag, a VMware manager, told Virtually Speaking. As a result, vSAN 6.6 now includes data-at-rest encryption, which is hardware agnostic, so it can be deployed on existing storage hardware (including Optane drives). Things can be kept (relatively) simple using a single key per cluster, which can be managed by standard key management systems. The encryption is dedupe- and compression-aware — basically that means that all three features work together. Which is nice. The latest version of vSAN has also been designed to be far more resilient in the face of hardware failures, according to Haag. For example, it offers enhanced Stretched Clusters with local protection to provide resiliency against both site and local component failures. That means if you lose one site, you are still OK, and you are still good even if one or two nodes then fail at the second site. All this can be yours, VMWare promises rather fuzzily, "for up to 50% less than leading traditional storage solutions." Make of that what you will, and take it with a pinch of salt. And take note that Enhanced Stretched clusters, as well as the new encryption capabilities, are only available in the vSAN Enterprise Edition. There is also a new redundant management plane, meaning it is still possible to manage vSAN storage even if vCenter goes down. That's because each node now has a GUI that is independent of vCenter and enables users to manage storage in the event of a vCenter meltdown. No discussion of anything to do with virtualization is complete these days without a nod to containerization as well, so here goes: there's now a vSphere Docker Volume Driver, so vSAN 6.6 provides snapshotting and cloning capabilities and multi-tenancy for Docker users deploying their Docker containers on vSAN through the Docker API. All in all, it's a big update to vSAN, and it should be available from May 5. Pricing is from $2495 per CPU, with vSAN for Desktop pricing starting at $50 per user.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login Home News E3 2017 E3 press conferences: who what where when why whom By Alice O'Connor on June 8th, 2017 at 8:30 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit E3, the event “as close as this industry gets to Eurovision“, officially begins on Tuesday. Thousands of developers, members of the press, and gawkers will descend upon Los Angeles for the four-day trade show, full of demos, presentations, and questions like “How many guns does this have?” E3 unofficially begins before then, mind, with publishers and platform holders livestreaming presentations from Saturday. Most of the announcements come from these and, as Graham said, they are pretty Eurovision. What to watch and when? Here’s our roundup of E3 livestreams. Electronic Arts Saturday, June 10 12pm Pacific / 3pm Eastern / 8pm UK time / 9pm CEST Watch on Twitch Expect to see Battlefield 1’s In the Name of the Tsar DLC, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed: Payback, FIFA 18 (did you know Ronaldo’s in it?), and possibly the mysterious Star Wars game being made by Dead Space devs Visceral. Also Madden and all that and whatever. Microsoft Sunday, June 11 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK time / 11pm CEST Watch on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Microsoft’s own Mixer doodad (the rebranded Beam) Blah blah Xbox Project Scorpio blah blah console VR. All Microsoft’s Xbox One games these days seem to also be Windows 10 games so there should be plenty for us. I’d expect to hear about Forzas, Halos, and hopefully Crackdown. It’d seem a good time to announce a release date for pirate ’em up Sea of Thieves too. Bethesda Sunday, June 11 9pm Pacific / midnight Eastern / 5am Monday UK time / 6am Monday CEST Watch on Twitch and YouTube I’m hoping for an hour-long video of B.J. Blazkowicz’s sad eyes blinking and averting their gaze. Devolver Digital Sunday, June 11 10pm Pacific / 1 am Monday Eastern / 6am Monday UK time / 7am Monday CEST Watch on Twitch’s Twitch as part of their First Ever Second Pre Pre Show Devolver Digital swear blind they won’t reveal any new games but they will have Grasshopper Manufacture’s Suda51. That seems a fair trade. PC Gaming Show Monday, June 12 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm UK time / 6pm CEST Watch on Twitch, Mixer, and Facebook The folks at cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer are hosting their PC Gaming Show this year. We already know something XCOM 2-y will be announced. Intel, Nexon, Bohemia Interactive, Xbox, Tripwire, and Cygames are official partners so I assume they’ll show stuff, but personally I’m hoping the rest of the 17 hours will be people showing off weird mods. Ubisoft Monday, June 12 1pm Pacific / 4pm Eastern / 9pm UK time / 10pm CEST Watch on Twitch and YouTube Ubi’s known games include Far Cry 5, The Crew 2, and South Park, and oh god will they please announce Assassin’s Creed: Origins already this is exhausting. Sony Monday, June 12 5pm Pacific / 8pm Eastern / 1am Tuesday UK time / 2am Tuesday CEST Watch on Twitch and Sony’s own doodad Given that most games are multiplatform these days, Sony will surely show off plenty of third-party games that are also coming to PC. Microsoft and Sony do scrap over publishers to drop hot scloosies in their shows. Nintendo Tuesday, June 13 9am Pacific / noon Eastern / 5pm UK time / 6pm CEST Watch on Twitch and YouTube No, none of Nintendo’s games will come to PC. So? Nintendo’s streams are always full of wonderful things that lift the spirits. I’m always exhausted by this point of E3 (when technically it hasn’t even started) and find this a delight. I haven’t even owned a Nintendo system since the DSi. That’s the bigguns! Obviously a million sites will have their own streaming odds and ends with developers all over. If you’re very lucky, you’ll be able to tune into a livestream of me barely awake at 5am watching streams and talking to the bottle I’ve sworn off. So, gang, what are your bets on this year’s overused buzzwords? ‘Visceral’ is always a safe bet and our Adam thinks ‘authentic’ will do well this year. Oh, and a hot tip: given how many people will be throwing around business terms next week as if they’re Gordon flipping Gekko, you might want to use this Chrome extension which replaces the term ‘IP’ with ‘immense penis’. I’ll settle for pelting pennies at the foreheads of anyone talking about ‘IPs’, ‘titles’, and ‘winning E3’.

Log in to Reply 08/06/2017 at 21:20 Nokturnal says: Was just asking that myself. I suspect it’s because this is just the livestreams being listed and, let’s be honest, the big companies just spit out the same shit every year anyway so this lineup was bound to be dry as ever. I’ll just check up on it post-E3 to see the good stuff.

On the other hand, I ADORED the uncharted series, it’s very obvious Hennig hasn’t lost her touch, so if they ever COULD get her back to do another proper LoK game I would probably combust from excitement… Log in to Reply 09/06/2017 at 03:17 Ejia says: While I’d love the next Elder Scrolls game to be in fantasy catpeople Ancient Egypt, it will probably be set in Hammerfell, with pirates and such. Maybe Killer7 will pop up on PC – although since both the GameCube and PS2 are emulated technically you can play it on one. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Peter Bright - Jun 9, 2017 12:11 am UTC Enlarge / Physical serial ports (the blue ones) are fortunately a relic of a lost era and are nowadays quite rare to find on PCs. But their virtual counterparts are alive and well, and they can be used for some exciting things. Ericf reader comments 35 Share this story When you're a bad guy breaking into a network, the first problem you need to solve is, of course, getting into the remote system and running your malware on it. But once you're there, the next challenge is usually to make sure that your activity is as hard to detect as possible. Microsoft has detailed a neat technique used by a group in Southeast Asia that abuses legitimate management tools to evade firewalls and other endpoint-based network monitoring. The group, which Microsoft has named PLATINUM, has developed a system for sending files—such as new payloads to run and new versions of their malware—to compromised machines. PLATINUM's technique leverages Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT) to do an end-run around the built-in Windows firewall. The AMT firmware runs at a low level, below the operating system, and it has access to not just the processor, but also the network interface. The AMT needs this low-level access for some of the legitimate things it's used for. It can, for example, power cycle systems, and it can serve as an IP-based KVM (keyboard/video/mouse) solution, enabling a remote user to send mouse and keyboard input to a machine and see what's on its display. This, in turn, can be used for tasks such as remotely installing operating systems on bare machines. To do this, AMT not only needs to access the network interface, it also needs to simulate hardware, such as the mouse and keyboard, to provide input to the operating system. But this low-level operation is what makes AMT attractive for hackers: the network traffic that AMT uses is handled entirely within AMT itself. That traffic never gets passed up to the operating system's own IP stack and, as such, is invisible to the operating system's own firewall or other network monitoring software. The PLATINUM software uses another piece of virtual hardware—an AMT-provided virtual serial port—to provide a link between the network itself and the malware application running on the infected PC. Communication between machines uses serial-over-LAN traffic which is handled by AMT in firmware. The malware connects to the virtual AMT serial port to send and receive data. Meanwhile, the operating system and its firewall are none the wiser. In this way, PLATINUM's malware can move files between machines on the network while being largely undetectable to those machines. Enlarge / PLATINUM uses AMT's serial-over-LAN (SOL) to bypass the operating system's network stack and firewall. Microsoft AMT has been under scrutiny recently after the discovery of a long-standing remote authentication flaw that enabled attackers to use AMT features without needing to know the AMT password. This in turn could be used to enable features such as the remote KVM to control systems and run code on them. However, that's not what PLATINUM is doing: the group's malware requires AMT to be enabled and serial-over-LAN turned on before it can work. This isn't exploiting any flaw in AMT; the malware just uses the AMT as it's designed in order to do something undesirable. Both the PLATINUM malware and the AMT security flaw require AMT to be enabled in the first place; if it's not turned on at all, there's no remote access. Microsoft's write-up of the malware expressed uncertainty about this part; it's possible that the PLATINUM malware itself enabled AMT—if the malware has Administrator privileges, it can enable many AMT features from within Windows—or that AMT was already enabled and the malware managed to steal the credentials. While this novel use of AMT is useful for transferring files while evading firewalls, it's not undetectable. Using the AMT serial port, for example, is detectable. Microsoft says that its own Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection can even distinguish between legitimate uses of serial-over-LAN and illegitimate ones. But it's nonetheless a neat way of bypassing one of the more common protective measures that we depend on to detect and prevent unwanted network activity.

NBC News reporter Kasie Hunt first broke the news Thursday night. Two Congressional sources told NBC News that Kushner intends to meet with staff in mid-June on the condition that he submit documents and answer questions from the senators themselves at a later time.   BREAKING ON NBC: Jared Kushner will meet with Senate Intel staff mid-month, 1st step in agmt to also provide docs & take senator qs— Kasie Hunt (@kasie) June 8, 2017   A source familiar with the matter on Thursday confirmed the meeting to CNN, adding it is unclear when Kushner would meet panel members, though top committee member Sen. Angus KingAngus KingAngus King on Trump-Comey ‘tapes’: ‘Release them’ Kushner to meet with Senate Intel staff: reports The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (I-Maine) told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the meeting was scheduled for next week. The news comes just hours after former FBI Directer James Comey's bombshell testimony before the same committee. Reuters in May reported that Kushner had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during and after Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Shortly after, The Washington Post reported that Kushner spoke with Kislyak early last December about establishing a private communications line between the Kremlin and Trump’s transition team. Kushner reportedly inquired about using Russian diplomatic facilities for the communications to shield the talks, U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports told The Post. Kushner’s attorney last month said that his client would cooperate on any probes of his past meetings with Russians and Trump said he has “total confidence” in Kushner following the reports.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Image Source: iFixit New MacBook Pro teardown: Meet the old boss Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 8th, 2017 at 5:43 PM Share Tweet Apple’s “new” MacBook Pro lineup hit stores today, which means it’s time for an old tradition: ripping apart the brand-new hardware in the name of science and computer porn. iFixit has taken its favorite collection of prybars to the new machines, and as you might’ve guessed, not much has changed. There were a few welcome surprises that Apple didn’t mention, though. Don't Miss: Apple’s ambitious iPhone 8 design could already be causing problems The only significant change from a specs perspective is the new Kaby Lake processor in the updated MacBooks. Intel’s latest-gen processor is around 20% faster in real-world use, and a little more battery-efficient. You don’t see any of that in the design, however, as it’s still just a soldered-on processor that you can’t change yourself. Both the MacBook Pro and Retina MacBook are still nearly impossible to fix yourself. Both machines score a 1/10 on the repairability scale from iFixit, because as the organization points out, “In both units, the processor, RAM, and flash memory are still soldered to the logic board. The battery assemblies are still entirely, and very solidly, glued into the case, thus complicating replacement.” The only really good news is that the updated Retina MacBook has the newer key assembly that Apple introduced last year with the new MacBook Pro. It means the keyboard is still thinner, but the feel and clickiness of the keys is closer to Apple’s traditional laptops. Overall, the news is pretty much what we expected: Intel’s components are the only major change here. A new keyboard for the Retina MacBook is good news for sure, but it’s still not going to make people hungering after their mechanical keyboards happy, per se.

Joe Donnelly (D – IN) told I-Team 8 Thursday that he was “very concerned” by former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony that President Trump asked him to “let go” of the FBI’s investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. That revelation, first reported by the New York Times last month, was further catapulted into the public eye Thursday as Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee as it continues to investigate Russia’s role in the U.S. election. During his nearly three hours of testimony, the former FBI director told the panel of senators that he felt his firing by President Trump was directly related to his handling of the FBI’s investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Comey also said that he felt “stunned and concerned” by a White House dinner conversation with President Trump earlier this year in which Comey said President Trump asked him to “let go” of the FBI’s probe into ties between Flynn and Russians. Flynn had been forced to resign amid a White House scandal in which he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his ties or prior conversations with Russian officials. READ: Joe’s statement on #JamesComey’s testimony before Senate Intel Committee. pic.twitter.com/s2YSxLRxdO — Senator Joe Donnelly (@SenDonnelly) June 8, 2017 During Comey’s testimony Thursday, the former FBI director first blasted President Trump and his administration as liars for defaming the FBI and claiming the department was in disarray in the days that surrounded Comey’s firing. Prior to being fired, Comey said that he began taking contemporaneous notes of his meetings with President Trump after he became concerned that he might later need a record of their conversations. During the Senate hearing, Comey was asked if Trump’s request about the Flynn matter would arise to the level of obstruction of justice. Comey said he would have to defer to special counsel Robert Mueller, who was investigating the matter. Donnelly echoed Comey’s comments. “It’s very, very concerning, but I will also defer to Robert Mueller. That’s the purpose of the special counsel in this process is to review what did happen in regards to potential criminal investigation and to make those decisions,” Donnelly told I-Team 8. Comey also revealed that while he was investigating the scandal surrounding Hillary Clinton’s emails last year, that then-acting Attorney General Loretta Lynch asked him to refer to the FBI’s inquiry as “a matter” rather than “an investigation.” Donnelly, who stumped for Clinton in Indiana during last year’s election, said Lynch never should’ve made that request. One major revelation during Thursday’s Senate hearing came from Comey himself, as he acknowledged that he was behind the leak to the New York Times of his memos about meetings with Trump. Comey testified that after seeing Trump’s tweet that there may have been tapes of their conversations, Comey felt compelled to put his notes out into the public arena. He said he asked a friend who is a Columbia Law School professor to share the contents of the memos with the New York Times. Comey caught heat for the leak during the Senate hearing and for his failure to confront the president on his request that he “let go” of the Flynn matter. Comey said he should’ve been “stronger” and later “if he had it to do over again, maybe” he would’ve acted differently. Donnelly, during the interview with I-Team 8, appeared to come to Comey’s defense. “As we look at this from both sides, the Justice Department should not be Democrat or Republican. The Justice Department works for the people of this country. Their boss is the U.S. Constitution and the people who live in this great nation. That’s who I think Director Comey has worked for every single day,” he said. I-Team 8 also reached out to Sen. Todd Young (R- IN) for comment. A spokesman said there would be no statement. The rest of Indiana’s largely Republican congressional delegation remained silent about the Comey hearing on their various Twitter accounts.

By Travis Pope Posted on 06/08/2017 The 12.9-Inch iPad Pro and the 2017 Surface Pro are capable laptop replacements this summer that will shoppers need to compare. The iPad Pro and 2017 Surface Pro share many characteristics. Users can skip typing with on their screens and purchase a keyboard accessory. Apple’s iOS 11 update expands on the multitasking features of the iPad Pro while Windows 10 already offers robust multitasking. Their differences make them hard to choose between though. Some 12.9-Inch iPad Pro models connect to LTE when there’s no Wi-Fi. The 2017 Surface Pro won’t have this feature until Fall 2017. iPads rely on the iTunes App Store for new apps. New touch-friendly apps are available from Windows 10’s store. Users can download the desktop programs they need from the web in addition to those available in the Windows 10 store. The 12.9-Inch iPad Pro and the 2017 Surface Pro will allow you to stay productive and entertained with just a single device when they go on sale. To get the most out of the experience you’ll need to choose the right one for your needs. 12.9-Inch iPad Pro vs 2017 Surface Pro: Design An iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil. The 12.9-Inch iPad Pro is a light and thin slab of a glass and aluminum. It comes in silver, gold and Space Gray. Models that can connect to mobile data networks weigh just 1.53 pounds. The Wi-Fi only 12.9-Inch iPad Pro weighs 1.49 pounds. Every 12.9-Inch iPad Pro is 0.27-inches thick. On the front are the 12.9-inch 2732 x 2048 resolution display it takes its name from. A TouchID fingerprint reader and 7-megapixel FaceTime camera sit above and below this display. The 12.9-Inch iPad Pro has a 12-megapixel camera sensor with flash is on the back. This camera has auto-focus, noise reduction and optical image stabilization. It can record video that’s four times as sharp as HD video. The headset jack, volume controls, Lightning port, power button and Smart Connector run along its edges. Four speakers pump audio out of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s corners. LTE models have a Nano-SIM card slot for connecting to mobile data networks. To keep things simple, iPads lack a USB port, Display Port and Micro SD slot. Adapters for the Lightning port let buyers add accessories when they need to. Offloading music, pictures and video to iCloud when storage space gets low is possible. The 2017 Surface Pro only comes in silver. Its least powerful model weighs 1.69 pounds and is a third of an inch thick. The more processing power you add, the heavier it becomes. A 2017 Surface Pro with Core i7 processor weighs 1.73 pounds. The 2017 Surface Pro’s kickstand angle is more comfortable for artists. Surface Pro buyers don’t need a case or cloud storage. Its kickstand extends up to 165 degrees. A Micro SD card slot hidden behind the kickstand lets buyers add storage. There’s an 8-megapixel camera on the back that won’t take pictures as sharp as the iPad Pro’s camera. The 8-megapixel camera on the back of the 2017 Surface Pro won’t take pictures as sharp as the iPad Pro’s camera. The sides of the 2017 Surface Pro have ways to connect accessories. The Surface Connect port on the right edge allows for docking. A full-size USB 3.0 port and Mini Display Port also sit on the right. Keyboard covers snap to a port on the tablet’s bottom edge. The headset jack is the only port on the left edge. Volume and power buttons are on the top edge. The 2017 Surface Pro has no fingerprint reader on the front. Instead, Microsoft wants users to log in by gazing at the 5-megapixel Windows Hello camera above the display. iPad Pro has four speakers, but Surface Pro only has two, and they face the user. The 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824 is only slightly sharper than the 12.9-Inch iPad Pro’s display. 12.9-Inch iPad Pro vs 2017 Surface Pro: Internals & Accessories The 2017 Surface Pro is a confusing mess of different processors, RAM, graphics hardware and storage. Finding the right 12.9-Inch iPad Pro for your needs is easy. The cheapest 2017 Surface Pro has an Intel Core m3 processor, 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. 1TB of storage, an Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM are inside the most powerful 2017 Surface Pro. If you edit video or really need processing power on the go, the most expensive model delivers. Every 2017 Surface Pro has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. A gyroscope lets them detect motion for games. An accelerometer lets the tablet know which way to orient the display. The tablet adjusts display brightness on its own thanks to a light sensor. Compare that complicated line-up to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s simpler offerings. No 12.9-Inch iPad Pro outperforms the other. Buyers just pick a color, storage size and LTE connectivity. Apple’s A10X Fusion chip handles processing. Bluetooth 4.2, 802.11 AC Wi-Fi and a digital compass come in each. They all have an accelerometer and gyroscope for motion gaming. A light sensor adjusts display brightness depending on how bright the room is. The built-in barometer lets apps detect altitude. Accessories Any tablet hoping to replace a laptop needs a keyboard. The 12.9-Inch iPad Pro and 2017 both have one. The Smart Keyboard costs $169.99 for the iPad Pro. It locks into place and provides all the power it needs. Every key is woven into the fabric of the cover. Unfortunately, buyers need to move the entire tablet to get a better view of the display. The cover has one angle for typing. iPad accessory makers offer their own covers that solve key problems with the Smart Keyboard. The $139 Zagg Slimbook Case has more than one angle. Logitech’s Slim Combo Case adds a laptop-like keyboard deck, a place to store the Apple Pencil and backlit keys with travel for $129. 2017 Surface Pro with Type Cover and Pen. Buyers can leave the $129 Surface Type Covers flat on a desk, or add a slight angle with a row of magnets that clamp to the bezel of the device. The cover’s plastic keys glow in the dark. A glass trackpad lets users navigate Windows without touching their screen. The kickstand adjusts up to 165 degrees for better viewing angles. Only the $69.99 Moko Surface Pro 4 Keyboard is a credible alternative to Surface Type Covers. Artists and fans of handwritten notes need a digital pen. Again, both devices have one you can buy separately. The Apple Pencil lets users take notes and draw on their iPad. Artists can tilt the pen to get a better angle and press harder to create wider strokes. iPad Pro can charge the $99 accessory in 15 seconds for thirty minutes. Fully charged, it lasts for 12 hours. Apple Pencil Surface Pen comes in black, platinum, burgundy and blue for $99. Pen strokes don’t show up as fast as they do with the Apple Pencil and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. It can detect 4,096 different levels of pressure and it knows when users are tilting it. That cap acts as an eraser and shortcut to launch apps. 12.9-Inch iPad Pro vs 2017 Surface Pro: Battery Life & Software The 12.9-Inch iPad Pro battery lasts for 10 hours of video on a single charge. Models with LTE data last for 9 hours of web browsing. Compare that to the 13.5 hours of video that Microsoft says the 2017 Surface Pro is capable of and you have a clear winner. At least, on paper, you have a clear winner. For other activities, it’s hard to tell whether the battery will hold up. Buyers rely on programs from the web on Surface devices because the Windows Store doesn’t have many apps. Programs aren’t as touch or battery friendly as apps are. There are millions of powerful desktop programs though. iOS has better touch apps today. These apps don’t have as big an impact on battery life as Windows programs do. The iTunes Store offers millions of apps. Your favorite iPhone apps should work on the iPad Pro already. The 12.9-Inch iPad Pro and iPhone 7. This fall’s free iOS 11 update adds new ways to move files and work with more than two apps at the same time. Split-screen multitasking is available today though. Windows 10 lets users multitask with as many programs and apps as they want. Read: iOS 11 vs iOS 10: What’s New in iOS 11 Apple gifts iPad owners its iWork apps for creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations. Buyers that don’t have Microsoft already can rent it for $6.99 a month or more. 12.9-Inch iPad Pro vs 2017 Surface Pro: Pricing The 12.9-Inch iPad Pro and 2017 Surface Pro cost as much as a high-end laptop once buyers add their keyboard covers. Going with the 2017 Surface Pro gets shoppers double the storage of the entry-level iPad Pro. On the other hand, buyers can get a 256GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of RAM and LTE connectivity for $200 less than a Surface Pro with the same storage. Surface Pro LTE models dont arrive until this fall. 12.9-Inch iPad Pro 2017 Surface Pro $799 – 64GB of Storage $799 – 128GB of Storage / Intel Core m3 / 4GB of RAM $929 – 64GB of Storage / LTE Connectivity $999 – 128GB of Storage / Intel Core i5 / 4GB of RAM $899 – 256GB of Storage $1,299 – 256GB of Storage / Intel Core i5 / 8GB of RAM $1,029 – 256GB of Storage / LTE Connectivity $1,599 – 256GB of Storage / Intel Core i7 / 8GB of RAM $1,099 – 512GB of Storage $2,199 – 512GB of Storage / Intel Core i7 / 16GB of RAM $1,229 – 512GB of Storage / LTE Connectivity $2,699 – 1TB of Storage / Intel Core i7 / 16GB of RAM   iPad Pro Accessories Surface Pro Accessories $169 – Smart Keyboard for 12.9-Inch Pad Pro $129 – Surface Type Cover $99 – Apple Pencil for iPad Pro $99 – Surface Pen 2017 iPad Pro vs 2017 Surface Pro: Which Should You Buy? The 2017 Surface Pro’s Type Cover has some good features. The multi-angle kickstand and laptop-like keyboard are great. Its Mini DisplayPort, Micro SD card slot and USB 3.0 port make adding storage, moving pictures from a camera and a display easier. Windows 10 gives users access to millions of powerful desktop programs. More expensive configurations get you more processing power for video and photo editing. Everything isn’t great though. You certainly won’t get a touch-friendly experience from desktop programs, and they’ll harm the tablet’s battery life. The touch and battery friendly apps that are present in the Windows Store are hardly as good iPad apps. LTE isn’t available on Surface Pro today. The 12.9-Inch iPad Pro has some issues of its own too. Not having a way to change the display’s angle when you need to type is bad. Using software tricks and dongles to connect to displays and printers isn’t convenient. Those things don’t ruin all that’s right about the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. It’s thin and light. Buyers will hardly notice in their bag. The iTunes Store has lots of productivity and entertainment apps that are already on your phone. Mid-range models have lots of storage. LTE is available today. Buyers can count on reliable battery life. If you need software that’s only available in Windows and lots of processing power, the 2017 Surface Pro is the best choice for you. Everyone else is better off with the iPad Pro. Shoppers can place their 12.9-Inch iPad Pro pre-orders today at Apple.com. The tablet launches on June 15th. The Microsoft Store has 2017 Surface Pro pre-orders now. It also launches on June 15th.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login Home News E3 2017 E3 press conferences: who what where when why whom By Alice O'Connor on June 8th, 2017 at 8:30 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit E3, the event “as close as this industry gets to Eurovision“, officially begins on Tuesday. Thousands of developers, members of the press, and gawkers will descend upon Los Angeles for the four-day trade show, full of demos, presentations, and questions like “How many guns does this have?” E3 unofficially begins before then, mind, with publishers and platform holders livestreaming presentations from Saturday. Most of the announcements come from these and, as Graham said, they are pretty Eurovision. What to watch and when? Here’s our roundup of E3 livestreams. Electronic Arts Saturday, June 10 12pm Pacific / 3pm Eastern / 8pm UK time / 9pm CEST Watch on Twitch Expect to see Battlefield 1’s In the Name of the Tsar DLC, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed: Payback, FIFA 18 (did you know Ronaldo’s in it?), and possibly the mysterious Star Wars game being made by Dead Space devs Visceral. Also Madden and all that and whatever. Microsoft Sunday, June 11 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK time / 11pm CEST Watch on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Microsoft’s own Mixer doodad (the rebranded Beam) Blah blah Xbox Project Scorpio blah blah console VR. All Microsoft’s Xbox One games these days seem to also be Windows 10 games so there should be plenty for us. I’d expect to hear about Forzas, Halos, and hopefully Crackdown. It’d seem a good time to announce a release date for pirate ’em up Sea of Thieves too. Bethesda Sunday, June 11 9pm Pacific / midnight Eastern / 5am Monday UK time / 6am Monday CEST Watch on Twitch and YouTube I’m hoping for an hour-long video of B.J. Blazkowicz’s sad eyes blinking and averting their gaze. Devolver Digital Sunday, June 11 10pm Pacific / 1 am Monday Eastern / 6am Monday UK time / 7am Monday CEST Watch on Twitch’s Twitch as part of their First Ever Second Pre Pre Show Devolver Digital swear blind they won’t reveal any new games but they will have Grasshopper Manufacture’s Suda51. That seems a fair trade. PC Gaming Show Monday, June 12 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm UK time / 6pm CEST Watch on Twitch, Mixer, and Facebook The folks at cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer are hosting their PC Gaming Show this year. We already know something XCOM 2-y will be announced. Intel, Nexon, Bohemia Interactive, Xbox, Tripwire, and Cygames are official partners so I assume they’ll show stuff, but personally I’m hoping the rest of the 17 hours will be people showing off weird mods. Ubisoft Monday, June 12 1pm Pacific / 4pm Eastern / 9pm UK time / 10pm CEST Watch on Twitch and YouTube Ubi’s known games include Far Cry 5, The Crew 2, and South Park, and oh god will they please announce Assassin’s Creed: Origins already this is exhausting. Sony Monday, June 12 5pm Pacific / 8pm Eastern / 1am Tuesday UK time / 2am Tuesday CEST Watch on Twitch and Sony’s own doodad Given that most games are multiplatform these days, Sony will surely show off plenty of third-party games that are also coming to PC. Microsoft and Sony do scrap over publishers to drop hot scloosies in their shows. Nintendo Tuesday, June 13 9am Pacific / noon Eastern / 5pm UK time / 6pm CEST Watch on Twitch and YouTube No, none of Nintendo’s games will come to PC. So? Nintendo’s streams are always full of wonderful things that lift the spirits. I’m always exhausted by this point of E3 (when technically it hasn’t even started) and find this a delight. I haven’t even owned a Nintendo system since the DSi. That’s the bigguns! Obviously a million sites will have their own streaming odds and ends with developers all over. If you’re very lucky, you’ll be able to tune into a livestream of me barely awake at 5am watching streams and talking to the bottle I’ve sworn off. So, gang, what are your bets on this year’s overused buzzwords? ‘Visceral’ is always a safe bet and our Adam thinks ‘authentic’ will do well this year. Oh, and a hot tip: given how many people will be throwing around business terms next week as if they’re Gordon flipping Gekko, you might want to use this Chrome extension which replaces the term ‘IP’ with ‘immense penis’. I’ll settle for pelting pennies at the foreheads of anyone talking about ‘IPs’, ‘titles’, and ‘winning E3’.

Comey told the Senate Intel Committee he wanted to get out into the public his version of what went down. “My judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square. And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter. Didn’t do it myself for a variety of reasons.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login Home News E3 2017 E3 press conferences: who what where when why whom By Alice O'Connor on June 8th, 2017 at 8:30 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit E3, the event “as close as this industry gets to Eurovision“, officially begins on Tuesday. Thousands of developers, members of the press, and gawkers will descend upon Los Angeles for the four-day trade show, full of demos, presentations, and questions like “How many guns does this have?” E3 unofficially begins before then, mind, with publishers and platform holders livestreaming presentations from Saturday. Most of the announcements come from these and, as Graham said, they are pretty Eurovision. What to watch and when? Here’s our roundup of E3 livestreams. Electronic Arts Saturday, June 10 12pm Pacific / 3pm Eastern / 8pm UK time / 9pm CEST Watch on Twitch Expect to see Battlefield 1’s In the Name of the Tsar DLC, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed: Payback, FIFA 18 (did you know Ronaldo’s in it?), and possibly the mysterious Star Wars game being made by Dead Space devs Visceral. Also Madden and all that and whatever. Microsoft Sunday, June 11 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK time / 11pm CEST Watch on Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Microsoft’s own Mixer doodad (the rebranded Beam) Blah blah Xbox Project Scorpio blah blah console VR. All Microsoft’s Xbox One games these days seem to also be Windows 10 games so there should be plenty for us. I’d expect to hear about Forzas, Halos, and hopefully Crackdown. It’d seem a good time to announce a release date for pirate ’em up Sea of Thieves too. Bethesda Sunday, June 11 9pm Pacific / midnight Eastern / 5am Monday UK time / 6am Monday CEST Watch on Twitch and YouTube I’m hoping for an hour-long video of B.J. Blazkowicz’s sad eyes blinking and averting their gaze. Devolver Digital Sunday, June 11 10pm Pacific / 1 am Monday Eastern / 6am Monday UK time / 7am Monday CEST Watch on Twitch’s Twitch as part of their First Ever Second Pre Pre Show Devolver Digital swear blind they won’t reveal any new games but they will have Grasshopper Manufacture’s Suda51. That seems a fair trade. PC Gaming Show Monday, June 12 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm UK time / 6pm CEST Watch on Twitch, Mixer, and Facebook The folks at cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer are hosting their PC Gaming Show this year. We already know something XCOM 2-y will be announced. Intel, Nexon, Bohemia Interactive, Xbox, Tripwire, and Cygames are official partners so I assume they’ll show stuff, but personally I’m hoping the rest of the 17 hours will be people showing off weird mods. Ubisoft Monday, June 12 1pm Pacific / 4pm Eastern / 9pm UK time / 10pm CEST Watch on Twitch and YouTube Ubi’s known games include Far Cry 5, The Crew 2, and South Park, and oh god will they please announce Assassin’s Creed: Origins already this is exhausting.

Maybe Killer7 will pop up on PC – although since both the GameCube and PS2 are emulated technically you can play it on one. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The main takeaways: Comey definitely thinks Donald Trump is a liar, which is why he took copious notes of each of their interactions — that he thought it likely that Trump would lie about them later, so he needed to write everything that happened down in detail, right away. Comey understood Trump’s “I hope you’ll let this go” line was a direct order to stop investigating Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor, which Comey found highly inappropriate. Fox News covered the hearing in exactly the manner you’d expect. James Comey loves to say, “Lordy!” Last, Donald Trump did not tweet at all during the hearings. That last point did not go unnoticed: One hour into hearing, no @realDonaldTrump tweets. Is Reince using manacles or zip ties on him? — Dana Milbank (@Milbank) June 8, 2017 Two hours into hearing, no @realDonaldTrump tweets. I now suspect duct tape is involved. — Dana Milbank (@Milbank) June 8, 2017 Fortunately, Trump’s son Donald Jr. stepped in to fill that void: DJT is doing Trump’s live-tweeting for him. https://t.co/MnbSkHcbYh — Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) June 8, 2017 Now let’s take a look at how Twitter politicos analyzed the hearing, as it was happening. Senator Richard Burr (R., N.C.) is the Intel Committee chairman, and he opened the hearing by discussing the infamous dossier on Donald Trump that allegedly includes what some have playfully dubbed “the pee tape“: Burr asking about controversial dossier; Comey won't say if events in it have been proved accurate "in open session." Not a denial, that. — Cathleen Decker (@cathleendecker) June 8, 2017 Unfortunately, we never did get confirmation that there is or is not a pee tape. However, in much less salacious but probably more consequential news, it looks as though Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Trump for obstruction of justice, which is an impeachable offense: Comey just said he is "sure" Mueller is investigating Trump for obstruction of justice. — Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) June 8, 2017 Then we learned exactly what Comey thinks of Donald Trump as a person, particular as compared with his predecessors in the Oval Office: Comey, having served under previous R and D presidents, says Trump was different, because he lies. That's astonishingly damning — James Astill (@JamesMAstill) June 8, 2017 Comey: I Documented Trump Meetings Because Of The ‘Nature Of The Person. I Was Honestly Concerned That He Might Lie’ https://t.co/v7XkoQU2aY — Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) June 8, 2017 "He might lie," Comey says of Trump, explaining why he meticulously documented all of his interactions w Trump. — Ashley Parker (@AshleyRParker) June 8, 2017 Comey told senators that Trump dangled his position as FBI director in a private meeting. That’s a major ethical breach, which we’ve learned for President Trump is standard operating procedure: Comey: "Common sense told me what’s going on here is he’s looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job.” — Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) June 8, 2017 BREAKING: Comey says he believed Trump was `looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job' — AP Politics (@AP_Politics) June 8, 2017 James Comey is telling us that the President is a liar, that he sought to create a patronage system, and that Trump tried to influence him. — Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) June 8, 2017 Apparently the only ongoing investigation the FBI was conducting that interested Trump was the Russia one: Comey says Trump never asked him about any of the FBI’s tens of thousands of other investigations. — Ramesh Ponnuru (@RameshPonnuru) June 8, 2017 Then we heard about the moment Trump told Comey he hoped he’d let the Flynn investigation go and, more importantly, how Comey interpreted that moment: Comey: "I took it as direction. … I didn’t obey that but that’s the way I took it.” — Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) June 8, 2017 We also got a smashing new catchphrase for Comey: “Lordy!” !!! Comey: “I’ve seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy! I hope there are tapes.”https://t.co/7K0jjeVSLz — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) June 8, 2017 There was a good deal of discussion as to why Trump fired Comey. Comey was quite clear that he thinks it was because he would not back off the Russia-Trump investigation, even citing Trump’s interview with NBC’s Lester Holt in which he openly stated that he had been thinking about the Russia scandal when he decided to fire Comey. Here is the interview in which Trump said the Russia investigation played a role in Comey's firing: https://t.co/7N8DqekXYp — Lawfare (@lawfareblog) June 8, 2017 SIREN –> #Comey: "I got the sense my job would be contingent upon whether I demonstrated loyalty." — Alice Ollstein (@AliceOllstein) June 8, 2017 Attorney General Jeff Sessions probably did not enjoy this part of the hearing: Comey says he was certain Attorney General Sessions would have to recuse because of "facts that I can't discuss in open setting." — Dafna Linzer (@DafnaLinzer) June 8, 2017 Outside the hearing room, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan explained that Trump should be forgiven for his obviously inappropriate behavior because — this is literally what Ryan said — Trump was “new to this”: BREAKING: WASHINGTON (AP) — @SpeakerRyan says FBI director needs to be independent, says Trump unfamiliar with protocol, 'just new to this' — Meg Kinnard (@MegKinnardAP) June 8, 2017 Comey repeatedly urged the senators to take Russia’s interference seriously because it’s not a partisan issue — it was an attack on American democracy: Helluva moment: “They’re coming after America!” Comey makes an impassioned plea for people to care about Russian intrusions in our democracy pic.twitter.com/ZbADetsBsU — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) June 8, 2017 Republican Tom Cotton tried to get Comey to exonerate Trump, but Comey did not give the answer Cotton was looking for: Cotton: "Do you think Donald Trump colluded with Russia?" Comey: "That's a question I don't think I should answer in open session." — Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) June 8, 2017 That’s why they tell lawyers you should never ask a question you don’t already know the answer to. During the hearing, we saw a fine example of how the various cable news channels appeal to their respective audiences: two worlds pic.twitter.com/b5EVMg6Cbr — Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) June 8, 2017 And later it got a bit ridiculous: MEANWHILE, ON FOX NEWS pic.twitter.com/EjCBBN9GDA — hot weather takes (@paulythegun) June 8, 2017 President Trump’s spokesperson defended him against Comey’s characterization by saying something we can’t recall ever hearing from an official White House source: Sarah Sanders at briefing: "No I can say definitively the president is not a liar." — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 8, 2017 And finally, at the end of the hearing, the last senator to speak, John McCain, asked some bizarre questions that left watchers a bit flummoxed: WTF is John McCain going on about? — Kevin Drum (@kdrum) June 8, 2017 Whoa is this embarrassing. McCain? What? — Norman Ornstein (@NormOrnstein) June 8, 2017 John McCain is sleepy. Something something Clinton. Whole lot of questions about what went on. Comey: I'm a little confused. — Charles P. Pierce (@CharlesPPierce) June 8, 2017 What is McCain talking about? — (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) June 8, 2017 Like, seriously: is he ok? https://t.co/qMnXSsOQ9l — Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) June 8, 2017 America wants to know pic.twitter.com/lgPfMrqezL — Jonathan Chait (@jonathanchait) June 8, 2017 Unanimity in my timeline for first time during the hearings: McCain isn't making sense. — Ramesh Ponnuru (@RameshPonnuru) June 8, 2017 And on that note of bipartisan unity, the hearing ended. But there is one lingering question about James Comey, who we should point out is 6-foot-8-inches tall: Can James Comey dunk? https://t.co/nQvb4TfEJL pic.twitter.com/37io9lwLa4 — Deadspin (@Deadspin) June 8, 2017 15 Stars Who Should Totally Play Donald Trump: Image of NEXT: HERE'S WHAT TWITTER THOUGHT ABOUT 'COVFEFE' Filed Under: Donald Trump Category: News | Social Media SHARE TWEET EMAIL REDDIT More EMAIL Print this page Pin it!

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Dell Ryzen XPS, ASRock X299 Mini-ITX and Nvidia Max-Q: Luke and Leo discuss Dell Ryzen XPS, ASRock X299 Mini-ITX and Nvidia Max-Q: Luke and Leo discuss Carl Muller 11 hours ago Channel, Computex, Featured Announcement, Featured Tech News Luke Hill and Leo Waldock discuss the Good Stuff they saw at Computex 2017. Dell Ryzen XPS All-In-One and Intel X299 in Mini-ITX by ASRock both look brilliant while Nvidia Max-Q presents something of a puzzle to the intrepid duo. Watch via our Vimeo Channel (Below) or over on YouTube HERE. Two new products caught the KitGuru eye at Computex; the first is the new Dell XPS 27 which is a 27-inch All-In-One PC powered by Ryzen 7 1700 with AMD RX 580 graphics, 32GB of DDR4 memory, a 256GB SSD and 1TB of bulk storage. That’s a good deal of hardware to squeeze inside an overgrown display and KitGuru is very keen to see how it performs and what sort of temperatures are produced. It has been somewhat overshadowed by the announcement this week of the upcoming Apple IMac featuring an 18 core processor, 4TB SSD with AMD Vega graphics, but that looks to be a firm 2018 product based on release dates. Next up we have the ASRock X299E-ITX/ac motherboard which is a high end X299 motherboard in the same vein as the X99E-ITX/ac. Luke is massively excited about this ASRock board and may even be more excited about than the Core i9 processor. To wrap up, the KitGuru duo discuss Nvidia Max-Q, which is a way of packing a high end gaming laptop with GTX graphics into a slender chassis that is less than 18mm thick, weighs less than 5lbs or 2.3kg and a target noise level under 40dBA. It sounds like magic and the best explanation we have is that Nvidia is using a 1Volt profile to reduce GPU power and hence to keep the heat down. The obvious question – to which we do not currently have an answer – is how this affects performance. KitGuru says: Dell has done some impressive stuff in recent times and the XPS 27  looks like a wlecome continuation. ASRock has very likely booked a bunch of 2018 awards for  the X299E-ITX/ac motherboard. Nvidia may have pulled off a marketing coup with Max-Q although time will tell.

Comey, who was testifying before the Senate Intel Committee as Sanders gaggled with reporters, said Trump’s tweet about recordings caused him to give his memos on Trump conversations to a friend to leak to press. Related Marco Rubio Snarks About Leaks To Press During James Comey Testimony Sanders also got asked if Trump lied, in response to Comey having several times during the hearing said Trump lied in various assertions. “I can definitively say the president is not a liar, and I think it’s frankly insulting it is asked,” Sanders said. On Thursday – two days after reporters began asking White House reps if Trump still has confidence in Attorney General Jeff Sessions – Sanders said, “absolutely the president has confidence in all of his cabinet.” Previously Trump reps said they had not had the chance to discuss that with Trump and would get back to them. At the hearing itself, reporters learned Donald Trump’s remark to Comey about hoping the FBI would let go of its Michael Flynn probe is under investigation by special counsel. Comey also indicated, in saying he could not discuss in open session, that there still is an investigation into whether members of Team Trump colluded in Russia’s election interference. Comey also said he could not answer in open session questions as to whether Trump himself colluded.

Reply • on Jun 8, 2017 10:48 am Trump said for years that Obama was not born in the U.S. Then he admitted that he had been. But he’s not a liar, right Ms. Huckabee?

Reply • on Jun 8, 2017 10:53 am thanks for your opinion – we were looking for facts Kim Davis at the podium next Reply typegiwoqac • on Jun 8, 2017 11:23 am Republicans don’t care if he’s guilty, they don’t care if he’s a traitor, they don’t care if he’s an authoritarian, they don’t care if he’s incompetent. They only care about power. Period. Trump supporters think he will kick out immigrants and re-establish the patriarchy. They think he will get rid of Obamacare, which, ironically, will hurt most of his supporters. Under Obamacare, my previously unaffordable premium is now down to $85/month. My auto insurance is down to $25/month (from Insurance Panda). My homeowners is $25/month too. Under Trump, expect inflation and massive price increases across the board. So nothing will be done. They will defend Trump under any and all circumstances. Reply • on Jun 8, 2017 2:29 pm Sounds familiar……….

Reply James • on Jun 8, 2017 12:04 pm What was it that Nixon said that sounds so familiar? Oh I know “I am not a crook”. We know how that turned out don’t we. Hopefully this will go the same way.

Reply • on Jun 8, 2017 12:38 pm As dull as her daddy Reply • on Jun 8, 2017 1:16 pm I can truly say that President Donald Trump is not a liar, but a habitual liar. You know if Donald Trump lies about he little things he would lie about the big things. Believe that he is one who must have things look goid for him and therefore he lies to make himself look good. Have got in the habit of doing it is now a habitual liar. Reply Cheryl • on Jun 8, 2017 1:27 pm Well, her reputation is now 0 as everyone knows & we have evidence of many lies. :( Reply • on Jun 8, 2017 1:44 pm Trump said there would be a wall, Obamacare repeal, and that we’d all be sick of winning. None of that has turned out to be true. Reply • on Jun 8, 2017 1:58 pm So, Sarah , how do you sleep at night? Probably very well since you have sold your soul to Trump.

Image Credit: Epic Games Fortnite has been lost in works for a long time at Epic Games, and it’s finally about to hit. The company announced the July 25 early access launch date for the third-person shooter game where you build a fort and defend it against zombies. It will be available in paid early access for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and Mac, and it will be free to play in 2018 when it formally launches. Fans can preorder or preregister now on the official website. In Fortnite, you can play solo or cooperatively in a dynamic world. You can grab procedurally generated resources on maps that are never the same the second time around. Then you craft your ammo, build your fort, and defend it against the hordes of husks and other monsters. It’s a funny game, and you’ll get a flavor for it in these gameplay videos. I’ve played it for a week, and it has proven to be quite stable on my aging Nvidia and Intel PC. It’s a funny blend of Minecraft, Unreal, and Team Fortress 2. It’s in alpha testing now, and it will be on display at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) next week. Players team up to build forts and battle against hordes of zombies, all while crafting and looting within big open environments where no encounter will be the same. I’ve been playing the alpha version of the game for more than a week, and it’s a unique and funny experience. At least it is as funny as you can make the zombie apocalypse. It’s a nice blend of the building fun of Minecraft, the realistic but stylized graphics of Unreal games, and amusing shooters like Team Fortress 2. The title is free-to-play in the long run, but in the meantime Epic will sell Fortnite Founders Packs to give players entry to the Early Access Season, access to exclusive in-game events in 2017, and access to Heroes, loot, weapons, and in-game boosts. That is, if you want to play it early, you’ll have to pay. Players who pre-order a Founder’s Pack will get a four-day head start beginning on July 21, along with the exclusive Storm Master Weapon Pack. Additionally, Epic Games has partnered with Gearbox Publishing to distribute a boxed retail version of the game for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Epic’s official trailer is here. Here’s an early mission where you find and launch an Atlas satellite and fight the storm. This mission lasted 52 minutes. I got penalized for taking so long. Here’s another mission that last more than an hour, and got cut off at the end.

Camila Russo Bloomberg News Published Thursday, Jun. 08, 2017 2:12PM EDT Last updated Thursday, Jun. 08, 2017 6:40PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Mining references generally evoke images of picks and shovels. For advocates of bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies surging in value, the gold may be in the shares of the companies that produce the computer chips and processors used to create the digital coins in the process that’s become known as mining. Digital coins can only be created by using computers to solve complex mathematical problems. The difficulty increases as more of the problems get solved, prompting the miners to require even more powerful hardware. With digital coin prices soaring, demand for the components is surging as miners are able to recoup their initial investment quicker. A complete mining rig, which is made up of graphics cards, a processor, power supply, memory, cabling and a fan, costs between $2,400 to $3,800 on Amazon.com. The Antminer S9, which is estimated to mine 0.29 bitcoin per month, and retails for $2,795, which means you can break even in about four months with bitcoin at $2,700, without taking into account electricity costs. Miners typically buy complete rigs or build them themselves. The following are some of the companies that make the parts. Nvidia Corp. The Santa Clara, Calif-based company manufactures graphic processing units used by gamers and increasingly, by digital-currency miners. GPUs listed in Nvidia’s website can cost as much as $1,200. The rig-mining market can grow to about $1.3-billion, and with GPUs making up approximately 2/3 of coin mining costs, the demand for GPUs can increase to $875 million, according to a RBC Capital Markets report on June 6. If Nvidia gets half of that, it represents a 10-per-cent increase on its GPU sales, RBC analyst Mitch Steves said in an interview. The company currently has about 75 per cent of the GPU market, according to a Jon Peddie Research report. The complexity of mining bitcoin has increased to the point that GPUs aren’t powerful enough, and miners are mostly using application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices don’t make. Tech news website Digitimes reported Nvidia and AMD are planning to release GPUs specifically designed to mine bitcoin. Shares of Nvidia have climbed 45 per cent this year, and have more then tripled in the past year. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, as the company is known, also makes graphics cards used for mining ethereum and other coins. The Sunyvale, Calif.-based company’s shares have rallied the most in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in the past week, in part thanks to a PCWorld article that said it’s almost “impossible” to get AMD’s Radeon graphics cards after a surge in demand from ethereum miners. The company also builds the processors typically used to build mining rigs, and its Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference its product compete with bigger rival Intel Corp. The shares are up 27 per cent in the past month, and have almost tripled over 12 months. Intel Corp. Digital currency mining has the potential to boost demand for Intel’s processors, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. While AMD CPUs are popular among miners, Intel is the traditional leader in the sector and is taking steps to counter its fledgling rival. The company’s shares have lagged rivals, with a gain of 17 per cent in the past year. Micron Technology Inc. Boise, Idaho-based Micron is the largest U.S. maker of memory chips, one of the components of a mining rig, so it also stands to benefit, Mr. Cassidy said. Micron shares have surged almost 50 per cent this year, and have more then doubled in the past 12 months.

The retired general and champion surfer Barbara Redgate headed over to Second Beach in Newport, Rhode Island for the day. Michael Flynn Jr. posted a photo of his father and aunt in their wetsuits while carrying their boards on the beach, located near the family's home. Flynn, 58, was all smiles in the picture, taken almost four months after he was forced to resign as President Trump's national security adviser over claims he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contact with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. That big smile also came just three days before James Comey faced the Senate Intel Committee on Capitol Hill, and testified that Flynn was still under criminal investigation by the FBI. Endless summer: Michael Flynn was all smiles on Monday as he went surfing with his sister Barbara Redgate at Second Beach in Newport, Rhode Island (above) The very model of a modern major-general: It has been four months since Flynn resigned from his post as national security adviser over claims he misled VP Mike Pence on his contact with Russians (Flynn and Trump above in December) Cool customer: On Thursday, James Comey (above) stated under oath that Flynn was under criminal investigation by the FBI and may have lied to intelligence officers Flynn has been an avid surfer for some time, having grown up in Rhode Island. That fun fact was not known by many until this past February when he was profiled by the New Yorker in an interview done prior to his resignation but released after he had exited the White House. His sister meanwhile is a retired teacher who lives in California and has also been surfing since she was a child, and competing since the age of 12 around the country. Flynn looked the happiest he has ever been in the photo his soon posted on Monday, though that feeling may quickly be dissipating in the wake of Comey's testimony.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next COMEY: I LEAKED TOO!

Comey knifes Loretta Lynch too: Ex-FBI boss reveals Obama's... Share this article Share 11 shares The most surprising thing to emerge on Thursday might have been the details of the nature of the investigation into Flynn. Comey was asked by Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas during the hearing if he believed that Flynn had 'attempted to deceive [him] or made false statements to an FBI agent.' After initially saying he did not want to 'go to far,' Comey stated: 'That was the subject of the criminal inquiry.' It was the first time if had been confirmed that there was a criminal investigation into Flynn, and Comney declined to give any further details. Comey had already revealed in his opening remarks, which were submitted for the record on Wednesday, that he felt President Trump was asking him to drop any investigation into Flynn when he spoke to him on February 14 in private after a meeting. 'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go,' President Trump told Comey according to the former FBI director's notes from the meeting.  That meeting came one day after President Trump asked for Flynn's resignation.  Comey explained in his written remarks that he was able to recount his conversation with President Trump on that day because he had taken notes. Blue crush: Flynn's love of surfing was not known by many until a New Yoprker profile of the retired general in February (above in a photo posted by his son) On Thursday, Comey stated that at the time of that meeting with President Trump Flynn was in 'legal jeopardy.'  He also said that after his first meeting with President Trump during the transition period he made a point of taking notes following each of their sessions.  When asked about that exchange during his testimony on Thursday, Comey went into more detail about his perception of the conversation. 'Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice or for that matter any other criminal offense where this—they said or thought they "hoped" for an outcome?' asked Senator Jim Risch of Idaho.  Comey responded  by stating: 'I don't know well enough to answer. And the reason I keep saying his words is, I took it as a direction. It is the president of the United States, with me alone, saying "I hope this." He then added: 'I took it as, this is what he wants me to do. I didn't obey that, but that's the way I took it.' Flynn has not commented on the proceedings from Thursday, but his namesake did retweet the first comment made by President Trump's namesake, which said: 'Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well. I hear "I hope nothing happens but you have to do your job"' He has been under scrutiny from the Justice Department since November, when the department's Foreign Agent Registration Act unit sent him a letter questioning whether he needed to register as a foreign agent for lobbying work he performed for a Turkish businessman. Flynn signed a $600,000 contract last August with a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. The contract called for Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, to gather information on a Turkish cleric living in the United States with the aim of getting a criminal referral against him.  Flynn is separately being investigated by the Defense Department's inspector general.  That inquiry is looking into whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. The top Democrat and Republican on a House oversight committee have said Flynn likely broke federal law by failing to get approval from the U.S. government to accept foreign payments, including $33,000 in 2015 from RT, Russia's state-sponsored television network.  RT has been branded a propaganda outlet by US intelligence officials.  Read more: Michael Flynn, General Chaos - The New Yorker Share or comment on this article e-mail 11 shares Most watched News videos The floor is definitely lava!

Like many other chants in cricket, it is derived from similar football ones. But now this one has grown into a full blown chant every time the right music plays. It's something that the Indian supporters at The Oval today were doing at any given chance. Whether it's Jadeja boarding a bus, when he's coming on to bowl or simply at all for no reason. Warning - Repeated hearing can make this an earworm! Bat-makers in the house The bays around the ground, below the stands at the iconic Oval, is filled with photographs of former cricketers of England and Surrey. It is also the place where people are always rushing around to find their stands or for their favourite beverage or meal. But it is also the ideal place to sell anything that is connected to cricket. Intel has a booth where people can play a simulated game wearing a device over their eyes. It envisions a bowler running in and bowling at you in 3D and gives you a bat to play at. From the outside, the person wearing and swinging in the air seems like a mad man but so must be the guys who were ingenious enough to devise it. But one particular booth makes people stop and stare at is the Gray Nicolls shop just a few yards away. An old-fashioned bat-shop, it also has the tools required to chisel a bat with blocks of English willow lying on the side. The guys at the counter are helpful enough to give a quick run through on how bats are made, and you can take one home readymade in front of your eyes. Now, that's something! Virat Kohli fans endured a disappointing day. © Cricbuzz They know their cricket, alright Virat Kohli's duck had left the thousands of fans flocking the stadium very disappointed. There was a moment where the other big gun, MS Dhoni, could have gone the same way. Missing a delivery from Gunathilake, Dhoni was hit on the back pad. While the on-field appeal was dismissed, Sri Lanka went for a review leaving the crowd very anxious and peering onto the two giant-screens. It took barely a moment from the time the pitch map flashed with the ball shown to be pitching outside leg to see bated breaths turning into hoarse cries of delight. Mike Atherton on air quipped, 'They know their cricket'. They certainly seemed to do and collectively knew what they wanted to see. It was Dhoni, and he didn't disappoint them. Lack of wickets forced skipper Virat Kohli to bring himself on. © Cricbuzz Running out of options When Virat Kohli was running out of bowlers, or wicket-taking options, on a pitch that didn't offer much, he had to resort to bowling himself despite not practicing this skill. For a long while, it felt like India had ran out of any wicket-taking option. No bowler was creating a chance but India were kept interested thanks to the plentiful run out opportunities that were being created. There were a couple of direct hits, and a few more near misses as Sri Lanka were kept under pressure more by the fielders than the bowlers. This too was an answer to a call by their skipper from the last game against Pakistan where they dropped a few chances. The Dhols vs the Papare The match on the field was the one touted to be Goliath vs David. But in the stands too the dhols drumming for India heavily outnumbered the Papare trumpeting for Sri Lanka. The latter formed a small pocket of dozens compared to the thousands of Indian fans at The Oval. Angelo Mathews had chuckled a day earlier saying, 'Indians are everywhere!'. In a reversal of what is the norm, it wasn't the fans helping the team. The Papare was outnoised by the Indians only until Sri Lanka's batsmen began to quiten the Indian fans with some fantastic batting. And finally the Papare too found their merry voice heard. © Cricbuzz Share Tweet Share TAGS ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 India vs Sri Lanka, 8th Match, Group B Ravindra Jadeja MS Dhoni Virat Kohli Sri Lanka India RELATED STORIES Increased intensity makes Pakistan a formidable force: Imad Wasim Sri Lanka break 38 year hoodoo Hats off to Sri Lanka for outplaying us: Kohli Mathews happy after move to promote Kusal Perera pays off Farbrace commends Morgan for England's remarkable turnaround Champions Trophy Qualification Scenarios - Australia eye semifinal spot FROM AROUND THE WEB COMMENTS PLAYER SEARCH Loading...

Michael Flynn, the most prominent target of the FBI’s investigation of Russian election interference, is expected to emerge Thursday at the center of the brewing political firestorm over allegations that President Trump made repeated entreaties to then-FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation. “One of the important questions is what was the president’s intent when he allegedly said to Mr. Comey ‘Go easy on Flynn,’” Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, told ABC News. Comey is set to testify that Trump made repeated requests to the director to drop the investigation of Flynn, according to the advance copy of Comey’s upcoming testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. It remains unclear, King said, whether those alleged requests were motivated by compassion for Flynn, loyalty to the man who strongly backed his candidacy, or driven by self-preservation aimed at keeping Flynn from being forced to share more about any questionable relationship between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The probe, which has already ensnared several current and former associates of President Donald Trump, has expanded to look at a questionable paid appearance Flynn made in Russia and side work Flynn was doing in the midst of the 2016 campaign through his consulting firm, the Flynn Intel Group. The firm belatedly filed papers with the Justice Department to disclose work he did that could have benefitted the Turkish government. Flynn also accepted $45,000 to attend a dinner in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his firm received $500,000 from a Dutch company with ties to Turkey. Flynn first came under investigation for his ties to Russia during the campaign when he was Donald Trump’s senior foreign policy adviser and a strident supporter. After the election, during the transition, Flynn failed to report that he had secretly met with the Russian ambassador, even lying to vice-president elect Michael Pence about discussing lifting sanctions with the ambassador at that meeting. Pence then unknowingly repeated the lie to the public. That discussion was at the heart of Trump’s request to the then-FBI director to drop the investigation, according to the advance copy of Comey’s testimony. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go,” Comey says Trump told him. Comey said he gave the president no such assurances before he was suddenly fired in May. In March, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, defended his client from the swirl of allegations that have dogged him since Trump was elected. “Gen. Flynn is a highly decorated 33-year veteran of the U.S. Army,” Kelner said. “He devoted most of his life to serving his country, spending many years away from his family fighting this nation’s battles around the world … Notwithstanding his life of national service, the media are awash with unfounded allegations, outrageous claims of treason, and vicious innuendo directed against him.” It’s not just Flynn’s behavior that will face intense scrutiny during Comey’s testimony. According to Matt Olsen, a former federal prosecutor for the FBI and an ABC News contributor, Trump’s alleged attempts to pressure Comey have landed him in the spotlight as well. “It appears that the president is really trying to isolate the investigation, really establish a firewall around the White House by asking Comey to drop the investigation,” Olsen told ABC News. “Again, something that’s completely inconsistent with the principle of the rule of law.” According to John Carlin, the former assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice who is now an ABC News contributor, if it appears that Trump’s actions rose to the level of obstruction of justice, lawmakers could be heading into uncharted territory. “The key here isn’t whether it violates a criminal statute because you can’t bring that criminal charge against a sitting president,” Carlin told ABC News. “So I think at the end of the day you have to look as to whether this is an impeachable offense. And there’s not a lot of precedent there.” Copyright © 2017, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.

Here are a look at the key players in the Senate Intelligence Committee testimony: James Comey, former FBI director Comey served over three years as the director of the FBI before his firing in May by President Trump, which would lead to Thursday’s hearing. Prior to his appointment by President Obama in 2013, he worked as deputy attorney general in the Bush administration and U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York for almost two years. In written testimony released Wednesday, he wrote that Trump asked for his loyalty during private meetings and that he assured the president that he wasn’t personally under investigation. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee After serving five terms in the House, Burr moved to the Senate, where he currently is serving his second term. He has been an adamant support of military families and veterans, and prioritizes protecting American security through his work on the Senate Intel Committee. During Wednesday’s hearing of Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and company, he demanded answers, saying: “At no time should you be in a position to come to Congress without an answer.” Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence committee The Democrat was elected to his Senate post to represent the state of Virginia in 2008, and is currently serving his second term. In the Senate, Warner has a record of reaching across the aisle to increase government accountability and improve job creation. Prior to his post in the Senate, Warner served as the governor of Virginia from 2002 to 2006. Warner was disappointed with the answers he received Wednesday from Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Adm. Michael Rogers. He emphasized the gravity of this investigation, comparing it to Watergate when he said on Morning Joe: “We are in a land that we’ve never visited before, even back beyond the ‘70s.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Feinstein is a 24-year Senate veteran who is the former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Feinstein, 83, is the oldest member of the Senate, and was quick to question the White House’s rationale for firing Comey last month, immediately asking publicly whether the dismissal was tied to the Russia investigation. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. A first term senator, just five months into her term, Harris is the former attorney general of California and district attorney of San Francisco. Her highly-publicized Senate victory in the country’s most populous state and willingness to take on high-profile issues early into her Senate tenure has led to speculation she could be eyeing a bid for the presidency in 2020. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio is serving his second term in the Senate, previously serving as speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. In the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Rubio ran a competitive campaign but eventually ceded to President Trump. During Wednesday’s hearing, Rubio responded to Coats’ refusal to answer by saying that “the American people deserve to know” the validity of media claims surrounding the investigation. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. Cotton is serving his first term in the Senate, having been elected in 2014. Before becoming senator, Cotton served in the military in Iraq and Afghanistan and held one term in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Follow us: Release dates: every game confirmed for 2017 Injustice 2: tier list and base character stats ranked for the full roster Bethesda at E3 2017: what to look out for from the Fallout, Skyrim, Dishonored and Quake teams PC PS4 Xbox One Destiny GTA 5 Battlefield Pokemon Overwatch Guides Ticker E3 2017 schedule: conference times for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, Bethesda, EA and Ubisoft, plus other streams By Alex Donaldson, Thursday, 8 June 2017 17:20 GMT Share on: Facebook Twitter Reddit Google+ Use our cheat sheet and make sure you don’t miss a thing. Ready or not, E3 is a-comin’. We’re a matter of days away from the biggest event in the gaming calendar! Though E3 has changed quite a lot over the last few years and had a lot said about its continuing significance, this year spells a big change: the show is open to the public. Before the show doors are flung open for public and industry alike, we have the traditional gauntlet of E3 conferences to get through. That means you lot staying up late or otherwise making the time to follow the news if you’re so inclined, and for us that means running around like our hair is on fire in an attempt to report all the news and get it all under control and report you the latest news. Which we will. We’re cool like that. If you need to plan out your E3 week or if you’re just looking to get the dates down in order to contain your hype appropriately, we’ve got you covered. Here’s the E3 2017 conference schedule as it currently stands. Saturday, June 10 – E3 conferences and live streams E3 kicks off one day earlier than usual thanks to EA stepping back from the show proper. EA Play – 12pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern, 8pm BST, 9pm CEST EA kicks off E3 with the grand opening of its EA Play event. The event will be open to the public, but before that happens they’ll hold a press conference to talk about the playable games there (including your usual smattering of sports stuff and Star Wars Battlefront 2) plus make new announcements. Rumours suggest we’ll see a new IP from Bioware at the conference – and we’ve gathered that plus other predictions and thoughts on EA at E3 separately if you want the scoop on what to expect. Sunday, June 11 – E3 conferences and live streams Microsoft shift their conference back a day to get slot that isn’t at the crack of dawn. Xbox / Microsoft – 2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern, 10pm BST, 11pm CEST Microsoft are the first of the ‘big three’ hardware makers to let rip with their conference, though it’s moved forward a day from its typical slot. Expect all the details on the Xbox Scorpio, updates on previously-announced games like Crackdown and Sea of Thieves plus no doubt more Windows 10 gaming stuff and hopefully some new game announcements to boot. We’re a little worried about Microsoft – Scorpio alone isn’t going to be enough. Crucially, the company needs games – and we wrote about that at length. Fingers crossed we get an impressive showing from Scorpio and more on the new games front than just a new Forza entry. Bethesda – 7pm Pacific, 10pm Eastern, 3am BST, 4am CEST Bethesda has released an E3 invite that seems to tease that its E3 showcase will feature at least two new games. With Prey and Dishonored out, the company surely must be gearing up to show off some new things. Could it finally be time for Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, the game teased in last year’s conference intro? In any case, we’ve rounded up everything you can expect from Bethesda at E3 2017. According to the latest information on Bethesda’s E3 2017 showcase hub, the conference livestream will kick off two hours after the announced start time – so tune in from 9pm Pacific, midnight Eastern, 5am BST and 6am CEST, but expect news to roar out before then. Monday, June 12 – E3 conferences and live streams Sony and Ubisoft round out the on-the-ground conference events at E3 2017. The PC Gaming Show – 10am Pacific, 1pm Eastern, 7pm BST, 8pm CEST The PC Gaming Show returns at E3 – with Intel partnering up with the magazine PC Gamer to put in a show for PC gamers specifically. This show is never one for really big news, but often some good titbits can be found here for PC-specific fans – it’s well worth a look. It’ll be hosted by Sean ‘Day9# Plott and boasts Intel as its main sponsor. Confirmed atendees include Xbox, Bohemia Interactive, Sega and others. Expect PC darling PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds to make an appearance. Ubisoft – 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern, 9pm BST, 10pm CEST They were late to announce compared to the other companies, but Ubisoft will still have a major presence at the show, as confirmed with the official announcement of their press conference. Assassin’s Creed Empire is one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming, and Ubisoft has now come right out and said it outright: a new Assassin’s Creed, The Crew 2, Far Cry 5 and South Park will all launch this fiscal year. As a result, we fully expect them at E3. What else Ubi might show is a mystery, but South Park is still missing in action and rumours point to a cross-over game with Nintendo. PlayStation / Sony – 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern, 2am BST, 3am CEST Sony keep their traditional Monday evening E3 slot. After getting the PS4 Pro out of the way late last year, Sony has a bit of a clean slate here – and they have the Xbox Scorpio to respond to. We’re sure to see more of God of War, Days Gone, Detroit: Become Human and Spider-Man, but other questions remain… will we see The Last of Us Part 2? What will there be that’s all new? We’ve got a list of our predictions and wishes for Sony at E3 2017 – give it a read. Tuesday, June 13 – E3 conferences and live streams E3 kicks off proper with the show doors opening, but before they do Nintendo steps in… Nintendo Spotlight: E3 2017 – 9am Pacific, 12pm Eastern, 5pm BST, 6pm CEST Nintendo got out ahead of most other companies and said right off the bat that they wouldn’t be having a traditional conference during an investor call. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, as they haven’t held one for years – but they will still put on a unique show with “Nintendo Spotlight: E3 2017”, a special pre-recorded E3 event that’ll stream live much like Nintendo Direct and last year’s E3 Nintendo ‘Digital Event’. Nintendo has already confirmed Super Mario Odyssey will be shown at the event, plus teased other announcements for both 3DS and Switch. We’ve got a full page of our hopes and predictions for Nintendo at E3, so go give that a read. E3 Show Floor Streams: Youtube Live at E3 YouTube of course has a massive presence at E3, and it’ll be inviting developers onto its live stream as well as rehosting all the major conference live streams listed above. Youtube Live at E3 – June 11 1pm Pacific (4pm Eastern, 9pm BST, 10pm CEST) until 10pm Pacific: Xbox Conference, Bethesda Conference & YouTube Live at E3 shows Youtube Live at E3 – June 12 12pm Pacific until 9pm Pacific: Ubisoft Conference, PlayStation Conference & YouTube Live at E3 shows Youtube Live at E3 – June 14 2pm Pacific: E3 Coliseum – Call of Duty WW2 panel with Sledgehammer Games 2pm Pacific: E3 Coliseum – ‘Stories Across Screens’ panel E3 Show Floor Streams: Nintendo Treehouse Live Once their conference is done and dusted, Nintendo aren’t quite finished – they have lots more to do at E3, includiong a live stream throughout the show. This stream will run alongside the show every day, but there are some set events. Nintendo Treehouse Live – June 13 2:30pm Pacific (5:30pm Eastern, 10:30pm BST, 11:30pm CEST): 2017 Splatoon 2 World Inkling Invitational Nintendo Treehouse Live – June 14 3:30pm Pacific: 2017 ARMS Open Invitational E3 Show Floor Streams: Twitch The folks at Twitch TV will be streaming throughout E3, and as well as streaming some of the press conferences complete with some exclusive pre and post-show content, the video giant will also be present on the E3 show floor itself streaming. Here’s what to expect from them: Twitch TV at E3 – June 11 1pm Pacific – Xbox Preview (4pm Eastern, 9pm BST, 10pm CEST) 3pm Pacific – Xbox Briefing Reactions 10pm Pacific onwards – The E3 pre-show Twitch TV at E3 – June 12 9am Pacific: Intel Press Conference (12pm Eastern, 5pm BST, 6pm CEST) 2:30pm Pacific: Ubisoft Conference Reactions 7:30pm Pacific: Sony PlayStation Media Showcase reactions Twitch TV at E3 – June 13th 10am Pacific: Show intro with Xbox’s Aaron Greenberg 10:30am Pacific until 6pm – Live show featuring EA, Nintendo, Bandai Namco, Square Enix, Ubisoft & more Twitch TV at E3 – June 14th 10am until 6pm Pacific: Live show featuring Double Fine Productions, Bethesda Softworks, Sony, Aspyr Media & others Twitch TV at E3 – June 15th 10am until 6pm Pacific: Live show featuring Deep Silver, Nintendo, Xbox, Amazon Games & more Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Office workers around the world no longer have to endanger their health or their sanity. Most forward-thinking companies are happy for their employees to bring and use their own devices. But for every winner, there’s a loser. While your eyesight might benefit, you could gravely compromise your safety and security by enrolling on a “Bring Your Own Device” (BYOD) scheme. And the dangers don’t stop for you as an employee 5 Ways Your Security Is at Risk in the Office 5 Ways Your Security Is at Risk in the Office You assume your corporate IT colleagues are skilled enough to keep your data safe. But what if they're not? And what other threats face your privacy and security in the workplace? Read More — your company could be putting itself at risk as well. What are the security pitfalls of BYOD? In this article, I’m going to discuss why the idea of BYOD is gaining traction, then explain what problems could arise. What Is BYOD? BYOD is a catch-all term for a company policy that allows employees to use their own devices to access company data, email, infrastructure, and networks. The devices can be everything from smartphones and tablets to laptops and projectors. Typically, it refers to any employee-owned device with an internet connection that is connected to a company’s internal network. Note to all: "BYOD" (bring your own device to work) aka Consumerisation of IT DOES NOT MEAN you bring ur XBox to the office. — Not Happy, Gladys (@NickHodgeAU) February 10, 2012 Advertisement The term entered general use in 2009 thanks to Intel, and since then the policy has exploded. The vast majority of the world’s largest companies now offer some form of BYOD, as do thousands of SMEs. Data suggests uptake of BYOD has been most prevalent in the Middle East where more than 80 percent of the office workers now have access to the policy. Brazil, Russia, India, UAE, and Malaysia are the world’s five leading countries — all boast rates of more than 75 percent. In North America, the rate stands at about 44 percent. Why Do Companies Like It? Companies have been quick to adopt BYOD for two key reasons: cost-cutting and productivity. Cost-wise, companies are be able to save money on hardware, software, and device maintenance 8 PC Maintenance Mistakes That Kill Your Hardware Lifespan 8 PC Maintenance Mistakes That Kill Your Hardware Lifespan PC maintenance isn't rocket science, but you could be making a handful of mistakes that are actually harming your hardware. Read More . Theoretically, it eases the strain on IT departments that already struggle to keep up with the rapidly changing pace of technology. From a productivity standpoint, repeated research has shown employees who have access to BYOD policies are happier, more comfortable, and typically work faster. But everything isn’t rosy. There are potentially some serious security pitfalls both employees and companies need to consider. Security Pitfalls for Employees Companies frequently use remote mobile device management software to manage BYOD schemes, but the software is more intrusive then employees might believe. Here are three things you should watch out for. 1. Data Collection How much data would you be willing to share with your company? For example, would you be happy if your boss knew your entire browsing history? Would you be eager to share your location with your IT department? The answer to these questions is probably “No,” but according to a report by Bitglass, you might be exposing yourself to these profound invasions of privacy. “The intent of mobile device management solutions is not to spy on employees but to monitor for things like malware and general security. But these tools do a lot more. That includes seeing where the phone is located, what apps are on the phone, and even what websites the user was accessing. We could see that some of our employees search for health information on the web.” — Salim Hafid, Product Manager at Bitglass Ask yourself this question: do you know what data your company holds about you? Under both U.S. and U.K. law, you have a legal right to see it all. Go and ask your HR department. The results might surprise you. 2. Intercept Personal Communications While you might not be thrilled at the idea, most of us accept our employers have a right to access and monitor our company email accounts. But what about personal email accounts? Or messages sent via Facebook Messenger Facebook Messenger Privacy: Everything You Need to Know Facebook Messenger Privacy: Everything You Need to Know Are you concerned about Facebook Messenger privacy? Should you be? We take a look at the app permissions and the case for protecting your messages with another app. Read More ? That’s a different matter entirely. And yet, researchers at Bitglass were able to see all these communications using remote device management software. The report even claimed passwords and bank details were visible. Of course, companies probably aren’t collecting this data as a matter of course (unless you gave them permission to in the small print of your contract). However, the potential risk should set alarm bells ringing. Would you trust every member of your company’s IT department not to snoop on you? Do you have faith in your business’s security systems ability to prevent hackers from gaining access to the data? 3. Loss of Personal Data Almost all mainstream remote device management software that companies use can remotely wipe data from a device. Companies need these safeguards in case you leave the organization. Your employer has to be able to delete sensitive data on managed apps and any database content you might have on your device. But the device management software doesn’t just have the ability to wipe company-managed apps. It can also delete entire apps and even wipe the whole phone. Image Credit: pathdoc via Shutterstock As an employee, this means your data is permanently vulnerable to the whims of your company. If you’ve signed a BYOD contract, even something as innocent as accidentally downloading a company file to a non-managed app could give your employers reason to wipe your phone. Bottom line: Your photos, music, files, and messages are all at risk of being deleted without your consent. Security Pitfalls for Companies While most employee risks are mostly privacy-based, the employer risks mainly revolve around security. Here are the three top ways companies are at risk from their BYOD policies. 1. Lost Devices A company can spend thousands of dollars on the latest security software, but can’t do anything to prevent simple user error. People lose things 2 Easy Ways to Recover a Lost or Stolen Android Phone 2 Easy Ways to Recover a Lost or Stolen Android Phone These methods can help you find your lost or stolen Android phone or tablet. Read More , and things get stolen. And if the lost device happens to contain highly sensitive information, it can be devastating for the company in question. Indeed, data suggests more than 60 percent of all enterprise network breaches are due to stolen devices. A company will argue this is why it needs remote mobile device management software on BYOD gadgets, but employees are likely to push back for reasons I’ve already discussed. The problem can lead to a stalemate in which neither the employer or employee are happy with the situation. 2. Unsecured Networks People are going to use their devices on a wide range of networks. And although your home Wi-Fi might be largely safe from criminals and hackers, the same cannot be said for public Wi-Fi in hotels and airports 7 Secure Strategies to Use Public Wi-Fi Safely on Phones 7 Secure Strategies to Use Public Wi-Fi Safely on Phones Is that public Wi-Fi network you just connected to safe? Before you sip your latte, and read Facebook, consider these simple secure strategies to using public Wi-Fi safely on your phone. Read More . Such networks are rich hunting grounds for cyber-criminals. Hackers can lurk in wait for a poorly secured device to log on, then wreak havoc as soon as a connection is made. Again, the data supports the theory. Estimates suggest hackers target as many as 40 percent of all BYOD devices on a public Wi-Fi network within four months of use. Companies can protect against these problems with robust security profiling, but do non-tech SMEs have the budget, time, or knowledge to take such steps? 3. Software Updates The disparity between how different companies release updates can cause problems from companies. For example, look at the difference between Apple’s centralized update process and the fragmented Android approach. Employees will be using a wide variety of devices, and IT departments have no way of forcing them to upgrade to the latest releases. The same thing applies to third-party apps: how can companies be certain that the app’s code isn’t vulnerable? Image Credit: Markus Mainka via Shutterstock Sure, companies can prevent employees with out-of-date software from accessing the networks, but then the employee is going to be unable to do their job. It defeats one of the key original tenets of BYOD: improved productivity. Are You Worried About BYOD? I’ve shared the three biggest BYOD security concerns from both and employer’s and employee’s viewpoint. Of course, there are lots of benefits to the policy, but both parties need to be aware of the risks they are exposing themselves to. At the moment, not enough of the stakeholders possess sufficient knowledge. Are you an office worker with an unsavory BYOD story to share? Have you encountered a BYOD horror show at your SME?

From my experience, I have had users calls saying their cellphone suddenly wipe itself, while the phone was in their pocket! This can also on very very rare occassion happen if the cellphone is pressing buttons in their pocket to cause too many password attempts, but could be in some cases our MDM glitched out and decided to wipe out the device. For example, the MDM glitched thinking the device is no longer compliant, or malware detected, and for some reason instead of doing its usual thing the MDM decided to start a remote wipe, automatically, without an IT guy clicking any buttons. Reply David Martchouk June 8, 2017 at 8:36 pm I am an IT employee that gives out BYOD instructions for cellphones, and while we normally use a MDM solution for company cellphones, for BYOD we now only use ActiveSync for emails. The amazing thing is, even with our ol' Exchange 2010 server we can easily wipe the entire cellphone. We can wipe any cellphone by only using ActiveSync, even within Outlook Mail app! So yes, if you have BYOD be warry that all your data could very easily be deleted remotely, you can even do it yourself by accident within your Outlook Mail app that you login to.

It’s an emotional roller coaster that can bring fear, anxiety, frustration and a slew of other feelings. Then it’s only compounded by the fallacies espoused by the mainstream media, such as “buy and hold,” “dollar cost averaging” and “compounding.” Sure these are all great in theory, but the problem is that for most investors it turns into “buy and fold,” “buying more of a losing position” and surprise “compounding losses.” Just ask anyone who invested in the “safe” solid blue-chip Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) back in 1999 and was told to simply buy and hold and they would be rewarded… Yet, after more than a decade check out how that “buy and hold” strategy performed: But what’s perhaps worse than the frustration those investors went through or the fact that their “safe” blue-chip stock lost them money is the fact that they just lost those 10-plus years. The time aspect is the real kicker. You can eventually recover from a loss, but you can never make up for the lost time. And it is time that is crucial to reaching your investment or retirement goals. 8 No-Brainer Retirement Stocks to Buy Of course, the time and risk aversion components of investing are rarely talked about in the mainstream media. Instead, they insist that if you sell, you’re going to “miss out” on some level of the bull market. But the problem is that they never tell you the devastating effects that large losses can have on your portfolio. Remember, we can’t use arithmetic averages when it comes to investing. Using arithmetic average would suggest that a 100% gain and a 50% loss averages out to an annual return of 25%. (100-50=50/2=25). Making one think that if you invested $100 in that scenario you would have $125. Unfortunately, the real world of investing doesn’t work like that. If you invested $100 and made a 100% gain in year one, that would put you at $200. But a 50% loss in year two brings you back to $100. So, in the end, you haven’t made a dime… but you did lose two years. Understanding how to manage the inherent risks associated with investing can be the difference between making money in the market and hitting your investment goals, or losing a fortune. This is why every great investor in history is defined by the methods by which they manage their investments. Not only when they buy, but more important, when they sell. The difference between a successful long-term investor and an unsuccessful one comes down to following some simple rules. Longtime readers of my premium newsletter, Maximum Profit, should recognize these rules. I talk about them regularly in the pages of my newsletter. That’s because while we use a proven  system to identify solid companies with sustained price momentum to give clear “buy” and “sell” signals, it still comes down to the individual following those rules to achieve success. But despite their simplicity, they seem to be some of the most difficult rules for individuals to follow. But they’re so important.

Mark Warner asked Comey why he took such copious notes immediately after each of his nine encounters with President Donald Trump. Comey cited the heady and sensitive topics of the  conversations, and the fact that Trump arranged so no one else had been present. Then Comey added that he was moved to take notes, and do it fast, because of “the nature of the person.” “I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document.” “That combination of things I had never experienced before,” Comey said. “But it led me to believe I got to write it down and got to write it down in a very detailed way.

Reply eye roll • on Jun 8, 2017 9:37 am Because the president tried to obstruct justice on several occasions. Because Trump directly told Comey to lay off on the Flynn investigation. Because Trump tried to derail the Russian investigation on several occasions. Because at least six of Trump’s closest associates didn’t disclose or lied about contact with Russian agents. Because the day after Trump fired Comey, he boasted to the Russian ambassador and the Russian foreign minister in the Oval Office “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” Because the Russian tried to hack our elections. That’s why.

It would kind of be like a superpower. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have tools to do it – right now. They are tinkering with artificial intelligence, racks of cloud computing power and ordinary cameras found in every smartphone. And they are anxious to give these tools to developers. It’s going to lead to a new class of corporate superheroes, and the reinvention of business models. We should not be surprised. This is the New Gilded Age. Information technology is growing exponentially. It was just a matter of time before engineers figured out how to use AI to index the physical world. At Google’s recent developer conference, CEO Sundar Pichai unveiled the smartphone app Google Lens. The camera software can easily identify people, places and objects. The sensors inside smartphones give those images context. You just tap the Google Lens icon and point the camera lens at an object. Then the app connects to the full power of Google’s massive knowledge graph. And the object appears on the phone’s screen along with options to get more information. For example, if you aimed at a restaurant, Google Lens can show you the eatery’s hours, menu and reviews. Microsoft is going one step further. Its Custom Vision Search software recognizes images in photographs and video. It adds metadata, uses facial recognition, can transcribe real-time video and even provide translation to supported languages. CVS Health Corp. (CVS) has current partnerships with Samsung, Hewlett Packard and Intel. It’s also being pushed into the Microsoft SDK and API channels supported by 141 million software developers. Now, imagine what they will build. Maintenance workers in the field might gain instant access to repair manuals. The addition of augmented-reality visors would free their hands, boosting productivity and reducing training times. Retailers might enhance the in-store shopping experience by making information about pricing and availability just a snapshot away. The possibilities are endless. The applications will come, soon. Both Microsoft and Alphabet are leading public cloud-computing vendors. All of the corporate world is headed to the public cloud or some combination of public cloud and corporate data center. Gartner, an information technology research firm, argues cloud computing has the potential to be a $1 trillion sector. Companies have already been migrating because it’s more modular, more secure and ultimately more cost-efficient. The rapid ascent of AI will hasten the advance. There is a growing consensus that if your company doesn’t have an AI strategy, it is going to be disrupted by one that does. IDC predicts spending for AI projects will rise to $47 billion by 2020. For reference, it was $8 billion in 2016. And Andrew Ng – the ex-Google, ex-Baidu AI guru – calls AI the new electricity. It’s high praise. It’s also kind of reality. AI allows companies to take data and turn it into actionable intelligence. The way superheroes see nefarious behavior and leap into action. Some people might think the only way to play the trend is Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon (AMZN), the major public-cloud companies. That is simply not true. AI changes business models. The tumult will be felt in every sector. I help my Pivotal Point Trader members find winners, and avoid losers. And there are plenty of companies hiding in the most unlikely places, from banking to oil-well services. It really is the start of something new and important. A new breed of super stocks is being forged by New Gilded Age advances. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) was trading at $57.17 per share on Thursday morning, down $0.14 (-0.24%).

Marco Rubio, part of the 15-member Senate Intel Committee now questioning former FBI Director James Comey, boiled down the three requests Comey says President Donald Trump made to him during their meetings: Related Perfect Casting Helps Make 'The Comey Show' A Hit Demanded FBI director’s “loyalty” Wanted Comey to “let the [Michael] Flynn thing go” Asked Comey to tell American people that POTUS is not under investigation Comey declined on all three asks. Trump fired Comey in May. Noting how much has been leaked to the press as various entities investigate Russia’s interfering in the 2016 election – this investigation is so full of leaks, Rubio said, they sometimes “learn more from the press than in open hearings” – Rubio asked Comey, like he meant it to sting, why the “only thing never leaked is that the president is not under investigation.” Comey declined to take the bait.

James Risch (R-ID) asked Comey about a New York Times report that suggested the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia using electronic surveillance, and Comey shot down that there was any truth to the reports. In fact, Comey said the false report distressed him so much that he surveyed the intelligence community to see if he was missing something. When he discovered that the report was inaccurate, he convened with Republicans and Democrats to alert them of the falsehoods. “It was not true. … The challenge, and I’m not picking on reporters, about writing stories about classified information is the people talking about it often don’t really know what’s going on, and those of us that actually know what’s going on are not talking about it,” Comey explained. “And we don’t call the press to say, ‘hey, you got this thing wrong about this sensitive topic,'” he continued. “We just have to leave it there … nonsense. But I can’t go on explaining why it’s nonsense.” WATCH: Follow Amber on Twitter Tags: James Comey, New York Times Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Trending Popular Emailed 11 Things We Learned From Comey’s Testimony Rosie O’Donnell Gives Large Sum Of Money To NSA Leaker Rubio Asks The Most Obvious Question About The Comey Leaks Things Turn Bitchy In The Media Scrum Outside The Comey Hearing Lynch Successfully Pressured Comey To Mislead Public Using Clinton Campaign’s ‘Inaccurate’ Talking Points Lynch Successfully Pressured Comey To Mislead Public Using Clinton Campaign’s ‘Inaccurate’ Talking Points Comey: ‘No,’ Trump Didn’t Ask Me To Stop Investigation Harvard Researchers: Trump Election May Cause Higher Risk Of Disease The Internet Is Losing It Over a Passage From Hillary Clinton’s Book Evoking Slavery Imagery EXCLUSIVE: Obama Never Warned State Election Officials Of Russian Election ‘Hacking’ Dershowitz: Trump Could Have Just Pardoned Flynn [VIDEO] Burr Suspends Kamala Harris During Senate Intel Hearing [VIDEO] FLASHBACK: Robert Gates Said He Felt Pressured To Tell Obama He Would Be Loyal WaPo Takes Anonymous Sourcing To A Whole New Level In Latest Obstruction Story COULTER: All We Need Is Love… And Deportations Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Emails and Notifications Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

UC Santa Barbara graduate programs include film and media studies, global and international studies, media arts and technology, marine science, environmental sciences and management and the nation’s first doctoral degree in Chicana and Chicano studies. While both undergrad and grad students prepare to graduate, grad students have a unique perspective of UCSB, as they have either stayed after completing their bachelor’s degree or come from a variety of different undergraduate experiences, some on the opposite side of the country. As a graduate student at UCSB Engineering, students will be involved in world-leading research in their field, with the perfect environment to go deeper into solving important problems, producing new technologies and evolving their fundamental knowledge of science and engineering. / gradpost.ucsb.edu Alexander Hunter is one of those grad students who have been at UCSB as an undergraduate and as a graduate. Having completed his master’s degree in electronics and electrical engineering during Winter Quarter, he is now working at Intel in Arizona. “It was a little different for me because I was a transfer student; I came in a little bit older than everyone as far as undergrad went. In the courses I was in, everyone already had their friend groups,” Hunter said. “That’s the main thing I remember as a transfer student, but only that  first year was difficult since I had to adjust to the quarter system and adjust to not knowing anyone. Before going to grad school, Hunter says he did not know much about it. However, he knew that one of his goals was to go to grad school and get his master’s. Fortunately, electrical engineering has a five-year B.S./M.S. program in which students receive their bachelor’s in four years and their master’s the year after. Hunter applied to that program at the end of his junior year and was notified of his acceptance while studying abroad in Chile. “Grad school was different; it had its ups and downs. Since I stayed [at UCSB], all the friends that I had and studied with, they all left. Like, 90 percent of them left,” Hunter said. “I had to reestablish my friend group. On the other side, I still knew a ton of people; I still knew all of NSBE [National Society of Black Engineers]. I still knew some underclassmen, who were then seniors.” Hunter notes that by staying at UCSB he felt camaraderie with professors, students’ clubs and staff. “The best thing about the professors was that I always had someone to TA for and it wasn’t hard getting research. Those were the pros [of staying],” Hunter said. The biggest con of staying at UCSB was coursework, according to Hunter. “I had either taken the most interesting courses or had taken the majority of them before I was even a grad student. So, what I primarily wanted to do — circuit design — they had, like, maybe one of two classes I hadn’t taken,” Hunter said. “If I went to a different school there would have been completely different coursework, different professors. It would have been more [diverse], coursework-wise.” When asked about his decision to stay at UCSB for grad school, Hunter said it had to do with the fact that he was in Chile when the applications were due. “It was much more difficult to talk to professors regarding letters of rec or references. I couldn’t walk into a professor’s office hours and ask for advice,” Hunter said. “That was out the window because I was in another country and not everyone responds to their emails quickly.” He encourages others to apply to different grad schools but does not regret his experience at UCSB. “I loved it and I got a good job out of it,” Hunter said.   Michelle Labrecque, another grad student who pursued her master’s degree in electrical engineering, had a different experience, as she obtained her undergraduate degree in North Carolina. Labrecque graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a double major in physics and math, but after graduation she was not sure what she wanted to do with her degree. “I did my undergrad at [UNC]. I took a few years off between undergraduate and graduate,” Labrecque said. “I went to [South] Korea and taught English for a year and then I came to Goleta and started a job in 2012. I worked at that job for about three years before starting my masters at UCSB.” Labrecque started working at Transphorm Inc. as an electrical engineer, which inspired her to go back to school and get her master’s in electrical engineering. As part of the master’s curriculum, both Labrecque and Hunter were involved in research during their time at UCSB. “I did my research in electrically characterizing semiconductors,” Labrecque said. “So specifically, the system I worked on was DLTS, which stands for ‘deep level transient spectroscopy,’ and this is a very sensitive instrument to electrically characterize semiconductors. You can kind of find signatures or fingerprints to indicate what sort of defect is inside the semiconductor based on the results of the typing.” Hunter’s research involved power amplifiers, and he wanted to improve the operating range and get an estimation of error generated by the power amplifier. “They’re devices that aren’t very efficient. So you’re pumping power into them and they spit out more power and have this linear relationship; like, for every watt of power it’ll give me five watts. It does that until you reach, like, 10 watts and it’ll give you 40 watts instead of 50,” Hunter said. He looked at amplifiers and changed the rate at which they satuarate. “What I mean by that is, let’s say you’re getting this perfect linear relationship and then immediately it goes flat. That would be zero saturation,” he said. “We had another [experiment] where we varied it from extreme cases so it would slowly stray from being linear and then get to this flat line. It’s called the compression rate. What we found was that if we vary this compression rate, we can come up with an estimation on how much error is generated based on a power amplifier.” Labrecque and Hunter agree that their master’s degree has helped them in the work force. “Actually, my research directly ties into the job I’m doing now in town. It has allowed me to take my work into a different direction than I would have otherwise,” Labrecque said. Hunter believes that believes that with a master’s degree, he was able to obtain more base knowledge. “Now that I’m working, I’m using some of it. In short, yes it does, but you don’t use everything you learn. In my opinion, school, it might be different for Ph.D., but for bachelor’s and master’s, when you get a job, it’s like your permit to learn. It’s like [your employer] trusts you,” Hunter said. “When you get a graduate degree, you do go in-depth on some topics, and when you do you learn a lot more, and when you go out in the work force it’s easier for you to learn a lot because you have a lot of base knowledge.” Print Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Related <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d620d4ba43&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536875323&amp;cs=d620d4ba43&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=8b66e5310d&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536875323&amp;cs=8b66e5310d&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

Live Watch Key players in James Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee By CAROLINE COHEN Adam Kelsey Close Follow on Twitter More from Adam Jun 8, 2017, 10:36 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlaySaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images WATCH Key moments from Comey's testimony on Trump, Russia 0 Shares Email Former FBI Director James Comey is testifying on Capitol Hill today amid a swirl of questions about the Russia investigation and in the wake of his firing. Here are a look at the key players in the Senate Intelligence Committee testimony: James Comey, former FBI director Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo FBI Director James Comey prepares to testify on Capitol Hill in Washington, May 3, 2017, before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing: "Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation." Comey served over three years as the director of the FBI before his firing in May by President Trump, which would lead to Thursday's hearing. Prior to his appointment by President Obama in 2013, he worked as deputy attorney general in the Bush administration and U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York for almost two years. In written testimony released Wednesday, he wrote that Trump asked for his loyalty during private meetings and that he assured the president that he wasn't personally under investigation. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee J. Scott Applewhite/AP Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr orders Sen. Kamala Harris to suspend her inquiry of top national security chiefs testifying on the gathering intelligence on foreign agents, on Capitol Hill in Washington, June 7, 2017. After serving five terms in the House, Burr moved to the Senate, where he currently is serving his second terms. He has been an adamant support of military families and veterans, and prioritizes protecting American security through his work on the Senate Intel Committee. During Wednesday’s hearing of Coats and company, he demanded answers, saying: “At no time should you be in a position to come to Congress without an answer.” Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence committee Jacquelyn Martin/AP Sen. Mark Warner attends a Senate Finance Committee meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, March 5, 2014. The Democrat was elected to his Senate post to represent the state of Virginia in 2008, and is currently serving his second term. In the Senate, Warner has a record of reaching across the aisle to increase government accountability and improve job creation. Prior to his post in the Senate, Warner served as the Governor of Virginia from 2002 to 2006. Warner was disappointed with the answers he received Wednesday from DNI Coats and Admiral Roberts. He emphasized the gravity of this investigation, comparing it to Watergate when he said on Morning Joe: “We are in a land that we’ve never visited before, even back beyond the ‘70s.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill, May 17, 2017, on the controversies surrounding President Donald Trump. Feinstein is a 24-year senate veteran who is the former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Feinstein, 83, is the oldest member of the senate, and was quick to question the White House's rationale for firing Comey last month, immediately asking publicly whether the dismissal was tied to the Russia investigation. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. Alex Brandon/AP Sen. Kamala Harris reacts during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, on Capitol Hill, June 7, 2017, in Washington, D.C. A first term senator, just five months into her term, Harris is the former attorney general of California and district attorney of San Francisco. Her highly-publicized senate victory in the country's most populous state and willingness to take on high-profile issues early into her senate tenure has led to speculation she could be eyeing a bid for the presidency in 2020. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Susan Walsh/AP Photo Sen. Marco Rubio listens to testimony during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington,March 30, 2017, on Russian intelligence activities. Rubio is serving his second term in the Senator, previously serving as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. In the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Rubio ran a competitive campaign but eventually ceded to President Trump. During Wednesday’s hearing, Rubio responded to Coats’ refusal to answer by saying that “the American people deserve to know” the validity of media claims surrounding the investigation. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. Danny Johnston/AP Photo Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., speaks in front of the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock, Ark., May 26, 2015. Cotton is serving his first term in the Senate, having been elected in 2014. Before becoming Senator, Cotton served in the military in Iraq and Afghanistan and held one term in the U.S. House of Representatives. Cotton has worked alongside Trump to craft policy that aligns with both traditional Republican beliefs and Trump’s unique rhetoric. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Key players in James Comey's testimony " Unlike Trump so far, Rex Tillerson recognizes Pride Month " Barbara Bush turns 92, Twitter celebrates " Did Comey lay out a case for obstruction of justice?

Michael Flynn, the most prominent target of the FBI’s investigation of Russian election interference, is expected to emerge Thursday at the center of the brewing political firestorm over allegations that President Trump made repeated entreaties to then-FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation. “One of the important questions is what was the president’s intent when he allegedly said to Mr. Comey ‘Go easy on Flynn,’” Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, told ABC News. Comey is set to testify that Trump made repeated requests to the director to drop the investigation of Flynn, according to the advance copy of Comey’s upcoming testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. It remains unclear, King said, whether those alleged requests were motivated by compassion for Flynn, loyalty to the man who strongly backed his candidacy, or driven by self-preservation aimed at keeping Flynn from being forced to share more about any questionable relationship between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The probe, which has already ensnared several current and former associates of President Donald Trump, has expanded to look at a questionable paid appearance Flynn made in Russia and side work Flynn was doing in the midst of the 2016 campaign through his consulting firm, the Flynn Intel Group. The firm belatedly filed papers with the Justice Department to disclose work he did that could have benefitted the Turkish government. Flynn also accepted $45,000 to attend a dinner in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his firm received $500,000 from a Dutch company with ties to Turkey. Flynn first came under investigation for his ties to Russia during the campaign when he was Donald Trump’s senior foreign policy adviser and a strident supporter. After the election, during the transition, Flynn failed to report that he had secretly met with the Russian ambassador, even lying to vice-president elect Michael Pence about discussing lifting sanctions with the ambassador at that meeting. Pence then unknowingly repeated the lie to the public. That discussion was at the heart of Trump’s request to the then-FBI director to drop the investigation, according to the advance copy of Comey’s testimony. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go,” Comey says Trump told him. Comey said he gave the president no such assurances before he was suddenly fired in May. In March, Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, defended his client from the swirl of allegations that have dogged him since Trump was elected. "Gen. Flynn is a highly decorated 33-year veteran of the U.S. Army," Kelner said. "He devoted most of his life to serving his country, spending many years away from his family fighting this nation’s battles around the world ... Notwithstanding his life of national service, the media are awash with unfounded allegations, outrageous claims of treason, and vicious innuendo directed against him." It’s not just Flynn’s behavior that will face intense scrutiny during Comey’s testimony. According to Matt Olsen, a former federal prosecutor for the FBI and an ABC News contributor, Trump’s alleged attempts to pressure Comey have landed him in the spotlight as well. “It appears that the president is really trying to isolate the investigation, really establish a firewall around the White House by asking Comey to drop the investigation,” Olsen told ABC News. “Again, something that's completely inconsistent with the principle of the rule of law.” According to John Carlin, the former assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice who is now an ABC News contributor, if it appears that Trump’s actions rose to the level of obstruction of justice, lawmakers could be heading into uncharted territory. “The key here isn't whether it violates a criminal statute because you can't bring that criminal charge against a sitting president,” Carlin told ABC News. “So I think at the end of the day you have to look as to whether this is an impeachable offense. And there's not a lot of precedent there.” Copyright © 2017, ABC Radio. All rights reserved. Article is invalid or is no longer published.

Not so for Thursday's Senate Intelligence hearing, featuring fired FBI Director James Comey. It's the first time Comey is speaking publicly about his termination by President Donald Trump. In addition to CPSAN 3 (and the CSPAN radio app), news networks CBS, NBC, Fox, and ABC all plan to preempt their programming to carry the 10 a.m. hearing live. Cable news outlets CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News will also carry the hearing live, but that's far less rare. (Also commonplace: both CNN and Fox News are employing a countdown clock in the corner of their screens, ticking down to the start of the testimony.) A bevy of D.C. bars are treating the hearing like it's the Super Bowl, opening early and offering drink specials. One is even promising a round of free drinks every time President Donald Trump tweets about Comey during the testimony, as The Washington Post reports the commander in chief might do. It all begins at 10 a.m. EST. Here are the best ways to watch: Senate Intelligence Committee website PBS is livestreaming So is CNN Plus, Bloomberg is streaming the testimony on Twitter In the meantime, prepare yourself by reading Comey's opening statement, which the Senate Intel Committee released on Wednesday afternoon. The statement chronologically explains Comey and Trump's interactions from the former FBI director's perspective. Comey made it a practice to create a written record of each time he spoke with Trump, though he had not done so with the previous president. He notes that the number of times he spoke directly with Trump over the course of four months—three in person and six over the phone—was significantly more than the two times he spoke with President Barack Obama alone over three years. Comey describes a series of interactions that "concerned me greatly," with Trump engaging in an effort to "create some sort of patronage relationship." During a one-on-one dinner, Trump told him "I need loyalty, I expect loyalty." According to Comey, Trump asked him to "lift the cloud" of the Russia investigation. "He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia," the testimony reads. That bit about hookers refers to an unverified dossier often referred to as "The Pee Tape." That's because it claims that Trump hired Russian sex workers to urinate in front of him in a hotel room, and the entire escapade was taped by the Russians to be used as blackmail. The testimony ends with the poetic line, "That was the last time I spoke with President Trump." Less than a month after their final conversation, Trump fired Comey.

We duly noted the first content creator professional targeted iMac, the aptly named Apple iMac Pro, and also a pair of powerful and sleek new iPad Pro tablets, again fishing for high-end content creator customers. With such headlining products the refreshed iMac line didn't earn many column inches. However, as revealed by a new iFixIt teardown, the refreshed Kaby Lake iMacs are the first since 2012 to feature a non-soldered Intel CPU, and the first to offer removable / upgradeable RAM since 2013. The precise model of iMac taken to bits by iFixIt was the $1,299 Apple iMac Intel 21.5-inch Retina 4K Display 2017. This model is equipped with the following hardware: 3.0GHz quad-core (Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz) Intel Core i5-7400 Kaby Lake processor in a standard LGA 1151 CPU socket 8GB 2400MHz memory, configurable to 16GB 1TB hard drive Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB video memory Two Thunderbolt 3 ports Retina 4K 4096-by-2304 P3 display Apple can fit upgrades before you buy; the processor can be upgraded (to a 3.6GHz i7 for an extra $300), to 16GB of RAM (extra $200), and to better storage choices rather than the default 1TB HDD (Fusion drive, or various capacity SATA SSDs). However it's good to know you will be able to buy and do the upgrades yourself at some future date, if you feel the need. While these upgradeable / swappable components are welcome, the new iMac still doesn't fare that well on the iFixIt reparability score. Three out of ten is awarded, as even though its quite easy to get into your new iMac, most upgrade-targets like the RAM are still hidden beneath the logic board so extensive disassembly is required to access them - it isn't a trivial task.

Posted by b0redom - Thu 08 Jun 2017 15:01 This isn't strictly true though is it? Opening up the Mac and removing all the heatsinks etc will void your warranty, and whilst the CPU and RAM aren't soldered on, the process for getting to them isn't exactly easy. Finally, this has only been confirmed for the 21.5" model, and none of the articles I've seen have suggested what other CPUs are compatible, either in terms of actual functionality or thermal envelope. Posted by DaMoot - Thu 08 Jun 2017 18:24 Chances are you'll find Apple has that laptop motherboard locked down to only a couple of processor models. Apple runs their systems very hot to help with planned obsolescence and failure (gotta make sure you replace that hardware every 1-2 years! :P), so I doubt they'd particularly want you sticking a CPU in there that the already taxed cooler can handle (voided warranty or not). Or worse yet, put a slightly more efficient CPU in to bring operating temps down and let things run longer. Posted by DevDrake - Thu 08 Jun 2017 18:49 Wow, what a invention, what a news! (not like you can do that in PC from beginning) I wonder when they plan to patent this stuff. I guess they made it so they will have less unsold boards in the stock - as the same board will be sold in few configurations, or just upgraded overtime. Not for me.

Richard Burr, R-N.C., leaves a closed-door GOP caucus luncheon at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 14, 2014. Photo by J. Scott Applewhite/AP Key GOP senator shrugs off Trump’s scandalous demand for loyalty 06/08/17 09:20 AM By Steve Benen Donald Trump sat down with Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro last month, and the host, responding to a New York Times account, asked the president if he pressed then-FBI Director James Comey for his loyalty. “No,” Trump replied. “No, I didn’t.” Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 6/7/17, 9:20 PM ET Four key points in Comey's opening statement to Senate Intel Rachel Maddow reviews some of the key points in former FBI Director James Comey’s opening statement to the Senate Intelligence Committee before his testimony Thursday. share tweet email save Embed We now have reason to believe the president was lying. The Comey statement released yesterday provides the details of the conversation in which Trump reportedly told the head of the FBI, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty” – and then seemed to connect his expectations to Comey’s continued employment. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told MSNBC yesterday that it was “obviously” not appropriate for Trump to make such a request. Unfortunately, not every Republican leader agrees. The Washington Post reported: Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who is leading the Senate probe of possible Russian coordination with Trump associates, said he was not alarmed by Comey’s account. “I don’t think it’s wrong to ask for loyalty of anyone inside an administration,” Burr said. “I don’t think of what I’ve read there’s anything of wrongdoing.” Note, Burr isn’t rejecting Comey’s account as unreliable. Rather, the North Carolina Republican is saying that if the account is true, he just doesn’t care.  I realize assorted partisans are going to take steps to defend their party’s leader, but Burr’s quote is unsettling, not just because he’s the chairman of the committee investigating the Russia scandal, but also because he’s completely wrong. The FBI published a document several years ago that’s still online, which Richard Burr may want to take a minute to read: “It is significant that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution and not an individual leader, ruler, office, or entity. This is true for the simple reason that the Constitution is based on lasting principles of sound government that provide balance, stability, and consistency through time. A government based on individuals – who are inconsistent, fallible, and often prone to error – too easily leads to tyranny on the one extreme or anarchy on the other. The founding fathers sought to avoid these extremes and create a balanced government based on constitutional principles.” All Americans – including the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee – should care when a sitting president abandons these principles and tells the director of the FBI, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” Richard Burr, confronted with this, said he doesn’t see anything “wrong” with such an appeal. That’s as ridiculous as it is dangerous: our system of government is predicated on the idea that those responsible for protecting the rule of law are loyal, above all, to the American system of justice. Trump, however, appears to have pressed Comey to prioritize the interests of his presidency. Vox’s Ezra Klein added yesterday, “Trump’s behavior, in Comey’s telling, is more befitting of a Mafioso than a president. He asks, repeatedly, for loyalty, and shows no evident understanding of the norms or institutions that bind American presidents. His actions would be worrying if they came from the regional manager of a Scranton paper firm; they are terrifying coming from the most powerful man in the world.” Partisans who dismiss this as insignificant may need a refresher on American Civics 101.

Why Apple’s Last Foray Into Home Speakers Was Such a Fiasco The iPod Hi-Fi stumbled out of the gate, mocked by audiophiles and announced to the world during perhaps Apple’s weakest Steve Jobs keynote ever. The speaker was nice enough, but it simply didn’t match iPod users’ needs. Monday's keynote at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference was perhaps the most action-packed set of releases from Apple in quite a long time, with the kicker being Cupertino's take on the Amazon Echo and the Sonos Play speaker systems, the snazzy-but-expensive HomePod. Certainly the device, which combines high-quality sound with a touch of Siri, is deserving of some of the hype it's gotten so far. But the buzz of Monday's event stands in stark contrast to the release of Apple's last big foray into the home speaker market, the iPod Hi-Fi. That device was the centerpiece of a February 2006 product announcement that looked downright modest in comparison to this year's WWDC. The event, featuring "some medium-scale things," according to then-CEO Steve Jobs, was weirdly small-potatoes for an Apple event, with just three new products introduced: The first Mac Mini with an Intel processor; a $99 leather case for the iPod; and the $349 iPod Hi-Fi, which Jobs described as "home stereo, reinvented for the iPod age." The iPod Hi-Fi, despite being the event's centerpiece, felt like something of a letdown. Jobs sold the device as an attempt by the company to make the iPod suitable for the home—despite an already-crowded iPod speaker market filled with new players like iHome and older ones like Bose. Despite this, Jobs felt there was room for something more powerful. "You do want room-filling power, but without distortion, and a lot of these products do distort when you crank up the volume," Jobs noted. I actually remember the iPod Hi-Fi quite well—because it was the speaker of choice for my employer at the time, a newspaper targeted at millennials that received the speaker as a gift. The device felt absurd: It looked like an iPod-ready clock radio, except super-sized. It was minimalist to the extreme, with little in the way of interface—just volume and play/pause buttons. It had a remote, but that was really only useful for the volume: If you wanted to change the settings beyond simply turning up the volume or selecting the next song, you were better off walking over to the device. It didn't support only iPods, as it had a headphone jack on the back, and in practice, the office mostly used it as a way to play music from an XM Radio receiver. (Steve Jobs probably would have given us the side eye.) The device was a surprisingly non-interactive block of noise, with no ability to do anything other than play music from an audio jack or iPod connector. Having used it regularly for about a year or so, I'll say that the Hi-Fi was fine—best compared, both in terms of price and purpose, to a Bose Wave speaker with stripped-down functionality—and perhaps not worthy of some of the more aggressive disdain that it received at the time. But it failed to connect with consumers. The device was a surprisingly non-interactive block of noise, with no ability to do anything other than play music from an audio jack or iPod connector. (On the other hand, the sound was powerful enough to blow out two rows of candles.) It was easy for the non-audiophiles to dismiss in favor of cheaper options that did more things, and audiophiles were quick to scrutinize the actual sound. And after the device went off the market in late 2007, Apple dropped support pretty much immediately. The Hi-Fi's 30-pin connector didn't even support most iPhones, because of a difference in voltage between the iPhone and iPod. (A device called the Coolstream Bluetooth Receiver, released in 2013, fixed this problem by turning the 30-pin slot on the Hi-Fi into a Bluetooth connector.) The HomePod, with the addition of a lot more interactivity, might have a market for the simple fact that it does a lot more than play music.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Cooling News 5 Noctua talks about its products and prototypes from Computex by Mark Tyson on 8 June 2017, 10:01 Tags: Noctua Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadiiw Add to My Vault: Austrian PC cooling specialist Noctua was displaying its wares at Computex but HEXUS didn't get time to visit and video its exhibits. Thankfully, the company today emailed a recap and summary of all its products and prototypes to us. The news is backed up by a new Noctua blog post here. Among the products on show were prototype 120mm A-series fans (under demonstration, as pictured above) and, predictably, products compatible with the latest AMD X399 and Intel X299 platforms. On the topic of Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X: all current Noctua coolers are said to be compatible already, as the LGA2066 heatsink mounting mechanism is shared with the previous LGA2011-0 and LGA2011-3 sockets. The highlight of Noctua's exhibition stand showcase was the upcoming A-Series 120x25mm high performance fan. In Noctuas own tests at Computex it was shown that a single prorotype fan could match or even beat "two of the renowned NF-F12 fans on an NH-U12S heatsink at a heatload of 190W". In some background info supplied to us, Noctua says that the new fan features "a record tight 0.5mm tip clearance," and will be manufactured from Sterrox liquid-crystal polymer (LCP) compound. Another bonus of the new 120mm fan is that it was shown to be quieter too. This fan is expected to hit the market in H2 2017. Noctua also had prototype A-series fans in the following sizes; 140x25, 140x15, 80x15, 70x15 and 50x10mm. The largest model would be a good choice for high-end CPU coolers or liquid cooling setups reckons Noctua. With plenty of tuning and refinement still needed to these particular fans they aren't likely to hit the market until H2 2018. However a 60x15mm model has moved from prototype to pre-production stage and should be available in Q1/Q2 2018. Colourful components fans are rather popular for PC system customisation and Noctua gave notice that it is preparing Chromax line versions of its award-winning NF-A15, NF-A14, NF-F12 and NF-S12A fans, and coloured fan cables as well as customisation accessories for heatsinks. Coloured anti-vibration pads (black, white, red, blue, yellow and green) will enhance the visual appeal further. Expect these to arrive in Sept/October. Chromax slide-on heatsink covers for the NH-U12S, NH-D15 and NH-D15S are now finalised and will ship later in 2017. For AMD Ryzen Threadripper and EPYC platforms Noctua showed off 140, 120 and 92mm size CPU coolers that feature an enlarged contact surface "to match the new CPUs' gargantuan heatspreaders". Noctua will make these coolers available on, or shortly after, the release date of the new AMD platforms.

On June 6, the team from Project Wing — the experimental drone delivery project at Alphabet’s X “moonshot” umbrella organization — tested a new system to manage drone traffic, Recode reports. Taking part in tests convened by NASA and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Project Wing conducted trials of its own drone traffic control platform at Virginia Tech, where the FAA has set up a test site for flying drones. Wing discussed the project in a blog post published on June 7. The problem of tracking and managing drone flights will be critical to figure out before drone delivery can come to fruition. Drones don’t take off and land from the same place on set routes — in the way airplanes use airports — but rather are supposed to work more like cars, going direct to and from homes and offices. Operators will need to know where other drones are flying in order to prevent collisions, as well as which areas to avoid and when, like if there’s a major sports event or a wildfire. There is no comprehensive nationwide U.S. system for tracking drone traffic, which is one reason why it’s not legal for drones to fly beyond the line of sight of the operator. In Project Wing’s test, the team was able to track the flight paths of multiple drones at once on a single platform. Three of the drones were Project Wing’s own aircraft, a winged drone that the company hopes will one day be used to deliver food and retail items. Another drone in the test was made and operated by Intel and a third drone was an Inspire from DJI. Those two were simulating search and rescue operations, while Wing’s three drones were testing delivery scenarios. With Wing’s drone air traffic control system, the drones automatically steered away from each other without an operator needing to pilot the drones to manually avoid collision. The software helps drones plan routes and sends information to aircraft when an airspace restriction is issued. Wing isn’t the only company exploring low-altitude air traffic control solutions with NASA and the FAA. Airmap — a company that makes a platform to alert air traffic controllers and drone operators to where drones are flying and is already in use at nearly every major airport across the country — is also working with the federal agencies, as are Amazon, Uber and GoPro. Project Wing completed a burrito delivery with Chipotle to Virginia Tech students last September at the same test site it conducted its recent traffic management trials. Still, the last year at Wing hasn’t been without turbulence. A former employee told the Wall Street Journal in a report from last December that the latest model of the Wing drone at that point hadn’t been able to complete more than 300 successful flights before something went wrong. And in the final quarter of last year, the CEO of Wing, David Vos, as well as Sean Mullaney, Wing’s top commercial executive at the time, left the company. NASA and the FAA aren’t scheduled to be done with their research into how to integrate drone air traffic control into the national airspace until 2019. But that doesn’t necessarily mean drone delivery will have to wait that long. On Monday, June 5, Donald Trump shared a proposal to privatize the federal air traffic control system, and last week, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao laid out plans for a pilot program to let local communities experiment with different approaches for controlling drone activity in their airspace. Both may open the doors for private companies to contract with the government to provide drone air traffic control solutions, as opposed to, say, the FAA building its own system, which could take a lot longer. And that means that drone delivery in U.S. skies could happen sooner than previously anticipated, Recode said. Related links: Recode.

Live Watch Michael Flynn is central figure in brewing political drama surrounding Comey testimony By Brian Ross Close Follow on Twitter More from Brian Matthew Mosk Close Follow on Twitter More from Matthew Pete Madden Close Follow on Twitter More from Pete Randy Kreider Close Follow on Twitter More from Randy Jun 8, 2017, 7:42 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayCarolyn Kaster/AP Photo WATCH Michael Flynn and his dealings with Russia are focus of FBI investigation 0 Shares Email General Michael Flynn, the most prominent target of the FBI’s investigation of Russian election interference, is expected to emerge Thursday at the center of the brewing political firestorm over allegations that President Trump made repeated entreaties to then-FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation. “One of the important questions is what was the president’s intent when he allegedly said to Mr. Comey ‘Go easy on Flynn,’” Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, told ABC News. Comey is set to testify that President Trump made repeated requests to the director to drop the investigation of Flynn, according to the advance copy of Comey’s upcoming testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. It remains unclear, King said, whether those alleged requests were motivated by compassion for Flynn, loyalty to the man who strongly backed his candidacy, or driven by self-preservation aimed at keeping Flynn from being forced to share more about any questionable relationship between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The probe, which has already ensnared several current and former associates of President Donald Trump, has expanded to look at a questionable paid appearance Flynn made in Russia and side work Flynn was doing in the midst of the 2016 campaign through his consulting firm, the Flynn Intel Group. The firm belatedly filed papers with the Justice Department to disclose work he did that could have benefitted the Turkish government. Flynn also accepted $45,000 to attend a dinner in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his firm received $500,000 from a Dutch company with ties to Turkey. Flynn first came under investigation for his ties to Russia during the campaign when he was Donald Trump’s senior foreign policy adviser and a strident supporter. After the election, during the transition, Flynn failed to report that he had secretly met with the Russian ambassador, even lying to vice-president elect Michael Pence about discussing lifting sanctions with the ambassador at that meeting. Pence then unknowingly repeated the lie to the public. That discussion was at the heart of President Trump’s request to the then-FBI director to drop the investigation, according to the advance copy of Comey’s testimony. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go,” Comey says Trump told him. Comey said he gave the president no such assurances before he was suddenly fired in May. In March, Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, defended his client from the swirl of allegations that have dogged him since Trump was elected. "Gen. Flynn is a highly decorated 33-year veteran of the U.S. Army," Kelner said. "He devoted most of his life to serving his country, spending many years away from his family fighting this nation’s battles around the world ... Notwithstanding his life of national service, the media are awash with unfounded allegations, outrageous claims of treason, and vicious innuendo directed against him." It’s not just Flynn’s behavior that will face intense scrutiny during Comey’s testimony. According to Matt Olsen, a former federal prosecutor for the FBI and an ABC News contributor, Trump’s alleged attempts to pressure Comey have landed him in the spotlight as well. “It appears that the president is really trying to isolate the investigation, really establish a firewall around the White House by asking Comey to drop the investigation,” Olsen told ABC News. “Again, something that's completely inconsistent with the principle of the rule of law.” According to John Carlin, the former assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice who is now an ABC News contributor, if it appears that Trump’s actions rose to the level of obstruction of justice, lawmakers could be heading into uncharted territory. “The key here isn't whether it violates a criminal statute because you can't bring that criminal charge against a sitting president,” Carlin told ABC News. “So I think at the end of the day you have to look as to whether this is an impeachable offense. And there's not a lot of precedent there.” 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Michael Flynn is central figure in brewing political drama surrounding Comey testimony " Unlike Trump so far, Rex Tillerson recognizes Pride Month " Barbara Bush turns 92, Twitter celebrates " Did Comey lay out a case for obstruction of justice?

The motherboard manufacturer's in-house overclocker HiCookie and his five-person team spent the hours of the show rocketing an Intel Core i7-7740K past 7.5 GHz and setting four new 3DMark records. The team used liquid helium at -220° C, a Corsair AX 1500i power supply, and one of the Gigabyte's own X299-SOC Champion motherboards to set the records. The 7.5 GHz CPU clock speed record was achieved using a Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB 4333 MT/s memory kit, while the 3DMark records were set using G.Skill's Trident Z 3600C17 memory modules and a pair of Gigabyte Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards. The CPU clock speed record is the headline news, but the team also set records of 356,678 points in 3DMark03, 737,222 in Aquamark, 71,928 in 3DMark06 with one GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, and 71,176 in 3DMark06 with two GTX 1080 Ti cards.

These are all in some way mixed in and as development and progress hastens, they will be even more intertwined up to one point when they will become one and form the future of mobility, one that is apparently revolutionary. So far, the most complex of them all – and we could argue that by the fact that it’s not yet common reality like the other three – is the self-driving technology. But it’s not going to take long before it becomes the norm – virtually all automakers, their suppliers as well as a myriad of technology (hardware and software) companies are fully involved. According to Intel’s Strategy Analytics study, once lawmakers come to an agreement about autonomous cars, everyone will have them or disappear into oblivion. More so, the study postulates that “autonomous technology will enable a Passenger Economy worth $7 trillion in 2050.” And these are indirect savings for consumers and businesses – thanks to free time from not driving as well as productivity and cost saving increases. Intel also sees increased overall traffic, but with better consumer commuting time – 250 million hours a year, to be more precise.   Related Tweet Share Share [Video] NEVS InMotion is taking your office to the road June 8, 2017 Euro-spec Nissan X-Trail includes autonomous tech with the facelift June 5, 2017 [Video] The McLaren P1 LM takes the Nurburgring record for itself May 29, 2017 [Video] Jaguar XE SV Project 8 is the pinnacle of current Jags May 29, 2017 [Video] New age begins with the BMW 8 Series Concept May 26, 2017 Recent Posts [Video] Honda announces roadmap towards full autonomy by 2025 Report – Skoda dropping the Citigo in favor of crossovers [Video] Porsche introduces yet another limited series – 911 Turbo S Exclusive [Video] Watch the DTM change over time in comparison race Volvo’s Polestar division moved fast, performance upgrades on 100k vehicles Most Popular Now List of World record highways 10 Busiest Junctions in the world McLaren denies Dennis to challenge new FIA rule McLaren denies Dennis to challenge new FIA rule Jackie Stewart tells Mercedes to quit F1 Jackie Stewart tells Mercedes to quit F1 Hamilton-to-Ferrari rumours fire in Bahrain Ferrari re-opens door to working with Red Bull Test Drive: Renault Captur 0.9 – TCe 90 – fast… 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show LIVE: 2016 Skoda Superb Combi… Latest Galeries Receive Our Newsletter Subscribe to RSS Follow us on Social Media News All the news ordered by time Industry Technology Tuners Videos Safety Car Crashes Concepts Spy Photos IN DEPTH Motor Shows Motor Sport Test Drive Editors Choice Automakers Acura Alfa Romeo Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Bugatti Buick Cadillac Caterharm Chevrolet Chrysler Citroen Dacia Dodge Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford GMC Holden Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Jaguar Jeep Kia Koenigsegg Lamborghini Lancia Land Rover Lexus Lotus Lincoln McLaren Maserati Mazda Mayback Mercede-Benz Mini Mitshubishi Nissan Pagani Peugeot Porsche Opel RAM Renault Rolls Royce Saab Saturn Scion Seat Skoda Spyker Subaru Suzuki Tata Tesla Vauxhall Volkswagen Toyota Volvo Others Copyright © 2017 — INAUTONEWS.

Thor Challgren TAKE YOUR PLAN WITH YOU—Not too long ago, using your cellphone while traveling abroad meant a huge bill at the end of the month. Today, all major wireless providers offer some type of temporary international package for a fixed cost. In the world of computing, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore observed in the early 1970s that computer processor speeds would double every two years. Moore’s Law, as it is famously known, has generally held true in the years since. Consumers have come to expect regular speed boosts in their computers and mobile devices. I cite this because in July 2014 I wrote about cellphone coverage while traveling. Whether it’s accessing city maps, Googling info on museum hours, making a restaurant reservation or texting a question to a tour operator, travelers use their phones a lot on vacation, a trend that has only accelerated in the last three years. At the time of my first piece, I found that if you wanted to use your cellphone overseas, one thing was certain: It would be expensive. My, how times (and competition) have changed things. Call it Moore’s Law for cellphone plans. Here’s a quote from the 2014 piece, in which I cited the international rates from my own carrier: “With AT&T, for example, you can add coverage for one month only, at a rate of $5 for voice calls, $10 for 100 text messages and $30 for 120MB of data.” With that as a typical 2014 baseline, let’s review how the top three carriers (measured in subscribers) stack up today. AT&T: With a qualifying plan (AT&T Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Choice), you can add the “AT&T International Day Pass” plan. For $10 a day per device, you’ll receive unlimited talk and text as well as access to the data allotment in your domestic plan. You pay only for the days you use, but assuming daily use, your cost for a seven- to 10-day trip would be $70 to $100. Compare that to the $45 you would have paid in 2014 for a minimum talk, text and data plan. Yes, it costs more today, but you’re getting substantially more data today than you were then (120 MB then versus more than 10 GB today.) AT&T also offers benefits to U.S. customers who travel to Mexico or Canada. With a qualifying plan (see above), you’ll essentially be able to use your phone in those countries exactly as if you were at home. Talk, text and use as much of your data as you want; there’s no extra cost. Verizon: America’s largest cell provider offers its own “TravelPass” plan, which has a similar cost structure to the AT&T plan described above. For $10 a day per device, you’ll have access to your domestic plan’s allowance of talk, texting and data in over 100 countries. You’re charged only on the days you use your device in those countries. For travel to Mexico and Canada, the cost per day is $5 per device, though that fee is waived if you happen to have the carrier’s new Verizon Unlimited Plan. T-Mobile: If you’re an AT&T or Verizon customer and you benefit from the deals described above, you can thank America’s third largest cell provider. T-Mobile markets and prices their cell plans aggressively, often forcing the other two majors to match them when possible. With its popular T-Mobile ONE plan, you’d receive free data and texting in over 140 countries. Compare that to Verizon and AT&T, which charge $10 a day to use those same services. For voice calling with T-Mobile, you’d pay 20 cents per minute in most countries—still a relative bargain. The data speed for this included benefit is described as “up to 3G.” If you want faster speeds abroad, you could select their ONE Plus plan for an additional $5 per month, which doubles download speeds and adds a stash of hotspot data you could use for a tablet. T-Mobile also offers an “On Demand Data Pass,” giving you a fixed amount of additional data for a set price. Of course, no matter which provider you use, companies often change the plans they offer, so I recommend speaking with them directly before you travel to make sure you have the best plan, pricing and international coverage for your needs. If talk, text and data usage are stitched into your normal routine at home, you’ll be happier if you can enjoy the same benefits while traveling abroad.

Photograph: Tony Lewis for the Guardian Guardian Careers women in technology Women in eSports: 'Ignore the stereotypes and do what you want' Cyberbullying and the pay gap are just two of the hurdles facing female gamers, but that isn’t holding them back Supported by About this content Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Emma Featherstone @emfeatherstone Thursday 8 June 2017 02.00 EDT Last modified on Thursday 8 June 2017 04.29 EDT The day begins with a breakfast rich in protein and carbohydrates, followed by a workout designed to sharpen the reflexes and mental stamina. Next is an intense, eight-hour training session with the team in preparation for a forthcoming tournament. This is the typical day in a life of a woman who plays computer games in front of live audiences and millions of people online for a living. Stephanie Harvey, also known by her gamer name MissHarvey, is one of them. “It’s an amazing experience,” she says. “I travel the world, I game, I do what I love.” Women face additional obstacles to overcome about the validity of a career in eSports Carleigh Morgan Esports, which is organised, competitive computer gaming, is a fast-growing industry, with global revenues estimated to reach £1bn by 2020. Professional gamers earn money from championship winnings, sponsorships and live-streaming games; those with regular viewers can partner with streaming sites, earning fees for attracting subscribers. Others might ask for donations or receive tips in online currency from viewers. Los Angeles-based Harvey, who is part of an all-woman team specialising in the first-person shooter game Counter Strike, is sponsored by Intel and says she makes money from multiple sources, including streaming and speaking gigs. Some of the top eSports players can expect to command six-figure salaries, yet a vast pay gap exists between the sport’s top earning men and women. Among the top 100 highest overall player earnings, tracked by Esportsearnings.com, there are no women gamers. Discussing this data, Dominic Sacco, content director for the British Esports Association (BEA), says eSports is “more inclusive” than some other traditional sports, but there is a lack of women competing in top-tier tournaments. Another reason for the pay disparity is that the typical gamer and audience is still perceived as predominantly male, so advertisers target that demographic, says says Carleigh Morgan, an academic adviser for the BEA. According to a report from market intelligence provider SuperData, eSports audiences are 85% male. While the gaming community considers eSports a meritocracy, Morgan says this is not always the case. “It’s women who have additional obstacles to overcome, regarding both global and local expectations about the validity of a career in eSports and their legitimacy as female gamers. “It can be wearying to be confronted with a volley of verbal abuse and questions about one’s gender as a handicap every time one logs on to a server to play.” This experience rings true for Harvey: “I’d say the worst [part of the job] is cyberbullying.” Whenever she’s streaming a game online, someone usually makes a misogynist joke in the comments section, she says. To make gaming more welcoming for women and minorities, Harvey set up online community and streaming site called MissCliks. “We try to be inclusive and teach before banning [those who post offensive comments], and most of the time the chat stays pretty clean,” she says. Several other organisations in eSports are working to plug the gender gap. AnyKey is a US-based organisation that promotes diversity in eSports by organising worldwide competitions with its partners Intel and the Electronic Sports League. Meanwhile, Skylla, a series of tournaments that welcomes up-and-coming players, has open qualifiers for women’s teams. The women who make a living gaming on Twitch Read more New careers for women While the pro gamers steal the limelight, eSports offers other career paths for women, such as games developers, event organisers and commentators. Jorien van der Heijden, also known as Sheever, is making her name as a games analyst, interviewer and host. She says the perks of the job are “the hype of an event, the players, their ups and downs, the halls or stadiums full of people with the same passion”. She began streaming herself playing as an amateur in 2011, which led to professional commentating gigs. But her success hasn’t come without hurdles, including enduring internet trolls, sexist jokes and maintaining a stable income between events. Higher education can provide a fertile ground for women gamers to start building eSports careers. In the US, several universities offer eSports scholarships for women. In the UK, Josh Williams says the National University Esports League he founded lacks women, but he has seen the numbers growing. “University, to a certain extent, helps to foster that environment that is more welcoming and encouraging to female players.” Natacha Jones, president of the University of Manchester eSports society wants to work as an eSports events organiser when she graduates next year. She plans to gain event management experience by volunteering at contests such as the student-organised gaming festival King of the North. She is also looking out for graduate jobs with games developers, such as Riot Games or Blizzard. Jones is undeterred by sexism in the industry. “I would encourage women to ignore the stereotypes and do what they want,” she says. “It might be daunting entering a male-dominated scene, but see it as an opportunity.” Looking for a job?

News & Analysis IBM Optics Go CMOS Low-Cost Photonics Goal R. Colin Johnson 6/8/2017 00:01 AM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet LAKE WALES, Fla.—Researchers from IBM this week are describing a breakthrough in 60-gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) optical interconnect that the company claims will lead to broad replacement of costlier 56 Gb/s copper interconnects. At the 2017 Symposia on VLSI Technology and Circuits, in Kyoto, Japan, scientists from IBM Research in Zurich will describe an inexpensive 60 Gb/s optical receiver that is expected to be followed next year by a matching optical transmitter. Together, the two devices will form a complete optical-transceiver built in CMOS at costs that the company expects to be lower than the costs of a copper interconnect. Video: https://youtu.be/ZAQVge2T5tw IBM reports a low power implementation of a 60Gb/s optical receiver (RX) cast in 14-nanometer CMOS finFETs with high jitter tolerance using digital clock and data recovery. (Source: IBM) "We are developing a single lane 60-Gigabit per second optical receiver with non-return to zero (NRZ) signaling targeting low cost multi-mode vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) based links," Alessandro Cevrero, an engineer at IBM,  told EE Times in advance of the symposium.  "The power is way lower than our competitors, ~120mW for the receiver and eventually below 300mW for the full transceiver," Cevrero said. "Also, its compact CMOS footprint and low power consumption means it can be moved closer to the processor or switch chip and eventually even be put in the same package or even on processor chip die, providing high bandwidth connectivity directly from the processor or switch chip spanning up to 100-meters. This covers links from processor-to-processor, processor-to-memory, from drawer-to-drawer inside a rack and from a rack to a tier-1 Internet switch." Alessandro Cevrero, an electrical engineer at IBM Research in Zurich, demonstrates IBM's low-cost silicon photonics receiver. (Source: IBM) Cevrero said that implementing the devices in CMOS enabled IBM to essential double transmission speed, essentially cutting the costs per Gigabit per second by two. "Some people believed that a SiGe solution was required to achieve good optical sensitivity at data rates above 32Gb/s," Cevero said. "Our work demonstrates that CMOS can achieve the same sensitivity, but at much lower power consumption.” The 60 Gb/s optical link IBM demonstrated still depends on discrete III-V photodetectors (for the receiver) and discrete III-V lasers (for the transmitter) together forming a transceiver that is otherwise all-CMOS. Others, such as Intel (which offers a 25-Gigabit per second optical transceiver), use silicon photonics to modulate the light from a III-V lasers. Intel combines four such channels to achieve 100-Gbits per second today, but at much higher cost and power consumption, according to IBM. Intel, however, is shooting for the same goal as IBM by 2020. IBM's current prototype runs at a wavelength of 850 nanometers, which is the standard wavelength for VCSEL-based multi-mode optical links, making it suitable for processor-to-memory, processor-to-processor and server-to-server communications. Once the complete transceiver is demonstrated later this year or early 2018, the price crossover point will have been reached, according to Thomas Toifl, manager of the high-speed Interconnects group at IBM Research in Zurich. The entire 60-Gigabit per second optical receiver fits on a small CMOS die, or could be incorporated into the edge of a processor, and consumes only 117 milliwatts. (Source: IBM) "So far, optical links were always pushed out due to their higher costs, but now we have reached the point where optics are at the same price as electrical links," Toifl told EE Times in advance of the VLSI Symposium. "Electrical links, however, need complex equalization when we go to higher data rates, and hence require more power. Also, their distance is limited to about two meters of cable compared to 100 meters for our optical solution." Toifl also claimed IBM's "breakthrough" CMOS photonics technology provides superior sensitivity ( -9dBm) and is ideal for the high throughput requirements of cloud computing. The team also claims to have pushed its existing CMOS circuitry to 70+ Gigabits per second already, but is waiting for the III-V photodiodes and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers to catch up before publicizing it. IBM has already demonstrated graphene photodetectors on silicon-on-insulator substrates and silicon-germanium lasers, but Toifl claims their next-generation all-CMOS transceivers will not require germanium, making them exceptionally cool running.

Related Perfect Casting Helps Make 'The Comey Show' A Hit Former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony of his various meetings with President Donald Trump began Wednesday with his “pre-xplosion” of Thursday morning’s prepared remarks to the Senate Intel Committee. “Tomorrow, bars in the capitol are opening early and offering drink specials like the Covfefe Cocktails…People are calling Comey’s testimony Washington’s Super Bowl. Animal Planet is even airing the Puppy Comey Testimony.” Colbert began to read Comey’s seven pages of remarks, full of juicy details, because Comey wrote a memo after each of  his interactions with Trump. “Dear Diary: I needed to write down my thoughts immediately, because that guy is so normal,” the late-night host joked. Comey, Colbert told his viewers, said he first met with Trump on January 6, to let him know about some “salacious intelligence” –“pee pee tape” Colbert translated – explaining he agreed to the meeting alone in order to “minimize potential embarrassment to the President-Elect.” “Remember this was back when we thought it was possible for him to feel embarrassment,” Colbert reminded. At one of their meetings, Colbert noted, Comey says Trump had told him he “had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia.” Comey also described a dinner he had with Trump just after his inauguration, in which he was surprised to discover the two of them were dining alone. That’s when Comey says Trump told him “I expect loyalty” from the director of the FBI.

No laws have been broken. I would hope that our president asked for Comey’s loyalty. The head if the FBI? He’d better be loyal to this country, this president, and our constitution. This witch hunt has gone on long enough. Let’s get on with reforming taxes! Reply • on Jun 8, 2017 4:52 am Being loyal to your country and the Constitution is not the same as being loyal to the President. There is no doctrine of presidential infallibility.

It is POTUS corruption in its finest hour. Trump hasnt even been in office for 6 months and here we are, the eve of the talks of impeachment. Gee folks what were you expecting.

Try it sometime; Pence would be 10 times more effective in gutting government, think Paul Ryan 10 times worse.

Reply cadavra • on Jun 8, 2017 10:33 am Pence is awful, agreed, but he has two advantages: He’s an experienced politician who at least understands how the machinery works, and he’s not the kind of lunatic who would nuke Tehran because somebody insulted him on Twitter. Abortion can always be re-legalized, but World War III is not something you can simply put the brakes on. Reply Frank • on Jun 7, 2017 10:45 pm ROFL….if Pence become prez, say goodbye to abortion. Trump is a moderate. You don’t want Pence.

Reply • on Jun 8, 2017 6:55 am So Trump asks Comey to back off RussiaGate, Comey refuses, Trump fires him, then admits to the world that he fired him because he wouldn’t back off the investigation.

Reply chris snyder (@chris87654) • on Jun 8, 2017 11:29 am As did McCain, I thought it was interesting that Comey didn’t ask Trump to say what he meant by “that thing” [they had], but in the same position, I wouldn’t have asked either – it could do nothing but put Trump in an awkward position (the answer would be BS). Best to let this be explained with outlandish meanings by Team Trump… maybe Trump was referring to the “covfefe” between them.

Welcome to 2015. This week at its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote, Apple finally jumped into the augmented and virtual reality world. ARKit is Apple’s tool for making AR applications, and it was the first of several announcements that show that the iPhone company is ready to take the next step into a larger world. AR and VR could be a market that has more than 1 billion users and $60 billion in global revenues by 2021, tech adviser Digi-Capital estimates. And in a guest post for us, DC founder Tim Merel says that Apple “took the mobile AR war to the next level” with this announcement. And Merel’s not the only one bullish on Apple and AR. “With more than 130 million active iPhones in the U.S. alone and far less hardware/software fragmentation than Android, Apple’s move into AR stands to make it the largest player in the space virtually overnight. It will mint millions of new consumers for AR developers, all of whom have been shown the promise of the medium by Apple itself and are ready to see more,” says Randy Nelson of research firm Sensor Tower. “At the same time, the qualities that have made iOS the preferred platform for app developers will undoubtedly carry over to AR, so I believe Apple will make iOS the most attractive target platform possible for AR developers and content creators.” And on the VR side, Valve says it’s bringing SteamVR to Macs. You’ll be able to play VR games on an HTC Vive or an Oculus Rift — though you may need an external graphics chip solution that Apple also announced (because, let’s face it, Macs just can’t cut VR without a little help, and Apple loves selling you accessories). All of this has made game devs excited to see what comes from this new foray from the Mac maker. I’m not so excited about VR coming to the Mac. I want to see something better than a slap-dash cobbling together of a Mac and an external video chip. Why do that when I can buy a VR-ready PC for less than $1,000 — or just hook up a headset to my powerful gaming rig? Yeah, my Air can keep being an email and Hearthstone machine. But AR and iOS? That’s a dream team. For AR/VR coverage, send news tips to Dean Takahashi and Jeff Grubb (for those that cross over into PC gaming). Please send guest post submissions to Rowan Kaiser.

This week, we’ve finally found out what he’s doing next. The New York Times cites three sources familiar with the matter in saying that that Luckey has once again started up a new company. Instead of VR, though, this startup is working on surveillance technology targeted for use at countries between borders and military crossings. The unrevealed company has not yet been given a public name. (via UploadVR) What Virtual Reality Means For Marketers When new technology is introduced, businesses are never quite sure how to react. In 2008, marketing agencies were inundated with app requests from clients claiming ‘we want to be on the App store.’ Wanting to be first but not quite sure what they wanted, or why. Other businesses wondered the same thing, and today many still do. If it doesn’t serve a business need, it’s not on the radar.

Swaraj Singh Dhanjal This is the second time Tejas Networks is planning an IPO, after abandoning its previous attempt at an initial public offering in 2008-09. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Mumbai: Telecom equipment maker Tejas Networks Ltd on Wednesday said it will launch its initial public offering (IPO) on 14 June. The company has fixed a price band of Rs250-257 per share for the IPO. The offering will close on 16 June. This is the second time the company is planning an IPO, after abandoning its previous attempt at a public offering in 2008-09. The IPO will see the company raise Rs450 crore of primary capital through a fresh issue of shares, while certain existing shareholders of the firm will sell shares worth Rs326 crore through an offer for sale. Investors selling shares in the IPO include Cascade Capital Management Mauritius, India Industrial Growth Fund (Frontline Strategy), Intel Capital and Sandstone Capital. Other investors in the company include the likes of Goldman Sachs, Mayfield and Samena Capital. In October 2007, the company had raised $24 million (Rs95 crore) from Goldman Sachs. Earlier in 2006, it had raised $20 million in a round led by Sandstone Capital. In 2009, Frontline Strategy, a Singapore-based PE firm, bought a 2.44% stake in Tejas through a secondary transaction. Samena Capital invested in the company last year. Tejas is an optical and data networking products company with customers in over 60 countries. It designs, develops and sells high-performance and cost-competitive products to telecommunications service providers, internet service providers, utility companies, defence companies and government entities. Its products find application in building high-speed communication networks that carry voice, data and video traffic from fixed line, mobile and broadband networks over optical fibre. As of 30 April, Tejas Networks has filed 333 patent applications, with 203 filings in India, 89 filings in the US and 6 filings in Europe, out of which 56 patents have been granted. The company follows an asset-light strategy by outsourcing most of its manufacturing to reputed electronics manufacturing services companies. The strategy allows it to scale up production without requiring a corresponding increase in capital expenditure towards building its own manufacturing operations. For the financial year 2016-17, Tejas Networks reported a revenue of Rs865.3 crore, up from Rs625.5 crore in the previous financial year. It reported a profit of Rs53.2 crore in 2016-17, compared to a profit of Rs27.4 crore the previous year. Axis Capital Ltd, Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt. Ltd, Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd and Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd are managing the Tejas IPO. Earlier this week, Mint had reported that several companies, including Tejas Networks, are gearing up to launch their IPOs in June. These include private equity firm ChrysCapital-backed pharma company Eris Lifesciences, depository services firm CDSL Ltd and small finance bank Au Small Finance Bank Ltd. Collectively, these four firms are looking to raise over Rs5,000 crore through their initial share sales. So far this year, eight companies have raised Rs6,335.83 crore through IPOs, while last year 26 companies raised Rs26,493.84 crore through this route.
