ASRock Z170M Extreme4 LGA 1151 Intel Z170 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.1 USB 3.0 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard Ships from United States. Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Based on the Intel Z170 chipset, the ASRock Z170 Extreme4 is a high-end, feature-rich motherboard that accommodates the latest 6th generation Intel Core processor in LGA1151 packaging. It supports dual-channel DDR4 up to 3466+(OC), and features three PCIe 3.0 x16 slots, two 10Gbps USB 3.1 ports (Type A + Type C), and one Ultra M.2 connector to take full advantage of the latest storage technology. A great choice for DIY professionals and overclocking enthusiasts, this motherboard also incorporates premium components and a rich array of performance-enhancing features, like ASRock Super Alloy component selection, Digi Power with six power phase design, Full Spike Protection against surge, lightning and ESD, and Purity Sound that refreshes your listening experience from onboard audio. Plus, with high grade matte black PCB color scheme, this motherboard looks as great as it performs and matches perfectly with your elite-class components. Super Alloy Design Dual-Stack MOSFET for CPU Power Dual-Stack MOSFET (DSM) is another innovative MOSFETs design by ASRock. The silicon die area is increased by stacking two dies into one MOSFET. The larger the die area, the lower Rds(on). Compared to traditional discrete MOSFET, DSM with larger die area provides extreme lower Rds(on) 1.2 mO, so the power supply for the CPU Vcore is more efficient. Nichicon 12K Platinum Caps Supreme 12K platinum capacitors with lifespans of at least 12,000 hours. Compared to other counterparts on high-end motherboards that merely have lifespans of around 10,000 hours, ASRock applied Nichicon 12K Platinum Caps that offer 20% longer lifespans and provide more stability and reliability. * Tested under industry standard 105 degree Celsius ambient temperature. I/O Armor A new designed protective cover for all of the crucial parts near the motherboard's rear I/O, so that they won't easily be damaged by static electricity. Matte Black PCB A new mysterious matte black and copper color scheme to match the prestigious components on ASRock's high-end 100 Series motherboards. High Density Glass Fabric PCB What you’ve never understood about your computer is that it is scared to death of water, H2O, humidity or whatever you’d like to name it. And even though you do not see the water, actually there may be lots of excessive moist in the air killing your motherboard silently and slowly. No, your motherboard doesn’t melt when in contact with water like the wicked witch of the west, but it dies of short circuit. Luckily, ASRock has a new High Density Glass Fabric PCB design that reduces the gaps between the PCB layers to protect the motherboard against electrical shorts caused by humidity. Supports NVIDIA/AMD Workstation Graphics Cards Three PCIe Gen3 x16 slots that not only support ordinary graphics cards, but are also fully compatible with professional NVIDIA Quadro and AMD FirePro workstation graphics solutions. Full Spike Protection Some sensitive digital components on the motherboard are vulnerable to power surges, the excessive current may cause your system to malfunction immediately. ASRock Full Spike Protection includes various technologies to prevent your motherboard’s components from being damaged by these unexpected voltage spikes. Ultra M.2 32 Gb/s (PCIe Gen3 x4 & SATA3) The PCIe Gen3 x4 Ultra M.2 interface pushes data transfer speeds up to 32Gb/s. In addition, it also supports SATA3 6Gb/s M.2 modules, and is compatible with ASRock’s U.2 Kit for installing some of the world’s fastest U.2 PCIe Gen3 x4 SSDs. USB 3.1 10 Gb/s Type-A + C A pair of Type-A and Type-C USB 3.1 connectors is built onboard for delivering up to 10Gbps data transfer rates. Supports DDR4 3466+ (OC) Supports the latest DDR4 memory modules and most extreme memory performance! DDR4 OC Originally an Easter egg, now the hidden option DDR4 OC may be summoned from the UEFI using certain memory modules, such as Samsung or Kingston DDR4 memory DIMMs. It unlocks the hidden potential of those memory modules and maximizes the performance! UEFI EZ Mode EZ mode is a dashboard which contains multiple readings of the system’s current status. You can check the most crucial information of your system, such as CPU speed, DRAM frequency, SATA information, fan speed, etc. Intel LAN Intel LAN provides the best throughput performance, lower CPU utilization, enhanced stability and is able to deliver ultimate network experience to users! Digi Power Unlike traditional motherboards that use analog power, this motherboard uses a next generation digital PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) design, which provides CPU Vcore voltage more efficiently and smoothly, so that the stability and lifespan of the motherboard is greatly enhanced. Six Power Phase Design The power phase design offers smooth power delivery to the CPU, unmatched overclocking capabilities, lower temperature for advanced gamers, and reinforced system stability for taking on all sorts of arduous computing tasks. Flexible PCIe Slots A new flexible PCIe Gen3 x1 slot design that allows users to install add-on cards of all kinds of sizes. * The bandwidth of your devices will be limited to PCIe Gen3 x1. Purity Sound 3 7.1 CH HD audio with Realtek ALC1150 audio codec, Pure Power-In and other technologies to deliver the crispest sound effects.

In 2016, people have witnessed the digital and physical worlds continuing to merge as everyday objects, commercial and industrial equipment, and entire cities become smart and connected to the cloud. Analysts expect that by 2020 more than 50 billion devices – wearables, store inventory sensors, autonomous vehicles, medical equipment, city infrastructure and more – will be connected to the internet and each other. And people’s relationship with technology – how it is used, the experiences it enables and what benefits people derive from it – are beginning to shift dramatically. Not since the transition from analog to digital has there been the potential for transformation of this magnitude: Networks are evolving faster than ever before to accommodate the intense bandwidth demands created by the ever-growing number of always-on, connected devices to access, analyze and share data in real time. In 2016, Intel has been working with policymakers, the industry and industrial leaders to focus on four areas that will help spur innovation and enable more rapid transformation, leading to greater and new opportunities for industries and consumers: artificial intelligence, 5G networks, automated driving and virtual reality/merged reality.   Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) is already all around us, from the commonplace (talk-to-text, photo tagging and fraud detection) to the cutting-edge (precision medicine, injury prediction and autonomous cars). AI will enable machines to augment human capabilities, automate tedious or dangerous tasks, unleash scientific discovery, and address challenging societal problems. 2016 o   Aug. 6: Intel signs an agreement to acquire Nervana Systems, a recognized leader in deep learning. o   Nov. 17: Intel announces how new products, technologies and investments from the edge to the data center will expand and accelerate the growth of AI.  2017 o   Technology will become more cost-effective and pervasive, new applications will emerge across a wide range of industries, creating efficiencies for businesses and consumers. o   The technology supporting some nascent AI applications, such as natural language processing and bots will greatly improve, paving the way for more widespread adoption of AI. o   Machine and deep learning will become more acutely integrated into IoT connected devices, which will uncover access to a deeper layer of insights. o   Intel will introduce three Intel Nervana platform products built for speed and ease of use, enabling more data professionals to solve the world’s biggest challenges on industry standard technology. The products include: A breakthrough technology from Nervana Systems tested in first silicon (code-named “Lake Crest”) in the first half of 2017 and made available to customers later in the year for neural networks to deliver the highest performance for deep learning and offering unprecedented compute density with a high-bandwidth interconnect. A new product (code-named “Knights Crest”) that tightly integrates best-in-class Intel Xeon processors with the technology from Nervana Systems. The next generation of Intel Xeon Phi processors (code-named “Knights Mill”), which will deliver up to 4x better performance than the previous generation for deep learning.3 5G More than just a faster network, 5G is expected to deliver extremely low latency combined with incredibly high bandwidth, which means the ability to manage an unprecedented demand for data and more connected devices. Powerful, agile networks can also route network traffic intelligently to give priority to safety-critical devices, such as self-driving cars and medical wearables. In geographical areas where connected infrastructure is not as fast or reliable as needed, 5G will also open a world of possibilities currently unavailable. The global 5G network is expected to support an estimated 100 billion devices.4 2016 o   Feb. 5: Intel debuts its Intel 5G Mobile Trial Platform at Mobile World Congress.  o   July 14: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) unanimously approves a plan for implementing 5G in the U.S. o   Dec. 6: Intel announces a partnership with AT&T and Ericsson to launch the first 5G business customer trial. 2017 o   5G will continue move from conception and testing to meaningful plans for deployment, accelerating support across the industry. o   The need for faster connectivity will increase pressure for the industry to align around global standards with IEEE and 3GPP and address key challenges around interoperability, backward compatibility and future proofing.   Automated Driving Automated driving will change our lives and societies: The car of the future means significantly reduced accidents, mobility for many and reduced congestion in the world’s most polluted cities. The global market for fully autonomous vehicles could reach $42 billion by 2025; self-driving cars may claim one-quarter of worldwide auto sales by 2035.5 2016 o  July 1: BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye announce a collaboration to bring solutions for highly and fully automated driving into series production by 2021. o  Nov. 15: Intel Capital announces $250 million of additional new investments over the next two years to make fully autonomous driving a reality. 2017 o  Significant advancements will be made to further the operation of driverless cars but also advance every part of the infrastructure – from connectivity to use of AI to data processing. o  More companies will enter the autonomous driving market, new partnerships and collaborative efforts will emerge, and a call for standardization across the industry. o  The industry will continue to learn through trial and error, but 2017 will mark the first year that automated systems in cars gain mainstream access, such as through advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or automated ride-sharing fleets.   Virtual Reality/Merged Reality Where today’s experiences rely on engagement with a screen, tomorrow’s will completely immerse users though sight, sound and touch. The next frontier of compute will empower people to build, solve, create and play in a world where the barrier is diminished between the physical and virtual worlds. Virtual technologies hold tremendous potential for the future, but industries have only begun to scratch the surface of what’s possible. 2016 o  Aug. 16: Intel unveils Project Alloy, an all-in-one virtual reality solution. o  Nov. 3: Intel announces it has acquired VOKE*, a leader in live, VR experiences to deliver immersive sports experiences for athletes, fans and content producers. o  Dec. 7: Intel and Microsoft announce the specs for Windows Holographic. 2017 o  VR experiences will move beyond the nascent phases in industries like healthcare, education and travel, employing the latest in VR technology to create fully immersive experiences. o  Technology and sports will become even more deeply integrated in the next year, transforming the way people train, watch and interact with sports. o  Merged reality, a new way of experiencing physical and virtual interactions and environments, will come to the forefront with five technological advances (6 degrees of mobility, integrated tracking, more natural manipulation, untethered, digitized real-world content) and is expected to come to market in holiday 2017.  Tags 5G AI Intel VR Previous ArticleGlobal converged systems revenue increases 1.7% to $2.6bn in Q3 Next Article2017 cloud predictions: Hear what Microsoft, Salesforce, VMware & more see for the future of cloud Most read UK Gov scheme will fast track tech to boost £22bn cyber sector Hannah Williams 21st December 2016 OpenStack becomes ‘de facto’ private cloud James Nunns 21st December 2016 Airlines face hacker hijack threat from vulnerable Panasonic systems James Nunns 20th December 2016 ECB goes Advanced in search for next England cricket stars James Nunns 19th December 2016 BT Tower becomes world’s highest IoT base station Byomakesh Biswal 19th December 2016 AI in 2017: 14 funny things that could become a (crazy) reality Ellie Burns 16th December 2016 Have you been pwned?

The diagnostic tool checks for brand identification then verifies the processor operating frequency then tests specific processor features and performs a stress test on the processor. The diagnostic can be configured to execute in one of two modes, presence test mode or verification mode. Additionally, it can be configured to enable (run) or disable (skip) individual default configurations that are used for this mode of operation. Intel processor diagnostic tool test system requirements Multiprocessors Systems The Intel processor diagnostic tool is compatible with multiprocessor systems. It is essential that only one Intel processor is tested at a time in this system configuration. Intel processor diagnostic tool does not support multiple processors inserted into a multiprocessor system configuration. Motherboard & Processor It is essential that the motherboard you use to test your processor is fully compatible with your Intel processor. Consult your motherboard manufacturer's support to ensure the motherboard supports your processor. If you are using an Intel® motherboard, please use this utility: Intel Processors and Boards Compatibility Tool. Motherboard BIOS It is essential that the motherboards BIOS is at the minimum BIOS revision specified to support your Intel processor. Consult your motherboard manufacturer's support to ensure the BIOS revision is at the correct revision. Motherboard Architecture IPDT is only compatible with motherboards built using Intel 32-bit architecture. Over-Clocking Over-Clocking should be disabled while running Intel processor diagnostic tool. Power Management Some power management features (e.g. Intel SpeedStep technology) throttle or reduce the operating frequency of components within the system. These types of power management features may result in very low tested frequency results. This does not mean that the processor is operating at degraded performance levels. It means that the enabled power management feature is optimizing the efficiency of the processor, either to save power or to reduce heat within the system. We recommend you disable any power management features such as Intel SpeedStep technology and configure your system to its optimal power management settings when running Intel® processor diagnostic tool. For instructions on how to disable these power management features, please contact your system manufacturer.

 Intel's new sales strategy could help its IoT business BI Intelligence Dec. 23, 2016, 11:15 AM 1,097 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Xura just spent $385 million to develop 5G and the IoT Here's how the Internet of Things will explode by 2020 There will be 24 billion IoT devices installed on Earth by 2020 This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. At a recent investor conference, Intel EVP of Sales, Manufacturing, and Operations Stacy Smith shed light on the company’s new sales strategy for the IoT, The Motley Fool reports. Smith, who was recently moved into the position from his old job as Chief Financial Officer, emphasized that the company will shift its focus to crafting a sales force and strategy that's more aligned by vertical markets, supplying the hardware and software needed to fully supply those various markets. To accomplish these goals, the company will look to create a sales force with specific skills in a space to target markets within the IoT most effectively. While Intel has done well in the IoT so far, this new strategy could help it continue to improve and grow as the IoT matures. Intel has seen steady growth in its IoT group, but the unit is still not one of the larger business segments for the chip designer. But the IoT is so broad — ranging from drones to development boards to autonomous vehicles — for which Intel recently carved out a business segment, that Intel, as well as competing chip designers, may find a number of opportunities to continue their businesses and diversify their revenue streams. The IoT Revolution is picking up speed and when it does, it will change how we live, work, travel, entertain, and more. From connected homes and connected cars to smart buildings and transportation, every aspect of our lives will be affected by the increasing ability of consumers, businesses, and governments to connect to and control everything around them. Imagine “smart mirrors” that allow you to digitally try on clothes. Assembly line sensors that can detect even the smallest decrease in efficiency and determine when crucial equipment needs to be repaired or replaced. GPS-guided agricultural equipment that can plant, fertilize, and harvest crops. Fitness trackers that allow users to transmit data to their doctors. It’s not science fiction. This “next Industrial Revolution” is happening as we speak. It’s so big that it could mean new revenue streams for your company and new opportunities for you. The only question is: Are you fully up to speed on the IoT? After months of researching and reporting this exploding trend, BI Intelligence, Business Insider’s premium research service, has put together an essential report on the IoT that explains the exciting present and the fascinating future of the Internet of Things.  It covers how the IoT is being implemented today, where the new sources of opportunity will be tomorrow and how 16 separate sectors of the economy will be transformed over the next 20 years. The report gives a thorough outlook on the future of the Internet of Things, including the following big picture insights: IoT devices connected to the Internet will more than triple by 2020, from 10 billion to 34 billion. IoT devices will account for 24 billion, while traditional computing devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, etc.) will comprise 10 billion.  Nearly $6 trillion will be spent on IoT solutions over the next five years.  Businesses will be the top adopter of IoT solutions because they will use IoT to 1) lower operating costs; 2) increase productivity; and 3) expand to new markets or develop new product offerings.  Governments will be the second-largest adopters, while consumers will be the group least transformed by the IoT.  And when you dig deep into the report, you’ll get the whole story in a clear, no-nonsense presentation: The complex infrastructure of the Internet of Things distilled into a single ecosystem  The most comprehensive breakdown of the benefits and drawbacks of mesh (e.g. ZigBee, Z-Wave, etc.), cellular (e.g. 3G/4G, Sigfox, etc.), and internet (e.g. Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.) networks  The important role analytics systems, including edge analytics, cloud analytics, will play in making the most of IoT investments  The sizable security challenges presented by the IoT and how they can be overcome  The four powerful forces driving IoT innovation, plus the four difficult market barriers to IoT adoption  Complete analysis of the likely future investment in the critical IoT infrastructure:   connectivity, security, data storage, system integration, device hardware, and application development  In-depth analysis of how the IoT ecosystem will change and disrupt 16 different industries  To get your copy of this invaluable guide to the IoT universe, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.

Both laptops have 8GB of LPDDR3 1866MHz memory and 256GB PCIe NVMe SSDs, so it gave us a great opportunity to compare the performance of Kaby Lake versus Skylake on a laptop! The Dell XPS 13 9360 as we have configured is $1,459.99 shipped while you can still buy last years Dell XPS 13 9350 as we have configured for $1,289.98 shipped.  We loaded up the latest drivers on both the Dell XPS 13 9360 (BIOS 1.2.3) and the Dell XPS 13 9350 (BIOS 1.4.10) and ran over 15 performance tests on them to see what the performance differences were. Core i7-7500U Core i7-6500U Intel Series 7th Generation 6th Generation Architecture Kaby Lake Skylake Process Tech 14nm+ 14nm Cores/Threads 2/4 2/4 Base Clock 2.7 GHz 2.5 GHz Max Turbo Clock 3.5 GHz 3.1 GHz Cache 4MB 4MB TDP 15 watt 15 watt Max. Memory 32GB 32GB Graphics HD Graphics 620 HD Graphics 520 Graphics Compute Units 24 24 Graphics Clocks 300 – 1050 MHz 300 – 1050 MHz Tray Price $393 $393 The big difference between the on the Intel Core i7-7500U Kaby Lake processor and the Intel Core i7-6500U Skylake processor is that the new Kaby Lake processors are built using the improved 14nm+ FinFET process and that is critical as those process technology refinements have allowed Intel to get higher clock frequencies without increasing power. That has allowed Intel to gain 200MHz on the base clock and an impressive 400MHz max turbo frequency on the Core i7-7500U over the Core i7-6500U. The other big addition inside Intel’s 7th Generation Core series processors is the addition of a new media engine for HEVC 10-bit (H.265) and VP9 hardware accelerated decoding for improved media performance. Having a dedicated media engine handling video decode is a big deal as it helps ensure media playback is smooth and will improve power efficiency for the latest video formats. Since that is pretty much the only difference between the Dell XPS 13 9350 and the Dell XPS 13 9360 that we have in-house (other than the 802.11ac wireless card and SSD) it gives us the ability to look the performance differences between the two systems.

I get that there is more performance to be had on the kaby, but this would not be enough for me to jump ship for such a small incremental performance increase. Spineman Great review. Thanks. Intel should have just waited on this one. Not enough to warrant an upgrade. They need to acquire Nvidia and get some real graphics pros on board. Yawn! It will hopefully lower the Surface Pro 4 pricing even more as rich boys upgrade to this “power” processor. lol. Greg Zeng Running on battery makes the upgrade very worthwhile. These improvements should also be visible on other products with the new CPU. Patrick DuChene Great article. Its not very often we see such thorough information. Thanks for that. Helps clarify a bit more of the true benefits on Kaby Lake over Skylake. Nice work anon 10% more performance for 10% higher clock speed? If scores are not normalized its difficult to compare when products are sooo similar. The performance boost could be alleged to a higher absolute performance, but its not. Also in the power comsumption chart, HEV (page 8) decoding power use seems missleading. You cannot use a line graph to compare different usages of power because the lines between the points mean a progression which is non existant. Should be a bar chart as well. I like very much legit, and I think you should pay attention to this kind of details. anon The claim is the 14nm+ process achieves a higher clock with equivalent TDP. Nathan Kirsch I get your point on the chart, so I updated it! Thanks for the feedback and we always strive to make the reviews as good as possible! anon This kind of feedback is what makes legit what it is. Kudos for you. Earl Keim Excellent article, Nathan. Nice to see one can have a long flight overseas, etc. and never run out of battery.

Intel May Finally Enable Framebuffer Compression By Default For Skylake+ Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 23 December 2016 at 01:45 PM EST. 8 Comments Intel developers are weighing again the possibility of enabling frame-buffer compression (FBC) support by default for Skylake graphics hardware and newer. Frame-buffer compression by default in the Intel driver comes up every so often while to date so far it's only flipped on by default for Broadwell, but users can still easily enable it for other hardware via a module parameter. But Intel's Paulo Zanoni is feeling comfortable now to send out a patch for enabling FBC-by-default with Skylake "Gen 9" graphics and newer. Intel QA has already tested it and confirmed a "100% pass rate" for Skylake, Kabylake, and Broxton hardware. The patch is here and by the time the Linux 4.11 kernel merge window rolls around, hopefully it will be mainlined. Making use of FBC can reduce power consumption while reducing memory bandwidth needed for screen refreshes. Those wanting to try out FBC on an existing Linux kernel release can use the i915.enable_fbc=1 module parameter. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The Linux Foundation The Zephyr Project is still a babe in the technological woods, so it’s only fitting that the open source real-time operating system is driving an innovative wearables solution that aims to improve healthcare for infants. At the recent Embedded Linux Conference Europe, Teresa Cauvel, CTO and co-founder of Chicago-based neonatal health technology startup Neopenda, explained how her company built a neonatal monitoring bracelet for hospitals in the developing world using an Intel Curie module running Zephyr. The complete talk, called “Leveraging IoT Biometrics and Zephyr RTOS for Neonatal Nursing in Uganda” can be seen in the video link below. Cauvel and co-founder and CEO Sona Shah came up with the idea for Neopenda as graduate students in biomedical engineering at Columbia University. The partners hoped that a new U.N. Sustainable Development goal for ending preventable deaths of under 5-year-olds by 2030 would provide numerous opportunities for technological innovation. “With IoT we can reimagine what’s possible in global health,” Cauvel told the ELCE audience. Cauvel and Shah decided to develop a wearable for neonatal patients in the first 28 days after birth. They focused on developing countries where 98 percent of preventable neonatal deaths occur and where every year 46 million newborns have complications at or around birth that require special care and treatment. Some 3 million newborns die from these complications. However, 80 percent of the victims die from preventable causes or could have saved by affordable treatments. “Reducing infant mortality is a solvable problem,” said Cauvel. The problem is being attacked on several levels, from improving transportation to hospitals to developing better treatments for pre-term birth, birth asphyxia, and severe infections. Neopenda is focusing on improving pediatric hospital care. When researching the problem in Uganda in 2015 with the help of the Uganda Paediatric Association, the co-founders discovered there were large unmet needs in monitoring and diagnosis. “Early detection of distress is really key in newborn care,” said Cauvel. “We want to help staff better manage a large quantity of patients. There are so many critically ill newborns that need care and not nearly enough nurses, doctors, equipment, and supplies. Typically, you might see two nurses responsible for 50 to 75 babies. Standard equipment like vital signs monitors is often prohibitively expensive.” In early 2016, the partners founded Neopenda with the help of a Kickstarter campaign, as well as grants from Cisco and Vodafone. They started working on a prototype for a wearable vital signs monitor designed for newborns in low resource hospitals. The wearable, which is due to enter trials in Uganda in 2017, is strapped to infants’ foreheads, and measures heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and temperature. “These are all of critically important vitals to track in newborns,” said Cauvel. “They show danger signs when conditions are changing, and help monitor health status.” The biometrics devices wirelessly communicate to the central monitor, which can be a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, where results are displayed with visualizations. “Health workers can view the status of all the babies and be alerted in real time when newborns are in distress,” said Cauvel. “It helps the staff triage while also providing more detailed information to guide treatment and diagnosis.” Prototyping: From Arduino to Curie In choosing a technology platform, Cauvel and Shah had several key requirements: The device needed to run on batteries using minimum power, and be rugged enough to resist dust, heat, humidity, and wear and tear. It needed good support for wireless and sensor technology, and be sufficiently scalable to support larger hospitals as well as clinics. It also had to be highly affordable. Neopenda aims to reduce the cost to about $50 per wearable, which is very low for medical monitoring devices. The initial prototype was built around an Arduino Uno, followed by a model that used the Uno’s ATMega328 MCU breadboarded with WiFi and the most essential components. Power considerations led quickly to swapping WiFi for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which also raised fewer questions about radiation risks. The current iteration uses the Intel Curie module, which runs Zephyr on an x86-compatible Intel Quark SE CPU. The dime-sized Curie offers the advantage of being smaller, more affordable, and more power efficient than an Arduino. It also furnishes an ARC EM4-based sensor subsystem and a built-in BLE radio, and its 80KB of SRAM makes it more suitable for complex BLE applications. The Curie’s interfaces between these components and the Quark SE saved a lot of time, as did the availability of a Curie-equipped Intel Arduino 101 board, used for prototyping. Meanwhile, the Curie’s pattern matching engine and 6-axis sensor may hold potential for future applications, said Cauvel. The ARC subsystem controls the Curie’s 12-bit ADC, which “enables us to make accurate DSP measurements,” said Cauvel. The device incorporates a LilyPad MCP9700 temperature sensor, as well as a pulse sensor from pulsesensor.com. Neopenda developed an algorithm that derives the respiratory rate from the pulse rate. For pulse oximetry, the developers breadboarded a sensor using red and infrared LEDs with a TSL235 light-to-frequency converter. To generate a blood oxygen saturation measurement from this setup, “we multiplexed between the two LEDs to calculate the absorption ratio, and used the GPIO driver and its callback API to calculate frequency,” explained Cauvel. Zephyr played a key role in the success of the wearable prototype, thanks to its modularity, support for constrained systems, and more advanced capabilities compared to the Arduino IDE. “Zephyr turned out to be a big step up from Arduino because it supports the ARC core, the DSP subsystem, and the x86 host concurrently,” said Cauvel. “Zephyr also supports multi-fibers and interrupts for complex sensor manipulation and communication so it can cleanly handle the data coming in from different sensors simultaneously.” The developers also benefited from “Zephyr’s rich support for drivers and sensors, as well as sample code and a reliable SDK with cross tool chain,” said Cauvel. “There was already a BSP supporting the Arduino 101 with tool chain to compile for the DSP subsystem in the ARC processor and the host processor. This enabled quick installation of the compiler and tool chain in just a couple of hours, and with the help of the Eclipse IDE, we were able to get the GDB debugger working with DSP and host.” Cauvel went into more detail about various past and current modifications of each sensor algorithm. Currently, most sensor readings are close to the reliability range of expensive commercial sensors, except for respiratory. “We may need to add Fourier transforms to get better accuracy on respiratory,” said Cauvel. The company has also developed an Android app that interprets the BLE signals and displays data and visualizations. Cauvel is confident the device will be ready for trials in Uganda in 2017. Neopenda is working on getting a CE mark for certification, and they will need to get approval of the government of Uganda. The plan is to expand in East Africa and beyond. Soon, Cauvel hopes to give thousands of newborns in low resource settings “the healthy start they deserve.” Watch the complete presentation: Log in or register to post comments Print This Like  (0 likes) Click Here!

The Dell XPS 15 computers are designed for performance-demanding users seeking near bezel-less laptops with above-average performance at a moderate price with a plenty of upgrade options. The new XPS 15 9560 will receive Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1050-series graphics as well as some other optional upgrades not available on current-gen, but will retain the internal architecture and external design. According to the listing (now removed from the website) Dell’s upcoming XPS 15 9560 notebook will use either a dual-core Intel Core i3-7100HQ, a quad-core Core i5-7300HQ or a quad-core Core i7-7700HQ CPU. The aforementioned chips are not yet formally announced, but it is known that they are based on the Kaby Lake microarchitecture and will thus offer improved performance compared to predecessors due to higher frequencies, Speed Shift v2 technology and other refinements. For those who opt for iGPU rather than a discrete model it is important to note that the Kaby Lake CPUs also has an improved video encoding/decoding engine. The next key enhancement of the XPS 15 9560 over the current-generation XPS 9550 will be NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1050 GPU with up to 4 GB of GDDR5 memory. NVIDIA has yet has to announce a mobile version of the GeForce GTX 1050, but it is highly likely that the product is based on the GP107 GPU featuring the Pascal architecture and up to 768 stream processors, similar to the desktop version. The new graphics chip should offer a decent performance upgrade when compared to the GeForce GTX 960M used in the current-gen XPS 15. Meanwhile for those planning to play demanding games it makes sense to look at the GeForce GTX 1060 or 1070, which means the Alienware 15. Since the new Dell XPS 15 9560 will retain the chassis of its predecessor, it will support similar InfinityEdge 15.6” display panels: an IPS FHD (1920×1080) or an IGZO UHD (3840×2160) with 100% AdobeRGB color gamut and touch support. Physical dimensions of the unit also remain intact with the predecessor: it weighs around 1.8 kilograms and is up to 17 mm thick. For storage, the new Dell XPS 15 will use either Seagate’s SSHDs or PCIe SSDs with up to 1 TB capacity. Meanwhile, due to improvements of Kaby Lake’s memory controller, the new laptops should be compatible with DDR4-2400 memory, offering an additional performance boost over DDR4-2133 used today. As for connectivity, the XPS 9550 uses Rivet Networks' Killer 1535 802.11 2×2 Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 controller, has one Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 2.0 headers, an HDMI output, a 720p webcam and an SD card reader, which essentially means that there is nothing for the XPS 9560 to upgrade here (at least, not without a major redesign of the whole PC). However, since the XPS machines are often used like workstations, Dell decided to add a fingerprint reader with Windows Hello support as an option. Since Dell has already taken down the XPS 9560 product page (technically, it is there, but without any data), so prices and exact final configurations / availability dates remain under wraps. Still, being a close partner of Intel and NVIDIA, Dell is typically among one of the first to release PCs based on the new CPUs/GPUs. Therefore we expect the new systems to arrive shortly after CES in the usual XPS 15 price range that starts at $999 and ends at ~$2500 for high-end models.

POST A COMMENT 100 Comments View All Comments rhx123 - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link I wonder if this will again have a poorly implemented TB3 port that only runs at half the PCIe bandwith it should. Reply BillBear - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link It doesn't offer two Thunderbolt controllers yielding four Thunderbolt ports, so why would it run out of available PCI lanes from the CPU? Reply rhx123 - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link The TB3 controller is only connected to the chipset via 2 PCIe lanes. Either a BIOS issue or hardware. Reply ddriver - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link Intel's mobile chips often have a very limited number of pcie lanes. You can't connect to lanes you don't have. Also, for most of the TB devices it is a non-issue, still plenty of bandwidth for even the most demanding devices. Reply Pneumothorax - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link I think the biggest hindrance is the 1/2 PCIe lanes really hits the performance of a eGPU TB3 implementation. Reply ddriver - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link It will be probably like a 5% hit, most likely hidden by the cpu bottleneck. IIRC pci-e 2 x4 vs x16 had negligible difference. And th3 at 50% is pretty much pci-e 2 x4. Bandwidth is mostly important for asset loading, and this usually happens in between levels, not during gameplay. Besides the XPS is not really a gaming product. eGPU will be a corner case. Reply Samus - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link Exactly. You are unlikely to notice a performance hit unless you have a massive GPU. Besides, this already has an embedded GPU, all you need TB3 and USB-C for are accessories, data storage and monitors. TB3 on two lanes can easily drive a pair of 4K monitors. Reply johnp_ - Saturday, December 24, 2016 - link I'd rather have a version without the mobile GPU and then connect the now free PCIe lanes to 1 or more Thunderbolt ports + use the space for battery. The Intel HD Graphics is powerful enough for all my mobile usage and and anything more demanding (e.g. gaming) is usually contained to specific places, where one or more external and more powerful GPU(s) can easily be attached to the device anyway. Reply Nexing - Saturday, December 24, 2016 - link +1 The Audio PRO world is also needing the XPS 15 mobility with a still large screen, together with a Thunderbolt port (because its extreme low latency), to be used with the now ubiquitous and not expensive Thunderbolt DACs (DigitalAnalogueConvertor). Those standards are nowadays a given, thus it would be welcomed if a second Thunderbolt port feeds either widescreens when at the studio, or translates into USB3, eSata or whatever good connector in order to hook up the Virtual Instruments and extensive Libraries from hopefully biggish SSDs. This way DELL's 2017 15 XPS may very well become the centerpiece of several mobile audio (and possibly video) professionals. It will indeed be the "up to this time" powerful Macbook, that was not released some weeks ago. Reply ddriver - Monday, December 26, 2016 - link Several audio interface makers have already been able to implement a walk-around for USB audio latency by using proprietary protocols supported at driver levels. That pretty much renders the latency advantage of TB obsolete. Plus TB audio interfaces are still at TB2 and adapters are costly. It is simply not worth it, as a TB audio interface comes with a hefty price jack already. TB still has a slight edge, but the difference is not as pronounced as compared to previous generation USB interfaces, so it is really not worth the price premium. Because at extremely low round trip latency, hardware becomes the bottleneck, so when you throw real time processing in the mix, the end difference is minuscule. For example, a TB interface may have as low as 2 msec round-trip latency, while a USB interface comes with an additional 1 msec penalty, so for unprocessed audio TB has a 50% advantage, but when you throw even some basic processing at it, that will add like 2 more msecs, making 4 for TB vs 5 for USB, advantage dwindles to 25%. For a practical real world scenario the advantage of TB vs "hacked" USB is negligible. At this point the price premium for TB is simply NOT worth it. For example, a scarlett 2i2 costs 150$ while a clarett 2 - the comparable TB product is 500$. That's 333% higher price for like 10% lower latency. Simply not worth it. All TB products are shamelessly overpriced, thanks a lot intel...

Bloomberg/October 2013   Mark Gurman Bloomberg     To die-hard fans, Apple's Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought these days. Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers. While the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky-opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets. Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and center in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips-a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen. In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn't look good on such a large product. In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads. In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the U.S. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the U.S. Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro.

We wish everyone the best of holidays and a prosperous 2017! 2016: The Year That Was By Rob Enderle Dec 26, 2016 11:00 AM PT 2016 really was a year like no other. We had yet another election defined by the misuse of analytics -- and folks seem to be getting worse rather than better at this. We had a rush to robotics, particularly self-driving cars, and some firms even leaped ahead to self-flying, people-delivering drones (which we called "flying cars" just a few years back). We had a wave of fake news, mostly paid for by Google, because that company, as always, has no compass. It appears to be shaming nations into regulating it, suggesting it has no sense, either. We also had a lot of interesting products, but I think one stood out as the next iPod, and it didn't come from Apple. I'll go further into all of that this week, as you recover from what I hope was a wonderful Christmas day full of presents, family, and a sense of dread for January, when we all have to go back to work. Sorry, that was my inner Scrooge. Analytics Miss If one thing stood out for me this past year, it was the election. After two elections in which Obama, a Democrat, out-executed his Republican rivals with analytics, we had Trump do the same thing to Clinton in the last 10 days of the election. That was in spite of the fact that Clinton was the candidate tech loved, suggesting someone really missed a meeting. This takes me back to the oft-heard criticisms of Clinton's opponents who maintained she showed bad judgment. The lesson here is that tech can't fix bad judgment, and it is a force multiplier. So, if you have bad judgment, it likely will make things worse. You know, it still strikes me that if folks spent more time understanding why someone screwed up so badly rather than just finding folks to blame and shoot, things might improve over time. Just saying... Bad Judgment Speaking of bad judgment, Meg Whitman likely takes the cake. She came out late against Donald Trump and for Hillary Clinton, even though she is tied at the hip to the Republican Party. Maybe it would have resulted in a minor cabinet post for Whitman had Clinton won, but getting this wrong made her look not only like a traitor to her party, but also like a foolish one. This is the sad part: HPE sells analytics products, suggesting Whitman has no better handle on that technology -- even though her firm sells it -- than Clinton does. I guess this means she'll have to go back to executing a strategy that will make HPE small enough to fit in the garage it started from. Good Judgment Peter Thiel stands out as the tech executive of the year, largely because he was the only one who saw that there were enough people in both parties who were sick of politicians to get Trump elected. Unlike virtually every other tech exec, he focused on tech, which is what he knows -- not politics. Thiel has had a material and largely positive impact on Trump's agenda, so much so that at a meeting earlier this month, Trump asked what he could do to help tech firms rather than yelling at them for their lack of support. In the end, I think Thiel may showcase how tech and government should work together to make the U.S. a better place. It won't be by donating money, as tech leaders did with Clinton, but by sharing and using the very technology they sell to make the nation better -- and that should be a bipartisan goal. Sadly, Thiel is the exception and not the rule, but the industry learns from example and he is one hell of an example. Fixing Judgment That is a sharp contrast on judgment. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, backed by my old friend Genevieve Bell, earlier this year made a timely announcement on focusing AI to help folks with their judgment. Both Clinton and Whitman should sign up for the alpha test. This is really the eventual promise of analytics. It's not a tool that multiplies the impact of a decision, good or bad, but a tool that helps people ensure their decisions are good ones. I think we all could use a tool that would help us with our judgment from time to time. Dell Technology In 2016, we saw the birth of the new super-company in tech, Dell Technologies. Instead of mucking around with politics, Michael Dell buckled down and took EMC private, saving Joe Tucci's legacy and creating the most powerful hardware company in tech. This is important in a market increasingly defined by cloud companies like Amazon, Google, and now even Microsoft. It still strikes me that Dell has the best acquisition and merger process, yet largely stands alone when using it. However, I did talk to an Intel exec who told me Intel recently adopted something similar, so that's good news for you folks in smaller tech firms. If this is a trend, you are less likely to get a surprise layoff in 2017 due to a bad acquisition. Product of the Year Runners-Up Dell's XPS 13: This was my go-to laptop for much of the year, though I actually came to prefer the XPS15, largely because it was better for playing Ashes of the Singularity, my new favorite strategy game. The XPS 13 is a nice balance of size, style, battery life and functionality, with the only downside being the lack of a good fingerprint reader. Dell XPS 13 Lenovo Yoga Book: At launch, this was a breakout product -- ultra-thin, ultra-portable and very reasonably priced. Artists raved over it. It reminds me a lot of the Courier tablet that Microsoft's advanced development team came up with, which effectively led to its being disbanded. Sadly, I'm not an artist -- it is best for those who are. Lenovo Yoga Book Varonis: As I noted last week, this product and its entire class of intrusion and behavior monitoring tools could have changed the U.S. election outcome, had both the U.S. government and DNC had used them. Varonis would have prevented the hack of the DNC (and other) email servers. However, it wasn't used and didn't have the impact it should have had (granted, if it had, we never would have known). (By the way, Varonis has posted a series of videos on how to secure your home for the holidays that is worth watching, and it's free.) BlackBerry DTEK 60: This phone showcased that you actually could have a secure BlackBerry. Thin and with glass on both sides, a decent camera, a fingerprint sensor (sensibly placed on the back of the camera, not the front), and a full Android implementation, this is the phone that BlackBerry should have made a long time ago, and it has been serving me as my primary phone ever since I got it. In a world increasingly defined by breaches, this phone is a godsend because it is secure. BlackBerry DTEK60 Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Solution: This was big -- the only ARM solution that has been blessed by Microsoft for Windows. Microsoft hadn't considered another platform since the 1980s, and to make the jump to Snapdragon was a huge win for Qualcomm and for users who want laptops with battery life comparable to tablets. It also suggests that Apple is likely close to a similar decision, since it's rumored that it has been exploring the same jump for MacBooks. However, products won't show up until 2017, suggesting we'll revisit this next year. Mercedes GLA 45 AMG: I liked this car so much I bought it. The car has been a dream -- Mercedes not so much. First, we had a trip from hell to pick it up in Germany. Then, to make it up to me, the company put me through its advanced driver course. However, Mercedes so overburdened the instructors that the thing became unsafe as a consequence, and there was an accident. Finally, Mercedes actually configured my car wrong, making a last-minute change that eliminated one of the features I expressly had ordered and paid for. It's a great car, but I think I'm done with Mercedes. AMD RX-460 Card: We are ramping to VR, but the best solutions are way too expensive as you jump from a US$100 dollar range headset for your smartphone to a $3,000 solution for a full PC with an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift solution. Well, AMD pushed back and brought out its Radeon 460 card, which dramatically lowered the cost of entry for those wanting to get in on VR. Nvidia Drive PX2: Perhaps the greatest sleeper product in the market was the Nvidia Drive PX2. Basically it is an AI system in a box, and I'm convinced it is capable of much more than driving cars. This product and its predecessor vaulted Nvidia into the lead with autonomous cars, and likely will help move it into autonomous aircraft at some point. There no doubt will be other circumstances where having an AI in a box that can see and make decisions would be useful. The Amazon Echo Dot is the product Apple should have built. The Dot and its siblings have everyone from Google to Microsoft and Intel, among others, looking to build similar offerings. It is the critical link between homeowners and their IoT future, and it has cut through the market like a hot knife through butter. The Dot was my go-to gift to relatives this year, and at under $50. it remains one of the true bargains available. I think the Amazon Echo is this decade's iPod, and we'll soon see if Amazon can do as good a job locking everyone else out of the market as Apple did. It is licensing the technology, suggesting that next year we could be up to our armpits in Echo clones and competitors. Overall, though, the Echo has become the core driver for in-home IoT. When a product spins a market on its head, that showcases true market power, and my product of the year needs to showcase leadership and power. Amazon did that -- first with the Echo, and now with the Echo Dot, making the Echo Dot my product of the year. Congratulations, Amazon and thanks also for offering it in bundles of six, because I now have one in nearly every room of the house.

The new mobile PCs are upgraded with Intel’s new Core i5/i7 Kaby Lake processors, new displays as well as a slightly different design that is slightly thicker, but is also slightly lighter. In fact, Samsung claims that its new Notebook 9 13” is the lightest laptop on the market at 816 grams (1.8 lbs), although some would claim that the 13.3-inch Lavie-Z holds that title starting at 720 grams (1.72 lbs). Samsung positions its Notebook 9 machines for business travelers who have rather special requirements and who are willing to make certain tradeoffs. Apart from the new Intel Core i5/i7 processors featuring the Kaby Lake microarchitecture, the key improvement of the Notebook 9 are their new display panels with FHD resolution and a maximum brightness of 500 nits (their typical brightness is 350 nits), which is especially useful for those working outdoors. Quite naturally, at 500 nits the screens consume a lot of power, but the Notebook 9 laptops come batteries that have 30 Wh capacity, which is lower when compared to thin and light systems from Apple (41.4 Wh), Dell (60 Wh) and HP (38.4 Wh), but which helps to reduce weight (at the end of the day, not a lot of people have to work under direct sunlight). Samsung claims that the Notebook 7 can last seven hours on one charge, enough for office workers and even long-haul flights. As an added bonus, the Notebook 9’s monitors can display videos with HDR enhancements (the manufacturer does not reveal whether we are dealing with HDR10, but that is a likely situation). The Notebook 9 laptops from Samsung can be equipped with up to 16 GB of dual-channel DDR4 memory, which is a rare option for contemporary ultra-thin laptops, many of which come with 8 GB of DRAM (but this may change in 2017). Meanwhile, when it comes to storage, Notebook 9’s SSDs top at 256 GB, but Samsung integrated a MicroSD card reader and hence road warriors may easily add storage space if needed. Connectivity-wise, Samsung’s Notebook 9 machines offer two USB Type-A, one USB Type-C as well as an HDMI port. For connectivity, a 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 wireless module is present. The key selling points of the Samsung Notebook 9 range are their weight and dimensions: the 13” model is 13.9 mm thick, weighs 816 grams, whereas the 15” model is 14.9 mm thick, and weighs 984 grams. The laptops are thicker when compared to HP’s Spectre and Apple’s MacBook, but they are still thinner than Dell’s XPS 13. Moreover, when it comes to weight, the Notebook 9 are considerably lighter than (almost all) laptops in their class.

As for pricing, it is likely that the market segment that the manufacturer targets with the Notebook 9 family will not change with the arrival of new models, so we are looking at something like $1000+ for 13” models and something that starts at $1200 for 15” models. In the meantime, for a limited period Amazon in the U.S. is selling out the previous-gen Samsung Notebook 9 13” (NP900X3L-K06US) for $749.99 and the Samsung Notebook 9 15” (NP900X5L-K02US) for $849.99.

Reply Samus - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link I would say it's 9" based on the model number but as usual, Samsung marketing at its finest. They spend billions on advertising and calling a 13 and 15 inch laptop a Notebook 9 was somehow green lighted? It would perhaps make sense if the Notebook 1-8 where well known products...but at the end of the day it's a very confusing naming scheme for average consumers. Reply lilmoe - Saturday, December 24, 2016 - link For the average consumer visiting a Samsung store, it's inline with most of their electronics product naming scheme. Most people know what a Series 9 Samsung TV is. Reply name99 - Saturday, December 24, 2016 - link Seriously? I follow tech closer than most people, and I don't have a clue what a Series 9 Samsung TV is or what the "Series 9" brand represents. Reply lilmoe - Sunday, December 25, 2016 - link Hmmmm. Have you ever been to a samsung store? Hard to believe you missed their flagship product. They usually have the series 9 in the middle of the store with big fat fonts. Reply blzd - Monday, December 26, 2016 - link Samsung has stores? Reply andychow - Sunday, January 01, 2017 - link +1, I never heard that Samsung has stores. In Korea? Reply MrSpadge - Monday, December 26, 2016 - link +1 Reply Samus - Sunday, December 25, 2016 - link LMAO, I own a Samsung TV, a UN46-6500 something or other, 46" 3D etc... No f'ing clue what a series 9 is. The fact my TV is a series 6500 and the one under it was like a 4300, you saying they now have a series 9 almost reinforces my point. They went from a 4 digit series scheme to single digit? But the actual model tag says 9000 I bet right? As I said, they are all over the place. The company spends more on advertising than any consumer electronics company on the planet and you really have to question how well those returns are when only half of their divisions are turning profits. The smartphone and appliance divisions are likely to run record losses this year due to the Note 7 and recalling every top load washer made since 2013.

Resend activation e-mail Cars Technica / All things automotive Two roads to the same place: 2016 and the future of self-driving cars 2016 was something of a watershed for autonomous vehicles. by Jonathan M. Gitlin - Dec 23, 2016 4:43 pm UTC Login to bookmark 222 Aurich Lawson The self-driving car reached something of a watershed in 2016. All of a sudden, it seems we're right on the threshold of autonomous vehicles transforming our transportation. I'd ask any engineer in 2015 when they thought we'd have full (i.e., SAE level 5) self-driving vehicles and the answer was always "ooh, that's another 20-30 years away." Fast forward a year, and all of a sudden that target has moved: BMW, Intel, Mobileye, Uber, Volvo, Ford, Delphi, and others have all set 2021 (or earlier in the case of Delphi) as the year by which steering wheels become optional. The big breakthrough is down to the use of machine learning and deep neural networks, a field that has come along leaps and bounds in a relatively short space of time. For example, Nvidia will sell OEMs and tier one suppliers an open AI platform for automotive uses that leverages the company's GPUs and machine learning—tech that it ably demonstrated with its BB-8 technology demonstrator: Nvidia's deep neural network allowed BB-8 to figure out how to drive on and off road in a short amount of time. But along the way, the automakers and tech firms working on the problem have diverged into two groups: the ones who plan to get there in an incremental, stepwise fashion, and the others who plan to skip the intermediate step. To explain, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) breaks down autonomous driving into six different levels. (Perhaps confusingly, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also had a scale for self-driving vehicles that went from 0-4, however the industry has coalesced around the SAE scale of late, and that's the one we'll use at Ars.) Drive a car with no traction control, electronic stability control (ESC), or antilock brakes (ABS)? Congratulations! You have a level 0 vehicle. Add some—or all—of those driver assists and it's now a level 1 car. The kinds of advanced driver-assistance systems like adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping, or blind-spot monitoring, that keep tabs on the driving environment to help the driver make for level 2 is where most of the industry is right now—even industry leaders like Tesla, Audi, or Volvo. And so the scale progresses, up to level 5, where human interaction isn't required to complete a journey. Level 3 is the tricky one. Under most circumstances, the car will do the driving. But if it all gets too much for the computers to handle, control gets returned to the human. And as far as companies like Ford and Volvo are concerned, that's problematic. For one thing, driver assists are specifically being developed to be better than a human; things like ESC and ABS are literally life savers. For two, it means getting the attention of the human operator (who may be engrossed in a book or half asleep) and then safely returning control to them. Far better, some say, to simply pass over this intermediate stage and go for level 4 or level 5 autonomy. Meanwhile, OEMs like Audi think they can make level 3 work. Audi's 2018 flagship A8 sedan promises to be the first true level 3 car on sale to the public, and it's believed that it will use cameras and image recognition to determine if the human behind the wheel is paying attention or not. Audi's system is also being designed to pull over safely in the event that the human isn't able to resume control. Buying vs. renting A second philosophical difference is also beginning to emerge in the industry, regarding whether or not you'll own or just rent these self-driving vehicles. Assuming Ford or Uber or whoever else gets its self-driving vehicles ready by 2021, they won't be vehicles you or I could go out and purchase. Instead, we're talking about fleets owned by the manufacturers, which we'll summon when needed, paying just for the ride. Probably the biggest reason for this is the as-yet unresolved problem of insurance and liability. It is much easier for a company with deep pockets like Ford to own and commercially insure a fleet of autonomous vehicles, assuming liability for crashes, than passing those problems on to the end user. Volvo was first out of the gate to state that it would assume liability for its vehicles when in autonomous mode. "When you drive manually, the driver is responsible," CEO Håkan Samuelsson told Ars last year. "When it's automatic, we as the manufacturer are liable. If you're not ready to make such a statement, you're not ready to develop autonomous solutions." Contrast that with Tesla's position—Elon Musk recently told journalists that Tesla won't consider itself liable in the event of a crash, likening the situation to being in a stuck elevator. If we cast our crystal ball further out—20 or 30 years into the future—those different paths are all headed to the same place, and it's one where humans driving themselves will be in a distinct minority. Policy makers are salivating at the life-saving potential of autonomous vehicles; NHTSA blames human error for 94 percent of all crashes, and more than 35,000 people have been killed on US roads this year. It's not hard to imagine that restrictions on human drivers will start to appear, first on highways (like HOV lanes), and I can easily imagine ideas similar to London's congestion charge being used to discourage humans from driving themselves in cities. "I don't think new vehicle ownership will even exist by then," Jeremey McCool, CEO of HEVO Power (a company that makes wireless charging systems for vehicles) told me recently. "Manufacturers will own the assets, and they'll be able to overcome the problems they're having with cost by having people pay premiums for a monthly service. That'll probably eliminate Lyft and Uber, because they're just a middle facilitator at that point." What that means for the Ferraris and Porsches of the world, that build and sell vehicles that by design are supposed to engage and delight the driver, remains unclear. The insurance industry is also in for a big change by then, explained Andrew Rose, CEO of compare.com. "If you don't wreck cars, why do you need insurance? It's a $200 billion industry that's going away in the next few decades." Of course, that assumes a homogenous transportation ecosystem, something I'm less convinced we'll see for quite some time. The automobile comes with a deeply ingrained sense of freedom for many people out there, and any restrictions to that—like the idea of no longer owning a car but renting an autonomous pod—will sit badly with them. My colleague Lee Hutchinson expressed severe misgivings with the idea, citing the need to evacuate Houston in a hurry in the event of a hurricane. For that reason, and plenty of other edge cases just like it, I think we're looking at a much more multimodal transport future for quite some time.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums SK Hynix's new fab will boost production of 3D NAND flash and DRAM by Wayne Manion  2:33 PM on December 23, 2016 Intel and Micron may be trying to upend the chip memory market with their 3D XPoint non-volatile memory technology, but that isn't stopping SK Hynix from investing ₩3.15 trillion ($2.6 billion) in additional fabrication space for regular DRAM and 3D NAND flash. The company will spend this money to build a new fabrication plant in Cheongju, South Korea and expand clean-room operations in an existing plant in Wuxi, China. The design phase for new Korean plant begins in January, with shovels hitting dirt in August 2017 and production starting by the end of 2019. The new fab is expected to cost ₩2.2 trillion ($1.8 billion) and will be used to construct 3D NAND chips for use in storage devices. According to Anandtech, the investment is somewhat smaller than the amount the company spent on its largest plant. Anandtech goes on to explain that factory will produce 3D NAND exclusively during the initial stage, but will eventually diversify into DRAM chip production. The company also plans to spend ₩950 billion ($790 million) to expand operations at its Wuxi plant in China. SK Hynix's Wuxi operations currently produce about half of the company's current DRAM production. The chipmaker expects the output per area of floor space to decrease over time due to the emergence of more complex manufacturing processes. The expansion of the Chinese factory is intended to help make up for this projected decrease in productivity.

We’ve seen some other chipsets used, but we’ve yet to see an option packing Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors which are more than capable of running the lightweight Chrome OS. Why is that? According to two ex-Googlers on Google+, the boiled-down reason is that Qualcomm doesn’t open-source or upstream the various drivers that enable operating systems to run stably with the company’s chipsets. The reason this becomes a roadblock is because Chromebooks are constantly updated for years after the release. There has been some work to develop Chrome OS hardware powered by Qualcomm chipsets. However, due to the risk associated with the possibility of Qualcomm abandoning the hardware, it hasn’t ever progressed to the point of showing up on actual hardware. One of the ex-Googlers further explains that Qualcomm prefers its business model on Android which, for the most part, is to “ship it and forget it.” One difficulty is Qualcomm’s reluctance to open-source and upstream the various drivers that make up Linux support for the embedded devices. If Qualcomm doesn’t demonstrate ongoing support for their devices in the Linux kernel, then Google (or a Chromebook OEM) would best significant engineering risk if an update needs to be made in the future. Qualcomm seems to prefer the business model of Android where they can “ship it and forget it”. So in summary, it’s very unlikely we’ll see a Chrome OS device powered by Qualcomm anytime soon. In the meantime, we’re still seeing expansion in what processors Chromebooks run on, such as the recent Acer R13 Chromebook which is the first powered by MediaTek.

The age of loanership Internet of Things Back to Home Vodafone demos NB-IoT technology with Nokia and Telit in Germany Increase / Decrease text size Byomakesh Biswal 23rd December 2016 0 0Shares 0 0 0 0 Add to favorites Narrow band IOT technology will be commercially available from early 2017. Vodafone has demonstrated the use of narrowband internet-of-things (NB-IoT) at its lab in Dusseldorf, Germany, working with Nokia and IoT specialist Telit. The project used Nokia’s radio access network and elements from the company’s cloud packet core solution. Device manufacturers and applications developers will use the system in trials of new products and solutions to extend the IoT ecosystem. The system used an Intel chipset integrated into a NB-IoT module. In the trial, it was embedded into a Shitek ultrasonic gas meter to transmit data on gas flow over a 4G Vodafone test network. The technology allows radio signals to reach further inside buildings to connect sensors and supports lower power consumption, with battery life prolonged for about 15 years. NB-IoT is a 3GPP Rel. 13 radio access technology, which will co-exist with operators’ existing networks to benefit from mobile security and privacy features. The improved coverage of NB-IoT compared to conventional LTE will enable for the tracking of objects deep within buildings and in rural areas. Vodafone Group Research & Development and Technology Strategy head and GSMA NB-IoT Forum chairman Luke Ibbetson said: “NB-IoT will be commercially available from early 2017 and, because it has strong support from across the telecoms industry, will be the technology used to connect millions more things to the Internet. “We are very pleased to make the Vodafone Open Labs available to companies that want to exchange ideas and to develop and test connected products and services powered by NB-IoT.” Nokia global customer business team head Roberto Loiola said: “The low power attributes and reach of NB-IoT make it an ideal technology to connect the Internet of Things. The trial with Telit showed how NB-IoT is perfectly suited to manage a network comprised of devices and sensors from multiple vendors. “At Nokia we are constantly innovating to allow our customers to evolve their offer and anticipate the needs of their subscribers and our work with Vodafone at the Open Lab is a prime example of this.” Tags Homepage News List IoT Previous ArticleSoftware flaw overstated Twitter’s video advertisement viewership Next ArticleEconomics of Big Software: What you need to know Most read UK Gov scheme will fast track tech to boost £22bn cyber sector Hannah Williams 21st December 2016 OpenStack becomes ‘de facto’ private cloud James Nunns 21st December 2016 Airlines face hacker hijack threat from vulnerable Panasonic systems James Nunns 20th December 2016 ECB goes Advanced in search for next England cricket stars James Nunns 19th December 2016 BT Tower becomes world’s highest IoT base station Byomakesh Biswal 19th December 2016 AI in 2017: 14 funny things that could become a (crazy) reality Ellie Burns 16th December 2016 Have you been pwned?

With many businesses bringing in new technology for efficiency and success, digital change reduces processes, and increases productivity. According to a global survey commissioned by Dell and Intel, the influx of digitally native candidates entering the workplace value high tech perks more than free food; making it imperative for HR to keep up with the shift.  Furthermore, the study found that 42% of Millennial employees are willing to quit their job if office technologies are not up to standard – with over half of employees expecting to work in a ‘Smart’ office in the next five years. Therefore, it is important that the online habits of employees be taken into account. Having information at our fingertips has fuelled the growth of chatbots, backed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). As messenger apps become increasingly popular, the way service departments interact with their customers is evolving. The same applies to global mobility and the interaction between mobility specialists and employees on assignment. MAIA, the intelligent global mobility chatbot, can support employees around the clock by providing direct access to the employee's assignment details in a simple conversational interface. MAIA accesses the relevant data in MoveAssist's flagship product mai-assignment - a complete global mobility software solution that facilitates assignment management - and provides detailed answers to employee questions. Integrated with both Facebook Messenger and Slack, employees do not need to navigate away from the everyday messenger apps that they are already using. By combining Slack and Facebook Messenger the accessibility and usability of MAIA has further improved, so all employees get the benefit of MAIA’s knowledge directly in the social apps they use every day - enhancing the on-assignment experience and increasing employee satisfaction.   Have your say Guide to Outplacement and Career Transition The digital dilemma Skype, FaceTime, text , email, direct message, webinars; all technological advances...

The New Features & Exciting Changes Of The Linux 4.10 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Computers on 23 December 2016. Page 1 of 3. 14 Comments Linus Torvalds is expected to release the Linux 4.10-rc1 kernel this weekend ahead of Christmas and thereby marking the formal end of the 4.10 merge window, but with all of the major pull requests already submitted and Linus tending not to honor last-minute pull requests of big changes, here is our usual look at the exciting changes and new features you will be able to find with the Linux 4.10 kernel. While you can try out the Linux 4.10 Git code today or any of the weekly release candidates, those sticking to stable releases will find Linux 4.10 debut around the middle of February if there are no delays in Torvalds' usual release practices. The one sentence overview would be lots of open-source graphics driver work (as always), the open-source NVIDIA driver is killing it with this release, Intel TBM3 support, UBIFS file-encryption, more AMD Zen/Ryzen code, more ARM SoCs/platforms being mainlined, DAX iomap support, and a fair amount of other new hardware support. The detailed highlights of Linux 4.10 from my perspective of "interesting stuff" are: Graphics: - The open-source NVIDIA (Nouveau) DRM driver this time around is quite exciting after missing out on their changes for Linux 4.9. Work here includes atomic mode-setting, DisplayPort MST, performance-improving BOOST support, a LED driver for the light-up cards, and more. If atomic mode-setting or boost support doesn't get you excited in the open-source NVIDIA driver for Linux 4.10, at least you can now control the green LEDs on relevant NVIDIA graphics cards with 4.10... - The AMDGPU DRM driver has power management fixes, RPM fan information exposed, and GPU VM manager work. - The GCN 1.0 / Southern Islands support in AMDGPU is still experimental and disabled by default but there are some improvements for interested users. - Intel GVT support is being prepped and should be in good shape for Linux 4.11. A lot of other GVT-related code landed via the other pull requests for this graphics virtualization technology out of Intel Corp. - The Intel DRM driver also had scheduler prep work and priority boosting as some of their latest feature work. - The Raspberry Pi VC4 DRM driver has ETC1 texture compression and fragment shader threading support. - Freedreno's MSM DRM driver has initial Adreno A5xx support thanks in part to work by Qualcomm's Code Aurora group. - Three new DRM drivers: the ZTE VOU ZX, Amlogic Meson, and MXS FB. - Outside of DRM, the Linux kernel now has no one left as FBDEV maintainer. Next section the AMD Zen/Ryzen fun and more...

And the skullduggery that some of our opponents and adversaries engage in, I think is beneath this country's greatness," Brennan told the National Public Radio (NPR). On December 9, US media reported that the CIA allegedly concluded in a "secret" assessment that Russia had meddled in the November presidential elections and helped Republican candidate Donald Trump win. The reports have been mocked by Trump, whose team said the electoral victory was decisive and called the assessment "ridiculous."

Cloud Services Elevate the Profile of DevOps The increased use of cloud services has brought with it unprecedented complexity, which has led directly to the growing profile of DevOps within organizations. IaaS Rules the Cloud More than 51% of IT respondents whose companies have deployed cloud solutions chose Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). 22% selected Platform as a Service (PaaS), and 20% chose Software as a Service (SaaS). DevOps Dominates Workweek DevOps professionals spend an average of 25.1 hours of their 40-hour workweek using, monitoring or evaluating DevOps tools and solutions. Big Workloads Breaking down the DevOps workload, respondents reported spending 10.1 hours a week on tuning infrastructure, 9.5 hours on remediation analysis, and 5.5 hours on cloud application performance management. Bigger Infrastructure = More Tuning DevOps workers in organizations with at least 500 employees spend more time each week (12 hours) tuning the infrastructure than do employees in organizations with 250 or fewer employees (8 hours). Performance Tools Get Raves Between 50% and 67% of respondents had positive views of the performance and supporting tools of solutions such as VMware, OpenStack and Docker. Projects, Communities Score Poorly Conversely, favorability ratings of VMware, OpenStack and Docker fell between 28% and 38% for the amount of supporting projects, and between 9% and 17% for the activity of their communities. Focus on Strategy 84% of responding VMware users said they have a container deployment and management strategy, indicating that companies are matching the evolution of technology with a more concentrated strategic focus. Noisy Neighbor Problem 69% of respondents said they are aware of the "noisy neighbor problem," which happens when a cloud infrastructure tenant hogs resources and negatively impacts the performance of other users. Problem Solved 82% of those who said they're aware of the noisy neighbor problem also said they have a strategy for dealing with it. Preference for Containers, Bare Metal About half of respondents from organizations with cloud management strategies emphasize container use (55%) or implement on bare metal (50%).

This reality has led directly to the growing profile of DevOps within organizations as more hours are devoted to maintenance, monitoring and operations. In fact, a recent Intel data center survey, "The State of Enterprise Cloud Services," found that DevOps teams are spending the majority of their time on these lower-value activities. "Most enterprises are not leveraging sophisticated tools currently available that would decrease these hours by at least 50 percent and instead require a team's valuable resources to spend their time performing manual, tedious, time-intensive work," said Jeff Klaus, general manager of data center solutions for Intel. "If you don't see how advanced solutions free up your talent to focus on higher output tasks that look ahead on the product roadmap or impact the bottom line, you're really only doing a disservice to your enterprise."

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Gadgets Ultrabooks - Dell XPS 13 VS MacBook Pro 13” Elroy Bethell - December 23, 2016 5:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail Here are two Ultrabooks that offer great features for this classification of laptops. They are both highly portable, very thin and light, and boast excellent battery life. But let’s see how they compare. Ultrabooks have garnered quite a following lately.  They are thin, lightweight and come packed with features that make them a viable choice for anyone looking for a computer that they can take with them wherever they go. Let’s take a quick look at how the Dell XPS13 and MacBook Pro 13” stack up. I picked both models with close specs for a fair assessment, so both have the same amount of RAM, and SSD storage.     According to the SPECS Chart below, we see the following:   Processor: The MacBook Pro 13” has the faster processor of the two ultrabooks. The MacBook features Intel’s fifth-generation dual-core processor that houses the CPU, L3 cache, Intel Iris Graphics 6100, and fast 1866MHz memory controller on a single chip. These processors feature Turbo Boost technology that automatically boosts the processor clock speed based on workload, giving you extra processing power when you need it. And Hyper-Threading technology allows two threads to run simultaneously on each core. Screen: The Dell XPS 13 has a stunning Quad HD+ display that outshines other 13-inch laptops. It features the world’s first infinity display which is almost borderless 13-inch screen inside an 11-inch laptop. When compared to the Apple MacBook Air 13, the XPS 13 is 23% smaller with the same screen size. Size: At its thickest point, the Dell XPS measures 0.59 which makes it thinner than the MacBook Pro. Weight: The Dell also has the MacBook Pro 13” beat in this category by weighing in at 2.9 pounds compared to the MacBook Pro’s 3.48 pounds. Battery: The MacBook Pro wins in the area by providing 12 hours of battery life compared to the 11 hours listed for the Dell XPS.   Here are the SPECS:   Dell XPS 13 MacBook Pro 13” Processor Intel Core i5-6200U 2.30 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology up to 2.80 GHz 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz   RAM 8GB 8GB Storage 256GB SSD 256GB PCIe-based flash storage Screen Size 13.3 in QHD+ LCD InfinityEdge touchscreen 13.3-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display Screen Resolution 3200 x 1800 2560 x 1600 (Retina) Touchscreen 10-point multi-touch No Thinness 0.35-0.59 inch 0.71 inch Weight 2.9 Lbs 3.48 Lbs Pen No No Biometric log-in No No Voice Activation Cortana personal assistant No Security Complete, built-in, Continuous NO Battery Life Up to 11 hours Up to 12 hours   "Well, there may be a reason why they call them 'Mac' trucks!

Meet The Publisher Meet The Team Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Home Mobile Gadgets Trending Business Women & Tech Contests Christmas Gifts, New Gadgets Can Compromise Your Online Security, Safety  By: Lee Rickwood December 23, 2016 The holiday gifting season is in full swing, but so too, the potential for holiday hacking. Yes, even Christmas lights themselves – accessed through a connected smartphone and mobile app – can compromise your online safety, security and privacy. Connected devices and consumer gadgets such as laptops and PCs, streaming media devices, drones, wearables, smart home products – even Christmas lights themselves – can compromise your online safety, security and privacy. In fact, hackable holiday gifts can be a threat to all of us if they are not used wisely or if they are left unprotected when hooked up to the ever-widening Internet of Things. IoT devices have been used in recent cybersecurity incidents that compromise the privacy of their owners and the security of the Internet overall. Barely two months ago, a major Web attack took down Shopify, SoundCloud, Spotify, Twitter and other popular websites; hackers can use unsecured webcams and other things connected to the Internet as their break-in tools. Another website was streaming live video from literally tens of thousands of connected webcams that had been hijacked; the cameras (being used in both residential and commercial settings) were unsecure because users did set them up properly – or safely. Video cameras and many other connected devices come with built-in username and password options so that owners can use and manage their gadgets. But factory default settings are easy to hijack, and connected gadget owners must take the steps needed to ensure the device has the latest updates, patches and individually customized password settings. Potentially value and revealing data can be collected from numerous smart devices and connected gadgets if passwords and other protections are not used. So, while gadget manufacturers surely have a duty to design privacy, safety and security tools into their products, so too, consumers have a duty to protect themselves and each other by being educated about their device and using safety tools that are available. “Connected devices are a popular holiday present because they offer convenience and entertainment,” said Brenda Moretto, Canadian consumer manager with Intel Security. “But Canadians need to be aware that connected devices that aren’t properly secured can expose important personal and financial information.” # # # Intel advises holiday gift- and gadget-loving techies to heed its tips for safe, secure and private uses of devices connected to the Internet of Things: Securing the devices itself, not only through use of robust passwords and user IDs, but also with the installation of security enhancement and virus protection software. Of course, connected devices are only as secure as their connection, and the use of smart home apps or any connected device across public Wi-Fi can expose users to risks. Device software should be kept up-to-date with authorized updates and software patches, and of course, strong passwords, PINs, even biometric authorization (fingerprint or face scanning) should always be used with any connected device. # # # Last year tech analysis firm Gartner estimated that over 5 million new things get connected every day, and the company said over 20 billion connected devices will be in use by the year 2020. Wearables devices and personal fitness gadgets are very popular gifts, but they too are connected to the Internet and thus are vulnerable to hacking and hijacking. Seeking some ways to come to grip with those 20 billion potential threats, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) has participated in a Global Privacy Enforcement Network’s annual privacy sweep, in which 25 data protection authorities from around the world looked at 314 devices. The OPC focused on health devices, like fitness trackers and heart rate monitors, while the other partners looked at everything from connected toys to smart TV’s and cars. In describing what risks and potential threats the survey found, the OPC’s Director of Technology Analysis Luk Arbuckle noted that great potential, promise and power of the Internet of Things also comes with great responsibility, again, both from the manufacturer and the user community. Intel Security’s chief consumer security evangelist Gary Davis has posted his holiday advice about hackable gift-giving in a recent blog post, and the OPC has also launched a privacy blog filled with tips that can help all of us have a safe and secure holiday and a happy New Year.   -30-   Featured Gadgets Mobile Trending apps cameras Canada gadgets privacy security smart home smartphone software technology wearables About Lee Rickwood Lee Rickwood covers developments in media and technology with particular interest in how such developments affect our social, political and economic activities and interactions.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home Reviews Cases, Cooling & PSU CPU Air Coolers Thermalright Le Grand Macho RT CPU Cooler Review Thermalright's Le Grand Macho is one of the best CPU air coolers we've tested in a long time. You need to take a look at this one. By: Chad Sebring | CPU Air Coolers in Cases, Cooling & PSU | Posted: 1 week, 3 days ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 97%Manufacturer: Thermalright Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Packaging] Page 3 [Thermalright Le Grand Macho CPU Cooler] Page 4 [Accessories and Documentation] Page 5 [Installation and Finished Product] Page 6 [Test System Setup, Thermal Tests, and Noise Results] Page 7 [Final Thoughts] Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing     Even though we just had a look at the Macho Direct, Thermalright has also introduced a cousin to this cooler, still sporting the Macho name as well. This time around, we are still offered a semi-passive CPU cooling option, but improvements have been made to what we just saw from their previous submission. In this design, there are more fins added to the stack, the base is larger to take on the LGA2011 CPUs, and along with an added heat pipe in the mix, this time the cooler is dressed to the nines as well. While similar at a glance, for those who thought he Macho Direct was a bit on the dull side, Thermalright still has an option for those of you who need the coolers appearance to be dressed up.     Adding more fins and an extra pipe does take up some of the available room the previous design offered, but it also does one vital thing on top of that as well. Rather than the 200W TDP that the Macho Direct has, this cooler offers an astonishing 280W TDP. This means that whether going AMD or Intel for your processor, this cooler has the grapes it takes to handle anything you can throw at it, even the most extravagant overclocks for suicide runs if that is the type of thing you enjoy doing. Of course, to do so, you will want to use this cooler with a fan to actively cool the tower. On the flip side, the TDP is so high, so that when and if you decide to run this cooler without a fan on it, depending on only the chassis cooling to pass air over it, you can still manage temperatures without any noise associated from this cooler at all.   If this were just the Macho Direct with a bit of lipstick on it, we would have no issues telling you that, but this is not the case. The Le Grand Macho RT shipped from Thermalright is a level above, while just resembling a more affordable solution. Something to pay attention to though is that there are two versions of this cooler. There is one sold as Le Grand Macho, which ships without a fan, and then there is the Le Grand Macho RT shipped with a TY-147 fan to cool it actively. As for our needs, we will be testing the cooler with the fan that accompanies it, as our test rig is not made to test passive coolers adequately. Since we run without an exhaust fan, our results in semi-passive mode would have shed a bad light on the Le Grand Macho, as it would be left to stew in its juices inside of the D-Frame chassis. That being said, we should move on, and see what this Thermalright Le Grand Macho is all about, and just what this 280W TDP cooler is capable of.     Our chart for the specifications is taken directly from the product page of the Le Grand Macho from Thermalright. In it, we are first shown the dimensions of the cooler, where we are shown that it is 150mm from side to side, it is 120mm from front to back without the base included, and 125mm with it included, and to the top of the pipe tips from the base, this cooler stands 159mm tall. We also see the weight has drastically increased from the Macho Direct, and that 900 grams does not include the 160 additional grams of the fan. We see there is a total of seven heat pipes in this design, all of which are 6mm in diameter. The aluminum fins are 0.4mm thick with a 3.1mm gap between each of them, and there are 35 fins in total. There is a mention of the C1100 Pure copper used in the base, but no mention of the copper that comprises the heat pipes, and there is also no mention of the nickel coating applied to both of them.   The fan that comes along with the Le Grand Macho RT is the Thermalright TY-147B fan. This fan is 140mm wide, 152mm tall, and 26.5mm in thickness. The speed of it can range from 300 to 1300 RPM, pushing a range of air flow from 16.9 to 73.6 CFM, but no mention of the air pressure level. We also see that this fan is shown to be only 21 dB(A) in noise level when fully powered, but normally it will be below that while using the 4-pin PWM controlled connection to the motherboard. The last couple of things to note in this chart are that the fan uses a fluid dynamic bearing, and the Le Grand Macho is indeed rated at 280W of TDP.   From earlier emails, we were shown the MSRP for both the Le Grand Macho, as well as the Le Grand Macho RT, where the former is offered at €59.99, and the latter was to release for €69.99. With the Euro nearly identical currently to the US dollar, pricing should still be close to what the MSRP is on the other side of the pond. We were able to find listings for the Le Grand Macho, where Newegg is asking $69.90 for it, and Amazon is asking $69.99 right now. So, there is a $10 increase on US shores. However, while the fan-less version is easy to get your hands-on, we only found one listing of the Le Grand Macho RT, and it is shown without a price as it is currently unavailable from Amazon at this time.   If we had to take a stab at the pricing, we would expect it to fall in the $79.99 to $89.99 range to add the TY-147B to the cooler. Considering the Le Grand Macho has a near $40 increase on the asking price over the Macho Direct, this cooler better look the part and play the part even better. The bar was raised high once we saw what the Macho Direct brought to the table. Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find the Thermalright Le Grand Macho RT CPU Cooler for sale below.

(Kathy Willens/AP) By Jerry Markon December 23, 2016 Follow @JerryMarkon President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for national security adviser partnered in recent months with a technology company co-led by a businessman who pleaded guilty to trying to sell stolen scientific material in the 1980s to the KGB, the former Soviet intelligence service. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn joined the advisory board of Brainwave Science in February, company documents show. The Massachusetts firm develops controversial “brain fingerprinting” technology designed to assess whether people under interrogation are being truthful by measuring their brain waves. The firm offers training in how to use the technology, in partnership with Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, according to Brainwave’s website. One of Brainwave’s two-member board of directors was Sabu Kota, an Indian-born software engineer who pleaded guilty in 1996 to selling stolen biotech material to an FBI agent posing as a Soviet spy. Prosecutors said the sale stemmed from what they called Kota’s involvement in a spy ring that passed sensitive defense technology to the KGB between 1985 and 1990, according to a Defense Department summary of the case. Brainwave Science removed Kota’s name from the company website sometime between Thursday and Friday, when Bloomberg News published a report about Flynn’s ties to the firm, according to a search of archived Google data. Company officials and officials from Trump’s transition team did not respond to requests for comment on Friday, and Kota did not respond to messages left at his home. Kota’s lawyer denied that he had any connection to spying when he was charged in 1995, and Kota told Bloomberg that the criminal charges were a misunderstanding and stemmed from a patent dispute, not espionage. Bloomberg also quoted a Trump transition official as saying that Flynn had no dealings with Kota during his time working with Brainwave and that he has ended his association with the firm. The connection between Flynn — a decorated military intelligence officer and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency — and the company is the latest controversy involving relations between Russia and Trump or members of his team. Trump has faced criticism for expressing his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and on Friday the president-elect released what he called “a very nice letter” from the Russian leader. Flynn stunned former colleagues when he traveled to Moscow last year to appear alongside Putin at a lavish gala for the state-run channel RT, a trip Flynn admitted he was paid to make. Former U.S. officials said Flynn, seen dining next to Putin in photos published by Russian outlets, was used as a prop by the autocratic leader. Flynn defended the trip, saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels such as CNN, and that he had pressed Putin’s government to behave more responsibly in international affairs. The length and precise nature of Flynn’s contacts with the Brainwave firm could not be determined on Friday. Bloomberg reported that Flynn was supposed to help drum up new business for the firm with U.S. agencies, and that he has met with company officials at least 10 times. The meetings reportedly were held as late as September, when Flynn helped pitch Brainwave’s services to officials from the Bangladeshi defense forces. Independent scientists have disputed the accuracy and reliability of brain fingerprinting, and Brainwave has not released research supporting its claims that the tool is highly effective. But Bloomberg quoted Brainwave President Krishna Ika as saying that Flynn had tested the device himself, donning a helmet-like headpiece fitted with sensors. “He found it very convincing,” Ika told the news service. 1 of 31 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Here’s a look at Trump’s administration so far View Photos The men and women the president-elect has selected for his Cabinet and White House team.

News Twitter testing notifications for breaking news—Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey insists that Twitter is a news platform, a channel for sharing what’s happening right now. Reflecting its desire to be a news app, the company has started testing notifications of breaking news. When a truck crashed into a Berlin Christmas market, Twitter pushed a news alert of the event to some users via the Twitter Moments tab; it had done the same when Fidel Castro died. The takeaway: While I don’t often check Twitter Moments, I do first see a lot of news in my Twitter feed. Pushing news notifications is a great idea, as long as users have the ability to turn them off (which they do). Read more Live audio comes to Facebook—Live Audio is Facebook’s latest feature for brands, enabling them to broadcast audio-only to audiences that can comment and react. It’s also an opportunity for fans to listen while doing something else, one of audio’s biggest benefits. Android users can keep listening even if they leave the app or lock their phones; iOS listeners have to remain on Facebook.  Facebook will test Live Audio with the BBC World Service and others in the next few weeks. The takeaway: Don’t expect Facebook to become the new king of podcasting with Live Audio because, well, it’s live and podcasts are on-demand. Still, it could be interesting to broadcast the recording of a podcast live over Facebook to see if it attracts more listeners to the recorded show. Read more Google launches podcasts for agencies—Speaking of audio, google will publish a podcast series early in 2017 that will feature agencies sharing their digital marketing expertise. The podcast will be hosted by Alex Langshur, co-founder and senior partner at digital data analytics company Cardinal path. Listeners will be able to submit questions and request topics to cover. The first episode will focus on turning leads and prospects into sales, will be available on January 9. The takeaway: Podcasting’s star continues to rise, leading me to ask yet again why so many companies aren’t jumping on board. Read more Twitter search now based on relevance—Without much fanfare, Twitter has changed the way it displays search results. Until now, results were chronological with the most recent tweets showing first, but now they’re based on relevance. The change mirrors what users see on their timelines; Twitter switched to relevance ranking for timelines nearly a year ago. The takeaway: I’m still not crazy about not seeing the most recent tweets on my timeline, but for search it makes sense. If I search for something, I definitely want to see the most relevant tweets, not just the most recent that happen to contain the word or phrase I’m searching. Read more Error in metrics leads Twitter to overcharge for ads—Facebook must be thrilled to see headlines about ad measurement errors involving a competitor. This time it’s Twitter whose measurement of video ads running on Android was inaccurate, leading to overcharging. Advertisers have been issued refunds. The takeaway: One more reason the industry should consider third-party audits and measurement services like Nielsen does for TV. And one more reason for marketers to approach social media ad metrics with a grain of salt. Read more Reddit gets a mobile competitor—Amino is a mobile community news site that mirrors Reddit but just for mobile. With nearly $20 million in funding, the service is expanding internationally, hiring regional staff, and curating communities unique to different countries. The takeaway: The fact that a community news site is building a base of users so quickly and so broadly on a mobile-only platform is one more sign that we’re fast become a mobile-only society. That doesn’t mean anyone should abandon the web, but it is important to understand your audience’s behaviors when selecting platforms on which to engage them. Read more TSA takes traveler questions via social media—The U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) gets a lot of criticism—much of it well-deserved—but its use of social media has been consistently brilliant. For the holidays, if you have a question about what you can carry on a flight, you can send a picture of the item through social media and get an answer in 20 minutes or less.  The takeaway: If you haven’t followed the TSA’s Instagram account, you’re missing some amazing photos. The TSA is an example of an organization using social media strategically and building a sizable following that not only makes it easier for the agency to do its job, but also to offset the negative perception the agency has built over the years. Read more JWT, Black Lives Matter create map of black-owned businesses—JWT New York and the activist group Black Lives Matter have connected a database of black-owned businesses with Google maps to create a map-based directory of black-owned businesses. The beta launched with 300 businesses, most in major metropolitan areas. The takeaway: Regardless of your opinion of Black Lives Matter, this mashup should spark some creative thinking. Finding all the Best Buy stores or CitiBank locations on a Google map is nothing new, but what else can you do with the Google Maps API and a database? How about mapping all the no-kill animal shelters? (That’s just off the top of my head.) What other locations that don’t all belong to one organization can you map as a public service? Read more Personalize your Facebook updates with color—When my wife and I were dating, she had only ever seen “The Wizard of Oz” on a black-and-white TV. Watching it at my place one Easter (when one of the three TV networks aired it annually), she was stunned when Dorothy stepped out of the house into a full-color Oz. (Yes, we’re that old.) Since then, color has been ubiquitous on TV and everywhere else. So it’s kinda hard to get worked up over Facebook’s new feature is the ability to select a color to appear behind your text status. The feature is rolling out globally for Android users, though everybody will be able to see Android-created colored updates in their news feeds. The takeaway: One good thing: Brands will be able to tint their updates with their brand colors, I guess. The goal is to encourage more people to share personal posts. Read more Trends Brands publish with Instant Articles—Facebook’s Instant Articles was created to make publisher content open quickly on mobile devices, but brands are starting to get in on the action, too. Turner Broadcast System is publishing on Facebook using Instant Articles to promote its sitcom, “People of Earth.” The series has just 44,000 Facebook fans, so consider the use of Instant Articles an experiment, with the network publishing fictional diary entries from the show’s characters. Few brands have taken Facebook up on its offer to use Instant Articles; they “lack the infrastructure and expertise to publish on a regular basis.” Intel, however, distributed its branded content magazine, iQ, via Instant Articles. The takeaway: There are plenty of brands that publish magazine-like content, such as Whole Foods, which could easily repurpose magazine content through Instant Articles. There’s no cost to do so, which will make it interesting to see if there’s any uptake by brands, which also should be converting content to the web-wide Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) version of HTML. Read more Operations, supply chain could lead to Millennials dumping your brand—A YouGov survey found nearly 70% of Millennials have switched a favorite brand in the past year, motivated by product quality, availability issues, working conditions, and sustainability. The factors usually assumed for Millennial disloyalty—a social media presence, user-friendly apps, and great websites—actually have little impact on brand loyalty. It’s the “behind-the-scenes” issues associated with operations, logistics, and supply chain management that make a difference. The takeaway: This surprises me not at all given the ever-growing body of evidence that a company’s behavior in society matters more and more to people (and not just Millennials). Your organization not only has to be a good corporate citizen; you have to engage audiences so they’ll know about it. That’s not only how you keep the customers you have. It’s how you attract those defecting from your competitors. Read more Print newspapers still serve a sizable audience—Nearly 170 million Americans read a newspaper at least once a month, according to a Nielsen Scarborough study, including the print edition. Eighty-one percent of monthly newspaper readers consume a print edition and 51% read print exclusively while 30% read both digital and print. Lest you think it’s just older readers favoring print, the data shows the ages of print readers mirror the general population. For instance, 13% of the population is 70 or older; they represent 15% of the newspaper audience. Millennials, on the other hand, represent 25% of the population and 24% of newspaper readership. The newspaper-reading audience is also affluent and educated. The takeaway: Some media analysts are wondering if the industry was hasty in shrugging off print. Just because everything can be done digitally doesn’t necessarily means it’s the best platform. Read more Do Millennials read email?—It’s hit and miss, according to a recent study, with 18% of American Millennials saying they always open marketing emails (compared to 9% of people 30 and over). But 24% are more likely to never open marketing emails (compared to 19% of those 30 and over). Fifty-five percent of Millennials say they open marketing emails sometimes; 49% of those over 30 said the same. Another study found that even if marketing emails are opened, it doesn’t mean the message got across. The takeaway: I would have liked to see data on opt-in email newsletters vs. plain old marketing emails. I have seen other data that confirms people do read well-constructed newsletters to which they have subscribed. Read more Marriott launches reality series—Joining a number of other companies that have taken to full-scale TV-like program production as a means of brand marketing, Marriott has introduced a half-hour reality series called “Hotel Countdown” that gives viewers an inside look at hotel openings. The series is, of course, available on YouTube. The takeaway: While I question how many people care about “the architectural design, interior decorating, staff hiring and the planning of (a) grand opening event,” the trend of producing programming—rather than just the ads that interrupt it—is gaining steam. From documentaries like this to fiction series (like “Carmella,” a youth-oriented vampire series from a feminine hygiene products company), brands are building fan bases with original programming content. Read more Fake News Search engine tracks fake news—Hoaxy is a search engine from Indiana University’s network Science Institute and its Center for Complex Networks and System Research that tracks fake news. The search engine, currently in beta, indexes stories from more than 130 sites that produce fake news so you can see how the links spread across social media. Hoaxy lists all fake news stories related to any search term, then lets you view how any one of the stories has spread. The takeaway: Hoaxy has two challenges (though I have to admit that I love it). One is capturing all fake news rather than just some. The other is to get the people most inclined to believe fake news to determine its veracity. The latter is the bigger challenge, given the next item. Read more The public is concerned about fake news—The Pew Research Center has found that most Americans believe fake news is having an impact, with 64% saying it creates confusion about the basic facts of current issues and events. This belief is consistent across incomes, education levels, partisan affiliations, and other demographic categories. The public is also confident that it can tell fake news from real news. Nearly a quarter of Americans say they have shared fake news; 14% said they knew it was fake when they shared it while 16% said they realized after sharing that it was fake. The takeaway: Compare this data to the next item. Most Americans are confident that their news sites are reliable—Fifty-eight percent of Americans are confident that the sites they use to find and read news are reliable, even though many say Facebook is their only news site. As a result, it’s safe to assume a lot of people believe everything they read on Facebook. An Ipsos study found that American adults are fooled by fake news 75% of the time. The takeaway: Companies will have to work hard to make sure they get correct information out to stakeholders once they have been targeted by fake news. One key tool is owned media. In other words, if you don’t have your own company blog, now’s the time to build one up. Read more Video and Livestreaming Assassination demonstrates the risk of autoplay—You’re scrolling through Twitter with videos automatically playing as they fill your screen and suddenly you see the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey. That happened to untold numbers of Twitter users, leading some to suggest Twitter turn off autoplay of videos showing people being killed. The same issue materialized for people scrolling through Buzzfeed, where a warning of graphic content didn’t display long enough to keep some people from seeing unwanted violent footage. The takeaway: This issue reflects the challenge facing companies introducing technologies before figuring out what the social issues could be. As one Twitter use put it, “I can’t accept an auto launch video where we can see the facial expression of the victim at the moment of bullet’s impact within two seconds. There is no choice whether to view this or not. It’s a snuff film forced on Twitter users without warning. Hard to believe this is where we are.” Yes. Yes it is. And to make matters worse, it’s where your ad may appear. Read more Consumers watch six hours of video on social networks every week—Research from Brightcove found that 67% of respondents are watching more video on social networks than they did a year ago, and 60% plan to watch even more in 2017. On a daily basis, consumers in the US watch 60 minutes of social network-based video daily, followed by 51 minutes in Australia, 46 minutes in the UK, and 44 minutes in Germany. Music videos top the genres watched, followed by user-generated videos and movie trailers. Half of social video views happen on YouTube, 36% on Facebook and the other 14% spread among several other networks. Forty-five percent say they watch brand videos on social media. The takeaway: What, you’re still not producing videos for social media? How much evidence of its growing influence do you need? Read more Facebook upgrades livestreaming for brands, social media teams—Public figures engage Facebook audiences through the Facebook Mentions app. A series of Mentions updates includes Team Prompts, which let social media managers draft posts a public figure can review before it’s published. Facebook has also added scheduling tools to set reminders to go live. You can also add tags to live posts to make it easier for fans to find them through Facebook Search. Other new features: comment moderation and improved live broadcast quality. The takeaway: Facebook clearly is paying no attention to the livestreaming naysayers, investing heavily in features designed to make it the platform of choice for celebrities, brands, and individuals to broadcast. Read more Twitter to livestream Golden Globes red carpet show—Twitter is also betting the farm on livestreaming, inking deals with the NFL, Wimbledon, news organizations, and others as fast as its senior executives are bolting for the door. (Two left in the last week.) The latest deal will have the Red Carpet event from the Golden Globes broadcast over twitter, featuring exclusive interviews, celebrity content from Twitter itself, and the red carpet event realtime video feed. “Twitter is where the conversation about the Golden Globes happens,” according to Twitter’s COO, expaining why the broadcast makes sense. The takeaway: Turning a two-screen experience into a single-screen experience might be appealing to some, but I suspect many will still want to watch the red carpet event on a big screen and confine their use of a mobile device to engaging with others watching at the same time. What would be better? “Casting” the Twitter broadcast onto a big screen. Of course, those not near a TV or computer monitor will be thrilled to have access to the stream—at least, those who give a damn about the Golden Globes red carpet event, among whom I don’t count myself. Read more Vine’s not completely dead, just mostly dead—Twitter announced the death of Vine in October, but it’s more of a transition. Next month, the Vine app will be renamed Vine Camera, a tool you can still use to create 6.5-second looping videos for sharing to Twitter or saving to your phone. The Vine team insists there will be a way to migrate your followers from Vine to your Twitter account. The takeaway: You have to wonder how many Vine creators will just move on to Snapchat or Instagram, even with the continued ability to create Vines. It has been a while since I have seen a brand partner with a Vine creator, which used to be a big deal. Read more Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality Linden Labs brings Second Life to VR—Sansar is the name Second Life creator Linden labs has given a tool it hopes will be “a WordPress for social VR.” As was the case in Second Life, anybody can make their own world by buying or importing their own assets to the environment, where they will be able to interact via avatar with others. The takeaway: I have already participated in a VR social space that reminded me for all the world of Second Life. Linden Labs’ vision is far more sophisticated. If creating a virtual space really is as easy as creating WordPress site, expect to see a flurry of social spaces emerge. The question is whether people will want to visit them. That’ll require a compelling value proposition, though I suspect most efforts will created based on a “build it and they will come” mentality—and they won’t come. Read more Oculus joins the social VR party—As Linden Labs prepares its Sansar project, Oculus is also jumping into social VR with a system due for release in 2017. Rooms and parties are two oculus offerings that enable social interaction inside a virtual environment. Parties are voice-only calls that accommodate three people at a time within a VR environment. When connected in a Party, participants can join a room to participate in group activities like watching videos and playing games. The takeaway: Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of Facebook’s future entails people gathering together in virtual environments, though the need to be engaged in real time seems limiting to me. I do see utility in virtual gatherings; the ability to engage a focus group, for example, without anyone needing to leave their home or office is intriguing. But if millions didn’t want to gather in virtual environments in Second Life, I don’t see a a significantly bigger demand for it just because the environment is immersive. Read more Artificial Intelligence and Chatbots GE blends a science kit with an Amazon Echo skill—Labracadabra is a series of six $30 science kits, each of which demonstrates a scientific concept like sound waves. You (or your offspring) are guided through each experiment with a skill created for the Amazon Echo, a kind of science teacher in your living room. The takeaway: I’m definitely wowed by this integration of the real world with an Echo skill. More of this is definitely inevitable. One thought I’m giving away free to Blue Apron, the service that delivers fresh ingredients for a meal: Deliver the instructions over the Echo—including the ability for the cook to ask questions—and play music in between instructions. It’s a no-brainer! Read more Have you chatted with a holiday gift bot?—Buzzfeed and Time Inc. are both offering holiday gift finders via chatbots that ask whom you’re shopping for, how much you want to spend, and other criteria. Buzfeed’s Ultimate Gift Finder on Messenger will offer 100 suggestions, while Time’s Real Simple is more focused on last-minute shopping. The takeaway: Both of these bots, despite having some kinks to work out, address genuine consumer needs. As people get more accustomed to using bots, making useful bots available will promote more one-to-one interactions with customers. Read more Marketers like AI a lot more than they use it—Seventy-seven percent of marketers responding to a Demandbase survey believe Artificial Intelligence will be “the next big thing;” only 23% see it as hype. Further, 79% say AI will revolutionize marketing within five years and 78% are confident they know how to use it for marketing purposes. That’s just aspirational, though, since 90% say they’re not using it, 60% are having trouble integrating it with their current tools, and 54% say they’d have a problem training employees to use it. The takeaway: These survey respondents are right about the role AI will play in marketing. You can beat 90% of them to the punch by figuring out how to take advantage of it now. Read more Alexa, how did my marketing campaign do?—Users of Datorama’s cross-channel marketing analytics offering can now ask the Amazon Echo for information about a campaign. Supplementing information available to clients via a web dashboard, the Amazon Echo “skill” could be useful during board meetings when someone asks for information. Rather than scroll through a web screen looking for answers while everyone else waits, the CMO could just ask. The takeaway: It’s this kind of interaction that convinces me that voice and chat tech will be the biggest transformation of the next five years. Read more What do users want from chatbots?—A report based on qualitative research and usability studies found that people using chatbots want the chats to be more focused and relevant and cluttered with less fluff so they deliver more helpful information as quickly as possible. They also want a single search bar that unifies all sources for user questions, one chatbot represent all departments or groups in a company, a face or icon to represent the chatbot, and for the chatbot to figure out what the user is likely to ask next. The takeaway: Too many companies are building chatbots quickly because of the growing trend without considering the user experience. Gathering information like this—as well as figuring out what frustrations your customers have that can be eased by a chatbot—is critical. Read more Microsoft’s Cortana coming to an Echo-like home speaker—That’s the speculation, anyway, since Microsoft released a software developer kit (SDK) for Cortana that will let companies build hardware that use the Artificial Intelligence tool that people will be able to use to set reminders, get weather updates, and even (perhaps) dictate Word documents. One company, Knowmail, is integrating its email automation engine with Cortana so it will be able to flag important messages as urgent and read them to you. Given Microsoft’s AI-driven translation tool (which enables real-time Skype translation), it’s not hard to see Cortana handling real-time translated audio conferencing. The takeaway: More fodder for my argument that voice and bots, not AR glasses, is the next significant step in digital evolution. Read more Mobile and Wearables Citi uses Spectacles for recruiting—Last week I reported on a surgeon’s use of Snap’s Spectacles wearable camera to livestream a surgery. This week comes news that Citi has embraced Spectacles to show candidates what working at Citi is like. The first series of first-person POV videos using the sunglasses is a day in the life of a junior employee. Citi has acquired 14 pairs of Spectacles to spread the POV videos to various locations. Citi hopes to attract younger talent, something Wall Street has had a difficult time doing in recent years. The takeaway: Cisco Systems uses a Snapchat account—We Are Cisco—for similar purposes. These tools are a great way to show instead of tell people about your employer brand. Read more Facebook adds video group chat to Messenger—Up to 50 people can join a group vide chat via Facebook’s Messenger app. If six or fewer people are participating, you can view all the videos at once or use a carousel that highlights the active speaker. The carousel is the default with more than six participants. The takeaway: This is a feature Messenger users have been asking for; it’s also an expansion of Facebook’s focus on livestreaming and a natural evolution of chat app-based video. Brands looking to tap into Messenger now have another option, since engaging groups of people in a video chat can lead to all kinds of brand-to-customer interactions. Just one thought: You know all those user groups that used to get together in the early days of computing? I can easily see user groups re-emerging (well beyond computing) as long as all you have to do is join a video call. Read more Consumers willing to engage with brands on messaging apps—Most companies haven’t yet figured out how to make the transition from web pages and social networks to messaging apps despite clear evidence that consumers are way ahead of them. One study finds 53% of people in the UK and France who use messaging apps (like Messenger and WhatsApp, both Facebook properties) have interacted with a company on a messaging app or are open to doing so as long as they can block companies with which they don’t want to interact. The takeaway: You have to make the transition, but you have to do so carefully, ensuring your interactions are personalized and responsive. There are also opportunities to innovate. For instance, 15% of respondents liked the idea of group interactions with brands. Creating a group to discuss specific issues or products could appeal to some consumers. Read more Snapchat avoids influencer marketing—Instagram is littered with celebrities boasting high follower counts who take money to share pics and videos they’ve been paid to share in order to shill products. You won’t find much of that on Snapchat, though, which won’t let celebrities (or anyone else) see how many followers they have, opting to treat celebrities like every other user. Its terms of service prohibit anyone from sharing snaps they’ve been paid for, so paid influencer marketing is absent from the platform. The takeaway: The authentic experience on Snapchat is how its parent company, Snap, can charge as much as $700,000 for some kinds of ads. Whether the inability of celebrities and influencers to build large followings will ultimately help or hurt Snapchat is a gamble on the company’s part, though. Read more Marketers can take advantage of Instagram “Saved Posts”—Users can now bookmark Instagram images and videos. It only took a few hours following the introduction of “Saved Posts” for Audi to turn the feature into a game. The company shared nine random pieces of a picture of one of its cars and invited users to bookmark them in the correct order to display the full photo. More than 3,200 people had solved the puzzle by the time Digiday published a story about it. Beyond these clever kinds of hacks, the bookmarking feature has implications when combined with other Instagram features, like links in Instagram stories and shoppable photo tags, both of which customers can save to interact with later. The takeaway: It’s not mentioned anywhere in the article, but bookmarks make Instagram more competitive with Pinterest. My daughter planned her wedding on Pinterest and, as the article notes, it’s now easy to do the same on Instagram.

But 2016 also had plenty of, er, high points. Marijuana producers left other stocks in a cloud of smoke, and miners unearthed some big gains after years of losses. But you didn’t have to be an expert stock picker to win big in 2016. Putting all of your money into an index – whether it was the S&P/TSX composite or the Dow Jones industrial average – would have worked out just fine. As easy as it was to make money, however, there were still plenty of ways to screw up, as the Stars and Dogs of 2016 reveal. Stars 🌟 Teck Resources (TECK.B-T) A year ago, if you’d told people you were planning to invest in struggling Teck Resources, they would have laughed at you. Then they would have called up their friends to laugh at you some more. Well, who’s laughing now? In one of the greatest comebacks for a Canadian stock since, well, since Teck Resources pulled off a similar feat in 2009, the diversified miner made yet another miraculous recovery in 2016 when it was the top-performing stock year-to-date on the S&P/TSX composite index. Lifted by rebounding prices for metallurgical coal – the kind used in steel-making – Teck’s beaten-down shares soared nearly tenfold from their January low of $3.65 to their November high of $35.67 before giving back some of those gains. Coal doesn’t get all the credit; cost-cutting, debt reduction and improving prices for copper and zinc also gave the shares a lift. Investors are laughing … all the way to the bank. – John Heinzl 🌟 Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA-I) The real reason U.S. stocks surged to record highs this year? The Clinton Foundation secretly funnelled money from the Saudi royal family into a Swiss bank account controlled by billionaire George Soros, who then hired employees of a pizza restaurant in Washington to execute a series of trades to deliberately drive up the prices of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and other Dow stocks. It’s so obvious, people! For those who aren’t swayed by conspiracy theories, there may be a simpler explanation: The U.S. economy is in good shape, corporate profits are recovering and president-elect Donald Trump is vowing to cut corporate taxes, deregulate industries and invest billions to rebuild infrastructure. Sure, his plan would add to the U.S. government’s already massive debt and probably take years to stimulate growth. But when Wall Street wants to party, nothing can stop it – except maybe a Chinese-led plot to unleash North Korean short sellers on the U.S. market in early 2017. You heard it here first. – JH 🌟 Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index An impeached president. The worst recession since the 1930s. A summer Olympics plagued by street crime, pollution and a diving pool that had to be closed after it turned a mysterious shade of green. These are not the sorts of conditions one normally associates with a healthy stock market, yet none of them stopped investors from diving back into Brazilian equities in a big way this year. Enticed by rebounding commodity prices, cheap valuations and hopes that Brazil’s economy – and its political problems – couldn’t possibly get any worse, capital poured back into South America’s largest and most populous country and sent Brazil’s main stock index to its highest levels since 2012. All of which proved the old investing adage that the best time to take the plunge into stocks is when the water looks the least inviting. – JH 🌟 Sleep Country (ZZZ-T) Money-saving tip: When you’re shopping at Sleep Country, lie down on a mattress and pretend to fall asleep. When the salesperson gives you a nudge, “fall” onto the floor as if you are hurt and yell: “Are you going to give me a 50-per-cent discount or do I have to call a personal injury lawyer?” Works every time. If you’d bought Sleep Country’s stock earlier this year, on the other hand, you could afford to pay full price. Shares of the mattress retailer surged as revenues and earnings rose, driven by new store openings, growing sales of pillows, linens and other accessories and – of course – the chain’s ubiquitous advertising (sing it with me: “Sleep Country Canada, why buy a mattress anywhere else?” Now good luck getting the stupid song out of your head for the rest of the day). With the third quarter marking the 13th consecutive period of higher same-store sales and Sleep Country continuing to expand, shareholders are sleeping like babies – rich babies. – JH 🌟 Nvidia (NVDA-Q) N-what-ia? Nvidia may not be a household name like its competitor Intel, but if you play video games, own a smartphone or drive a car with an on-screen navigation or entertainment system, chances are you’ve used one of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs). The top gainer on the S&P 500 by a wide margin this year, Nvidia owes much of its recent success to a new generation of “Pascal” chips that are taking aim at virtual reality games, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and other applications requiring massive processing power. “Our new Pascal GPUs are fully ramped and enjoying great success in gaming, VR, self-driving cars and datacentre AI computing,” CEO Jen-Hsung Huang said after Nvidia’s third-quarter results crushed estimates – again. With Nvidia’s stock hitting record highs all year, there was nothing artificial about the intelligence of investors who saw Nvidia’s massive potential. – JH 🌟 S&P/TSX composite index (TSX-I) Prior to 2016, relative stock market performance offered up plenty to nourish a Canadian inferiority complex. For five calendar years straight, the S&P 500 index had outperformed the S&P/TSX composite index. In 2013, when the Canadian index rose by a respectable 10 per cent, the U.S. counterpart notched a 30-per-cent gain. In 2015, when U.S. stocks declined slightly, Canadian stocks fully corrected. The losing streak finally ended in 2016, and all it took was for the price of oil to double. But the year certainly didn’t start out promising. The ongoing collapse in commodity prices had ravaged the resource-heavy Canadian stock market, while China’s economic slowdown had stifled risk appetite. But an abrupt reversal in commodity markets sent Canadian stocks on a fairly steady upward trajectory beginning in January, and by the end of the year, the index was closing in on its all-time high of 15,657. That performance was good enough to claim the top spot among all developed markets’ major indexes. But far more importantly, we finally beat the Americans. – Tim Shufelt 🌟 Encana (ECA-T) Once Canada’s largest company by market capitalization, Encana spent the following several years steadily destroying its own value. From a pre-financial crisis peak in excess of $50 per share, the company’s stock over time declined by 95 per cent to hit an all-time low of $3 in February at the depths of the oil crash. The stock was a victim of global forces exacerbated by some extraordinarily bad timing. With the industry decimated by the financial crisis, the company decided to spin off its oil assets and focus on natural gas. Then oil prices promptly rallied while gas prices tanked. Encana eventually pivoted back into oil assets just in time for the worst crude oil crash in a generation. On the bright side, that long grind downward made for all the more potential upside upon the recovery in oil prices. Since hitting bottom, the stock has more than quadrupled, and occupies the sixth spot among the best stocks in the S&P/TSX composite index this year. – TS 🌟 TMX Group (X-T) It serves to show how much the Canadian stock market is dominated by resources that the top-performing non-resource stock is itself partly fuelled by the resource rally. Last year at this time, shares of TMX Group, which owns the Toronto Stock Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange, were bearing the effects of the commodity rout through low trading volumes. Then Nasdaq announced its entry into the Canadian market, causing shares in TMX to end 2015 under considerable selling pressure. But the emerging competitive challenges, including the alternative trading platforms introduced by Aequitas Innovations Inc. last year, have yet to pose a mortal threat to TMX’s dominance. Combine that with the resource rally, and continuing cost-cutting, and the year was set up for a significant upswing. Then in November, TMX released third-quarter profits that beat estimates while announcing a dividend increase – the magic words for Canadian investors. That provided the last leg up in what proved to be more than a doubling of its share price. – TS 🌟 Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC-T) Buy one measly pot stock and pretty soon you could have yourself a nasty habit. Say you bought a small stake in Canopy at the end of last year. By November it would have swelled sixfold, crowding out the duller parts of your portfolio – stocks your parents kept telling you to own, like utilities. They were a drag anyway. Then you buy another pot stock, and another. It’s all very innocent at the start. Maybe you start spending a little more on video game and snack stocks than usual. Suddenly, you can’t focus at work so well, all you can think about is Canopy’s stock chart, checking in on it four, five times a day. Then one night you find yourself in a dank alley, buying a gun stock from a twitchy guy who says you need to diversify. This happened to a friend of mine. – TS 🌟 Caterpillar (CAT-N) It took all of one day for investors to go from dreading the idea of Donald Trump occupying the White House to humming Hail to the Chief while frantically buying into his agenda. Aside from financials, there is perhaps no greater example of the sudden faith the market has in the Donald’s economic platform than in Caterpillar’s shares. On day one after the Nov. 8 election, its stock rose by 8 per cent. Within one month, it was up by 15 per cent. To be fair, investors had been bidding on a recovery in heavy equipment well before the election, pushing the stock on a general upward trajectory through the year. But the promise of tax cuts, regulatory reform and a vast infrastructure spending program unleashed the bulls, who lifted Caterpillar to a two-year high. In early December, the company itself attempted to manage expectations, calling analysts’ estimates for earnings growth “too optimistic.” Investors responded by pushing up the stock a little more. – TS Dogs 🐶 Valeant (VRX-T) Side effects of investing in Valeant Pharmaceuticals may include, but are not limited to, staggering financial losses, delayed financial statements, regulatory investigations, repeated guidance reductions, screaming, crying, throwing chairs across the room and generally feeling a pervasive sense of hopelessness and despair. Even as Valeant replaced its CEO and moved to pay down debt and restructure its operations, the stock – once the most valuable on the TSX – kept falling, as did shares of another debt-bloated, growth-by-acquisition Canadian drug maker, Concordia International. As Morgan Stanley’s David Risinger, one of the few analysts who had still been recommending Valeant, said in December when he cut the stock to the equivalent of a “hold” rating and slashed his price target: “Our investment thesis that management would stabilize the business and execute accelerated deleveraging via divestitures has been wrong.” You don’t say. – John Heinzl 🐶 First Solar (FSLR-Q) There’s a lot to like about solar power: It’s renewable, affordable and better for the planet than burning fossil fuels. Unfortunately for First Solar shareholders, those virtues don’t guarantee that investors will make money. Hurt by plunging prices for solar panels – with cheap Chinese imports the main culprit – the Arizona-based company announced plans to accelerate development of more efficient models to help it compete. The move will lead to layoffs for about one-quarter of its employees, a pretax restructuring charge of $500-million to $700-million (U.S.) and a net loss of $2 to $4 a share in 2016. The largest U.S. solar-equipment maker – it also designs utility-scale power plants – First Solar lost more than half of its value from March to November before recovering some ground in December. Even with the rebound, however, investors are still nursing a nasty sunburn. – JH 🐶 Nike (NKE-N) Like a sports dynasty that seemingly could do no wrong, Nike came into 2016 with a seven-year stock market-winning streak under its belt. Posting percentage returns well into the double digits for most of those years, the shares seemed as unstoppable as LeBron James going in for a layup. Well, even King James misses once in a while. Faced with growing competition from Adidas – whose casual athletic styles are appealing to a growing number of consumers – and from upstart apparel-maker Under Armour, Nike’s already wobbly stock blew out a knee in the fall when future orders missed expectations. If you’d predicted that Nike would be the worst performer on the Dow Jones industrial average in 2016, people would have thought you were nuts. But that’s the thing about sports dynasties – they all come to an end eventually. – JH 🐶 DH Corp. (DH-T) Back when it was called Davis + Henderson, the company now known simply as DH was famous for two things: printing cheques and paying dividends. Unfortunately for investors, it’s run into problems with both. Having spent the past several years diversifying into financial-technology solutions for things like lending and payments processing, DH’s stock posted double-digit annual returns from 2012 through 2014, only to see the gains almost totally evaporate over the following two years as its cheque-printing business declined faster than expected and banks slowed purchases of new technology. When DH’s third-quarter earnings came in well below analyst estimates in October, the shares plunged 43 per cent in a single day. A few weeks later – in a move that should not have surprised anyone – DH slashed its quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share from 32 cents – a drop of 62.5 per cent. Well, it was fun while it lasted. – JH 🐶 British Pound The Brexit vote may have faded from the headlines – overtaken by an even more shocking vote across the Atlantic Ocean – but if Britain’s reeling currency is any indication, the fallout from its decision to leave the European Union may just be getting started. Defying predictions by some that the pound would recover after the initial Brexit shock wore off, the currency instead kept falling. By mid-December it had plunged all the way to $1.24 (U.S.), down nearly 17 per cent from $1.49 immediately before the June 23 referendum sent the currency into spasms. With Prime Minister Theresa May taking a hard line on immigration, investors are worried that trade may fall down the list of priorities when the details of Brexit are ultimately hammered out, potentially making it more difficult for British banks and other firms to do business in the EU. That fear is being reflected in a British pound that keeps on getting, well, pounded. – JH 🐶 BlackBerry (BB-T) BlackBerry has been an easy and frequent target over the years for short sellers and this column alike. In the years since BlackBerry shares peaked in mid-2008, the stock has been named as a dog in these pages no fewer than three-dozen times. This instalment is no exception. The problem this time around was largely one of timing. BlackBerry’s stock ended 2015 on a 60-per-cent run in the calendar year’s final quarter after introducing its latest handset. The company followed that with financial results that beat expectations on software and services revenue, setting up a difficult starting point for the stock in 2016. That brought out the shorts, which soon amounted to nearly 20 per cent of the company’s float. The short-lived rally ended up paying off for short positions – a refrain far too common for investors on the other side of the BlackBerry trade. Uncertainty surrounding growth in its software business – on which the company’s foreseeable future is almost exclusively riding – quickly snuffed out the rally, relegating the stock price to single digits for most of the year. – Tim Shufelt 🐶 TripAdvisor (TRIP-Q) Fall came early for TripAdvisor shares this year. As 2016 got under way, a global equity sell-off consumed investors over concerns for slowing global growth. Travel stocks, being particularly sensitive to global macroeconomic changes, were hit hard. TripAdvisor, and its contemporaries Priceline and Expedia, were all traded down in the order of 25 to 35 per cent in the first five weeks of the year. As the market frenzy fizzled out and major indexes bottomed, TripAdvisor’s competitor stocks rallied. TripAdvisor did not. It started out vulnerable because of a relatively high valuation. Then it disappointed on earnings. Even as online travel spending rose, TripAdvisor lost share to competing alternatives. The fierce competition saw TripAdvisor’s marketing costs soar even as profits from hotel bookings declined. – TS 🐶 Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG-N) Owning Chipotle shares this year was just as likely to produce a disquieting feeling in the pit of the stomach as scarfing down a large pulled-beef burrito. Since an outbreak of food-borne illnesses tied to lapses in food safety sickened more than 500 of the chain’s diners in 2015, Chipotle has made little headway in repairing its reputation. From its peak, the oncetrendy stock has declined by nearly 50 per cent, wiping away about $11-billion (U.S.) in market capitalization. An overhaul of food-safety measures, food giveaways and discounts, and a share-buyback program well in excess of $1-billion have all failed to reverse the losses in restaurant traffic or revive the company’s stock. In a kind of union of struggling brands, Bill Ackman, the activist investor fresh off a string of losing bets in Herbalife and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, announced a 10-per-cent stake in Chipotle in September. Badly in need of a big win himself, Mr. Ackman’s quest to rescue the burrito chain has yet to find any favour in the market. – TS 🐶 Mexican Peso Has anyone checked out the peso since Donald Trump won in the biggest election landslide ever in the history of elections? Way down, big trouble, dead! Total loser currency! Sad! Considering how much Mr. Trump targeted Mexico throughout the election campaign, the peso became a proxy for the expected outcome of the election. In two of the three presidential debates, following what were widely considered to be Hillary Clinton wins, the peso responded the day after with big upward moves. Having an incoming president promise to install a vast border wall at your expense and rip up the continent’s free-trade deal might be slightly negative for Mexico and its currency, according to the market. Going into election night, the peso, like most other markets, was priced for a Clinton victory. As the opposite result dawned on the markets, the Mexican currency buckled in response to its new reality, falling to a new all-time low against the U.S. dollar in the days after the vote. – TS 🐶 FTSE Milano Italia Borsa The ghosts of the European debt crisis awoke in Italy this year, as the financial system of the most indebted euro zone country not named Greece came under renewed scrutiny. Stress tests on European banks last summer identified Monte dei Paschi di Siena – the world’s oldest bank – in danger of collapsing. By early July, the Italian banks index was down by nearly 60 per cent, dragging the main Italian stock index into a 30-per-cent sell-off over the first half of the year. The fragility of the Italian financial system could even pose a threat to the recovery of the euro zone. Over the past month, talks of a rescue package for Italian banks have mitigated the worst of the equity losses, but that still wasn’t enough to save the index from dog territory, in a year when most of the developed world realized decent equity gains. – TS Report Typo/Error Next story | Learn More Discover content from The Globe and Mail that you might otherwise not have come across.

Come January, it's going to be a lot harder for Millard high school students to say, "The dog ate my homework." A lot of their homework will be inside a laptop. All high school students in Millard Public Schools will be issued laptop computers when they return from winter break. The Omaha World-Herald (http://bit.ly/2hK2wZd ) reports Nebraska's third-largest school district will join the growing list of districts implementing one-to-one computer programs. One-to-one means putting a single, district-owned computer in the hands of each student rather than having them share classroom computers or visit computer labs. In January, district officials will distribute nearly 8,000 laptops to students and some teachers in grades 9 through 12 at Millard North, South and West and the alternative school, Horizon High. The plan is to eventually put about 5,500 devices in the middle schools too, phasing in those machines by August 2018. Millard officials said the timing was right for the launch, with the cost of devices, bandwidth and online curriculum materials coming down. Paper textbook costs are going up, and their content is fixed, said Ken Fossen, Millard's associate superintendent for general affairs. Meantime, technology is getting cheaper, and it's flexible, he said. "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where the future is," Fossen said. The rollout comes as computer use in schools continues to be a controversial topic. Criticism abounds about kids spending too much time in front of screens. Some teachers complain that computers have reduced kids' attention spans and, ultimately, their ability to think. Some research suggests that computers in school have little to no effect on achievement. Other studies indicate that, when done right, such technology can have a positive effect. Some say computers cannot replace good teaching but they can enhance it. Millard officials said they are taking care to make sure the computers will be used wisely and not overused. "This is intentional use for a purpose," said Heather Phipps, the district's associate superintendent for educational services. "I'm not surfing Facebook. I'm not looking at Vines. I'm not on Snapchat." Officials said a big reason they chose one-to-one is that the annual costs are about the same as the district pays now for technology in its high schools and middle schools. "When we fully ramp this up, six through 12, we'll be spending about a million dollars a year," he said. Middle school students will keep the same computer through eighth grade. High school students will keep them through graduation. Once the system is up and running, the district will have to buy new computers for sixth and ninth grades every year. Millard officials said the popularity of Chromebooks and netbooks have driven down the price of computing devices. After trying out devices and getting input from students, the district chose the HP 360. It is a conventional Windows laptop with a solid-state hard drive, Intel processor and touch screen. At $327 apiece, including case and charger, the initial January rollout will cost about $2.6 million. The device is not a "Cadillac," said Kent Kingston, the district's executive director of technology. The laptop can fold into a tablet, a configuration many students find comfortable for reading and searching, he said. When it's time to write a paper, it converts to the laptop with a keyboard. District officials initially explored having students bring their own devices from home. But officials weren't eager to have students bring a dozen different devices to a classroom, with different specifications, capabilities and operating systems. "Instructionally, it is way better for them all to be using the same tool," Phipps said. "It would be like handing them four different math books and hoping that Page 17 is going to look the same for everybody. Of course it's not." Phipps said she has been using one of the HP 360s as her work computer. She said she wants to know exactly how various educational software works on it. "I want to know, as the instructional leader, what's the experience going to be like for kids," she said. If kids brought their own devices, the district would have needed "back-end" computer systems to ensure that each student was seeing the same things regardless of the device, Kingston said. "The amount of money that you start to spend on back-end systems becomes equal to or more than this," he said. The district also would have to set minimum standards for devices, below which the district couldn't guarantee each student would have the same experience, he said. "You create the 'scarlet letter' effect," he said. "Here are certain kids whose device doesn't meet the school spec." Kingston said people sometimes have the wrong impression that school computer systems can run like the wireless Internet at Starbucks: You just log on and start browsing. "But that doesn't mean great instructional things are happening," he said. The HP 360s will be loaded with G Suite for Education, Google's collection of education-focused applications. A key application is Google Classroom, used to keep classes organized. Teachers can use it to create, share and grade assignments. "Google Classroom is a great workflow manager for Google Drive, and assignments and calendars and message board," he said. "So that's where most of our staff will live with kids." The computers also will be loaded with Microsoft Office and Adobe, tools kids are likely to use in their careers. Students gave the HP 360 good marks in district pilots, he said. About a thousand of the devices are already in use in Millard schools. Some Millard South students used them in an early-college high school biology class this fall. Four freshman lab partners — Hayli Wheeler, Mikayla Brandl, Abbey Dyer and Emma Ricke — each had a laptop. For one assignment the teacher sent everyone the day's lab lesson on Google Classroom, with a link to a video of an instructor guiding them through the lab. Hayli said she likes the laptop to help organize her homework. She gives it a thumbs-up. It's better than shuffling paper. "I have my laptop on me all the time," she said. Paper homework is more likely to get ruined by a spill or by getting crunched in a backpack, she said. Students and parents must fill out a loan agreement. If they choose, they can enter into a cooperative loss agreement with the district to cover damages if the laptop is broken. Interest in one-to-one policies remains high among educators, despite a lack of consensus among researchers on their impact on achievement. More than half of U.S. K-12 students and teachers will have access this year to a school-issued personal computing device, according to a study by Futuresource Consulting reported by Ed Week, a periodical that focuses on U.S. education news and trends. For the 2016 to 2017 school year 104 Nebraska high schools report having one-to-one computer programs in ninth through 12th grades, according to the Nebraska Department of Education. Over 300 of the state's schools had one computer per student in at least one grade level. Although a lot of money has been invested in computers for education, the benefits are not clear. A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that despite considerable investments in computers, Internet connections and software for educational use, there is "little solid evidence" that greater computer use leads to better scores in mathematics and reading. Overall, data on computer use at school suggest limited use may be better than no use at all, but above-average use is associated with "significantly poorer results," the study found. Earlier this year, however, a study led by a Michigan State University researcher concluded that one-to-one computer policies, when done properly, can improve achievement and teach 21st-century skills. Researchers drew that conclusion after reviewing existing research. But they noted that a disproportionate amount of the research to date consists of small case studies in a handful of schools. And only a small number of studies have used reliable methods. At the Waldorf School of the Peninsula, featured in a 2010 New York Times story, the children of Silicon Valley parents are taught with a skeptical eye for computers. The school's website explains, "Exposing children to computer technology before they are ready (around seventh grade) can hamper their ability to fully develop strong bodies, healthy habits of discipline and self-control, fluency with creative and artistic expression and flexible and agile minds." Technological literacy — a crucial 21st century skill — can be mastered quickly, it said, when children reach adolescence and have the developmental maturity to know how, why and when to use technology as a tool. The website notes a 2012 study by Common Sense Media in which many teachers felt entertainment media — everything from TV to cellphones to online programming computer games — have hurt kids' academic skills. The biggest concern was attention span, but teachers also were concerned that students' writing skills were hurt. In October, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued new recommendations on children's media use. Noting that media have become "ubiquitous" in children's lives, the academy recommended that children ages 2 to 5 should spend only an hour a day on high-quality programs. For school-age children and adolescents, the academy calls for balancing media with other healthy behaviors. Kingston said he's wary of the pitfalls of too much computer time. "I'm an old social studies guy," he said. "We still want to sit in a Socratic circle and have a discussion. I still want kids to do that. I might actually say 'Close the laptops and shut it down.' " Phipps said that although each student will have a device, that doesn't mean students will be on that device in every class, all day, every lesson. "That doesn't instructionally make sense," she said. "When it's appropriate to be using a digital tool, you'll be using a digital tool. When it's appropriate to be having a conversation, you'll be having a conversation. When it's important to be working something on paper, you'll be working something on paper." To make for a smooth rollout, Millard officials have tried to think of all possible problems, including what happens when students turn them all on at the same time. To make sure the laptops were secure, officials invited students to try to hack them. The students discovered some vulnerabilities that needed fixing, Kingston said. Students will have a unique logon only good on that device. Filters will keep an eye out for inappropriate material — sexting, threatening behavior, bullying — even when the kids take them home, he said. If there's suspicion that a student's health or welfare is at risk, then school authorities will be alerted, he said. --- Information from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com An AP Member Exchange shared by the Omaha World-Herald.

Detected as BKDR_ALICE.A. the “Alice” malware is the leanest ATM threat of its type ever analyzed by Trend Micro, the firm’s senior threat researchers David Sancho and Numaan Huq claimed in a blog post. Probably in the wild since at least October 2014, it first checks to see if the ATM is running an Extensions for Financial Services XFS environment before beginning. Once the hacker enters a four-digit PIN based on the ATM’s terminal ID, it will bring up an operator panel displaying the various “cassettes” loaded with money inside the machine. The attacker can then empty each cassette at will. The four-digit code is apparently included to prevent individual groups of mules sharing the malware with each other and bypassing the rest of the cybercrime operation. “Several things stand out about Alice. It is extremely feature-lean and, unlike other ATM malware families we have dissected, it only includes the basic functionality required to successfully empty the money safe of the ATM,” wrote Sancho and Huq. “It only connects to the CurrencyDispenser1 peripheral and it never attempts to use the machine’s PIN pad. The logical conclusion is that the criminals behind Alice need to physically open the ATM and infect the machine via USB or CD-ROM, then connect a keyboard to the machine’s mainboard and operate the malware through it.” Although Alice uses a commercial off-the-shelf packer to make analysis and reverse engineering more difficult, as ATM malware goes mainstream it is expected that the black hats will develop custom packers and other obfuscation techniques. In related news, Positive Technologies is trumpeting research which led to the discovery of a zero day vulnerability in Intel Security’s Solidcore ATM product designed to protect Windows-based cash-points. Hackers could have used the bug to successfully target banks using customized malware, according to the vendor. “The core protection for ATMs has to be regular security audits, the creation of secure ATM configuration policies, combined with continuous monitoring for compliance with these requirements. Such monitoring would significantly increase ATM protection from attacks exploiting simple vulnerabilities - such as Kiosk mode bypass and the absence of BIOS passwords,” explained lead security evangelist, Alex Mathews. “For real-time detection of targeted attacks, the recommendation is to use security information and event management systems (SIEM) to detect suspicious activities or event sequences – such as the connection of any devices to an ATM, an unexpected reboot, the repeated depression of keys, or the execution of unauthorized commands.” Why Not Watch? 29 Jan 2015Sony Pictures Entertainment: The Fallout from 2014’s Biggest Breach 10 Mar 2016Out Think Mobile Malware - Learn How to Protect Your Mobile Devices 5 Mar 2015How to Build a Next-generation Security Programme 14 Jan 2016Securing Your Windows 10 Estate Related to This Story Cobalt Group Linked to ATM Jackpotting Across Europe London Authorities Nab Suspect in $2.6Mn ATM Heist Dairy Queen Dipped with Backoff Malware Breach Bugat Malware Adds GameOver Functionality Goofing off at Work Can Lead to Malware Infections and Data Breaches What’s Hot on Infosecurity Magazine?

TSMC has reportedly obtained 10nm chip orders from Apple, HiSilicon and MediaTek, with volume production set to kick off in the first quarter of 2017. Nevertheless, yield rates for TSMC’s 10nm process technology are not what the foundry expected, the sources said. TSMC is scheduled to start making Apple’s A10X chips for the next-generation iPad series slated for launch in March 2017. Unsatisfactory yields for the foundry’s 10nm process could disrupt the schedule, the sources indicated … Digitimes tends to publish absolutely everything it hears, so its reports always have to be taken with a sizeable pinch of salt. Even if the reports of lower-than-expected yields are accurate, there’s time to identify and resolve the problems prior to A10X production. In the worst of cases, it seems likely that TSMC might prioritize its highest-profile customer over other clients, so even continuing low yields may not impact iPad production. Then there are also other foundries, though Samsung would seem highly unlikely at this point. Apple has recently warmed up to Intel however.  The challenge of creating such densely-packed chips is, however, substantial. The same source reports that Samsung is also seeing low yields, promoting Qualcomm to grow less ambitious in its own plans, so the underlying claim – that yields are so far low – is a credible one. There have been multiple reports that Apple plans to rejig its iPad line-up in early 2017, introducing a new 10.5-inch(ish) machine specifically targeting the enterprise and education sectors. One suggestion is that the existing 9.7-inch line would continue but be pushed downmarket, while the 10.5-inch machine would be the Pro model – alongside the existing 12.9-inch one. A KGI report said that Apple will be sticking with its IPS LCD screens next year, OLED making it into only one iPhone model. 2018 iPads would then feature OLED displays, KGI says.

As can be guessed by its name, one its top attractions is its in-built LTE support. The Mi Notebook Air 4G will be sold in two variants measuring 12.5-inch and 13.3-inch. The two are priced at CNY 4699 (roughly Rs 46500) and CNY 6999 (approx Rs 69500), respectively. Both have been launched bundled with a free China Mobile offer which serves up 4GB of data on a monthly basis for a total of 48GB a year. The LTE-ready Mi Notebook Air is pretty similar to the older model which came out earlier this year. Other than the added connectivity option, another factor which sets it apart from its predecessor is the 13.3-inch version’s sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processor compared to the non-4G iteration’s Intel i5 CPU. Here’s a neat summary of the top specs of the Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air 4G: – Display: 12.5-inch/13.3-inch, 1080 x 1920 pixels – OS: Windows 10 – CPU: Intel Core m3 (12.5-inch), Intel Core i7 (13.3-inch) – Battery: 37Wh (12.5-inch), 40Wh (13.3-inch) – Storage: 128GB/256GB SSD, expandable – RAM: 4GB (12.5-inch), 8GB (13.3-inch) – Connectivity: 4G, Wi-Fiac, Bluetooth 4.1, HDMI, 2 x USB 3.0, USB Type-C Also Read: 4.6-inch Xiaomi Mi S with Snapdragon 821, 4GB RAM leaked Xiaomi claims the faster i7 processor offers a 10% improvement over the i5 one. The company’s also come out with a new Piston Fresh in-ear headphone. The accessories will set buyers back by just CNY 29 (approx Rs 300). We’ll keep you updated if the firm decides to bring its new products outside China anytime soon.

There might always be a time when you would want to run a Windows program on an Android platform, and that is not easily done. Apart from the still experimental Crossover app, enter the ExaGear emulator. We want to warn you right at the beginning, ExaGear is not perfect – it will probably not run modern Windows-based games on your Android device. But for apps like those in the Microsoft Office suite and other smaller apps like that, this might be your solution. Originally, you would just transfer over to your Windows laptop or desktop should the need arise to use a Windows program. ExaGear might be an option where you wouldn’t have to. People who have used game emulators will be familiar with the mechanics here. ExaGear will not come with any Windows software – you have to own the Windows installers (EXE or MSI) so you can use them on your device. On Android, you need to have a mouse and a keyboard installed – have fun figuring that out. And on a Chromebook – it will run only on an ARM-powered one and not on an Intel-powered x86 device, which means the only one, the ASUS Chromebook Flip. So the Windows apps you might use with this is hit or miss, you will have to try them out. And you will need to have the keyboard and mouse hardware on an Android device. If you have all that, the ExaGear app is not cheap to try – you will need to pay USD$30 just to see if you can use it. If that’s alright with you, get it at the download link below.

Bulent Kilic / AFP Anger in Turkey over ISIL video of soldiers burned alive December 24, 2016 Updated: December 24, 2016 12:38 AM Related Arab Gulf states should join Syria meeting with Russia, Turkey and Iran: Erdogan Turkey urges international air support for its assault on ISIL-held Syria town Five die in air strike on rebel town near Aleppo Killer of Russian envoy had provided security for Erdogan: report A new alliance emerges in Syria’s proxy war Topics: Syria Turkey ISIL Beirut // Turks reacted angrily on Friday after a video released by ISIL that purportedly shows two captured Turkish soldiers being burned alive, although there was no comment from the government. The 19-minute video posted on extremist websites shows two uniformed men being hauled from a cage before being bound and torched. Despite difficulty in accessing some sites, especially Twitter and Facebook, the video was widely discussed among internet users in Turkey, with one describing it as a "nightmare". The video was supposedly shot in the ISIL-declared "Aleppo Province" in northern Syria, where Turkish troops and Turkey-backed Syrian rebels are trying to recapture the town of Al Bab from the extremist group. Turkish air strikes on the town killed at least 88 civilians since Thursday, including 24 children, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday. The raids followed the deaths of 16 Turkish soldiers in ISIL attacks on Wednesday, the heaviest casualties suffered by Ankara’s forces in one day since its incursion into Syria in late August. According to the pro-government news agency Anadolu, Turkish police arrested 31 people suspected of links with ISIL on Friday and were hunting for 10 more. It was not clear if the arrests were linked to the video. Speaking in Turkish, the killer of the two soldiers in the video criticised Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and called for "destruction to be sowed" in Turkey. The two soldiers are first shown in a cage, chained back-to-back as two other armed men in ISIL garb stand outside. The soldiers are then forced to walk on all fours to an open field, still chained, and are then burned alive via a fire that starts at the end of their chains. The video was shared on Twitter by the SITE Intel Group, which monitors extremist social media. Turkish authorities blocked access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube immediately after the video became public. Access to social media websites was restored Friday morning, with noticeable slowing. Before being burned, the two victims gave their names in Turkish as Fethi Sahin, born in Konya in central Turkey and Sefter Tas, a 21-year-old serving in Kilis in the south-east. According to Turkish media, a soldier by the name of Sefter Tas was kidnapped by ISIL on September 1 last year, but Ankara never confirmed the capture. The Turkish army however did confirm last month it had lost contact with two of its troops in Syria and the ISIL-linked propaganda website Amaq had claimed they were captured by the extremists. * Agence France-Presse and Bloomberg Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Arab Gulf states should join Syria meeting with Russia, Turkey and Iran: Erdogan Turkey urges international air support for its assault on ISIL-held Syria town Five die in air strike on rebel town near Aleppo Killer of Russian envoy had provided security for Erdogan: report More Europe Family’s tears for Layan, ‘just a shy, innocent child’ murdered in Istanbul ISIL admits Istanbul New Year nightclub massacre I ‘acted dead’ to survive Istanbul nightclub rampage - video Survivors describe terror inside Istanbul nightclub MOST VIEWED World | All Family’s tears for Layan, ‘just a shy, innocent child’ murdered in Istanbul Escape from Aleppo: a reporter’s story of leaving the city he grew up in Saudis, Jordanians, Lebanese and Indians among victims of Istanbul attack Pakistani man exchanges daughter, 13, for a second wife Syria’s government makes gains near Damascus despite truce Beheaded prisoners among at least 60 killed in Brazil jail riot Snap!

It’s also important to note that I consider “tech” to include technology, science, and science fiction entertainment, as well – so those that have any items to add, please, by all means speak up. 1. Amazon Echo and Alexa A surprise success for Amazon over the past two years has been the Amazon Echo with the automated smart assistant Alexa. Over the past year we’ve seen an intense amount of 3rd-party brands integrating products and services with Alexa skills. Amazon’s Echo family has grown by several products, and there’s no end in sight for the expansion of this ecosystem. What’s good for the rest of the industry is the light Amazon has shined on AI, in the process. Sure, there’d been audio-based smart assistant tech before, but Amazon’s persistence with Alexa has spread the bug in a big way. Even Google is getting in on the AI for one’s Smart Home trend with their own Google Home platform. Alexa was granted the skill to summon a Tesla to drive to its driver autonomously, too. 2. Google Pixel Since Android was first acquired by Google, we’ve been waiting for a proper Google Phone. Here in the year 2016, Google launched the Pixel, a device like their developer-aimed Nexus smartphone line, but here aimed at consumers. Unlike the Nexus, Google’s Pixel is a headliner smartphone, made to take on the big guns like Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy S and Note. According to Kantar Insights, Pixel phones accounted for .5% of worldwide smartphone sales in the three months ending in October of 2016. This might not seem all that fantastic, but consider the fact that the Pixel was only revealed on the 4th of October and put in physical store locations (at Verizon) soon after. Less than a month and 1 in every 200 phones purchased around the world was a Google Pixel. 3. Live Video Live video became a much more widely used platform for people of all sorts. This was thanks in part to the sustained support of Facebook Live Video and YouTube launching live mobile streaming and live 360-degree video. Instagram also joined in on the trend by launching Live Video within their Stories feature. Having a Live Video or Streaming Video option on many different types of social networking apps democratizes the medium in a big way. In the recent past, sharing a memory with video required some measure of skill in recording, saving, editing, and uploading media captured with a camera. Now it’s only a matter of opening Facebook and tapping a couple of buttons to begin a live feed – particularly great for amateur newscasters in the field, recording events as they happen. 4. Nintendo Nintendo basically killed it this year. Not only did they launch their hottest-selling console in years with the NES Classic Edition, they launched several super-successful games, too. Nintendo’s Super Mario Run was downloaded 40-million times in four days – thats success by many measures. The company revealed the Nintendo Switch near the end of the year to some hearty applause. We won’t know how well it’ll sell until it actually goes on sale in 2017, but for now – things look promising. Nintendo is also one of three joint owners of the Pokemon franchise, which also had a monumental year. 5. Pokemon The Pokemon brand hasn’t really had a bad year since they started doing big business back in the late 1990s. Here in the year 2016, 20 years after the launch of the original Pokemon Red and Blue video games for Gameboy, Pokemon saw a big resurgence in popularity. This was due in a giant way to the mega-success of the mobile game Pokemon GO. Niantic was probably the biggest winner in the launch of Pokemon GO aside from The Pokemon Company – owners of the Pokemon brand. The launch of Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon further solidified the year 2016 as a landmark year for the Pokemon universe. See our early review of Pokemon GO called Pokemon GO is the best game EVER to see how this all started. 6. SpaceX and the Reusable Rockets The tech world wasn’t all about personal gadgets, social networking, and games this year. There was also a rocket landing. One of the most important moments in the history of space travel happened this year thanks to the CRS-8 SpaceX rocket and countless scientists and engineers involved. Above is a video showing the takeoff and landing of the CRS-8 that made history. This event took place in April of 2016 and changed the way we travel to (and back from) space forever. This was one of the most historic moments in recent space exploration history. 7. Autonomous (Self-Driving) Cars We started the year discussing the California DMV’s new automated automotive rules – partially self-driving, that is, so long as a driver was present. President Obama’s State of the Union called for the United States to become a haven for self-driving vehicles. This month Michigan became the first state to pass a fully self-driving car law. We saw – and got to ride in -concepts for autonomous cars from Kia and Hyundai, and plenty of other companies dolled out the concept car driver tests throughout the year. Apple’s long-rumored self-driving car program was spoken about by the company in a letter to the NHTSA – without any imagery or video or anything, but still – it’s real. Tesla made self-driving technology standard on all of its future-aimed vehicles. BMW, Intel, and Mobileeye formed an autonomous car super-group that aims to bring automated vehicles into “series production” by the year 2021. Lyft suggested that by 2021, the majority of Lyft rides will be in self-driving cars. Alphabet got extra-serious about its self-driving car aspirations by spinning out an entirely new company called Waymo. Autonomous, self-driving vehicles are coming. The year 2016 acted to solidify the conceptual nature of this future with announcements, brand collaborations, and real-life ride-along tests around the world. 8. Star Wars In early 2016 it became apparent that Star Wars: The Force Awakens was set to become one of the most successful movies ever released. Over the course of the year, the resurgence of Star Wars popularity was cultivated by Disney and Lucasfilm through initiatives like ILMxLAB. The group ILMxLAB released Star Wars experiences like “Trials on Tatooine” for the HTC Vive virtual reality headset and, more recently, the Rogue One X-Wing experience for YouTube VR and Android’s Daydream devices. Disney and Lucasfilm made another big push for Star Wars merchandising with the #GoRogue initiative, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was released in December of 2016. Rogue One had the second-biggest December film debut opening ever, just behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In other words: this Star Wars thing isn’t just a fad. Wrap-up Again, this list is not indicative of the popularity or scientifically-tracked success of any one item. The items on this list are also not in any particular order. The fact that there are 8 items should not be seen as indicative of a lack of awesome things to have happened over the course of the past 12 months – these 8 just made the most sense to me. Bookmark this article and look back upon it in a year to see how far we’ve come in the 12 months that begin in January. The year 2017 could be a real disaster for science and technology and a real eye-opener for the prophesies of the most notorious of science fiction stories. Or it could end up being really great. We’re crossing our fingers for the latter.

The video was released by news websites close to the Islamic State, and the two victims identify themselves as Turkish soldiers taken hostage. One of them had been reported kidnapped by the Islamic State in Syria last year, and had been held in a prison in Raqqa, according to local media. Advertisement Turkish officials didn’t immediately comment on the video or respond to requests seeking verification of its content. The state-run news agency Anadolu reported that 31 suspected Islamic State members were detained in raids in Istanbul on Friday. Another 10 suspected members of the group couldn’t be located, it said. The footage release comes amid a rising casualty count in Syria for Turkey, which has had 35 soldiers killed since the military started a cross-border operation in August.

Sign up for more newsletters here The latest footage marks the first killings of Turkish citizens in a propaganda video filmed by the Islamic State. The video was shared by SITE Intel Group on its Twitter account, which monitors jihadist social media. Turkish authorities blocked access to Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube immediately after the video became public. Access to social media websites was restored Friday morning, with noticeable slowing.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Mirai “internet of things” malware from Krebs DDoS attack goes open source 05 Oct 2016 10 Botnet, Malware Post navigation Previous: Me-OUCH! Facebook shuts accounts over image of cat wearing suit and tie Next: Unmasking Tor users with DNS by Paul Ducklin 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Last week, we wrote about a DDoS attack on well-known investigative cybercrime journalist Brian Krebs. To explain. A DDoS attack is an aggressive sort of DoS attack, where DoS is short for denial of service. A DoS is a bit like getting into the queue at the station to buy a ticket for the next train, only to have a time-waster squeeze in front of you and slow you down. By the time the miscreant has asked, innocently enough, about the different sorts of ticket available, and whether it costs extra to take a bicycle, and how much longer it would take if he were to change trains in Manchester, only to walk off without buying a ticket at all… …you’ve watched your train arrive, load up with passengers, and depart without you. A DDoS attack is worse: it’s short for distributed denial of service attack, and it’s much the same thing as a DoS, except that the trouble-stirrer doesn’t show up on his own. Instead, he brings along a big posse of innocent-looking accomplices to flood the whole station with time-wasters. Genuine customers who are mixed in with the trouble-makers end up waiting far longer than usual – a problem that usually gets more and more frustrating as the backlog grows. Sophos Home Destroy malware in your sleep Learn More In the attack on Krebs’s site the crooks were able to generate an astonishing combined total of over 600 gigabits per second of time-wasting network traffic. That’s equivalent to about 60,000 fast home networks all turning their entire bandwith onto Krebs at the same time, or a whopping 600,000 regular ADSL connections at once (assuming a one megabit per second upload speed). If we assume that even a voracious reader of Krebs’s articles would use at most 10% of a home ADSL connection’s bandwidth when browsing the site, then the cost of neutralising this level of attack is the same as supporting at least six million concurrent legitimate users. The perpetrators in the mega-DDoS haven’t been identified, but the attack happened not long after Krebs outed a DDoS-for-hire service called vDOS, leading to the arrest of two young hackers in Israel. (Sophos experts Chester Wisniewski and John Shier discuss this attack, and the story behind it, in this week’s Chet Chat security podcast. [Starts at 1’08”.]) LISTEN NOW (Audio player above not working? Download MP3, listen on Soundcloud or access via iTunes.) The reason we mentioned home networks above, by the way, is that’s exactly where this attack seems to have originated. Not from malicious bot or zombie software on regular computers, as might have been the case a few years ago, but from so-called Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as routers, web cameras and perhaps even printers. If you’re surprised to hear that, don’t be. Although a typical router or webcam has just a fraction of the computing power of your laptop, it’s more than capable of filling a typical home network with outbound traffic. (After all, your powerful new laptop relies on your router to handle all that outbound traffic, so if your laptop can fill up the network connection, that’s only possible because the router can fill it on your laptop’s behalf.) Sadly, in the aftermath of the assault on Krebs, the source code of the malware used in the attack was openly published. It’s been removed from the hacking forum on which it was originally outed, but it still widely available “for research purposes” to anyone willing to look. Mirai, as the malware is known, is badly programmed and unfinished, but that doesn’t matter. It works, and it’s effective primarily because of bad programming in the very IoT devices it uses to do its dirty work. The Mirai malware package The Mirai bot, called simply bot in the source code, is written in C, and has three main components: A call-home system that connects to a command-and-control server (which could be another insecure IoT device) to download details of whom to attack, and how. A set of attack routines that can generate a range of legitimate-looking but purposeless streams of network traffic to eat away at the victim’s network capacity. A network scanner that searches randomly across the internet and tries to login in various ways to build and report a list of insecure IoT devices for the next wave of attacks. The Mirai source code package also includes a command-and-control tool, called cnc, written in Go. Cross-platform support is one of Go’s strong points: the compiler directly supports seven different computer architecures, including the 32-bit and 64-bit Intel chips in most modern laptops and servers, and the AMD and MIPS chips common in price-sensitive home IoT devices. In other words, both the attack bot and the control server can be built to run on regular computers as well as many commonly-used hardware devices. There’s a list of just over 60 built-in usernames and passwords that the Mirai bot uses to scan for other vulnerable devices; by all accounts, even this modest password dictionary is enough to find hundreds of thousands of easily-owned devices at a time. How to steal 600 Gbit/sec As we suggested above, between 60,000 and 600,000 home networks connecting simultaneously is, indeed, enough for a monster-sized attack of 600 gigabits per second. We’re disappointed, but not at all surprised, to hear that malware like Mirai has things so easy. After all, when SophosLabs researchers recently looked into a strain of malware called Mal/Miner-C, they noticed that it was widely found on network attached storage (NAS) devices from a well-known vendor. In this research, SophosLabs quickly found 7000 NAS devices that were publicly writable via the internet, using the FTP protocol, with no password at all. Of these, 5000 (more than 70%) already contained a copy of the Mal/Miner-C malware, deliberately left behind by the crooks for future malware distribution campaigns. When investigating the Miner-C malware, our researchers focused their investigation carefully. They looked only at NAS devices, only for public FTP servers with no password, and only for the presence of Mal/Miner-C. Malware such as Mirai has no such scruples when it goes looking for vulnerable devices, which is why it can quickly find hundreds of thousands of devices to abuse. Following the attack on Krebs, and his fascinating reports on what happened, he wrote that: Many readers […] asked for more information about which devices and hardware makers were [targeted by Mirai]. As it happens, this is fairly easy to tell just from looking at the list of usernames and passwords included in the Mirai source code. As you can see directly from the list above, and from a few tries with your favourite search engine, Krebs is right. Some of the entries don’t even need a search engine: username/password pairs such as root/­realtek, root/­dreambox and ubnt/­ubnt speak for themselves. But even obscure-looking credentials such as root/­7ujMko0vizxv are easily traced. And that’s just the problem with hardwired “backdoor” passwords, as we’ve pointed out many times before. Security through obscurity lasts only until someone penetrates that obscurity and shares the necessary secret, after which anyone can search for it, and so everyone knows it. What to do? If you’re a device vendor, this list is for you: Don’t use hardwired passwords. Those “secret codes” that let your own support staff get in and fix problems cheaply for forgetful users are an injury to us all, because they also let crooks get in and create problems cheaply for everyone. Don’t set default passwords. At least, don’t have default passwords that exist after the device has been set up for use. After a firmware reset, or on first bootup, prevent the device going online at all until the user has connected up directly to it and chosen unique passwords. Don’t allow unauthenticated or unencrypted protocols for inbound connections. In particular, that means no Telnet (use SSH instead), no FTP (use SFTP instead) and no web administration via HTTP (use HTTPS instead), even for connections from the internal network. Don’t open administrative connections on the outside interface by default. Most users don’t need to login from the internet, so don’t open up their devices by default for crooks to have a crack at logging in remotely. Let users opt in to remote access, instead of expecting them to remember to opt out.

Follow him on Twitter: @duckblog 10 comments on “Mirai “internet of things” malware from Krebs DDoS attack goes open source” SubSurge says: October 5, 2016 at 6:19 pm Naked Security, in your stories the INsecure devices are often highlighted; could you point us to a list or database of IoT vendors who DO take security seriously, for those of us who like to play without becoming part of the botnet? Reply Paul Ducklin says: October 6, 2016 at 12:42 am That’s tricky, at least for now… …maybe we should start trying to collect things like “official security manifestos” from various vendors. One huge part of the problem is that the IoT world is a bit like Android: even if the OEM fixes a security problem, how long until that fix percolates through all the products in the ecosystem that use that OEM’s technology in one way or another? Reply Larry M says: October 5, 2016 at 7:32 pm There’s hope. My last few AT&T U-verse VDSL modems (by Motorola, Arris, and Pace) have had unique passwords. Why have I had so many? Lots of outside line problems here, but the silly AT&T protocol requires them to change the modem first. And then I have to go through an hour of re-defining my internal networks, wi-fi parameters, static IP addresses for printers, etc. Reply Bryan says: October 6, 2016 at 9:33 pm I’ve got my fingers crossed your next modem lets you save a config file (and that the following gear is still compatible with said upload). Reply Bob Stromberg says: October 6, 2016 at 1:57 pm A very useful article. What is a device owner — for example, a homeowner — to do? How do we detect the presence of malware on one or any of our IoT devices? It would be a start to be able to tell if our home network was a source of outbound DDoS traffic.

from its database. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. (EMAILWIRE.COM, December 23, 2016 ) A solid-state drive (SSD) is a kind of an electronic disk that is built out of silicon microchips and is used for data storage. It uses the same I/O interface design as hard disk drives and stores data in solid-state memory in the form of electric charge. It is made out of silicon microchips. Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and negated AND (NAND) are most commonly used storage components used in many devices. Semiconductor-based devices such as NAND have no mechanical or moving parts. This reduces the risk of failure and allows higher read and write speeds in SSDs. The number of applications of SSDs has also increased as they can withstand extreme shocks, consume less power, deliver high consistency, and can be integrated into devices that are used in harsh environments.

World 15:39, 24 December 2016 REUTERS Subu Kota, who pleaded guilty in 1996 to selling the material to an FBI agent posing as a Russian spy, is one of two board directors at the company, Boston-based Brainwave Science. During years of federal court proceedings, prosecutors presented evidence they said showed that between 1985 and 1990 Kota met repeatedly with a KGB agent and was part of a spy ring that made hundreds of thousands of dollars selling U.S. missile defense technology to Russian spies. Kota denied being part of a spy ring, reached a plea agreement in the biotech case and admitted to selling a sketch of a military helicopter to his co-defendant, who was later convicted of being a KGB operative, Bloomberg wrote. Flynn served more than three decades in the military and rose to become director of the Defense Intelligence Agency before he was fired by President Barack Obama in 2014 over policy disagreements. He formed a private consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, which has sought business with an array of cyber security firms and defense contractors. He began collaborating with Brainwave Science last spring.  Read alsoYahoo News: Amid 'arms race' kerfuffle, Trump releases friendly Putin letterFlynn, who has been widely criticized for close associations with Russia, has declined repeated requests during the past month to be interviewed about his company's business ties. A spokesman for the Trump transition team, Jason Miller, said in an email that Flynn has never met or spoken with Kota and that he has ended his association with Brainwave Science. In a phone interview on Thursday, Kota described his criminal charges and dealings with the KGB as misunderstandings. He acknowledged selling biotech material to a federal agent posing as a Russian spy, but said the incident was a patent dispute, not espionage.

FILE PHOTO | JOSEPH KANYI | NATION MEDIA GROUP  In Summary Here at home, the world famous phone-based money transfer service, M-Pesa, was launched in 2007 by Safaricom. The service has tens of millions of users in Kenya and Tanzania, where most of its clients are, and is growing experientially. Every so often, we learn of new countries that are adopting M-Pesa, including Afghanistan, South Africa, India and Romania. From the days of mainframe computers, information and communication technologies have become easy and natural for people to use. Ten years ago, to use a computer, one needed college level training. That is no longer the case. Advertisement By SAM WAMBUGU More by this Author In just a week, the world will welcome 2017 — a significant year in many ways on the technology front. It will mark a decade since most of the technology we enjoy today came to light. From Facebook, Airbnb, Kindle by Amazon, to M-Pesa, many tech toys and services were conceived a decade ago. Many of the leading tech companies emerged around 2007. These firms have changed our lives in many ways. A decade ago, Facebook, a social networking site initially confined to college students, was opened to anyone 13 years and above. It expanded rapidly to virtually all corners of the world. Ten years later, Facebook has one billion active users, almost the population of Africa. In 2007, micro-blogging site Twitter, which had been part of a broader start-up, took a different and independent turn, spreading its tentacles worldwide. Before then, twitter was simply a sound made by some birds. Now Twitter has about 317 million monthly active users. In the same year, Amazon released Kindle, a device that enables users to download and read e-books; the same year Airbnb was conceived. Here at home, the world famous phone-based money transfer service, M-Pesa, was launched in 2007 by Safaricom. The service has tens of millions of users in Kenya and Tanzania, where most of its clients are, and is growing experientially. Every so often, we learn of new countries that are adopting M-Pesa, including Afghanistan, South Africa, India and Romania. From the days of mainframe computers, information and communication technologies have become easy and natural for people to use. Ten years ago, to use a computer, one needed college level training. That is no longer the case. A 10-year-old child with only a few hours of tinkering with a phone can teach the parents some fine features of the phone. It’s like children are these days born fully-loaded with tech skills. Computers have shrunk in size from mainframes to desktops, to laptops and now to smartphones and tablets. Their power improves every so often. Just days after you acquire a new piece of technology and think you have the latest version in town, you realise you are wrong. What can we expect in the next decade, starting in 2017? Can experiences from the past 10 years help us predict the direction technology will take? To answer this question, we need to refer to Moore’s Law. In 1965, Gordon Moore postulated that the speed and power of microchips — computational processing power — would double every year without increasing its cost. Moore’s Law is not a law in the sense of, say, Newton’s laws of motion. But Intel, which has for decades been the leading maker of microprocessors, and the rest of the industry, turned the prediction into a self-fulfilling prophecy. This law has held true for the past 50 years. Going by Moore’s Law, we can expect technology to expand even to the remotest parts of the country, providing farmers, fishermen, pastoralists and blue chip companies alike with technology to make lives better, cheaper and efficient. Broadband technology will expand and become cheaper, enabling more people, especially the youth, to go online and do business across counties and countries. Continuous education will be the norm as more and more skills become replaced by technology. The workforce will have to adapt quickly to changing technology, or shape out. Thankfully, there are many online resources to keep all of us up to speed. Happy holidays, everyone! Wambugu is an informatics specialist.

The Gigabyte AORUS Gaming-9 looks pretty but I'm a bit wary about that many uncovered LED lights. Whilst they look cool and all, if one blows out, it will be sorely noticeable. I'd buy that MSI M7 (M9 will probably come out sooner or later) but I already have a 5960x on an Asus Rampage V Edition 10 board (and I also have an original MSI Godlike Gaming, a Godlike Gaming Carbon, and an MSI Xpower X99). I really should stop collecting X99 boards... except every time I buy one, something else comes out which looks awesome, lol.     vdelvec View Public Profile Find all posts by vdelvec   (#6) PhazeDelta1 Moderator     Videocard: Evga 970 Processor: Intel i7 4790k Mainboard: Gigabyte Z97X-UD5H-BK Memory: 16GB Corsair 2133MHz Soundcard: Magni 2 Uber/Modi 2 Uber PSU: Seasonic X-850 12-26-2016, 04:02 | posts: 15,563 | Location: USA It'd be real nice for motherboard manufactures to start adding right angled psu connectors     PhazeDelta1 View Public Profile Find all posts by PhazeDelta1   (#7) Reddoguk Maha Guru     Videocard: Guru3d GTX 980 G1 Gaming Processor: i5-4690K Mainboard: Gigabyte GA-G1.Sniper Z97 Memory: Corsair Dominator 16GB Soundcard: Onboard Creative Sound PSU: XFX PRO 750W(Seasonic) 12-26-2016, 08:06 | posts: 1,247 | Location: In my house Those Gigabyte Gaming 9/8/7/K5 look sick.     Reddoguk View Public Profile Find all posts by Reddoguk   (#8) Andrew LB Master Guru     Videocard: PNY GTX 780 ti @ 1,143mhz Processor: i5-4670K @ 4.4ghz Mainboard: Asrock z87 Extreme4 Memory: 16gb Corsair Vengence Soundcard: X-Fi Titanium HD PSU: Corsair HX-850 12-26-2016, 21:52 | posts: 695 | Location: Peoples Republic of Kalifornia Those Aorus boards are butt-ugly.

The video was released by news websites close to IS, and the two victims identify themselves as Turkish soldiers taken hostage. One of them had been reported kidnapped by Islamic State in Syria last year, and had been held in a prison in Raqqa, according to local media reports. Three Turkish soldiers were believed to be in the hands of Islamic State, though any information regarding their fate requires confirmation, Turkey’s Defense Minister Fikri Isik said Friday, according to state-run Anadolu Agency. “We have information that 3 of our soldiers are held by Daesh so far. Yes, we are evaluating that 3 of our soldiers are in the hands of Daesh,” Isik said. “However, any comments beyond that are not confirmed information. We say these information should not be respected without confirmation.” Turkish troops and opposition forces from Free Syrian Army have captured a strategic hill from Islamic State overlooking the northern Syrian town of al-Bab, Isik said. Earlier, Anadolu reported that 31 suspected Islamic State members were detained in raids in Istanbul on Friday. Another 10 suspected members of the group couldn’t be located, it said. The release of the footage comes amid a rising casualty count in Syria for Turkey, which has had 35 soldiers killed since the military started a cross-border operation in August. The country is at war with militants on multiple fronts, fighting separatist Kurdish groups and Islamic State in Syria and facing attacks in its major cities and rural areas since last year. Turkey, U.S., Russia The latest footage marks the first killings of Turkish citizens in a propaganda video filmed by Islamic State. The 19-minute production opens with an Arabic narrator talking over shots of soldiers walking past a podium flanked by Turkish and U.S. flags.

The two Turkish soldiers are first shown standing in uniform in a cage, chained back-to-back as two other armed men in Islamic State garb stand outside. The soldiers are then forced to walk on all fours to an open field, still chained, and are then burned alive via a fire that starts at the end of their chains.

The video was released by news websites close to IS, and the two victims identify themselves as Turkish soldiers taken hostage. One of them had been reported kidnapped by Islamic State in Syria last year, and had been held in a prison in Raqqa, according to local media reports. Turkish officials didn’t immediately comment on the video or respond to requests seeking verification of its content.

Companies cut hiring costs since referral hires take less time, start the job quicker, and stay at companies longer. The referral hires themselves report higher levels of satisfaction. And the original employee who did the referring often gets a nice cash bonus and a new work friend.  It's a nice, closed-loop system that works out well for everyone—that is, unless you don't have the right network to get the job. Referral hiring isn't great for diversity. "Referral networks can lead to lesser diversity or—to put it another way—exacerbate between-group inequality," said Ian Schmutte, an economics professor at the University of Georgia. "It's very clear that people who get referrals tend to get referrals of the same race, gender, ethnic group, or national origin." Schmutte's research has found that people tend to look to their social circles for referral hiring. Those groups are often made up of similar people, a phenomenon known as homophily. Using a data set from Boston that matches individuals to both their home and work locations, Schmutte found that a pair of workers living in the same block are three times more likely to work at the same company than a pair of workers living in the same neighborhood. These effects are stronger for workers of the same race and the same gender.  It's not just a matter of valuing diversity for its own sake. Companies with more diverse workforces tend to perform better. A McKinsey report from 2015 found that among 366 companies, those with gender diversity outperform those without it by 15 percent; those with ethnic diversity outperform those without it by 35 percent. For every 10 percent increase in racial and ethnic diversity on the senior executive team at a U.S. company, earnings before interest and taxes rise 0.8 percent, the report found. As a result of findings like these, organizations spend millions of dollars on inclusion programs, which largely don't work. For all the talk of diversity, companies love referral programs, which are, perhaps unwittingly, hurting their chances of diversifying workplaces. John Sullivan, a professor of management at San Francisco State University and an expert in human-resources strategy, has called referrals a "powerful" way to build a competitive workforce. It's cheap and leads to better hires. What better way to market a company than through an enthusiastic review of a current employee?  But many of the companies that rely most on employee referrals for hiring also have alleged commitments to diversity that they fail to meet. Palantir got in trouble with the federal Labor Department for relying too heavily on referral hiring, which has led to a homogenization of its workforce. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all landed on a recent Glassdoor list of the top 30 companies that use referrals for hiring and have had a hard time hiring non-white and non-Asian male workers. Google, for example, pledged just under $1 million to a nonprofit group that teaches technical skills to black and Latino college students. Facebook, in an attempt to move its numbers, altered the recruiting process to incentivize hiring for diversity; recruiters would get more points for diversity hires, which lead to better performances reviews, bonuses, and raises. These efforts haven't worked. Only 4 percent of Facebook's U.S. employees are Hispanic and 2 percent are black, as of summer 2016—and those numbers haven't moved in two years. Google's staff is now 69 percent male, down from 70 percent male a year ago, according to its own diversity report.  Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email.

You will now receive the Pursuits newsletter Even if standard referral programs risk reinforcing workplace demographics, there might be a way to turn employee recommendations into engines of diversity. Accenture and Intel, which also have predominantly male and white workforces, started dangling bigger bonuses for diversity hires made through referral programs. Pinterest saw a large increase in diverse candidates when it ran a similar program over a six week period last year.  Getting rid of referrals altogether isn't the answer. "Social interactions provide information that is useful to firms that are trying to screen workers for jobs where the skill set is not that obvious or easy. You want to know: Is somebody going to show up to work? Are they going to be a good worker?" Schmutte said. "But because they operate along lines of race or ethnicity, they might still block people off from certain types of jobs."  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
