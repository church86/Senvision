Raju added that Democrats “actually have the power” to subpoena Trump under committee rules despite being in the minority. But such a move could throw a wrench into the committee's bipartisan investigation into Russia's meddling in the election. And the White House would likely employ protections to keep Trump's tax returns under wraps, CNN reported. ADVERTISEMENT Raju said that Sen.

Trump has said that he has not done business in Russia. Democrats have repeatedly tried unearthing Trump's tax returns, with the latest attempt happening Wednesday, as part of an effort to force Republicans to take tough votes on the record. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) offered an amendment during the Ways and Means Committee’s markup of legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare that evening.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 9, 2017 2:12 PM PT Credit: Qualcomm More like this Intel will change its approach to PC chip upgrades Three technologies that could demolish slow internet Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Intel surprised many observers when the company hired outsider Venkata Renduchintala to lead the company's PC, Internet of Things, and Systems Architecture groups. With more than a year under his belt, he's spearheading a cultural change inside the company, getting employees to think beyond PCs and talk about technologies like 5G and IoT. There's been a lot of chatter about changes in the company's chip development strategy, with the recent announcement of the 8th Generation Core processors, an unprecedented fourth chip architecture on the 14-nanometer process. The chip industry veteran sat down with the IDG News Service at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to talk about what spurred the move and also his thoughts on 5G. IDG News Service: How is 5G development going? Renduchintala: I'm noticing there are a hell of a lot more people interested in 5G. The interest in anything that happened before -- whether you're an industrial conglomerate, a car company, a transportation company -- you are now talking about much more interest in 5G than ever before. It's the whole age of everything coming down to data. There are so many colliding identities that get aggregated under the banner of 5G. For example, IoT is now becoming inextricably linked with the passage of 5G. IDG News Service: 5G will be across a wide range of devices. What can users expect? Renduchintala: You'll have network operators becoming more like a cable operator where you can basically get your phone, internet, and TV all in one contract. An autonomous car, all of your cell phones, your tablets, your media consumption, and even the automation and control of your house via an IoT network, is all going to be in one bill. It's going to be different types of networks all generating different types of traffic but ultimately concatenating into one of all integrated services. A network operator is going to basically say: I deliver media, I deliver services, I deliver mobile broadband communications, and it may be delivered over two or three different network architectures that all work together. IDG News Service: What's happening to the 5G network? Renduchintala: What's happening in the network, although it may be more esoteric to explain, is actually just as profound. A network that used to be custom pieces of silicon -- that used to be hand-stitched together to give you performance optimization and load balancing -- is now collapsing down to a reconfigurable entity that used to live in the data center [and is] now being shoved into the network. It's general purpose computing, general purpose data distribution, reconfigurable memory and programming logic, all of which can be reconstituted by the upgrade of a binary in terms of the function. IDG News Service: Do the cloud providers understand the implications of 5G? Renduchintala: It's difficult to actually see. It's only when you really stand back and look at the totality of what's changing you'll actually understand how profound it is. They're no longer going to say, I build five or six mega data centers and stuff. Let's say, for example, Google wants to build out a network that is supporting self-driving cars. I don't think its network architecture is going to look anything that it looks like today, where its main service is essentially providing things like Google Drive and offsite data storage and retrieval. It could be a completely different architecture. IDG News Service: You are developing modems a lot quicker. Why is that? Renduchintala: The cadence is not set by Intel. The cadence is set by the market. You're going to have to have an upgrade of a modem every year. There's a big transition coming along probably in around the late 2018/2019 timeframe where instead of incrementally evolving LTE, you are going to flip to your first multimode LTE/5G. And then you get to this big disruption and then get a big stride in incremental improvement thereon. And then over time, it becomes less and less discernable to the end user. To me, this is like the classic period of a modem upgrade followed by a rapid improvement on the very first generation device and then the ability to get more and more improvement becomes diminishing returns over time. IDG News Service: With 5G supposedly around the corner, how valuable is gigabit LTE? Renduchintala: There's nothing innovative in gigabit LTE -- all you are doing is, instead of aggregating two carriers, I'm aggregating four carriers over a wider bandwidth. That means bigger memory, bigger chipsets, more power -- there's nothing technically mind-blowing. It's just arithmetic extension -- if I want to get a gigabit per second, I have five carrier aggregation across 100 megabits of contiguous bandwidth and therefore I get more data. With LTE, you're really getting to a point where we have to basically go towards both spectrum efficiency gains as well as better data resiliency and service security. That's going to be truly profound. IDG News Service: At Intel's recent analyst conference, you mentioned 8th Generation Core chips coming out on the 14-nm process, while Cannonlake is around the corner. Why the change in chip development plans? Renduchintala: What we're moving towards is a model where people can expect from Intel a yearly cadence of platform upgrade that actually gives meaningful performance improvements in the generation that preceded it. For example, Skylake to Kaby Lake was about 15 percent in overall system performance improvement. What we said is we will deliver at least 15 percent improvement from 7th Generation to 8th Generation. We're focusing on making sure we get meaningful performance upgrade on an annual cadence and to some degree, the process technology that lives underneath that is going to be less conspicuous. There will be a much more of a seamless transition from node to node. We can translate that into a more predictable cadence of product which delivers meaningful performance to stimulate PC upgrades. IDG News Service: Will Cannonlake be 8th generation or is it a different lineup? Renduchintala: I don't know yet. I think we're going to be more focused on generation by the amount of performance increment it will give us. I don't think that generations will be tagged just to node transitions. It will be tagged towards the fact that it needs to have meaningful performance [gains]. Whatever we launch in September of 2018 has to have at least as much improvement year over year as what happened between Kaby Lake and the 8th Generation. If Cannonlake comes out at the end of the year, it could be interesting what we actually market it as we haven't actually decided yet.

Flynn Intel Group, was lobbying for a Dutch consulting firm with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before and immediately after the US election. Documents filed with the Justice Department on Tuesday said the work 'could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.'  The filing also disclosed that Flynn secretly met with the Turkish foreign and energy ministers in New York before Election Day. Speaking on Fox News, the vice president said the revelations showed his boss was right. 'I think it is an affirmation of the president's decision to ask General Flynn to resign,' he said. President Donald Trump's fired national security adviser Michael Flynn has admitted that his lobbying firm was paid $530,000 for work that could have benefited the Turkish government, just two months before he was appointed to the White House. Now Mike Pence says it was right he was sacked Flynn's consultancy firm is reported to have spoken with a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee, asking the rep to hold congressional hearings on American-based cleric Fethullah Gulen,  right, who reportedly was behind the failed coup against Turkish President Erdogan, left Flynn was fired after just 23 days for misleading Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. The Turkish lobbying was not known to be part of the reasons for his sacking, and it is still unclear if the White House knew about the payment when he was appointed. Flynn wrote an op-ed the day Trump was elected calling for the US to kick out anti-government Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who is living in exile in Pennsylvania. But at the time he didn't disclose he was being paid by a firm with links to the Turkish government.  His firm is also said to have tried to pressure a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee into opening an investigation into Gulen, who is accused of organizing the failed coup against Erdogan. After his firm's work on behalf of a Turkish company was done, Flynn agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments.  The amended paperwork was allegedly in response to work Flynn's consultancy form did for a Dutch company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin (pictured) Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign government or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department.  Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. A Turkish businessman who hired Flynn's consulting firm told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the amended filings were made in response to pressure from Justice Department officials in recent weeks.  The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, said in a phone call from Istanbul that the changes were a response to 'political pressure' and he did not agree with Flynn's decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. 'I disagree with the filing,' he said. 'It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government.' Flynn's attorney did not respond to questions about whether the Justice Department or FBI had contacted Flynn about his lobbying activities. Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive transparency about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. In the filings with the Justice Department, Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, noted they served as a termination of the registration, saying the firm had ceased operations in November, the same month the lobbying contract ended. Calls to phone numbers associated with Flynn and his firm weren't answered. Kelner, his attorney, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. Reached Wednesday afternoon, an official at the Turkish embassy in Washington said he would refer the questions to the embassy spokesman. The spokesman did not immediately respond. The shocking revelations come just a month after Flynn was fired from his White House post after just 23 days for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Cleaning house: Russian oligarch loses $150million selling...

Share this article Share 11 shares The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon.  As a key member of Trump's transition team last December, Flynn spoke by phone several times with Kislyak during the period when former President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and levied new sanctions in response to Russian election-related hacking. According to the new paperwork, Flynn's firm took on the Turkish-related lobbying work in August while he was a top Trump campaign surrogate. Flynn Intel disclosed in its filing that in mid-September, the company was invited by Alptekin to meet with Turkish officials in New York. Alptekin wrote a series of tweets on Wednesday, saying Flynn's work for him was in no way tied to the government Alptekin acknowledged Wednesday that he had set up the meeting between Flynn and the two officials. He said they met at an undisclosed hotel in New York. Alptekin said Flynn happened to be in New York while the Turkish officials were attending United Nations sessions and a separate conference Alptekin had arranged. 'I asked one of Gen. Flynn's staff if he was in town and would be available to meet and they got in touch with him,' said Alptekin, who owns several businesses in Turkey. Among those officials, the documents said, were Turkey's ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn's company did not name the officials but reported the two worked for Turkey's government 'to the best of Flynn Intel Group's current understanding.' Alptekin, who previously told The Associated Press he has no relationship with the Turkish government, is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. Erdogan's power base is Turkey's Islamic voters, and since a failed coup in July, he has accelerated a crackdown against the nation's weakening secularist faction. Erdogan has accused cleric Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives. The Obama administration did not comply, and Gulen still lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel's work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric, including a meeting in October between Flynn's firm and a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee. Flynn Intel arranged the meeting to discuss a technology developed by another Flynn Intel client. But after discussing the technology, the firm changed the subject to Gulen, pressuring the committee to hold congressional hearings to investigate the cleric, said a U.S. official with direct knowledge of Flynn Intel's work. That request was rebuffed. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The official said Flynn Intel never revealed whom it was representing during the meeting. The October meeting came as Flynn was working on an op-ed promoting Turkey's political and business affairs that was later published in The Hill, a Washington-based political newspaper. Flynn wrote that Turkey needed support and echoed Erdogan's warnings about Gulen, whom he called a 'shady' Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Flynn argued that Gulen should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. In the new filing, Flynn disclosed that in writing the op-ed, he relied on research conducted as part of the Inovo BV contract. Flynn's firm also admitted it conducted 'open-source research,' directed by Inovo, focusing on Gulen. The results 'were provided to Inovo' and to a separate lobbying firm, S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying, a public relations company retained by Flynn Intel. The materials were aimed for distribution to 'third parties,' but because the project terminated early, 'the full scope of the contract was not performed,' according to the filings. In the filings, Flynn emphasized that neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government directed him to write the op-ed. He also said he was not paid for the op-ed. Alptekin said he had been opposed to Flynn's writing the op-ed, although he agreed with its anti-Gulen and pro-Turkley stances. Alptekin added that he had asked for some of the $530,000 in payments to the Flynn Intel Group to be returned to him because of his dissatisfaction with the company's performance.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 11 shares Most watched News videos Homeless man brought to tears following incredible transformation Dancing Prince seen talking to mystery woman at Verbier party Little girl is overcome with emotion as her dad meets her from school Train ploughs snow as it pulls into New York station Good samaritan saves police deputy by shooting his attacker Will's got the love!

(Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images) Cloud Computing, Data Center Strategies, Featured, Google Google Expands Cloud Data Center Plans, Asserts Hardware, Connectivity Leadership by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on March 9, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Google has added three locations to the list of cloud data center construction projects it is doing to expand geographic reach of the physical infrastructure that supports its enterprise cloud services, investing billions to catch up with its biggest rivals in the space — Amazon, and Microsoft. Urs Hölzle, the company’s senior VP for technical infrastructure, announced the plans from stage Thursday at the Google Cloud Next event in San Francisco. He also underlined hardware innovation inside Google’s cloud data centers and its global network backbone and announced new cost controls for cloud users, while his colleagues unveiled new security, developer, and collaboration tools. Cloud data center locations, connectivity, hardware, cost, security, and toolset are all levers cloud providers pull as they compete for enterprise cloud market share – a race in which Google Cloud Platform remains far behind market leader Amazon Web Services as well as Amazon’s distant-second competitor, Microsoft Azure. AWS had more than 40 percent market share in public infrastructure and platform cloud services at the end of last year, Synergy Research Group estimated. Microsoft, Google, and IBM collectively had 23 percent. Synergy doesn’t break out the latter three companies’ individual market share, but another market analyst firm, Structure Research, estimated that at least in the infrastructure-as-a-service space, Azure commanded close to 11 percent market share in 2015, while Google’s share was 2.5 percent, compared to AWS’s nearly 71 percent. DCK analysis: Can Google Lure More Enterprises Inside Its Data Centers? But Google’s cloud business is growing. The company paraded numerous big new customers at the conference, including Verizon, Colgate-Palmolive, HSBC, eBay, and Evernote, among others. “Customers of GCP connect to a billion individual users every single day,” Hölzle said. Expanding the Google Data Center Empire The three new cloud data center locations Google is planning to launch are in California, Canada, and The Netherlands, Hölzle said. Previously announced regions that are in the works are Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland, Frankfurt, Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney. All these locations will come online this or next year, he said, bringing Google’s total to 17 availability regions and 50 availability zones. Each zone is essentially a separate data center, with its own dedicated power and cooling infrastructure. The company plans to have a minimum of three zones in each region, although some regions are initially launched with two zones. Like its big rivals, Google has been spending billions of dollars each year on building out its global network, which includes data centers, hardware, and telecommunications infrastructure, including terrestrial and submarine fiber cables. Its trailing three-year capital investment totals about $26.4 billion, Hölzle said. Capex figures Google discloses usually include costs other than infrastructure, but infrastructure is responsible for the bulk of the expenses. The company reported $10.9 billion in capex for 2016 – up 10 percent from the year before, an increase that was in line with its recently expanded focus on cloud infrastructure investment. Chipping Away at Market Share One of the layers of the stack where Google is asserting leadership is data center hardware. In addition to designing its own servers and network switches, Google has been deeply involved in the design of CPUs that power its cloud services by collaborating with Intel, which supplies chips for virtually all computing capacity cloud providers have today. Last month, Google announced that it was the first company to upgrade its servers with Intel’s next-generation Xeon processors, codenamed Skylake. At the event Thursday, Raejeanne Skillern, who leads Intel’s Cloud Service Provider Group, confirmed that Google was first, and that Intel would not be putting the product on the market for some time. While it’s common practice for Intel to customize products for all hyper-scale cloud companies – it’s been tweaking its chips for Google since 2003 – Google was involved in the development of Skylake from the very beginning. “We take the Google feedback every step of the way,” Skillern said. Hölzle also shared more details about a custom security chip that’s on every server motherboard in Google data centers, which was only briefly mentioned in a recently published whitepaper on the company’s cloud security practices. The chip is called Titan, and it’s so tiny that Hölzle was able to have it attached to an earring pin he was wearing on stage. Titan helps Google protect hardware at the BIOS layer. It helps authenticate hardware and services running on the servers. Wiring the Planet Another big capital investment area for Google is global data center connectivity. It was the first non-telco technology company to invest in a submarine cable construction project nine years ago. The cable, called Unity, crosses the Pacific Ocean to link landing stations in Chikura, Japan, and Redondo Beach, California. It came online in 2010. Since then, Google has invested in five more submarine cable projects. In recent years, other hyper-scale data center operators, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, have also become major investors in transcontinental connectivity. Read more: Here are the Submarine Cables Funded by Cloud Giants Sharpening the Machine Learning Angle Google has been making good progress on differentiating itself with cloud services around Artificial Intelligence and machine learning (the most widely used type of AI), Sid Nag, a research director at Gartner, said. That has been the company’s core message since around one year ago, when it started significantly ramping up its enterprise cloud efforts. A key challenge going forward will be simplifying the narrative around these tools and creating some “pedestrian use cases” to help customers easily integrate Google’s machine learning capabilities into their applications, Nag said. Go-to-Market Improvements Another important development this week was Google’s announcement of a significant expansion of its channel and technology partner programs. The company hasn’t had a managed services capability to help clients get on-boarded onto its cloud platform, and partnerships such as the one it announced with Rackspace, will go a long way in improving that. The managed service provider has been supporting AWS and Azure, saying these managed cloud services have been its fastest-growing business. Now, it has added the third massive cloud platform into the mix. Google’s “partnership with Rackspace is going to be pretty significant,” Nag said.

 Michael Flynn registers with Justice Department as a foreign agent over Turkey lobbying Stephen Braun and Chad Day, Associated Press Mar. 9, 2017, 9:57 AM 8,260 facebook linkedin twitter email print White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (C) arrives prior to a joint news conference between Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 13, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who was fired from his prominent White House job last month, has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work before Election Day that may have aided the Turkish government. Paperwork filed Tuesday with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit said Flynn and his firm were voluntarily registering for lobbying from August through November that "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." It was filed by a lawyer on behalf of the former U.S. Army lieutenant general and intelligence chief. After his firm's work on behalf of a Turkish company was done, Flynn agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. A Turkish businessman who hired Flynn's consulting firm told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the amended filings were made in response to pressure from Justice Department officials in recent weeks. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, said in a phone call from Istanbul that the changes were a response to "political pressure" and he did not agree with Flynn's decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. "I disagree with the filing," he said. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government." Turkish President Erdogan arrives for a meeting in Istanbul. Thomson Reuters Flynn's attorney did not respond to questions about whether the Justice Department or FBI had contacted Flynn about his lobbying activities. Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive transparency about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. In the filings with the Justice Department, Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, noted the documents served as a termination of the registration, saying the firm had ceased operations in November, the same month the lobbying contract ended. Calls to phone numbers associated with Flynn and his firm weren't answered. Kelner, his attorney, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. Reached Wednesday afternoon, an official at the Turkish embassy in Washington said he would refer the questions to the embassy spokesman. The spokesman did not immediately respond. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. Sergey Kislyak. AP Photo/Cliff Owen As a key member of Trump's transition team last December, Flynn spoke by phone several times with Kislyak during the period when former President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and levied new sanctions in response to Russian election-related hacking. According to the new paperwork, Flynn's firm took on the Turkish-related lobbying work in August while he was a top Trump campaign surrogate. Flynn Intel disclosed in its filing that in mid-September, the company was invited by Alptekin to meet with Turkish officials in New York. Alptekin acknowledged Wednesday that he had set up the meeting between Flynn and the two officials. He said they met at an undisclosed hotel in New York. Alptekin said Flynn happened to be in New York while the Turkish officials were attending United Nations sessions and a separate conference that Alptekin had arranged. "I asked one of Gen. Flynn's staff if he was in town and would be available to meet and they got in touch with him," said Alptekin, who owns several businesses in Turkey. Among those officials, the documents said, were Turkey's ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn's company did not name the officials but reported the two worked for Turkey's government "to the best of Flynn Intel Group's current understanding." Alptekin, who previously told The Associated Press he has no relationship with the Turkish government, is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. Erdogan's power base is Turkey's Islamic voters, and since a failed coup in July, he has accelerated a crackdown against the nation's weakening secularist faction. Erdogan has accused cleric Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives. The Obama administration did not comply, and Gulen still lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel's work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric, including a meeting in October between Flynn's firm and a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee. Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) sits next to retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn (L) as they attend an exhibition marking the 10th anniversary of RT (Russia Today) television news channel in Moscow, Russia, December 10, 2015. Reuters/Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin Flynn Intel arranged the meeting to discuss a technology developed by another Flynn Intel client. But after discussing the technology, the firm changed the subject to Gulen, pressuring the committee to hold congressional hearings to investigate the cleric, said a U.S. official with direct knowledge of Flynn Intel's work. That request was rebuffed. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The official said Flynn Intel never revealed whom it was representing during the meeting. The October meeting came as Flynn was working on an op-ed promoting Turkey's political and business affairs that was later published in The Hill, a Washington-based political newspaper. Flynn wrote that Turkey needed support and echoed Erdogan's warnings about Gulen, whom he called a "shady" Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Flynn argued that Gulen should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. In the new filing, Flynn disclosed that in writing the op-ed, he relied on research conducted as part of the Inovo BV contract. Flynn's firm also admitted it conducted "open-source research," directed by Inovo, focusing on Gulen. The results "were provided to Inovo" and to a separate lobbying firm, S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying, a public relations company retained by Flynn Intel. The materials were aimed for distribution to "third parties," but because the project terminated early, "the full scope of the contract was not performed," according to the filings. In the filings, Flynn emphasized that neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government directed him to write the op-ed. He also said he was not paid for the op-ed. Alptekin said he had been opposed to Flynn's writing the op-ed, although he agreed with its anti-Gulen and pro-Turkley stances. Alptekin added that he had asked for some of the $530,000 in payments to the Flynn Intel Group to be returned to him because of his dissatisfaction with the company's performance. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report.

The retired Serbian pro recently joined PlaySight. Israeli startup brings 'Matrix’-style replays to televised sports Israeli start-up upgrading tennis technology China blazes a trail to Startup Nation Imagine, for a moment, being able to watch automatically edited video highlights from your kid’s basketball club on your cellphone, having a virtual physiotherapist who can screen an athlete’s movements to predict the risk for injury, or a shoe that can track a soccer player’s statistics. Sports – where the difference between breaking records and not making it past the trials is a fraction of a second – is constantly on the lookout for innovative technology. Over $5 billion was spent worldwide from 2014 to 2016 on sports technology and companies that provide services to the industry. Israel has become a world leader in the field of computer vision and image analysis – the result of military and academic work in the area that has led to the establishment of a number of startups that develop products for a variety of industries. The Israeli company that has made the biggest splash is Replay Technologies, which was acquired by Intel about a year ago for around $170 million. Replay developed an advanced system for viewing sports events in 360 degrees and from the perspective of players on the field. The technology is being used in the top Spanish soccer league and American NFL broadcasts. Replay isn’t alone in the field. The SmartCourt system developed by PlaySight includes cameras that turn any ball court, playing field – or gymnastics, martial arts or dance studio – into a “smart” venue offering advanced video and analytics technology. PlaySight says it wants to do for other sports categories what GoPro brought to the world of extreme sports. The company began with tennis, before branching out into basketball, soccer, hockey and wrestling, among other sports. It focuses on practice grounds and small gymnasiums, in order to bring profession technology to lower levels, in what it calls the “democratization of technology.” skip - WSC Sports “We turn any court in any sport into a space that offers livestreaming and analyzes player activity. It lets players improve their abilities, and makes practice and games more challenging and enjoyable,” says PlaySight CEO Chen Shachar. The company has raised some $13 million since launching seven years ago, with investors including tennis ace Novak Djokovic and former champion Pete Sampras. The retired Serbian pro Ana Ivanovic recently joined the company, which has offices in Kfar Sava, New York and Los Angeles and a staff of around 50. Customers include NBA teams such as the Phoenix Suns and the Golden State Warriors. WSC Sports Technologies, based in Ramat Gan, is another Israeli startup that upgrades the sports viewing experience. Its products automatically create video content that is tailored individually for each viewer. WSC announced a $12-million funding round last September, bringing investment to date to $16 million. Investors include Intel Capital, the Wilf family (owners of the Minnesota Vikings), the owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Yossi Moldawsky’s PLUS Ventures, which is creating a sports-dedicated investment fund. WSC Sports was established in 2011 by Daniel Shichman, Shmulik Yoffe, Aviv Arnon and Hy Gal, in order to provide focused, short-form videos for coaches and scouts, but pivoted to concentrate on sports broadcasts after recognizing the unrealized potential in the area. The company’s system can automatically analyze and index events on the field in real time using audio analysis, video processing and editing algorithms, creating custom highlights that focus on a single element such as a basketball team’s dunks or the moves of a particular player. WSC works with organizations including the NBA and the Big East college basketball league, and content providers such as Turner Sports. It also creates personalized content for fans of a team. In the most recent NBA finals, WSC launched a chatbot on the league’s Facebook page to let fans request tailor-made video clips, for which it won a Sports Technology Award. Pixellot, which is based in Petah Tikva, also uses computer vision and image-analysis technology. However, its products are used mainly as a distribution channel for professional and amateur sports events. The target audience includes not only professional teams but also, say, parents who want to watch their children’s afterschool sports activities. “Every year there are some 75 million soccer and basketball games that are not recorded,” says Pixellot CEO Alon Werber, adding, “With the right products, we can play an important role in the media world.” skip - Video for Pixellot His company’s clients include a Chinese sports broadcasting portal, sports auditoriums, media companies and various amateur leagues, including the youth clubs of soccer giants Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Pixellot has raised $12 million to date, from investors that include Baidu of China. Looking after athletes’ health PhysiMax Technologies develops technology that analyzes athletes’ movements to help identify the risk of injuries and let professionals design corrective programs. It was founded in 2013 by Ram Shalev – an engineer with years of experience with rehabilitation technologies – and David Kahani, who has a background in video-image analysis. Three months ago, PhysiMax signed a partnership agreement with the Indiana Pacers. The company’s product uses 3-D video cameras and proprietary software to film and analyze an athlete’s movements and to create detailed reports that assess performance and injury risk factors. Shalev notes that his company’s target audience includes amateur as well as professional athletes, putting powerful motion-analysis tools in the hands of people without access to sports medicine professionals. The brain analysis technology developed by ElMindA, which has offices in Herzliya and Silicon Valley, measures neural activity. The company’s products have been used to identify concussions in American football players, and ElMindA operated a clinic in the Olympic village in Rio last year. ElmindA’s BNA Analysis System uses a cap fitted with electrodes to measure electronic activity in the brain. It was developed to supplement existing imaging tools, in order to give a fuller picture of brain function in cases that do not involve bleeding. Minute Media is no longer in the startup category, after its 90min became one of the biggest media platforms in the world of soccer; its new 12up platform seems set to do the same for basketball. skip - PhysiMax The company’s technology allows fans to automatically create videos from their own content, in 11 different languages. Minute Media has raised around $60 million, has 130 employees and its customers include brands such as Nike, Pepsi, MasterCard, Verizon and Warner Bros. Content created by Minute Media is also broadcast on platforms that include ESPN, NBC and Yahoo Sports. Fanzone is an Israeli company that aims to get young people to put down their devices and show up to concerts, festivals and sports events by getting them to the venue in comfort and style. The company’s platform aims to provide logistics for event organizers, and to manage transportation for ticket holders. Founded in 2014 by Ori Shilo and Tomer Kazaz, Fanzone has raised $6.2 million and has 20 employees. Clients include sports teams, concert organizers, ticket agencies and local governments. Statistics has always been at the heart of the sports industry. Data analytics is most closely associated with Major League Baseball, with the NBA a close second. According to Deloitte, the market for sports-data analytics is expected to exceed $600 million by 2021. The startup founded by the retired judoka Aviv Hatzir extends data analytics to judo, with a chatbot at the front-end of a library of videos of the athletes. The company went into high gear ahead of the Rio Olympics, and the tool was rolled out a few minutes before the games were held last August. Another Israeli startup with a unique speciality is Motionize, whose technology uses sensors to record and analyze the strokes of kayakers to help them improve their technique. Founded in 2014, Motionize has 21 employees and has raised around $4 million. Motionize CEO and cofounder Guy Aharon notes that the company is branching into additional sports, including the development of a smart shoe for soccer. Gamers sweat too – on the couch Not everyone considers eSports or gaming a real sport, but it’s a growing field that is forecasted to be worth around $1 billion in 2019. Major sports teams have begun to invest in their eSports brands, and even to acquire professional gamers. Israel is not a major player in the area of competitive gaming, but at least one Israeli company is trying to profit from the popularity of the category. Zengaming is the social network for gaming, where gamers can join leagues, find sponsors and reach out to fans. Zengaming was founded by Jimi Gecelter, Shai Gecelter and Or Preiss, self-confessed gamers who say they saw a need for amateur players to communicate among themselves and gain wider exposure. Viewers are an important part of the eSports industry – indeed, they’re what make it profitable. Israel’s Partner Communications hopes to get in on the game, and to that end will soon launch the international gaming channel GINX eSports TV, which is already available on the company’s 4GTV app. The television channel was mentioned in a Deloitte report as representing a global trend. “The gaming industry has enormous power and an audience with a very high level of engagement, and their numbers are only increasing,” said Partner CEO Itzik Benvenisti in a statement. “In Israel, too, there are hundreds of thousands of gamers – from 12 years old to 40 and older – who consume global content and follow international events in the field.” Minute Media is also trying to get a piece of the eSports action, and plans to start covering gaming leagues alongside traditional sports.

The Daily Caller asked Pelosi if she was concerned about the order, signed by Obama in January, that allowed the National Security Agency to share internationally intercepted personal communications with 16 other U.S. intelligence agencies. President Trump’s National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned after his name was leaked to the press as having a conversation that was recorded by unknown individuals in the intelligence community. Pelosi, one of the eight members of Congress who receives exclusive classified information from the intelligence community on a regular basis, replied, “No. I mean, I think that we all don’t want everybody in pipeline, so we’re not having the benefit of information or intelligence to keep the American people safe. But I don’t think that has anything to do with leaks. No.” House Select Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and Ranking Member Adam Schiff expressed concern that the eight members of Congress who receive classified briefings were not told of any Flynn-related investigation. “The Gang of Eight exists for a reason, and we are supposed to be kept up to speed on any pertinent counterintelligence investigation. If that did not occur last year we need to understand — so in other words, if Trump or any other political campaign that can be associated with Trump was under some type of investigation that clearly should have risen to the Gang of Eight level,” Nunes told reporters. “These are issues that should have been brought to the gang of eight, at a minimum. If we’re to get quarterly counterintelligence briefings, then we need the confidence of knowing that they’re briefing us on the most significant issues,” Schiff told Roll Call last Thursday.

Today Microsoft announced plans to run internal cloud-based workloads on ARM-based processors. ARM hopes that Microsoft it is one of the first big names in tech to make such moves and to shake up the server market. According to information seen by the Verge, Intel claims it almost has a monopoly of the server market, as "98 percent of the cloud runs on Intel," adding $7.5 billion to Intel's coffers in 2016. Microsoft is working with ARM servers from two hardware companies, Qualcomm and Cavium, to optimise their machines for its data centre needs. On the software side of things Microsoft has made a "significant commitment" to ARM servers by porting a version of Windows Server to the platform. Microsoft ported only the server side component software of value to its operations, such as; search and indexing, storage, databases, big data and machine learning. ARM says that such tasks benefit from the high-throughput compute capability delivered by ARM-based SoCs. Microsoft's Leendert van Doorn, Distinguished Engineer, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Corp., wrote in an official blog post of how ARM servers "represent a real opportunity," to his company. Doorn stated that ARM servers stand out in an increasingly crowded market for three main reasons: There is a healthy ecosystem with multiple ARM server vendors. There is an established developer and software ecosystem for ARM (such as high-end smartphone software stacks). ARM designs are can be more flexible "without disrupting their installed software base." In addition to the above, modern ARM servers provide high Instruction Per Cycle (IPC) counts, high core and thread counts, and impressive connectivity and integration options. The ARM servers and Microsoft software are currently being demonstrated at the 2017 Open Compute Project (OCP) US Summit. Qualcomm is showing off its Qualcomm Centriq 2400 open compute motherboard leveraging its recently announced 10nm, 48-core server processors (pictured above). Cavium will be running its flagship 2nd generation 64-bit ThunderX2 ARMv8-A server processor SoCs for datacenter, cloud and high performance computing applications (pictured below).

Windows may be synonymous with Intel powered PCs but that is more an accidental symbiosis than intentional, Microsoft would have launched Windows on whatever was the dominant architecture if it hadn't been x86/IA-32; Windows NT was at one time compatible with MIPS, DEC Alpha, PowerPC and Itanium.

To be honest, I thought it was surprising it took this long to port Windows Server. We have been talking about high-density ARM servers for quite a while now…..the writing has been on the wall for a number of years. SQL Server on Linux isn't such a surprise when you consider their competitors support a LOT of platforms.

It also is $200 off today. And considering it typically goes for just under $500, that’s a sizable discount. But none of that is the most interesting aspect of this product listing. That would be the fact that it has a perfect 5 out of 5 star customer rating. Normally $480, this convertible computer is 42 percent off today (Photo via Amazon) Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 11E-G3 Convertible, Intel:N3160/CQC, 1.6 GHz, 128 GB, Intel-HD/IGP, Windows 10 Home Edition-64 bit, Black, 11.6″ HD Touch on sale for $279.99 Now, when you look a littler closer, it becomes clear how this Thinkpad has achieved the impossible. There is only one review! But the review is very flattering. Yet, it also is completely realistic. It makes a great case for why you should take advantage of this one-day deal. I’ll post it here for your convenience: I have bought a bunch of these in all three generations for myself and clients. They’ve been the deal of the day a number of times and I’ve bought them elsewhere too. They usually sell out as the Deal of the Day. I’m a computer tech who works with some small offices that need windows touch screen computers for an app or two. I also think they make a great student laptop. This third gen has an updated processor, a little longer battery life, and supposedly a little stronger frame. These are in no way a powerhouse, but for a laptop of this size and price they’re very nice. It works well as a laptop and it works well as a tablet when you flip the screen all the way over. For this “Deal of the Day” Woot or Amazon made a new product page so that’s why the only review is from today. Yes they’re clunky. For their size they have a big bezel around the screen, they are a little heavier than you would expect, and they aren’t as thin as some. The Amazon weight is totally wrong. This is a little over 3 pounds. But on the flip side of the coin, they can take a beating. They have a strong frame and are rough-and-tumble ready. They’re military spec–whatever that means. I feel secure giving the 11e to my kids. Cheap laptops don’t often stand up to abuse and the Yoga 11e really does. I think I’ve worked with over 20 of just this 3rd generation over the past year or so and there have been no hardware failures. Most of these have been employee laptops and in the same situation other laptops have failed when abused. The screen is low resolution, but if it were higher resolution everything on the screen would be even smaller. I don’t want high resolution on a small laptop like this. It’s IPS so it has good viewing angles. The touch works well in laptop or tablet mode. The processor isn’t very powerful. The Celron processor in this third generation has been the 3150, but now it’s the 3160. The only difference is that the turbo mode is not quite 10% faster in this 3160. It’s not the type of laptop that you open a ton of windows and programs at one time. I think it’s perfectly usable for web, Netflix, Word, etc. It’s perfect as long as you’re not trying to do all that at once! 🙂 My kids play Minecraft on it and don’t complain. It doesn’t come with Microsoft Office. The second generation Yoga with the Core-M processor is a good bit faster but it’s about $400 on Amazon today. There is a i3 version of the 3rd gen, but I’ve not seen it inexpensive. Everything else is good too. I like the keyboard, but it’s not backlit. The touchpad is ok but I prefer actual left and right-click buttons. The touchscreen works great. The speakers are pretty good. You get two USB, an SD card slot, an HDMI out, a wired internet port, and a rectangular power cord port. Both USB are third generation. The 720p webcam is ok but nothing special. The power button is on the side so you can reach it in tablet mode and is one of those you have to hold for a second or two for it to turn on. There are physical volume buttons next to the power button. The battery life is nice and long. I’ve not timed it, but I think we get around 8 hours out of it. The 128GB SSD won’t win any speed awards, but it’s a lot faster than a spinning disk and in a convertible you need a drive that can be moved around. The drive is much faster than the previous generation Yoga 11e. These aren’t hard to open up. Something like 7 screws on the bottom panel and it pops up. There’s only one ram slot and the hard drive is the M.2 format. The physical format is m.2 and I believe that it uses the SATA protocal. I don’t have any way of verifying if these can use PCIe m.2 drives before the deal of the day is over. I’m not positive on the SATA protocal, but I am sure about the m.2 for all the gen 3 I’ve used. I think most of the time I’ve gotten Windows Pro with these, so I’m sad this only has Windows home. The main difference between home and pro is that you can connect Pro to a local Windows Server Domain. Windows pro also has a little more control over Windows Update in Windows 10. I like these Yoga 11e. It won’t win style awards, but there’s nothing uglier than a stylish laptop in a pile of broken plastic. This is a tough little laptop/tablet that will survive to be used again tomorrow. Thanks, Michael, for the info.

MiJia is one of them and in recent news the company is now crowdfunding a new pair of smart running shoes on the Mi Home webpage dubbed the ’90 Minutes Ultra Smart’. Xiaomi MiJia’s running shoes have a built-in Intel Curie chip able to crunch fitness data in real time and can detect a variety of activities including running, walking, and climbing. The 90 Minutes Ultra Smart shoes by Xiaom’s MiJia have apparently been designed by the Shanghai International Science & Technology institute in order to meet the needs of professional athletes. The base is manufactured from a foam-like material and features an air cushion as well as an antibacterial removable insole, whereas the sole features arch support and an anti-skid design. Ergonomics aside, Xiaomi’s running shoes wear the ‘Ultra Smart’ badge thanks to the inclusion of an Intel Curie chip designed specifically for wearable devices. The Intel Curie is a low-power module of the size of a button, which was built around the 32-bit Intel Quark SE System-on-Chip (SoC). It features an x86 host CPU, Pattern Matching Engine, sensor hub, a 6-axis accelerometer and gyro, a Bluetooth Low Energy module, and a battery charging unit. Intel Curie features 384kB flash memory and 80kB SRAM memory, and is described by the manufacturer as the ideal module for always-on apps and fitness activities. Together with Intel Curie on-board, the 90 Minutes Ultra Smart shoes can differentiate between fitness activities and has an autonomy of up to 60 days on a single charge. Prospective buyers should also be pleased to learn that the new Xiaomi smart shoes come in a variety of color options, including surf blue and black for men, as well as black and pink for women. There’s also an additional blue special edition color options featuring reflective materials for higher visibility at night. As previously mentioned, the 90 Minutes Ultra Smart running shoes have been announced through Xiaomi’s crowdfunding campaign, and the good news is that the goal has already been met five times over with a total of 1,515,092 Chinese Yuan (around $219,260) raised by more than 5,000 pledgers. With that being said, Xiaomi’s new running shoes are priced at 299 Yuan ($43) and have an expected shipping date set for April 15.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars GAMES Dhruva’s Rajesh Rao is still bullish on India’s game market — after two decades Dean Takahashi@deantak March 9, 2017 7:30 AM Tags: Dhruva Interactive, Ed Fries, Forza Motorsport, Game Tantra, GB Featured, Mark Skaggs, Microsoft, Rajesh Rao, Starbreeze Studios, Zynga Above: GDC 2017 Rajesh Rao is one of the founding fathers of India’s game industry. He started Dhruva Interactive in Bangalore almost 20 years ago. Dhruva was a pioneering company that went through various cycles. It started with work-for-hire, making games for the French game company Infogrames. Then it began making cars for Microsoft’s Forza Motorsport games. Dhruva also made original games for the Indian market and started an incubator for Indian game startups. Rao helped start the NASSCOM game event, which has become India’s largest game conference. And during all of that time, India’s game market is starting to mature, particularly with the fast growth of the country’s smartphone business. Rao recently sold Dhruva to Swedish game publisher Starbreeze for $11 million. We met once again at the Game Developers Conference last week in San Francisco. Here’s an edited transcript of our conversation. Above: Dhruva worked on Microsoft’s Project Spark Image Credit: Dhruva GamesBeat: How long has it been since the acquisition?  Rajesh Rao: The deal was announced at the end of December. It’s not closed yet because of regulatory issues in India. It’s a minor formality. It’ll happen in the next month or so. GamesBeat: When did you start the company? Rao: In one week it’ll be 20 years. GamesBeat: What was the gaming environment like back then? Rao: There was nothing. We were excited at the thought of getting into games, but there was no business, no market justification. This was in Bangalore. GamesBeat: What made you want to do it? Rao: I was kind of a geek, a programmer. I finished my engineering schooling. My final project was in multimedia. I’d actually written my own multimedia engine. I used that as a way to start my own multimedia company in 1995. We were fairly successful. Again, we were probably the first multimedia company in India as well, doing custom solutions for companies. We were doing things like point of information terminals, computer-based training modules, touchscreen-based stuff. The early days of multimedia. Above: Rajesh Rao discusses the challenges of the Indian mobile gaming market at GamesBeat 2015. Image Credit: GamesBeat GamesBeat: Not anything game-related at that point? Rao: No. Then, in February of 1997, we bumped into an evangelist from Intel. They were evangelizing the upcoming Pentium II, and they were looking to sign up companies that were willing to do code for that chip. Pentium II was a breakthrough chip for games. It had the AGP port and a lot of other gaming-friendly features on the chip. We signed up to do a rendering engine for the Pentium II. That’s how we got into games. The guy showed us Shiny’s old game, MDK, and said, “Look at this, this is huge. You guys are doing multimedia and this is even better.” That’s how we signed up. We were quite excited. They did a great job of selling the story to us. We signed up for what Intel called the early access program. They had an early access technology program. They’d give us the prototype chips and computers and help us with tech support. If we needed to talk to people on the DirectX team at Microsoft, they would facilitate that. They would do things like matchmaking events, where they’d showcase people like us to potential partners. GamesBeat: How did the games start growing for you? Rao: It took us a year to build our engine. We sustained the business with our pre-existing multimedia work. I traveled to E3 for the first time in 1997, in Atlanta, and realized how big the games business is. I came back and said, “We have to have something really awesome to show. This business is not about cost arbitrage. It’s not about an Indian services company coming in and selling. You have to be really good at what you do.” We took our time, and when we had a good demo, it was April of 1998. We used Intel’s offices to set up a few meetings. One of them was with Infogrames, in France. They liked what they saw and said they’d keep us in mind if they ever had a title that required a really mass-market engine like ours. The thing was, in those days, if you wanted to do any good graphics you had to have hardware acceleration with Glide, using a separate card. Here we were offering a software engine that was doing as good a job as the erstwhile hardware accelerated technology. That put us in a place where we could be high quality, but mass market. We got a call a few months later from Infogrames. They had a big Nintendo 64 game, Mission Impossible, and they were looking to make a PC version. Could we come over to France and see if we could do the job? That was the break, the first title we worked on. We signed up in November of 1998 and worked through all of 1999. The game was then cancelled at beta stage, but it was only cancelled because they had the Mission Impossible 2 license, and they didn’t want an old licensed game to be coming out too close to the sequel. They gave us a good recommendation on the work that we’d done, and we had a game to show. In March 2000 I was at GDC and I met people like Mitch Lasky and Ed Fries. I’m showing this stuff on my laptop. It caught Ed Fries’s interest and he put me on to people on his team. That’s how the next business came along. GamesBeat: One of those projects that turned out to be big was Forza. Rao: That’s interesting, yeah. The way that turned out, around the same time in 2000 and 2001, we ended up getting an inquiry out of the blue from Codemasters. They needed some cars made, and could we make them? So we did. I think it was in 2002 when we came to GDC and met up with Microsoft guys again. We showed them those cars and coincidentally, they had just greenlit the Forza franchise. The team, with Kiki Wolfkill and John Wendl, was looking for external companies to make those cars. The connection was made – hey, we just saw some good-looking cars, go check these guys out. They enlisted a lot of companies, and we did very well with that. Since then we’ve worked on every Forza that’s ever been built. It’s been a great relationship. It’s now, what, 15 years old? Above: Art created by Dhruva Interactive. Image Credit: Dhruva GamesBeat: Did you ever consider just doing art for games as opposed to doing whole projects? Rao: We were eventually forced into making that decision. Market forces made it so that was the best opportunity for us. When we did the port for Mission Impossible, after that the aspiration as a team was to do another big game. We kept looking around, but those opportunities were very few and far between. Not very many willing people were willing to send a full game project to India. The guys at Infogrames were outliers in that sense. It was a decision made by one of their founders, the CTO of the company. Only he could have done that, to say, “Let’s give these guys a break.” Subsequently he went on to become an investor in Dhruva at a personal level. He just liked us. You need some champions like that. But subsequent to that, especially when we’d come to the U.S. and meet with other companies, they’d say, “If you were here we could work with you.” I remember meeting with some publishers who said, “Why don’t you guys relocate here? Then we could work with you.” But that just wasn’t what we wanted to do. More and more the business that came our way was pieces of the whole, and specifically lots of art. What we did is we kind of used our games team – people who were good at tech, who could make a full game – we got them on to product initiatives. Things we hoped could be that product that would crack the Indian market open. We thought that we could make compelling enough games to open up the Indian market. We were obviously very wrong, because it was very early for that. But we had a product initiative that coexisted with services for very many years. It was only in 2010 or 2011 that we finally bifurcated the two and had Game Tantra becoming a publisher. GamesBeat: The incubator for games? Rao: Right, Game Tantra subsequently became an incubator focused on the Indian market. Dhruva continued be a pure services provider, doing mainly art. We did try to grow a full services group for game development, for mobile, but that didn’t really find good traction. We basically just doubled down and focused on art content creation and services. That’s done very well for us. GamesBeat: How did you then see the Indian game industry growing up? Rao: We did a lot to try and seed the market, from PC-based multiplayer gaming in the early 2000s to mobile Java games in the mid-to-late 2000s. We tried doing downloadable PC and later smartphone games. But I guess in hindsight we were just plain too early. In a way we peaked too early, invested too early. We invested quite a lot. It was $2-3 million over a few years, which is a lot of money in India. It was all money coming out of the cash flow from our services business. We were taking whatever profits we made and pumping them into product development. It was a mixed bag. Sometimes it worked. Most of the time it didn’t. Ironically, the games we released internationally did better. We did a Java mobile game called Maria Sharapova Tennis, done in collaboration with a U.K.-based publisher. That made us money. A lot of the products we did for India didn’t make money. The market was just not there. We just moved on from that double-down. Game Tantra ended up becoming an incubator. Later on, around 2007-2008, NASSCOM invited me to start the gaming forum. That gave me the opportunity to go around India and see how the ecosystem was developing. It was really just beginning to develop. 2010 and onwards it was a hockey-stick phenomenon, thanks to Angry Birds and Temple Run. It was like that the world over, and the same effect was taking place in India. Between 1997 and 2010, 13 years, we went from one company to perhaps 20 companies. From 2010 to 2017 we’re now at 250 companies. GamesBeat: Are they spread out, or are they concentrated? Rao: They’re all spread out. Definitely Bangalore, the Mumbai region, these are hubs. But they’re all over the place. A predominant number of these companies are early startups. I ended up watching this whole startup scene, and then I said, “Why are we trying to do all our own games? Why not create an incubator instead, for some of these young companies? They can benefit from our learning and experience.” We ran the incubator for some time. We don’t run it anymore, but it was a very good experience for us to do that. With the forum, which I continue to chair, our focus is really to say, “Let’s look at the mistakes that have been made, by others and by us.” Capital is very scarce. It’s still difficult for a game studio to raise money, or any startup in the game business. It’s pointless to see people make the same mistakes that have already been made by people before them. That’s why, in our conferences and our workshops – we also try to have city chapter meetups, in about seven cities, once a quarter — we encourage people to do postmortems, so they can share what worked, what failed, why they failed. That’s a good way to disseminate that experience. Hopefully new teams can benefit from that. Above: Dhruva’s original games included Bazzle Image Credit: Dhruva GamesBeat: At what point did you think about getting acquired? Rao: It’s strange. We never planned this. Ironically, over the last four or five years, I was looking to do an aggregation of services companies. I was driven by the thought that the supply side of game services is very fragmented. There aren’t many large players, unlike software services, where you have very large companies like Accenture. On the gaming side it’s very small companies. I thought there was an opportunity to aggregate good companies and create a larger platform with many service lines as an offering. I was pursuing that strategy, looking at other outsourcing companies with different service lines that complemented us, and trying to see if I could effect some kind of a roll-up. As I was doing this, we had Starbreeze as a client, a very good client, and one day early last year they said, “Hey, would you be interested in this?” It’s my duty to take back an offer when it comes to my shareholders, which I did. We liked them. The offer was very reasonable. The first question we had was whether we could continue to work with our current clients, and they had no problem with that. They didn’t want us to become a Starbreeze India. They wanted us to keep doing what we’re doing. We told them that we’ve aggregated the best talent in India, and the best talent in India needs to work on diverse projects. We wouldn’t be able to find that diversity if we were just working for one entity. They totally got that. There’s a change in the shareholding. They’re now the new owners. But they’ve told us very clearly to run the company the way it’s been run, do what we’ve been doing, continue to service the clients we already have. At the same time, it allows them to have deeper engagements with us. We can be more closely involved with their process. GamesBeat: Is there any one company out there to rival you right now? Including companies in other countries? Rao: The way I see the game services business, the demand outstrips supply. Right now there’s nobody fighting for work. There’s plenty of work to go around for the good teams, the ones that are established as reliable partners and have a high level of quality. There isn’t even a point in considering—I mean, you’re a rival if there’s a scarcity of work and everyone’s bidding for the same job and someone takes away a job that could have come to you. But the situation is quite the opposite. We have to turn down work, because there’s so much out there. We’re not able to scale fast enough. Above: Mark Skaggs, speaking at GamesBeat 2015. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat GamesBeat: Mark Skaggs [the creator of games like FarmVille] going over to India was a big moment. Rao: It’s very good. I remember I met Mark a few months after he’d moved on from Zynga. It was at GDC two or three years back. I remember telling him to look at doing something where he could look back and say he left a massive mark. He’s already done that in the U.S., with FarmVille. It’ll always be a defining moment. But I remember saying he should come out to India. He’d attended our conference, done a workshop and a keynote, and he was really good with people. Everybody wanted to talk to him, and he was equally enthusiastic to talk to them. He was great as a mentor. We need people like him. Indians are smart, but they just lack the experience. Then a few months later I read that he’s coming to India. We’ll see more of that, I think, as India starts to become—clearly it’s the last big market waiting to happen. There’s been a lot of people telling me, “You’ve been singing this song for so long. You’re forever the optimist. But when is it really going to happen?” Give it time. It’s going to take some time, but is there any doubt that it’ll happen? It’s a young population. You have more smartphones there than in most other countries. There’s been a data revolution taking place. Everyone’s consuming more data. It’s going to happen. GamesBeat: Do you have any particular tasks at hand for your new owner? Rao: They’ve basically told us to do what we’ve been doing and grow the business. Just keep up the good work.

By STEPHEN BRAUN and CHAD DAY Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump was not aware that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had worked to further the interests of the government of Turkey before appointing him, the White House said Thursday. The comments came two days after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Turkey's government. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called the action "an affirmation of the president's decision to ask General Flynn to resign." At the White House, asked whether Trump knew about Flynn's work before he appointed him as national security adviser, press secretary Sean Spicer said, "I don't believe that that was known." Pence said in an interview later with Fox News that he also did not know about Flynn's paid work. Flynn and his company filed the registration paperwork describing $530,000 worth of lobbying before Election Day on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. In an interview with The Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn did so after pressure from Justice Department officials. The filing this week was the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency's first acknowledgement that his consulting business furthered the interests of a foreign government while he was working as a top adviser to Trump's presidential campaign. Flynn's disclosure that his lobbying - from August through November- may have benefited Turkey's authoritarian government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came as Flynn has drawn scrutiny from the FBI for his contacts with Russian officials. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. In paperwork filed with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm acknowledged that his lobbying "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." The lobbying contract ended after Trump's election in November, according to the paperwork. A spokesman for Flynn, Price Floyd, said the general was not available for an interview Thursday. Floyd referred the AP to Flynn's filing in response to questions about why he and his firm had decided to register this week. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. The Turkish Embassy also didn't respond to questions from the AP. Spicer said he didn't know what Flynn had disclosed about his background and lobbying work during the White House's vetting of him for appointment as national security adviser. Spicer said Flynn was free to do the lobbying work because it occurred while he was a private citizen. "There's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork if filed," Spicer said. He declined to say whether Trump would have appointed Flynn if he had known about the lobbying. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Flynn's newly disclosed lobbying would not have violated that pledge because it occurred before he joined the Trump administration in January, but the pledge precludes Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. More than a month before Flynn was appointed as national security adviser, news accounts and Democratic senators had raised questions about potential conflicts of interest regarding Flynn's work for the Turkish company. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., criticized Flynn's work and late disclosure again Thursday as troubling. "Gen. Flynn's behavior seems to be part of a larger pattern of poor judgment from members of this administration," she said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement that Flynn should return any foreign money he received. "This astonishing admission is more appalling evidence of foreign entanglements and conflicts of interest involving the Trump team," he said. He said a special prosecutor should be appointed to look into ties between Trump officials and foreign governments. Alptekin told the AP that Justice Department officials had pushed for Flynn and his firm to register as foreign agents in recent weeks. He said the filing was a response to "political pressure" and he did not agree with Flynn's decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. He also said that he had asked for some of his money back because of his dissatisfaction with the company's performance. "I disagree with the filing," he said in a phone call from Istanbul. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government." Flynn's consulting firm had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive disclosures about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. Flynn Intel and S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying pressured congressional aides to investigate a cleric who Erdogan had accused of directing a botched coup last summer. The two firms orchestrated meetings with U.S. officials- including congressional staffers and Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, a Republican - as well as journalists. They also worked on research, informational materials and a video on the cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Flynn met privately in September in New York with two senior Turkish government officials, including the government's ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn's company did not name the officials, but the current Turkish energy minister is Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan's son-in-law. Alptekin told the AP he set up the meeting at a New York hotel between Flynn and the two officials while the officials were attending U.N. sessions and a separate conference Alptekin had arranged. Alptekin is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Erdogan, who has accelerated a crackdown against the nation's weakening secularist faction since the failed coup last summer. Erdogan has accused cleric Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel's work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report.

Review: The Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti is the first real 4K GPU, but who drives it better, AMD or Intel? By Joel Hruska on March 9, 2017 at 9:00 am Comment Today, Nvidia launched the GTX 1080 Ti ($699), its new highest-end consumer GPU. This release follows a pattern Nvidia established with the GTX 700 series back in 2013 of releasing a new workstation / prosumer GPU at the highest end of the market (the original Titan back then), followed by a cheaper consumer variant some months later. The “Ti” cards have historically been much better values than the Titan family, and we expect to see that trend continue here as well. The GTX 1080 Ti is a GP102-based design with 3,584 GPU cores, 224 texture units, and 88 ROPS (3584:224:88). Its base clock is 1480MHz with a 1582MHz boost clock, and it features 11GB of RAM as opposed to the 12GB buffer on the Titan X. Nvidia has stated they expect the GTX 1080 Ti to equal or surpass the Titan X’s performance, making this card a far more cost-efficient choice compared with its $1,200 predecessor. Part of those gains come courtesy of the 1080 Ti’s increased memory speeds (courtesy of cleaner RAM signaling, as shown above). While it uses an unusual 352-bit memory bus compared with the Titan X’s 384-bit architecture, the 1080 Ti compensates for its narrower pipe with higher memory clocks. Where the Titan X used 10Gbps RAM, the 1080 Ti relies on 11 Gbps memory, for a very slight increase in overall memory bandwidth (480GB/s versus 484GB/s). The cooler is familiar, but power efficiency improvements and better cooling performance (according to NV) make this a new twist on a classic design. Nvidia has promised that the GTX 1080 Ti will be an average of 35% faster than the GTX 1080, and while we don’t have a 1080 to directly compare against, our comparisons against the 1070 suggest they largely hit that target. Product positioning, review focus The 1080 Ti arrives at an unusually quiet time in the GPU industry. When AMD announced that it would refresh its midrange GPUs with its 14nm Polaris architecture, it implied that its new high-end GPU family, codenamed Vega, would arrive by the end of the year. That schedule has since slipped by a full six months, with Vega now expected sometime in the second quarter. By delaying, AMD has opened an unprecedented gap in its own high-end GPU lineup. By the time the RX Vega launches, it will have been nearly two years since AMD launched Fury X. It’s not unusual for AMD or Nvidia to enjoy a 3-6 month lead over the other, and longer periods are not unheard of, but two years is higher than anything we’ve seen from either company… ever. Unfortunately, our ability to compare the GTX 1080 Ti against other Nvidia GPUs is limited as well. Nvidia was neither able to provide nor assist us with acquiring a GTX 1080 (the most logical point of comparison) and our own efforts to secure a sample in time for this review were unsuccessful. The GTX 980 Ti and older Maxwell Titan X were both available for testing, but we already know how those cards perform — they’re between 0 and 10% slower than the GTX 1070 we’ve already tested. At its core, a review is designed to answer questions that a reader might have about a particular part. Rather than writing a 3,000-word exercise to answer a question we already know, we decided to tackle the 1080 Ti from a different angle. Last week, AMD launched Ryzen, its biggest CPU architectural refresh in 15 years. While the Ryzen 7 1800X is an amazing chip in most respects, its 1080p gaming performance was significantly lower than Intel’s Broadwell-E in our handful of gaming tests. The launch of the GTX 1080 Ti gives us an interesting opportunity to examine whether AMD’s new Zen architecture can compete against Intel in multiple games and resolutions, including extremely demanding 4K gaming scenarios. Testing against the most powerful GPU on the planet helps ensure we’re getting the best look at the long term scaling prospects for Ryzen that we can. We’ve also tested the GTX 1070, to see how both CPU manufacturers’ fare with a lower-end, but still quite powerful, Pascal GPU. Test Setup There were two plausible CPUs to pick for this review — either the Broadwell-E 6900K, which compares directly with the Ryzen 7 1800X in core count and clock speed, or the Core i7-7700K, which is Intel’s top mainstream part (there wasn’t time to benchmark a third system). In this case, we opted for the 6900K, since that’s the Intel CPU closest to Ryzen’s overall value proposition. Chances are, if you buy a $500 CPU, you’re buying it for multi-threading, with gaming as an important option to serious hobby. We had to compromise somewhat on memory configurations due to early Ryzen motherboard BIOSes offering limited compatibility with high-speed, high-capacity DDR4-3200. We tested Ryzen 7 1800X with 16GB of DDR4-3200 (two DIMMs), and our Broadwell-E system with 16GB (4 DIMMs) of DDR4-2667. The Broadwell-E still enjoys a substantial memory bandwidth advantage over Ryzen thanks to its quad-channel memory configuration, the while Ryzen 7 1800X has the best memory configuration we could give it. Our GTX 1070 tests were run using the Nvidia Forceware 376.88 driver, while our GTX 1080 Ti used the 378.78 release driver. We attempted to use the 378.78 driver for our GTX 1070 tests as well, but the card proved unstable and we fell back to the earlier release for both our Intel and AMD benchmarks. Speaking of the GTX 1070, we’re tapping the Gigabyte G1 Gaming GPU we reviewed last fall for this review. Benchmark results All our benchmarks were run 3x and averaged. We use different levels of antialiasing depending on the title; this is disclosed in the graphs themselves. Note that while we ran some of the same benchmarks in our Ryzen 7 1800X review, we used different detail settings and resolutions in every case. The results are not comparable. As always, you can enlarge each slide in the slideshow below by clicking on it. The slide will open in a new window. Evaluating the GTX 1080 Ti The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti isn’t just a faster GPU than anything we’ve seen at this price point before, it’s also the first genuine 4K GPU I’d argue we’ve ever seen on the market. The GTX 1080 Ti, sans cooler. Click to enlarge Oh, sure, both AMD and Nvidia have talked about 4K gaming. They’ve talked about it for years. But look back at GPU reviews, and you find reviewers often making compromises to hit these higher resolutions at playable frame rates. With the 1080 Ti, you don’t have to make compromises on anything. Even in our Metro Last Light Redux and Rise of the Tomb Raider benchmarks, both of which use super-sampled antialiasing, the GTX 1080 Ti returns playable frame rates — and you could nearly double its scores just by turning SSAA off. I would’ve liked, of course, to include a GTX 1080 or to have a GPU from AMD that could compete at this level of performance, but in this case, the math speaks for itself. How good a deal the GTX 1080 Ti is over the 1070 is a matter of what resolution you intend to play at. At 1080p or 1440p, the gains are smaller and the 1080 Ti is less of a good deal, unless you know you plan to upgrade your monitor in the near future. At 4K, the 1080 Ti almost always improves performance by 1.5x – 1.6x over the 1070. While that’s not in-line with the card’s MSRP (at $700 it costs 2x what the 1070 does), it’s hard to argue it’s a bad value when the objective improvement to performance is high enough to move games at top detail levels from “slow-ish” to “fluid” in so many cases. Should you buy one? This is always a tricky question to answer with luxury cards. $700 is a lot of money to spend on anything, including a graphics card. Whether you consider a GPU like the 1080 Ti should really hinge on when you intend to make the jump to a resolution like 3440×1440 or 4K. If your primary display is a 1080p or 1440p panel and you don’t plan to upgrade for at least the next 12 months, I wouldn’t buy a 1080 Ti right now. By the time you’re ready to pull the trigger on a monitor that would benefit from a card like this, Vega (and possibly even Nvidia’s next-generation Volta) will both be in-market. If, on the other hand, you’ve either recently upgraded or plan to do so in the next few months, the 1080 Ti is literally impossible to beat. Vega may offer it some competition come June, but I recommend hardware based on what you can do with it today, not how it may perform against an unlaunched part three months from now. As of today, the GTX 1080 Ti is the first GPU that can drive 4K at 60 FPS or above with little-to-no need to turn down visual settings. That’s worth a recommendation all on its own. The AMD vs. Intel question So how did AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X fare against Intel’s Core i7-6900K? The graph below compares the average difference between the two CPUs at every resolution. A score of 100% would mean that Ryzen and Broadwell-E tied; a score of 101% means that Broadwell-E was 1% faster than Ryzen across our entire battery of tests, etc. At 1080p, Intel’s Broadwell-E maintains an average frame rate that’s 8-9% higher than Ryzen 7 1800X’s. At 1440p, that difference shrinks to 4-7%. By 4K, the two CPUs are essentially tied. That’s more important than it might seem. The entire point of testing the GTX 1080 Ti with these two CPUs was to throw the world’s fastest GPU at Ryzen 7 and see if the CPU could keep the GPU fed. One of our concerns, after seeing Ryzen’s weak 1080p showing in our CPU review, was that the chip might not be able to keep up with a substantially faster GPU than the 1070 we used in that article. Now, we know it can. Even on a game-by-game basis, Ryzen and Broadwell often gain a similar amount of performance when moving from the 1070 to the 1080 Ti. This is particularly true when moving from 1440p to 4K. Gamers in pursuit of every last frame of performance at every resolution may want to opt for Intel, but those interested in Ryzen’s performance-per-dollar ratio don’t have anything to worry about on the gaming side of the equation. Those of you who used to prefer AMD CPUs and Nvidia GPUs have something to look forward to — as do Nvidia GPU fans in general.

Flynn, President Donald Trumpâ€šÃ„Ã´s former national security adviser, who was fired from the White House last month, has registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for work that may have aided the Turkish government in exchange for $530,000. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who was fired from his prominent White House job last month, has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work before Election Day that may have aided the Turkish government. Paperwork filed Tuesday with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit said Flynn and his firm were voluntarily registering for lobbying from August through November that “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” It was filed by a lawyer on behalf of the former U.S. Army lieutenant general and intelligence chief. After his firm’s work on behalf of a Turkish company was done, Flynn agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. A Turkish businessman who hired Flynn’s consulting firm told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the amended filings were made in response to pressure from Justice Department officials in recent weeks. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, said in a phone call from Istanbul that the changes were a response to “political pressure” and he did not agree with Flynn’s decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. “I disagree with the filing,” he said. “It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government.” Flynn’s attorney did not respond to questions about whether the Justice Department or FBI had contacted Flynn about his lobbying activities. Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive transparency about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. In the filings with the Justice Department, Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, noted the documents served as a termination of the registration, saying the firm had ceased operations in November, the same month the lobbying contract ended. Calls to phone numbers associated with Flynn and his firm weren’t answered. Kelner, his attorney, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. Reached Wednesday afternoon, an official at the Turkish embassy in Washington said he would refer the questions to the embassy spokesman. The spokesman did not immediately respond. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice-President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. As a key member of Trump’s transition team last December, Flynn spoke by phone several times with Kislyak during the period when former President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and levied new sanctions in response to Russian election-related hacking. According to the new paperwork, Flynn’s firm took on the Turkish-related lobbying work in August while he was a top Trump campaign surrogate. Flynn Intel disclosed in its filing that in mid-September, the company was invited by Alptekin to meet with Turkish officials in New York. Alptekin acknowledged Wednesday that he had set up the meeting between Flynn and the two officials. He said they met at an undisclosed hotel in New York. Alptekin said Flynn happened to be in New York while the Turkish officials were attending United Nations sessions and a separate conference that Alptekin had arranged. “I asked one of Gen. Flynn’s staff if he was in town and would be available to meet and they got in touch with him,” said Alptekin, who owns several businesses in Turkey. Among those officials, the documents said, were Turkey’s ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn’s company did not name the officials but reported the two worked for Turkey’s government “to the best of Flynn Intel Group’s current understanding.” Alptekin, who previously told The Associated Press he has no relationship with the Turkish government, is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. Erdogan’s power base is Turkey’s Islamic voters, and since a failed coup in July, he has accelerated a crackdown against the nation’s weakening secularist faction. Erdogan has accused cleric Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives. The Obama administration did not comply, and Gulen still lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel’s work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric, including a meeting in October between Flynn’s firm and a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee. Flynn Intel arranged the meeting to discuss a technology developed by another Flynn Intel client. But after discussing the technology, the firm changed the subject to Gulen, pressuring the committee to hold congressional hearings to investigate the cleric, said a U.S. official with direct knowledge of Flynn Intel’s work. That request was rebuffed. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The official said Flynn Intel never revealed whom it was representing during the meeting. The October meeting came as Flynn was working on an op-ed promoting Turkey’s political and business affairs that was later published in The Hill, a Washington-based political newspaper. Flynn wrote that Turkey needed support and echoed Erdogan’s warnings about Gulen, whom he called a “shady” Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Flynn argued that Gulen should not be given safe harbour in the U.S. In the new filing, Flynn disclosed that in writing the op-ed, he relied on research conducted as part of the Inovo BV contract. Flynn’s firm also admitted it conducted “open-source research,” directed by Inovo, focusing on Gulen. The results “were provided to Inovo” and to a separate lobbying firm, S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying, a public relations company retained by Flynn Intel. The materials were aimed for distribution to “third parties,” but because the project terminated early, “the full scope of the contract was not performed,” according to the filings. In the filings, Flynn emphasized that neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government directed him to write the op-ed. He also said he was not paid for the op-ed. Alptekin said he had been opposed to Flynn’s writing the op-ed, although he agreed with its anti-Gulen and pro-Turkley stances. Alptekin added that he had asked for some of the $530,000 in payments to the Flynn Intel Group to be returned to him because of his dissatisfaction with the company’s performance. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report. 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Flynn’s company did not name the officials but reported the two worked for Turkey’s government “to the best of Flynn Intel Group’s current understanding.” Alptekin, who previously told The Associated Press he has no relationship with the Turkish government, is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. Erdogan’s power base is Turkey’s Islamic voters, and since a failed coup in July, he has accelerated a crackdown against the nation’s weakening secularist faction. Erdogan has accused cleric Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives. The Obama administration did not comply, and Gulen still lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel’s work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric, including a meeting in October between Flynn’s firm and a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee. Flynn Intel arranged the meeting to discuss a technology developed by another Flynn Intel client. But after discussing the technology, the firm changed the subject to Gulen, pressuring the committee to hold congressional hearings to investigate the cleric, said a U.S. official with direct knowledge of Flynn Intel’s work. That request was rebuffed. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The official said Flynn Intel never revealed whom it was representing during the meeting. The October meeting came as Flynn was working on an op-ed promoting Turkey’s political and business affairs that was later published in The Hill, a Washington-based political newspaper. Flynn wrote that Turkey needed support and echoed Erdogan’s warnings about Gulen, whom he called a “shady” Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Flynn argued that Gulen should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. In the new filing, Flynn disclosed that in writing the op-ed, he relied on research conducted as part of the Inovo BV contract. Flynn’s firm also admitted it conducted “open-source research,” directed by Inovo, focusing on Gulen. The results “were provided to Inovo” and to a separate lobbying firm, S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying, a public relations company retained by Flynn Intel. The materials were aimed for distribution to “third parties,” but because the project terminated early, “the full scope of the contract was not performed,” according to the filings. In the filings, Flynn emphasized that neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government directed him to write the op-ed. He also said he was not paid for the op-ed. Alptekin said he had been opposed to Flynn’s writing the op-ed, although he agreed with its anti-Gulen and pro-Turkley stances. Alptekin added that he had asked for some of the $530,000 in payments to the Flynn Intel Group to be returned to him because of his dissatisfaction with the company’s performance.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who was fired from his prominent White House job last month, has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work before Election Day that may have aided the Turkish government. Paperwork filed Tuesday with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit said Flynn and his firm were voluntarily registering for lobbying from August through November that "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." It was filed by a lawyer on behalf of the former U.S. Army lieutenant general and intelligence chief. After his firm's work on behalf of a Turkish company was done, Flynn agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. A Turkish businessman who hired Flynn's consulting firm told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the amended filings were made in response to pressure from Justice Department officials in recent weeks. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, said in a phone call from Istanbul that the changes were a response to "political pressure" and he did not agree with Flynn's decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. "I disagree with the filing," he said. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government." Flynn's attorney did not respond to questions about whether the Justice Department or FBI had contacted Flynn about his lobbying activities. Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive transparency about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. In the filings with the Justice Department, Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, noted the documents served as a termination of the registration, saying the firm had ceased operations in November, the same month the lobbying contract ended. Calls to phone numbers associated with Flynn and his firm weren't answered. Kelner, his attorney, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. Reached Wednesday afternoon, an official at the Turkish embassy in Washington said he would refer the questions to the embassy spokesman. The spokesman did not immediately respond. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. As a key member of Trump's transition team last December, Flynn spoke by phone several times with Kislyak during the period when former President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and levied new sanctions in response to Russian election-related hacking. According to the new paperwork, Flynn's firm took on the Turkish-related lobbying work in August while he was a top Trump campaign surrogate. Flynn Intel disclosed in its filing that in mid-September, the company was invited by Alptekin to meet with Turkish officials in New York. Alptekin acknowledged Wednesday that he had set up the meeting between Flynn and the two officials. He said they met at an undisclosed hotel in New York. Alptekin said Flynn happened to be in New York while the Turkish officials were attending United Nations sessions and a separate conference that Alptekin had arranged. "I asked one of Gen. Flynn's staff if he was in town and would be available to meet and they got in touch with him," said Alptekin, who owns several businesses in Turkey. Among those officials, the documents said, were Turkey's ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn's company did not name the officials but reported the two worked for Turkey's government "to the best of Flynn Intel Group's current understanding."

It’s a clash of two premium devices. People buy them not because they need them but because they can afford them. The Porsche Design Book One doesn’t ship until April but its specs and features are already known. Hence, it will be interesting to compare the two. The two are very premium devices that command a significant price. While the Book One costs US$2,495 (US$3,330 approx), the Surface Book commands a price of US$2,699 (AU$3,600 approx). The Porsche laptop is thinner than the Surface Book but not lighter. The Book One is an anodised aluminium in a matte, silvery finish, whereas, the Surface Book is magnesium with matte, silvery finish. The Microsoft Surface Book has a Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge, which is a complicated mechanism. It has an articulated structure and Muscle Wire Lock for releasing the display. However, this makes the Surface Book an inch thicker than the Porsche Design Book One, which has both a 360-degree hinge and a detachable display. There’s a small button that detaches the display. According to PC World, users of both devices enjoy enhanced system settings, such as, Windows 10 Pro. The Book One has a clear advantage over the Microsoft Surface Book as it comes with an Intel 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) Core i7-7500U processor. It is a dual-core chipset that runs at 2.7GHz up to 3.5GHz. The Surface Book comes with Intel’s 6th-generation Skylake CPU. Both the laptops have 16GB RAM and 512GB internal storage. In terms of GPU, tech experts find the Surface Book better than Porsche’s laptop. Microsoft has incorporated Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 965M. It alternates with integrated Intel HD 520 graphics. However, this makes the Surface Book hotter and thicker than the Design Book One, which has Intel’s integrated HD Graphics 620. As it’s Porsche, experts expected a better and speedier GPU. In terms of display, the Surface Book has a 13.5-inch PixelSense IPS display with a 3,000 x 2,000 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio, plus 10-point multi-touch. The Porsche Design Book One has a 13.3-inch QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) IPS display with an LED backlight and 16:9 aspect ratio. The 10-point multi-touch display uses Gorilla Glass 4. The Microsoft Surface Book and Porsche Design Book One use Microsoft’s Precision Touchpad. Both have styluses that magnetically attach to the side of the display. They also have 5MP front cameras and infrared cameras for Windows Hello. There’s an 8MP rear camera in the Microsoft Surface Book. It does not have USB Type-C ports but only two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, SD card slot and mini DisplayPort. The Porsche Design Book One has a USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 3.0 Type-A ports in the keyboard dock and a microSD card reader. The display has a USB 3.1 Type-C Thunderbolt port.

Microsoft is the second biggest cloud company in the US after Amazon, and if it moves even a small bit of its business away from Intel’s products, it threatens the veteran chipmaker’s most lucrative revenue stream, responsible for $7.5 billion in operating profit last year. Speaking to Bloomberg, Microsoft’s vice president of cloud computing, Jason Zander, said the company had made a “significant commitment” to ARM servers — porting its Windows Server operating system onto ARM-powered designs by Qualcomm and Cavium, which were unveiled at Open Compute. The company won’t say how widely it plans on deploying ARM’s chips, and notes that these systems haven’t been integrated into consumer-facing services. Nevertheless, its intentions are clear. Windows ARM servers are coming — we just don’t know when “We wouldn't even bring something to a conference if we didn't think this was a committed project and something that's part of our road map,” Zander told Bloomberg. “It's not deployed into production yet, but that is the next logical step.” These ARM design are part of Microsoft’s next generation of server hardware, intended to cut operational costs. New hardware is being developed with a number of companies under the name Project Olympus. Other designs include systems running on AMD’s Naples processor, and on a variant of Intel’s own Skylake chips. Bloomberg reports that some of this new hardware will make its way into Microsoft’s data centers “later this year.” However, it’s not clear if this refers to the designs using ARM processors. Qualcomm’s Centriq 2400 server design, running on ARM chips. This is a seismic change in the chip industry, but not an unexpected one. Microsoft has been slowly pivoting away from Intel’s products for years, and the switch will affect consumers, too. Last December, for example, Microsoft announced that a new generation of Windows 10 machines running on ARM chips were in the pipeline. The change in underlying hardware could mean devices that are more energy-efficient, and that offer cellular connectivity for less. This move could also hurt Intel, which is suffering as the PC market continues to shrink year after year. However, the sheer scale of Intel’s business (it’s the biggest chip maker on the planet) means any change in the industry will be slow. When talking about ARM-powered Windows 10 machines, Microsoft admitted that Intel chips would still provide a more powerful experience, and Intel is confident the same is true when it comes to servers. A little more diversity in the market won’t mean Intel isn’t still a force to be reckoned with.

The comments came two days after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Turkey's government. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called the action "an affirmation of the president's decision to ask General Flynn to resign." At the White House, asked whether Trump knew about Flynn's work before he appointed him as national security adviser, press secretary Sean Spicer said, "I don't believe that that was known." Pence said in an interview later with Fox News that he also did not know about Flynn's paid work. Flynn and his company filed the registration paperwork describing $530,000 worth of lobbying before Election Day on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. In an interview with The Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn did so after pressure from Justice Department officials. The filing this week was the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency's first acknowledgement that his consulting business furthered the interests of a foreign government while he was working as a top adviser to Trump's presidential campaign. Flynn's disclosure that his lobbying — from August through November— may have benefited Turkey's authoritarian government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came as Flynn has drawn scrutiny from the FBI for his contacts with Russian officials. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. In paperwork filed with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm acknowledged that his lobbying "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." The lobbying contract ended after Trump's election in November, according to the paperwork. A spokesman for Flynn, Price Floyd, said the general was not available for an interview Thursday. Floyd referred the AP to Flynn's filing in response to questions about why he and his firm had decided to register this week. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. The Turkish Embassy also didn't respond to questions from the AP. Spicer said he didn't know what Flynn had disclosed about his background and lobbying work during the White House's vetting of him for appointment as national security adviser. Spicer said Flynn was free to do the lobbying work because it occurred while he was a private citizen. "There's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork if filed," Spicer said. He declined to say whether Trump would have appointed Flynn if he had known about the lobbying. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Flynn's newly disclosed lobbying would not have violated that pledge because it occurred before he joined the Trump administration in January, but the pledge precludes Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. More than a month before Flynn was appointed as national security adviser, news accounts and Democratic senators had raised questions about potential conflicts of interest regarding Flynn's work for the Turkish company. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., criticized Flynn's work and late disclosure again Thursday as troubling. "Gen. Flynn's behavior seems to be part of a larger pattern of poor judgment from members of this administration," she said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement that Flynn should return any foreign money he received. "This astonishing admission is more appalling evidence of foreign entanglements and conflicts of interest involving the Trump team," he said. He said a special prosecutor should be appointed to look into ties between Trump officials and foreign governments. Alptekin told the AP that Justice Department officials had pushed for Flynn and his firm to register as foreign agents in recent weeks. He said the filing was a response to "political pressure" and he did not agree with Flynn's decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. He also said that he had asked for some of his money back because of his dissatisfaction with the company's performance. "I disagree with the filing," he said in a phone call from Istanbul. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government." Flynn's consulting firm had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive disclosures about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. Flynn Intel and S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying pressured congressional aides to investigate a cleric who Erdogan had accused of directing a botched coup last summer. The two firms orchestrated meetings with U.S. officials— including congressional staffers and Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, a Republican — as well as journalists. They also worked on research, informational materials and a video on the cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Flynn met privately in September in New York with two senior Turkish government officials, including the government's ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn's company did not name the officials, but the current Turkish energy minister is Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan's son-in-law. Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

Alptekin is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Erdogan, who has accelerated a crackdown against the nation's weakening secularist faction since the failed coup last summer. Erdogan has accused cleric Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel's work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report.

Jason Hall, Anders Bylund, and Cory Renauer (TMFVelvetHammer) Mar 9, 2017 at 7:47AM Some of the best investments can be the most popular. On the other hand, getting caught up in the herd -- while ignoring what's actually happening with the business itself -- can be a surefire way to leave yourself with a smaller investment than you started with.  Three of our top contributors have identified three stocks that are popular with investors right now but could also be poisonous to own. This includes computer-chip designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), small-in-size (but big-in-risk) biotech Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX), and mortgage REIT giant Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NYSE:NLY).  Our contributors explain why these stocks are worth avoiding. Image source: Getty Images. If you've been considering one of these stocks for your portfolio, make sure you've studied them closely. They may be popular, but they might also be toxic.  How long can this rocket ride last? Anders Bylund (Advanced Micro Devices): AMD sure fits the bill if you're looking for a popular stock. The chip designer inspires impressive volumes of online forum discussions, and daily trading volumes are downright crazy for a moderately sized midcap stock. This would be great if AMD were a fresh-faced upstart or a solid turnaround story in the making, and investors just couldn't help to share a near-certain ticket to big gains before the rally runs out of gas. Unfortunately, that's not what AMD is offering here. AMD's rocket-like run could end badly for investors. Image source: Getty Images. Share prices have risen more than fivefold over the last year. AMD is trading at price-to-sales ratios comparable to larger rival Intel, and a much richer price-to-book ratio. Again, this could make sense if AMD sported profit margins in Intel's class, or superior growth trends. But Intel remains a stoutly profitable pillar of the semiconductor industry while AMD's profit margins have been negative for years. Yes, AMD is doing many things right for the first time since dropping former CEO Dirk Meyer like a bad habit. Current leader, Lisa Su, has righted the sinking ship to some degree and AMD is turning out competitive chips these days. One of these days, the company might even turn a profit. But that's still more of a gamble than an investment thesis. And either way, share prices have shot up into nosebleed territory with little support from actual business results. Priced for absolute perfection, AMD must now deliver on every bit of the promises its new Ryzen and Polaris chip architectures have been making. All it takes is one manufacturing misstep, one equally fantastic product launch from a major rival, or one mistake at the negotiating table with PC builders -- and then the gains of 2016 could evaporate in a hurry. Stumbling without a safety net Cory Renauer (Novavax, Inc.): Although small-cap biotech stocks can inflate your portfolio overnight, they also have a tendency to let the air out. Sticking to companies taking multiple shots on goal is a great way to protect yourself. Unfortunately, Novavax's safety net is practically nonexistent. It isn't isn't running any clinical trials with new drug candidates other than a once-failed experimental respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. For decades efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent RSV have come up short, and it remains a leading cause of hospitalizations for infants and older adults. The first effective vaccine could generate billions in annual revenue and send Novavax's stock soaring. Image source: Getty Images. Unfortunately, Novavax's RSV candidate already stumbled once. The market hammered the stock last year after the company announced miserable late-stage trial results. In a trial with thousands of older adults, it failed to reduce the rate of infection versus a placebo. The company had already started another large trial with pregnant women to see if it will lower infection rates of newborn infants through their first year. Positive results could lift the stock, but in the meantime, the company is quickly depleting its cash reserves. It ended 2016 with $235.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, after burning through $255.5 million last year. Raising more equity to pay the bills would dilute shareholder value in the near term. Further out, another failure in the maternal immunization could be devastating. As much as I'd love to see the company succeed, it seems letting this stock into your portfolio could prove highly toxic. A good company on the wrong side of a cyclical shift Jason Hall (Annaly Capital Management, Inc.): Annaly Capital is as well-run a company as you'll find, and its 12-month dividend yield of nearly 11% at recent stock prices makes it incredibly appealing, and popular for investors chasing income.  However, because of the way the company makes a living, investors should think twice before making a big bet that the dividend will be dependable going forward. Annaly Capital makes money on the spread between what it pays for capital when it takes on debt and what it can collect in interest on the assets -- largely residential and commercial real estate debt it buys with the capital. And it's looking more and more as if we're moving from a decades-long period of falling interest rates, which had been great for Annaly's ability to grow earnings (and its dividend), to a cycle of flat-to-rising rates.  Annaly could turn into a yield trap soon. Image source: Getty Images. And where this could be a problem for Annaly and other REITs that focus on owning debt is that its cost of capital could increase more quickly than the rates it will be able to collect, narrowing the "spread" it gets and cutting profits. Frankly, that's a big reason its stock is yielding so much today -- the market seems to expect this will catch up to Annaly sooner or later, and the dividend will get cut.  If that happens, many of those income-chasing investors will quickly flee the stock and send it falling, adding the injury of capital losses to the insult of a slashed dividend. So before you rush into this potential dividend opportunity, don't discount the risk that it really is too good to be true.  Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel.

Microsoft tries ARM processors in the cloud with Qualcomm partnership by Todd Bishop on March 8, 2017 at 9:10 amMarch 8, 2017 at 9:33 am Comments   Share  30 Tweet Share  9 Reddit Email A server running Qualcomm Centriq ARM processors. (Microsoft Image) Microsoft has started testing out ARM processors, power-efficient chips best known for running smartphones and other mobile devices, to run portions of its cloud services and applications, the company said this morning. At the Open Compute Project Summit today, ARM chipmaker Qualcomm and Microsoft are expected to give a public demonstration of Windows Server powered by a Qualcomm Centriq 2400 processor. This technology is internal to Microsoft for now, but Qualcomm says the goal is to enable “a variety of cloud workloads to run on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.” Bloomberg News sees the use of ARM chips as “potentially imperiling Intel Corp.’s longtime dominance in the profitable market for data-center processors.” It’s the latest step in Microsoft’s open-source Project Olympus, in which the company is sharing hardware designs to be downloaded and improved by the engineering community. Microsoft did announce that it’s also collaborating with Intel, Nvidia and others on Project Olympus. Leendert van Doorn, a Microsoft distinguished engineer, described the ARM initiatives in this blog post. We have been working closely with multiple ARM suppliers, including Qualcomm and Cavium, on optimizing their hardware for our datacenter needs. One of the biggest hurdles to enable ARM servers is the software. Rather than trying to port every one of our many software components, we looked at where ARM servers are applicable and where they provide value to us. We found that they provide the most value for our cloud services, specifically our internal cloud applications such as search and indexing, storage, databases, big data and machine learning. These workloads all benefit from high-throughput computing. To enable these cloud services, we’ve ported a version of Windows Server, for our internal use only, to run on ARM architecture. We have ported language runtime systems and middleware components, and we have ported and evaluated applications, often running these workloads side-by-side with production workloads.

She is not here because of the International Women's Day strike. WIRED They called it Wintel. For decades, two companies worked side by side to build the very foundation of personal computing. Microsoft built the operating system—Windows—and Intel built the chips. But Wintel is no more. Sure, Windows will continue to run on Intel chips. But Wintel as a mighty alliance has died. It’s been fading for years, and this week Microsoft snuffed out the last of it. On Wednesday, from a conference stage in Silicon Valley, Microsoft told the world it plans on using ARM chips in the servers that underpin Windows Azure, the sweeping collection of cloud computing services that represents the company’s future. It was the most tactical of announcements, a carefully considered collection of words meant to shift computing’s balance of power. Microsoft has yet to actually put ARM chips in the data centers that run Azure. It merely pledged that it would. ‘We’ve seen these kinds of announcements before. The question is: How ready is the technology?’ Jason Waxman, Intel “All this is before we’ve actually seen a chip,” says Patrick Moorhead, the president and principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, a firm that closely follows the chip business. In other words, this announcement isn’t about technology—at least not yet. It’s little more than a push against Intel’s market power. Like Google and Amazon and others, it seems, Microsoft wants an added bargaining chip when buying computer chips from the biggest computer chip maker on Earth. The question: will it get what it wants? With online empires like Google and Amazon running on open source Linux and the citizens of the world spending so much of their time on iPhones and Android, the Windows operating system is no longer dominant. At the same time, Intel’s influence has diminished: Most of those mobile devices use ARM chips from other companies. But in one market, Intel still rules. Google, Amazon, and most other online services still run on Intel chips. In fact, these chips drive 99 percent of the world’s computer servers. But Google and Amazon don’t quite like that reality. Now it’s clear that Microsoft doesn’t either. The problem isn’t so much technology as economics. If you run a large online service, Intel pretty much offers the only option for decent server chips. No real market competition exists to keep prices down. At the same time, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft build their own servers and negotiate their own chip prices in the process. Their online empires are so big, spanning hundreds of thousands of machines across the globe, they create chip markets unto themselves. By publicly pledging to use servers equipped with ARM processors from Qualcomm and Cavium, Microsoft is apparently looking for leverage when negotiating chip prices with Intel. “That sounds plausible to me,” says Intel vice president Jason Waxman. Consider this: In 2012, Intel vice president Diane Bryant told WIRED that Google bought more server chips from Intel than all but four other companies. And the other four actually sell servers. Google does not. It only builds servers for itself. As such, internet giants like Google represent the future of Intel’s server business—and indeed the entire server business. Sure, Intel will continue to sell chips to other companies. But increasingly, other companies run their operations on the cloud servers of Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Pulling Levers In theory, ARM server chips could also help Microsoft save money on electricity. Based on the same chip designs used in your smartphone, these processors use relatively little power. Across a worldwide network of data centers, those savings that can make a big difference. But that difference doesn’t mean much now, since viable ARM server chips don’t really exist. Qualcomm and Cavium are “sampling” their chips, which means they’ve built test versions. But both tell WIRED they won’t have finished chips until the end of the year. As Microsoft makes its chess move, you can’t overlook the reality of that the silicon isn’t finished. Google made a similar move about 18 months ago, publicly announcing that it would work to build servers around IBM’s OpenPower chip, another alternative to Intel. This move too was a way to gain leverage against Intel, after online giants publicly professed their interest in alternative server chips for years. But Intel still controls 99 percent of the market. “We’ve seen these kinds of announcements before,” says Intel’s Waxman. “The question is: How ready is the technology?” Related Stories Klint Finley Intel’s ‘New’ Factory Isn’t About Trump—It’s About Fixing Intel Cade Metz Google, Facebook, and Microsoft Are Remaking Themselves Around AI Cade Metz Intel Looks to a New Chip to Power the Coming Age of AI Google and Microsoft may want added competition in the chip market, but that doesn’t happen without many years of work. Intel controls 99 percent of the market because it has a mature technology that can run all the server software companies like Google and Microsoft require. Even if chipmakers like Qualcomm and Cavium build viable server chips, the market won’t really enjoy real competition until a broader community of companies builds the foundational software that allows these chips to operate in the real world. For Microsoft, this poses a particular problem. Unlike the rest of the big players, which use Linux, Microsoft still runs Windows in its data centers. While other companies have long worked to get Linux running on ARM server chips, Microsoft’s switch would represent the first effort with Windows. It can’t really benefit from what others have done—a common problem for Microsoft in world that revolves around open source software. Yes, Microsoft vice president Jason Zander tells WIRED that the company is already years into this project, that it wouldn’t be revealing the effort if it weren’t on solid ground. But at the very least, it’s a year until anyone will know how solid. The glory days of Wintel have passed. Microsoft wants to move on. But that may take a while. Go Back to Top.

Paperwork filed Tuesday with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit said Flynn and his firm were voluntarily registering for lobbying from August through November that “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” It was filed by a lawyer on behalf of the former U.S. Army lieutenant general and intelligence chief. After his firm’s work on behalf of a Turkish company was done, Flynn agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign government or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. A Turkish businessman who hired Flynn’s consulting firm told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the amended filings were made in response to pressure from Justice Department officials in recent weeks. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, said in a phone call from Istanbul that the changes were a response to “political pressure” and he did not agree with Flynn’s decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. “I disagree with the filing,” he said. “It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government.” Flynn’s attorney did not respond to questions about whether the Justice Department or FBI had contacted Flynn about his lobbying activities. Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive transparency about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. In the filings with the Justice Department, Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, noted they served as a termination of the registration, saying the firm had ceased operations in November, the same month the lobbying contract ended. Calls to phone numbers associated with Flynn and his firm weren’t answered. Kelner, his attorney, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. Reached Wednesday afternoon, an official at the Turkish embassy in Washington said he would refer the questions to the embassy spokesman. The spokesman did not immediately respond. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. As a key member of Trump’s transition team last December, Flynn spoke by phone several times with Kislyak during the period when former President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and levied new sanctions in response to Russian election-related hacking. According to the new paperwork, Flynn’s firm took on the Turkish-related lobbying work in August while he was a top Trump campaign surrogate. Flynn Intel disclosed in its filing that in mid-September, the company was invited by Alptekin to meet with Turkish officials in New York. Alptekin acknowledged Wednesday that he had set up the meeting between Flynn and the two officials. He said they met at an undisclosed hotel in New York. Alptekin said Flynn happened to be in New York while the Turkish officials were attending United Nations sessions and a separate conference Alptekin had arranged. “I asked one of Gen. Flynn’s staff if he was in town and would be available to meet and they got in touch with him,” said Alptekin, who owns several businesses in Turkey. Among those officials, the documents said, were Turkey’s ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn’s company did not name the officials but reported the two worked for Turkey’s government “to the best of Flynn Intel Group’s current understanding.” Alptekin, who previously told The Associated Press he has no relationship with the Turkish government, is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. Erdogan’s power base is Turkey’s Islamic voters, and since a failed coup in July, he has accelerated a crackdown against the nation’s weakening secularist faction. Erdogan has accused cleric Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives. The Obama administration did not comply, and Gulen still lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel’s work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric, including a meeting in October between Flynn’s firm and a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee. Flynn Intel arranged the meeting to discuss a technology developed by another Flynn Intel client. But after discussing the technology, the firm changed the subject to Gulen, pressuring the committee to hold congressional hearings to investigate the cleric, said a U.S. official with direct knowledge of Flynn Intel’s work. That request was rebuffed. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The official said Flynn Intel never revealed whom it was representing during the meeting. The October meeting came as Flynn was working on an op-ed promoting Turkey’s political and business affairs that was later published in The Hill, a Washington-based political newspaper. Flynn wrote that Turkey needed support and echoed Erdogan’s warnings about Gulen, whom he called a “shady” Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Flynn argued that Gulen should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. In the new filing, Flynn disclosed that in writing the op-ed, he relied on research conducted as part of the Inovo BV contract. Flynn’s firm also admitted it conducted “open-source research,” directed by Inovo, focusing on Gulen. The results “were provided to Inovo” and to a separate lobbying firm, S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying, a public relations company retained by Flynn Intel. The materials were aimed for distribution to “third parties,” but because the project terminated early, “the full scope of the contract was not performed,” according to the filings. In the filings, Flynn emphasized that neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government directed him to write the op-ed. He also said he was not paid for the op-ed. Alptekin said he had been opposed to Flynn’s writing the op-ed, although he agreed with its anti-Gulen and pro-Turkley stances. Alptekin added that he had asked for some of the $530,000 in payments to the Flynn Intel Group to be returned to him because of his dissatisfaction with the company’s performance. ——— Associated Press writer Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report.     Tags: flynn, turkish, flynn, alptekin, justice, government, Other stories from today: Mom who live-streamed 10-year-old son driving due in court Mosul museum retaken from Islamic State Panama ex-dictator Noriega is critical after brain surgeries     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of electric cars?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 9 March 2017 | MYT 5:03 PM Microsoft pledges to use ARM server chips in challenge to Intel by dina bassandian king Upsetting the apple cart: Microsoft is planning to incorporate the ARM chips as it develops a new cloud server design, which could pave the way for a real challenge to Intel. — Reuters Microsoft Corp is committing to use chips based on ARM Holdings Plc technology in the machines that run its cloud services, potentially imperilling Intel Corp’s longtime dominance in the profitable market for datacentre processors.  Microsoft has developed a version of its Windows operating system for servers using ARM processors, working with Qualcomm Inc and Cavium Inc. The software maker is now testing these chips for tasks like search, storage, machine learning and big data, said Jason Zander, vice president of Microsoft's Azure cloud division.  The company isn’t yet running the processors – known for being more power-efficient and offering more choice in vendors – in any customer-facing networks, and wouldn't specify how widespread they eventually will be.  ”It's not deployed into production yet, but that is the next logical step,” Zander said in an interview. “This is a significant commitment on behalf of Microsoft. We wouldn't even bring something to a conference if we didn't think this was a committed project and something that's part of our road map.”  Microsoft is planning to incorporate the ARM chips as it develops a new cloud server design, which it will discuss Wednesday at the Open Compute Project Summit in Santa Clara, California. The company is announcing new partners and components for the design, first unveiled last year, as it moves closer to putting the machines into its own datacentres later this year. Because the design is open-source, meaning it's freely available to be used and customised, other companies are also likely to use variations.  Both the server design, called Project Olympus, and Microsoft’s work with ARM-based processors reflect the software maker's push to use hardware innovations to cut costs, boost flexibility and stay competitive with Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, which also provide computing power, software and storage via the internet.  While large cloud companies have moved toward greater use of unbranded servers, storage and networking gear, Intel chips have remained one of the sole big-name products widely in use. Microsoft’s work with ARM, in progress for several years, could pave the way for a real challenge to Intel, which controls more than 99% of the market for server chips.  While Intel is among companies making components to work with the Project Olympus design, ARM-chip makers such as Qualcomm and Cavium are also in the running, increasing the chance that other server customers will begin to use these processors. ARM, which licenses its chip designs to manufacturers, is owned by Japan's Softbank Group Corp.  Any challenge to Intel's dominance in server chips is a threat to its most profitable business and main revenue driver as demand for PC processors continues to shrink. The company's Data Centre Group turned US$17.2bil (RM76.75bil) of sales into US$7.5bil (RM33.44bil) of operating profit in 2016, and Intel has been running ads that say, "98% of the cloud runs on Intel.”   Microsoft's server spending decisions have the potential to impact suppliers' bottom lines – its Azure service is No 2 in cloud infrastructure behind Amazon, and it's one of the biggest server buyers. Last month, computer maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co reported disappointing quarterly revenue, citing “significantly lower demand” from a major customer. That client was Microsoft, people familiar with the matter said.  This isn't the first time ARM manufacturers have taken aim at the server market. Other chipmakers have promised computer components – based on the ARM technology that dominates in mobile phones – that would loosen Intel's stranglehold, yet none have done so. That may be changing this year as Qualcomm, one of the few companies that can rival Intel's spending on research and design, begins offering its first server processor and as other chipmakers finally field long-promised chips that are capable of competing.  Microsoft will give an update on its work on Project Olympus today in a keynote speech by Kushagra Vaid, general manager of Azure Hardware Infrastructure at Microsoft, as part of a track of sessions on the Microsoft design at the conference. Partners including Qualcomm, Intel, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Samsung Electronics Co are making chips, servers and components for use in the Microsoft design, said Vaid, who spent 11 years at Intel before joining Microsoft.  One of those planned components is an add-in box made by Microsoft and chipmaker Nvidia Corp that plugs into the server to enable powerful processing for artificial intelligence tasks. The device, which runs Nvidia's graphics chips, lets Microsoft and other cloud providers more easily and cheaply host AI applications on their cloud networks. For customers, the product frees them from having to invest in the computing power needed to perform the complex training and analysing needed for tasks like machine learning, Nvidia chief executive officer Jen-Hsun Huang said.  ”In order to use deep learning you need a supercomputer and a platform that runs any and all AI tools. Startups would rather use their money to hire people and do software development,” he said. “Now there are AI supercomputers in the cloud and you pay as you go.”   While the AI device announced today was developed with Nvidia, Microsoft said future updates could add products using Intel's Nervana chips. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested ‘Germ-zapping’ robot latest tool to banish deadly hospital infections WhatsApp, Telegram patch flaws in instant messaging applications Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

According to International Business Times, the Pro 5 will likely support Microsoft’s HoloLens. “HoloLens support was earlier reportedly not said to be included in the Surface Pro 5, since HoloLens is not a consumer device. But with the company rolling out the technology to more affordable VR headsets, the tablet is expected to offer HoloLens support.” The Surface Pro 5 will likely support Microsoft’s HoloLens. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] The article adds that the Surface Pro 5 will also support Microsoft’s Windows 10 Creator’s Update, which is expected to be the biggest Windows update since Windows 10. According to iTech Post, the Surface Pro 5 will be compatible with Surface Dial support. “Moreover, the Surface Dial is also expected to be compatible with the next-gen Surface Pro tablet. This relatively new Microsoft product was launched in October and has primarily been designed for the Surface Studio.” The article explains that the Surface Dial is a Bluetooth-enabled accessory that is very much like a mouse. However, it has a dfferent set of features that can have custom functionalities depending on the user’s needs. Digital Trends talks about some other features. “The Surface Pro 4 uses sixth-generation Intel Core processors and offers an excellent 12.3-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio, 2,736 x 1,824-pixel resolution, and 267 PPI. Anticipated — and logical — Surface Pro 5 updates, therefore, include a move to seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processors and a 4K display option.” The article adds that in order to make the device as thin as possible, USB-3 ports may be replaced with USB-C ports — something Apple has been doing for the past year. Other possibilities listed include a wireless charging pen and a larger capacity battery. The Surface Pro 5 will definitely compete with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, although the MacBook Pro isn’t a touch-enabled or pen-enabled device. The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar hasn’t been as well received as Apple had hoped. Many have complained about the battery life and believe that is way overpriced. Digital Trends gives the Pro a very mixed three-star review. The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has received mixed reviews. [Image by Daryl Deino] “Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is a beautiful machine, but it has several flaws, and it’s far too expensive,” says critic Matt Smith, who adds that there are many cheaper Windows machines that have overall better features. Many in the comments section agree with the author. “I couldn’t agree with you more… last good macbook was from 2011,” says Tomas Stejcek. “This is the BEST REVIEW I have read of the new Mac laptop, and trust me, i have read many. Tech reviewers and other industry observers (like myself) agree that this new Mac simply is overpriced for the cost and under implemented for the technology,” claims Mike Drips. However, there are certainly a lot of happy MacBook Pro with Touch Bar owners on Twitter. I'm so in love with my MacBook Pro!!! touch bar is lit. Best decision I ever made — Marisol Valenzuela (@marisolv_3) February 19, 2017 Michael, I've been using my new 2016 MacBook Pro for a couple of weeks and absolutely love it and the touchbar (had a 2011 model). https://t.co/R0Aaq99ZcG — Erich Robinson (@ErichRobinson) January 14, 2017 Besides the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the Surface Pro 5 will compete with laptop hybrids from Dell, HP, Lenovo, and even Samsung, who is about to release the Galaxy Book, which is very much like the Surface Pro except that it includes the keyboard cover.

The company, based in Palo Alto, California, has filed paperwork for an IPO confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Cloudera is planning to go public this year and is eyeing a valuation of about $4.1 billion, said the people, in line with what it fetched in its last private funding round three years ago. Allen & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc are also working on the deal, one of the people said. A representative for Cloudera declined to comment. Spokesmen for Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Barclays, Bank of America and Citi declined to comment, while a representative of Allen & Co. didn’t respond to a request for comment. After a slow start to the year for initial offerings, Snap Inc., the maker of disappearing-photo app Snapchat, raised $3.9 billion this month, including an overallotment to underwriters. The company priced the shares above the marketed range, and the stock surged 44 percent in its debut. Though the shares have trimmed those gains, they’re still up 34 percent since the offering, a positive outcome for the first technology IPO of 2017. MuleSoft, Alteryx MuleSoft Inc., an enterprise software company based in San Francisco, is seeking to raise as much as $209 million in an IPO scheduled to price March 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Data-analytics company Alteryx Inc. filed its initial prospectus last month with a placeholder amount of $75 million. For more on potential software IPOs, click here. Cloudera creates tools and provides services that center on the open-source data analysis software, Hadoop. Its technology helps wrangle mass amounts of data, analyze it and use it to make decisions in real time. The company competes with the likes of Hortonworks Inc. and MapR Technologies Inc. It has raised upward of $1 billion in private funding, including a $900 million round in March 2014. That injection included $740 million from Intel, as well as $160 million from investors T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Google Inc.’s venture arm and Michael Dell’s investment firm, MSD Capital LP. Companies with revenue of less than $1 billion are able to file IPO documents confidentially under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. It allows them to work out details with the SEC away from the public eye. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Our team of Fools thinks that these five businesses could fit the bill. Brian Feroldi, Dan Caplinger, Rich Duprey, Jason Hall, and Jordan Wathen (TMFTypeoh) Mar 9, 2017 at 6:31PM It isn't hard to figure out why Amazon.com has been one of the best-performing stocks over the past two decades. The e-commerce giant's top line has skyrocketed since its founding in 1994 as more consumers warm up to the idea of shopping online. In turn, investors have bid up shares on the hope that the company's massive revenue growth will translate into huge profit growth, too. So what other companies could potentially grow at a breakneck speed over the next few decades? We asked a team of Fools that very question, and they picked MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF), Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Read on to find out why. Image source: Getty Images. Look south for great growth Dan Caplinger (MercadoLibre): To look for Amazon-like growth potential, it makes sense to stay in the same arena that Amazon serves while searching for a niche that the online retail giant hasn't yet sought to cover. MercadoLibre has that appeal, as it has set out to become the primary e-commerce giant serving the Latin American region. With hundreds of millions of potential customers in a rapidly growing part of the emerging world, Latin America gives MercadoLibre plenty of upside potential. MercadoLibre has done a lot to build up an entire ecosystem to facilitate internet commerce. Starting with its premier marketplace site, MercadoLibre later added a variety of add-on services, including its MercadoPago payment system, MercadoEnvios for shipping, and a service to allow purchasers to get financing on what they buy when necessary. These ancillary businesses provide a full-service experience for MercadoLibre users, but they also have the potential to become independently successful in their own right and expand into more applications. MercadoLibre does face the challenge of dealing with more volatile economic conditions. For instance, in recent years, Latin America largely missed out on the economic growth that the U.S. has enjoyed, because of falling commodity prices. That filtered through to MercadoLibre's prospects. However, with commodities starting to bounce higher, MercadoLibre has posted solid growth, and the runway for the e-commerce giant spans a long way into the future. Sights set on the future Rich Duprey (NVIDIA): After the run-up in value NVIDIA has had over the past few years, rising some 600% since 2014, it's easy to think its stock is priced for perfection. As it trades at 62 times trailing earnings and 44 times forward estimates, it's understandable why some are concerned about valuation. But at times some companies deserve the heightened expectations -- because their businesses are that good. The depth and breadth of the graphics-chip maker's portfolio gives it a huge competitive advantage over rivals Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), driving its leading GPU segment to exceed the market's growth. Notably, the segment is enjoying rapid adoption in AI, the cloud, gaming, and self-driving vehicles. That shows its importance not only in its mainstay gaming market, but also in the auto market, in the Internet of Things, and as part of devices that are pushing the boundaries of virtual reality and machine learning. GPUs are perhaps at the core of the wave of the future: deep learning that will literally drive the driverless cars, advance healthcare, and more. NVIDIA's leadership has come at the expense of Intel and AMD, but make no mistake: It's still gaming that is the moneymaker here, accounting for more than 60% of total revenue as its GeForce GPU continues to fuel strong adoption of its Pascal architecture. AMD's Polaris processors may help lift its performance, but they still lag far behind NVIDIA's offerings. The chipmaker may have to do everything right, but it's proving that it is capable of doing so, and it routinely exceeds even its own forecasts of growth. It expects fourth-quarter revenue to come in at $1.9 billion, give or take, which would be a nearly 50% year-over-year increase -- a goal well within its reach. No company can grow continuously in a straight line, and there will be hiccups along the way for NVIDIA, but there's no reason to think that, even if investors get nervous again, the strength of its business won't be able to continue driving it higher to achieve Amazon-like growth. A genomic-sequencing leader Brian Feroldi (Illumina): While the human genome was first decoded more than a decade ago, I'd bet that you still haven't had your DNA sequenced. That's because it still costs more than $1,000 to do so, which is a price tag that is still too high to drive mass adoption. However, I'd bet that you will have your genome sequenced in the next decade or so as costs continue to fall. If I'm right, then Illumina -- a leading provider of genomic-testing equipment -- looks poised for massive growth from here. Illumina is the dominant player in the genomic-sequencing market. The company sells both the machines that sequence the DNA and the supplies that are needed to run each test. This razor-and-blade model has allowed Illumina's revenue to rise rapidly even while the cost of performing a test has fallen dramatically. Here's a great chart that shows this phenomenon in action:  Image source: Illumina. CAGR = Compound annual growth rate. Recently, Illumina stunned the markets with the launch of its NovaSeq series, which is a next-generation testing system that promises to drive down the costs of sequencing a genome to as little as $100. With a price point that low, I could easily see this technology going mainstream. But what can healthcare providers do with the information gathered through DNA sequencing? To help find out, Illumina has teamed up with IBM and Philips to create new tools that will standardize and simplify data interpretation. If successful, the project could help providers identify diseases at far earlier stages than current technology allows.  In total, Illumina's new technology could help to revolutionize the world of healthcare as we know it today. If this pans out, then Illumina could be poised to deliver decades of top- and bottom-line growth. The future is bright for First Solar Jason Hall (First Solar): Solar and renewable energy stocks are likely to get trashed in the near term, as President Donald Trump's administration makes good on his campaign promise to cut regulations. And while a lot of investor money will shift away from renewables and chase after the companies that could benefit in the short term, the long term remains in the favor of companies like First Solar.  This is because, even as the Trump administration announces plans to cut emissions regulations across the transportation, automotive, and utility industries in the United States, the rest of the developed world is putting more emphasis on renewables. And with the bulk of global population expansion -- particularly in the energy-consuming middle class -- happening outside North America over the next several decades, don't let local politics cloud your view when it comes to the growth prospects for First Solar. After all, the company already derives nearly half of its business outside North America.  There's a good chance the market will remain very unfavorable on First Solar's stock in the short term. But looking out years down the road, billions of new global middle-class members will be relying on solar all over the world, no matter what U.S. politics and regulations look like. If you're willing to ride out short-term choppiness completely unrelated to the big picture, and potentially get Amazon-like returns, First Solar is a great stock to own.  A bet on index funds Jordan Wathen (WisdomTree Investments): WisdomTree Investments currently dominates in an obscure corner of the index fund world. WisdomTree's most popular funds allow you to invest in Japanese and European stocks without exposing yourself to currency risk. The bad news is that investors have turned cold on the strategy. The company's currency-hedged funds, which held about $39.2 billion in assets at their peak in the second quarter of 2015, ended the fourth quarter of 2016 with just $18.8 billion in assets. As the dollar strengthened, investors now want to bet on a weaker dollar, a bet that WisdomTree funds aren't particularly useful for. Luckily, the company has a few other emerging strategies. Its domestic dividend funds are proven winners and have been excellent asset gatherers. It has also expanded abroad to start new exchange-traded funds in markets that aren't as saturated with ETFs as American stock exchanges. I see WisdomTree as something of a lottery ticket in an industry that should see its assets under management grow at a high-single-digit clip for a long time to come. For a levered company like WisdomTree, that can easily turn into years of double-digit earnings growth.  Brian Feroldi owns shares of Amazon and MercadoLibre.

With more than a year under his belt, he's spearheading a cultural change inside the company, getting employees to think beyond PCs and talk about technologies like 5G and IoT. There's been a lot of chatter about changes in the company's chip development strategy, with the recent announcement of the 8th Generation Core processors, an unprecedented fourth chip architecture on the 14-nanometer process. The chip industry veteran sat down with the IDG News Service at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to talk about what spurred the move and also his thoughts on 5G. IDG News Service: How is 5G development going? Renduchintala: I'm noticing there are a hell of a lot more people interested in 5G. The interest in anything that happened before -- whether you're an industrial conglomerate, a car company, a transportation company -- you are now talking about much more interest in 5G than ever before. It's the whole age of everything coming down to data. There are so many colliding identities that get aggregated under the banner of 5G. For example, IoT is now becoming inextricably linked with the passage of 5G. IDG News Service: 5G will be across a wide range of devices. What can users expect? Renduchintala: You'll have network operators becoming more like a cable operator where you can basically get your phone, internet, and TV all in one contract. An autonomous car, all of your cell phones, your tablets, your media consumption, and even the automation and control of your house via an IoT network, is all going to be in one bill. It's going to be different types of networks all generating different types of traffic but ultimately concatenating into one of all integrated services. A network operator is going to basically say: I deliver media, I deliver services, I deliver mobile broadband communications, and it may be delivered over two or three different network architectures that all work together. IDG News Service: What's happening to the 5G network? Renduchintala: What's happening in the network, although it may be more esoteric to explain, is actually just as profound. A network that used to be custom pieces of silicon -- that used to be hand-stitched together to give you performance optimization and load balancing -- is now collapsing down to a reconfigurable entity that used to live in the data center [and is] now being shoved into the network. It's general purpose computing, general purpose data distribution, reconfigurable memory and programming logic, all of which can be reconstituted by the upgrade of a binary in terms of the function. IDG News Service: Do the cloud providers understand the implications of 5G? Renduchintala: It's difficult to actually see. It's only when you really stand back and look at the totality of what's changing you'll actually understand how profound it is. They're no longer going to say, I build five or six mega data centers and stuff. Let's say, for example, Google wants to build out a network that is supporting self-driving cars. I don't think its network architecture is going to look anything that it looks like today, where its main service is essentially providing things like Google Drive and offsite data storage and retrieval. It could be a completely different architecture. IDG News Service: You are developing modems a lot quicker. Why is that? Renduchintala: The cadence is not set by Intel. The cadence is set by the market. You're going to have to have an upgrade of a modem every year. There's a big transition coming along probably in around the late 2018/2019 timeframe where instead of incrementally evolving LTE, you are going to flip to your first multimode LTE/5G. And then you get to this big disruption and then get a big stride in incremental improvement thereon. And then over time, it becomes less and less discernable to the end user. To me, this is like the classic period of a modem upgrade followed by a rapid improvement on the very first generation device and then the ability to get more and more improvement becomes diminishing returns over time. IDG News Service: With 5G supposedly around the corner, how valuable is gigabit LTE? Renduchintala: There's nothing innovative in gigabit LTE -- all you are doing is, instead of aggregating two carriers, I'm aggregating four carriers over a wider bandwidth. That means bigger memory, bigger chipsets, more power -- there's nothing technically mind-blowing. It's just arithmetic extension -- if I want to get a gigabit per second, I have five carrier aggregation across 100 megabits of contiguous bandwidth and therefore I get more data. With LTE, you're really getting to a point where we have to basically go towards both spectrum efficiency gains as well as better data resiliency and service security. That's going to be truly profound. IDG News Service: At Intel's recent analyst conference, you mentioned 8th Generation Core chips coming out on the 14-nm process, while Cannonlake is around the corner. Why the change in chip development plans? Renduchintala: What we're moving towards is a model where people can expect from Intel a yearly cadence of platform upgrade that actually gives meaningful performance improvements in the generation that preceded it. For example, Skylake to Kaby Lake was about 15 percent in overall system performance improvement. What we said is we will deliver at least 15 percent improvement from 7th Generation to 8th Generation. We're focusing on making sure we get meaningful performance upgrade on an annual cadence and to some degree, the process technology that lives underneath that is going to be less conspicuous. There will be a much more of a seamless transition from node to node. We can translate that into a more predictable cadence of product which delivers meaningful performance to stimulate PC upgrades. IDG News Service: Will Cannonlake be 8th generation or is it a different lineup? Renduchintala: I don't know yet. I think we're going to be more focused on generation by the amount of performance increment it will give us. I don't think that generations will be tagged just to node transitions. It will be tagged towards the fact that it needs to have meaningful performance [gains]. Whatever we launch in September of 2018 has to have at least as much improvement year over year as what happened between Kaby Lake and the 8th Generation. If Cannonlake comes out at the end of the year, it could be interesting what we actually market it as we haven't actually decided yet.

Ogg March 9, 2017 4:17 pm EDT Print Email Tweet It has been no secret that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) came back with a vengeance in 2016. Even after an exponential rise last year, the stock had risen from the $11.34 year-end closing price to north of $14.00 and even $15.00 before a large share sale by Mubadala and perhaps a ‘sell the news’ on the Ryzen 7 brought some more recent selling. The hope for the new Ryzen 7 processors and upcoming developments are keeping most analysts from throwing in the towel. In fact, most analysts still seem to be raising AMD’s price targets ahead. After a bullish analyst call had a street-high target of $16.50 last week, now a new street-high analyst price target of $17.00 has been issued by Canaccord Genuity. The firm has had a Buy rating and its prior price target was $14.00. What drove the upgraded price target is that Canaccord Genuity has hosted a series of focused investor meetings with AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su over the last three weeks. Ten key takeaways were given in the report. Matthew Ramsay, the analyst behind the new street-high target for AMD, is now more confident in the positive thesis even considering the recent stock appreciation and volatility. Ramsay sees AMD re-emerging as a competitive second source to Intel across relevant x86 CPU markets from enterprise and gaming desktops, media-focused notebooks and certain server market segments. He also sees  a gradual GPU unit share recovery in low market tiers and being able to deliver a multi-generational roadmap with customer backing and foundry partners. He sees a total addressable market of $50-plus billion with modest growth assumptions and low market share levels. What is going to ultimately drive more interest is what Ramsay sees for earnings power ahead. His report noted: While we recognize roadmap execution and competitive risks remain, we believe risk/reward is still tilted toward the upside and our long-term bullish target of $1.00 in earnings per share remains attainable by 2020. More views were given regarding what the Vega can do for the gaming and datacenter accelerator business and on the Naples in the server market. Virtual reality and 4K graphics are also likely to increase the gaming console refresh cycle, with big upside coming to margins ahead. Tow more areas of strength were also cited. These included AMD’s strategy to engage customers through new product design wins, its semi-custom development, and more intellectual property licensing opportunities. Another upside ahead was what new product growth could mean for AMD’s gross margin and a path toward material long-term earnings power. Rosenblatt Securities issued a rather bullish target for AMD back on February 28, and it was a $16.50 price target. That report from Hans Mosesmann said the dynamics of the week should cause pause and reflection. He noted that the price being half of Intel  should give AMD market share gain in desktops, allowing that $500 savings to be spent on a better display, or GPU card, or storage solution. His real take-away shows why AMD is still a Buy and why Intel is a Sell: The 8-core Ryzen 7 is a 95 watt rated CPU, over 30% more thrifty on energy than Intel’s 8-core i7 6900K. This is an eyebrow-raising event to say the least and likely due to a very efficient design not easily solved by Intel in the near-term (process or architecture-wise). The implications of Zen in the server space are now more easily visible. A much cheaper x86 CPU, and significantly lower power consumption will lead to a much lower TCO. We measure TCO as the optimization of performance, per watt, per cubic foot, per dollar. We are in the camp of AMD re-capturing 10% or more of the x86 market in dollars (PC and server) as they did 7-8 years ago. AMD shares closed up 0.7% at $13.32 on Thursday. Its consensus analyst price target was last seen at $11.79 and its 52-week range is $2.15 to $15.55. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Twitter Facebook Intel's PC chief talks about 5G, changes in chip design Intel's Venkata Renduchintala talks about 5G and 8th Generation Core chips Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 10 March, 2017 09:12 - - - - print email Comments Intel surprised many observers when the company hired outsider Venkata Renduchintala to lead the company's PC, Internet of Things, and Systems Architecture groups. With more than a year under his belt, he's spearheading a cultural change inside the company, getting employees to think beyond PCs and talk about technologies like 5G and IoT. There's been a lot of chatter about changes in the company's chip development strategy, with the recent announcement of the 8th Generation Core processors, an unprecedented fourth chip architecture on the 14-nanometer process. The chip industry veteran sat down with the IDG News Service at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to talk about what spurred the move and also his thoughts on 5G. IDG News Service: How is 5G development going? Renduchintala: I'm noticing there are a hell of a lot more people interested in 5G. The interest in anything that happened before -- whether you're an industrial conglomerate, a car company, a transportation company -- you are now talking about much more interest in 5G than ever before. It's the whole age of everything coming down to data. There are so many colliding identities that get aggregated under the banner of 5G. For example, IoT is now becoming inextricably linked with the passage of 5G. IDG News Service: 5G will be across a wide range of devices. What can users expect? Renduchintala: You'll have network operators becoming more like a cable operator where you can basically get your phone, internet, and TV all in one contract. An autonomous car, all of your cell phones, your tablets, your media consumption, and even the automation and control of your house via an IoT network, is all going to be in one bill. It's going to be different types of networks all generating different types of traffic but ultimately concatenating into one of all integrated services. A network operator is going to basically say: I deliver media, I deliver services, I deliver mobile broadband communications, and it may be delivered over two or three different network architectures that all work together. IDG News Service: What's happening to the 5G network? Renduchintala: What's happening in the network, although it may be more esoteric to explain, is actually just as profound. A network that used to be custom pieces of silicon -- that used to be hand-stitched together to give you performance optimization and load balancing -- is now collapsing down to a reconfigurable entity that used to live in the data center [and is] now being shoved into the network. It's general purpose computing, general purpose data distribution, reconfigurable memory and programming logic, all of which can be reconstituted by the upgrade of a binary in terms of the function. IDG News Service: Do the cloud providers understand the implications of 5G? Renduchintala: It's difficult to actually see. It's only when you really stand back and look at the totality of what's changing you'll actually understand how profound it is. They're no longer going to say, I build five or six mega data centers and stuff. Let's say, for example, Google wants to build out a network that is supporting self-driving cars. I don't think its network architecture is going to look anything that it looks like today, where its main service is essentially providing things like Google Drive and offsite data storage and retrieval. It could be a completely different architecture. IDG News Service: You are developing modems a lot quicker. Why is that? Renduchintala: The cadence is not set by Intel. The cadence is set by the market. You're going to have to have an upgrade of a modem every year. There's a big transition coming along probably in around the late 2018/2019 timeframe where instead of incrementally evolving LTE, you are going to flip to your first multimode LTE/5G. And then you get to this big disruption and then get a big stride in incremental improvement thereon. And then over time, it becomes less and less discernable to the end user. To me, this is like the classic period of a modem upgrade followed by a rapid improvement on the very first generation device and then the ability to get more and more improvement becomes diminishing returns over time. IDG News Service: With 5G supposedly around the corner, how valuable is gigabit LTE? Renduchintala: There's nothing innovative in gigabit LTE -- all you are doing is, instead of aggregating two carriers, I'm aggregating four carriers over a wider bandwidth. That means bigger memory, bigger chipsets, more power -- there's nothing technically mind-blowing. It's just arithmetic extension -- if I want to get a gigabit per second, I have five carrier aggregation across 100 megabits of contiguous bandwidth and therefore I get more data. With LTE, you're really getting to a point where we have to basically go towards both spectrum efficiency gains as well as better data resiliency and service security. That's going to be truly profound. IDG News Service: At Intel's recent analyst conference, you mentioned 8th Generation Core chips coming out on the 14-nm process, while Cannonlake is around the corner. Why the change in chip development plans? Renduchintala: What we're moving towards is a model where people can expect from Intel a yearly cadence of platform upgrade that actually gives meaningful performance improvements in the generation that preceded it. For example, Skylake to Kaby Lake was about 15 percent in overall system performance improvement. What we said is we will deliver at least 15 percent improvement from 7th Generation to 8th Generation. We're focusing on making sure we get meaningful performance upgrade on an annual cadence and to some degree, the process technology that lives underneath that is going to be less conspicuous. There will be a much more of a seamless transition from node to node. We can translate that into a more predictable cadence of product which delivers meaningful performance to stimulate PC upgrades. IDG News Service: Will Cannonlake be 8th generation or is it a different lineup? Renduchintala: I don't know yet. I think we're going to be more focused on generation by the amount of performance increment it will give us. I don't think that generations will be tagged just to node transitions. It will be tagged towards the fact that it needs to have meaningful performance [gains]. Whatever we launch in September of 2018 has to have at least as much improvement year over year as what happened between Kaby Lake and the 8th Generation. If Cannonlake comes out at the end of the year, it could be interesting what we actually market it as we haven't actually decided yet. Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter!

The Summit emphasised the criticality of creating a unified global standard, backed by a strong unified ecosystem. Industry organisations ITU, 3GPP, NGMN, GTI and GSMA attended the event and were joined by executives from AT&T, China Mobile, NTT Docomo and Vodafone. In addition, the vendor community was represented by Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm. Speakers from each of the participants detailed the current state of play in 5G roll-out and set out their expected timeframe for increased testing of the technologies as they mature towards early commercial launches in 2020… The 5G Test Summit, held at Mobile World Congress 2017, brought together industry organisations, mobile network operators and vendors of 5G technologies to issue a joint declaration on the future direction of 5G trials and testing. The Summit emphasised the criticality of creating a unified global standard, backed by a strong unified ecosystem. Industry organisations ITU, 3GPP, NGMN, GTI and GSMA attended the event and were joined by executives from AT&T, China Mobile, NTT Docomo and Vodafone. In addition, the vendor community was represented by Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm. Speakers from each of the participants detailed the current state of play in 5G roll-out and set out their expected timeframe for increased testing of the technologies as they mature towards early commercial launches in 2020. “We’re all working for achieving an ecosystem which is unified through the adoption of unified 5G standards,” François Rancy, the director of the ITU’s Radiocommunications Bureau, told the Summit, adding: “We’re about halfway through the effort of creating the unified standards and ecosystem.” That effort is complex and involves many different organisations working closely together to turn 5G into reality. “5G reshapes society,” said Wang Xiaoyun, the vice chair of the IMT-2020 (5G) promotion group and general manager of the department of technology at China Mobile. “The low latency, communications density, energy efficiency and peak data rate [that 5G offers] are very important for operators and people. 4G was to build a road by 5G is to build a city, to create a cross-industry ecosystem.” Wang added that she saw the role of the 5G Test Summit as being to advocate a 5G unified standard and ecosystem that enables smooth global roaming as well as global scale to reduce cost. China Mobile itself is setting up what it claims will be the world’s largest 5G trial network in Huairou, Beijing, with six vendors involved. The operator will have more than 100 sites participating in 5G trials in 2019, she said. Other operators are also advancing well in their early test efforts. “We see 5G as an evolution, not a single event,” Gordon Mansfield, the vice president of RAN and device design at AT&T, told the Summit. “5G addresses massive communications throughput and capacity and critical IoT applications with ultra-low latency. AT&T wants to take DirecTV and put it on mobile and offer 4k video, augmented reality applications. We see 5G standards as being the proving ground and a unified standard helps us get to a unified ecosystem. We already have some friendly customer trials underway and want to expand into pilot projects that will allow us to have early products.” Takehiro Nakamura, the vice president and general director of the 5G Laboratory at NTT Docomo, has also started trials. “Commercial deployment is set for 2020 initially in areas where high performance is required,” he said. “It’s very difficult to deploy [5G] nationwide from the beginning. From this year, we will trial more and more and at larger scale and over a larger area.” The timeframe although measured in years is demanding and operators have some concerns about accelerating standardisation. “Unless we make decisions towards the end of the year, we’ll lose time in having the commercial chipsets available to meet our needs,” Luke Ibbetson, the director of Vodafone Group R&D, warned the Summit. “Never underestimate the benefits of having global scale behind the technology. As we got towards 5G we need to resist any attempts to fragment the ecosystem which will only cost us money and slow us down.” Another speaker at the Summit, Arnaud Vamparys, the senior vice president of radio networks at Orange, who has been working on NGMN’s 5G Trial and Testing Initiative, discussed how the organisation is working on developing building blocks for operators to use for the construction of their 5G networks. “The testing strategy is being defined and test cases will follow,” he said. “Interoperability testing will be triggered by a 5G work item in [3GPP] Release 15 which will start at the end of this year.” Industry organisations and mobile operators were not alone in acknowledging the complexity involved in the 5G test, standardisation and roll-out process. “5G will be the enabler of the fourth Industrial Revolution but it needs a global unified standard, new services and new markets, technological innovation and a mature industrial chain to succeed,” said Yang Chaobin, the president of the 5G product line at Huawei. “The test pattern in 5G will be different to that of 2G, 3G and 4G so it must be unified to ensure the user experience is good. The test pattern must take account of pooled hardware resources, fully distributed architecture and full automation.” “5G needs cross industry, end-to-end integration testing that brings multiple industries, cloud RAN and applications together,” Yang added. “In 2017, 5G testing will open a super-connected era.” Towards the end of the Summit, representatives from the companies participating in the 5G Test Summit came together onto the stage to initiate the Global 5G Test Trial Declaration, a joint statement of intent for the trial and testing of 5G technologies. AT&T, China Mobile, NTT Docomo, Vodafone, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Keysight, MediaTek, Nokia, Qualcomm, Rohde & Schwarz, ZTE and Datang jointly declared the statement promoting unified, global 5G standards achieved through 5G testing, trials and cooperation between telecom operators, vendors and vertical industry partners to build a unified end-to-end (E2E) ecosystem.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Flynn met with Turkish officials while lobbying for Turkish-linked firm By Theodoric Meyer 03/09/17 02:14 PM EST With Mary Lee and Aubree Eliza Weaver FLYNN MET WITH TURKISH OFFICIALS WHILE LOBBYING FOR TURKISH-LINKED FIRM: “President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn wrote an op-ed on Election Day calling for the U.S. to kick out an anti-government Turkish cleric without disclosing he was being paid by a firm linked to the Turkish government, according to documents newly filed with the Justice Department,” POLITICO’s Theodoric Meyer reports. “POLITICO reported in November that Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, was lobbying for a Dutch consulting firm with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Story Continued Below — “The new documents confirm that Flynn lobbied for the Turkish-linked firm, Inovo BV, before and immediately after the election. They also reveal that Flynn’s firm secretly met with the Turkish foreign and energy ministers in New York less than two months before the election. According to Inovo’s founder, Kamil Ekim Alptekin, the meeting was with Flynn himself. The documents reveal that Inovo BV paid Flynn's firm $535,000 between Sept. 9 and Nov. 14. … Flynn himself received $12,000 for 'Administrative Support' — including a $4,000 check on Nov. 22, four days after Trump tapped Flynn as national security adviser.” Full story. AMERICAN ACTION NETWORK TARGETS FREEDOM CAUCUS WITH HEALTH CARE ADS: “The Obamacare repeal ad wars continue, with both the liberal Priorities USA [Action] and the conservative American Action Network rolling out new spots Thursday morning,” POLITICO’s Kevin Robillard reports. “American Action Network, which has ties to GOP leadership in the House, is spending $500,000 to air an ad on Fox News and in 30 districts belonging to members of the House Freedom Caucus,” including Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and former chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). — “The spot aims to pressure conservatives, many of whom believe the bill doesn't go far enough in repealing the law, to side with President Donald Trump and pass the legislation. The ad concludes with footage of Trump saying 'repeal and replace Obamacare' in his address to Congress and tells viewers to tell their congressman 'to vote with President Trump.' … Priorities USA, the Democratic super PAC, is spending "six figures" on digital ads in seven states with competitive Senate races in 2018: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Ohio, Nevada and Arizona. They'll also run in Alaska and Maine, home to two GOP senators seen as possible votes against the bill.” Full story. Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Got a tip? Switching jobs?

If you haven’t: Don’t worry, I’ll keep you anonymous. RECORDS SHOW AT LEAST 36 LOBBYISTS WORKING IN TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: ProPublica’s Justin Elliott, Derek Kravitz and Al Shaw obtained a list of more than 400 Trump administration staffers through public records requests, which includes at least 36 former lobbyists, “spanning industries from health insurance and pharmaceuticals to construction, energy and finance. Many of them lobbied in the same areas that are regulated by the agencies they have now joined.” — Among the names: “Justin Mikolay, hired at the Department of Defense, was previously a registered lobbyist for Palantir. His title at the tech firm was ‘evangelist.’ Mikolay lobbied for the ‘procurement/deployment of the Palantir Government software platform” throughout intelligence and defense agencies, according to disclosure records. … Chad Wolf, a Bush-era Transportation Security Administration official turned lobbyist, is currently serving as an adviser to the TSA at the Department of Homeland Security. His clients have included defense and homeland security contractors. VAN HOLLEN TOPS LIST OF LOBBYIST CONTRIBUTIONS: Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) raised nearly $900,000 from registered lobbyists in the 2016 cycle — more than any other lawmaker, according to OpenSecrets Blog’s Niv Sultan. (Van Hollen was in the House last cycle before winning his Senate seat in November.) “Of the top 100 recipients of lobbyist money, 40 were Democrats and 60 were Republicans — but that ratio wasn’t represented among those who received the most cash. Van Hollen raked in the most money from lobbyists in the 2016 cycle, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) was next, but a wide gulf separated him from Van Hollen.” Full story. GE EXECUTIVE WITHDRAWS FROM CONSIDERATION FOR TREASURY POST: “Former Treasury Department official David Nason has removed himself from consideration as the Federal Reserve’s top bank cop, a coup for conservatives concerned about his ties to the 2008 bailout of the financial system,” POLITICO’s Victoria Guida and Zachary Warmbrodt report. “Nason's move leaves the powerful position, key to the Trump administration’s efforts to overhaul financial regulations, with no obvious front-runner. Nason, who is CEO of GE Energy Financial Services and previously served as the top regulatory officer at GE Capital, was a major player in the U.S. government’s response to the financial crisis while serving as assistant Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush.” Full story. GO BIG OPENS FOURTH OFFICE: Go BIG Media is opening an office in Seattle. It’s the firm’s fourth, in addition to offices in Florida, Texas and Washington. Peter Graves, the firm’s new president of political and media strategies, will run the Seattle office. ICAHN REBUTS PUBLIC CITIZEN COMPLAINT: Carl Icahn pushed back on Wednesday against Public Citizen’s complaint that he broke lobbying rules by pushing the Trump administration to change federal ethanol regulations. "Public Citizen’s assertion that I should be required to register as a lobbyist is another gross misstatement of the facts which is similar to much of the 'fake news' that is unfortunately so prevalent today," Icahn wrote in an op-ed in The Hill. "I have vetted my activities with a number of lawyers and it is clear that no registration is required." AWARD-WINNING PACS: Nationwide’s PAC won the Outstanding Corporate PAC award at the Public Affairs Council’s Innovation PAC Awards in Miami on Wednesday. The Air Line Pilots Association’s PAC won the Outstanding Association PAC award. JOB MOVES: — Hamilton Place Strategies had added Elizabeth Kelley as a senior director. She previously worked as a special assistant to President Barack Obama and the chief of staff of the National Economic Council. — Travis LeBlanc is joining Boies Schiller Flexner as a partner. He was previously the chief of the FCC’s enforcement bureau. — Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s firm, the Albright Stonebridge Group, has added Ranjana Smetacek as a senior adviser, focusing on South Asia as well as the health care industry.

Qualcomm on Wednesday announced a collaboration with Microsoft to accelerate next-generation cloud services on the 10nm Qualcomm Centriq 2400 ARM-based platform. The collaboration will span multiple future generations of hardware, software and systems. The companies have been working for several years on ARM-based server enablement. They have been optimizing a version of Windows Server for ARM running on the Centriq 2400, which Microsoft will use in its data center. <a href="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=007a712380&amp;cb=14897123459386" ><img src="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538762539&amp;cs=007a712380&amp;cb=14897123459386" border="0" alt="" /></a> Possible Synergies Qualcomm made the announcement at the Open Compute Project Summit in Santa Clara, California, where it conducted the first public demonstration of Windows Server on the Centriq 2400. Qualcomm also submitted a server spec -- the Qualcomm Centriq 2400 Open Compute Motherboard -- to the OCP. The spec, based on the latest version of Microsoft's Project Olympus, pairs the Centriq 2400 with the most advanced interfaces for memory, network and peripherals, and lets devs design ARM-based servers for the most common cloud compute workloads. The motherboard fits into a standard 1U rack server system. It can be paired with compute accelerators, multihost network interface controllers, and leading-edge storage technologies to optimize it for specific workloads. "Microsoft's looking for more efficient compute architecture for Azure, and Qualcomm wants a slice of the [Infrastructure as a Service] business," said Holger Mueller, a principal analyst at Constellation Research. "When two vendors see synergies, good things can happen, but it's too early to tell how well this spec will do," he told TechNewsWorld. Why the ARM Move? Microsoft has been running evaluations of ARM servers side by side with its Intel-based production workloads, noted Microsoft Distinguished Engineer Leendert van Doom. ARM's "high Instruction Per Cycle counts, high core and thread counts, the connectivity options, and the integration that we see across the ARM ecosystem [are] very exciting." Intel has "about 98 percent" of the server market today, and "this is a choke hold on innovation," remarked Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst at Tirias Research. "The industry needs competition, or Intel will use the industry as its piggy bank to fund other projects," he told TechNewsWorld. Cavium, which collaborated with server supplier Inventec, also developed an OCP-based motherboard compatible with Project Olympus and presented a demo with Windows Server for ARM on its server processor SoCs at OPC. All About the Cloud Microsoft is "looking for the cheapest solution for the cloud," suggested Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, and "it's working to make sure all its eggs aren't in one basket." The company's Azure cloud business is going gangbusters, based on its Q2 results. Microsoft considered where ARM servers would be applicable and provide the most value, van Doorn pointed out. Those areas include search and indexing, storage, databases, big data and machine learning. Cloud systems "have to be able to scale from the very large to very small almost instantly, so they need dense, high-core technology which is very similar to what AMD and ARM have been working on," Enderle told TechNewsWorld. Microsoft "has been looking at optimization of servers, and this goes to its cloud first strategy, because it wants to have the best cloud on the planet," he added. In addition to Qualcomm, Microsoft is working with AMD, Intel, Cavium, Nvidia and others on the Olympus project. Richard Adhikari has been an ECT News Network reporter since 2008.

Look At One Of The Last Things Obama Did Before Leaving Office Saagar Enjeti Reporter 11:46 AM 03/09/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5523431 Former President Barack Obama made a last-minute change to the way wiretapped intelligence is shared Jan. 12, which may have contributed to the proliferation of leaks plaguing the Trump administration. Obama changed the way National Security Agency intelligence is shared 8 days before leaving office, which allows globally intercepted communications to be disseminated across the entire intelligence community. The change was part of a post-9/11 push by the executive branch to increase intelligence sharing, to ensure that NSA analysts do not miss critically important information. The change is “simply widening the aperture for a larger number of analysts, who will be bound by the existing rules,” the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said at the time. Obama administration officials also scrambled to spread classified intelligence related to Russian meddling in the 2016 election to as many people within the U.S. government as possible. These officials said they spread the intelligence around to ensure Trump administration officials would not be able to quash the investigation. The officials also fought to keep the related intelligence at a low-classified level, giving more officers access to the raw information. “We have people spouting off who don’t know the difference between FISA surveillance and a wiretap or a counterintelligence probe versus a special prosecutor criminal case, and it has hurts our ability to get to the truth and has wrongly created the impression that intelligence officials have a political agenda,” a U.S. intelligence official told Circa Wednesday. These globally-intercepted communications included conversations during the presidential transition between then National Security Advisor-designate Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. These communications were leaked by elements within the intelligence community to the Washington Post, prompting a government scandal and the resignation of Flynn in disgrace.

These leaks also likely constitute communications between Trump campaign officials and Russian intelligence officials, which were reported by the New York Times. “I think President Obama’s behind it, because his people are certainly behind it,” Trump told Fox News in late February. He continued, “some of the leaks possibly come from that group. You know, some of the leaks, which are really very serious leaks, because they’re very bad in terms of national security, but I also understand that’s politics. And in terms of him being behind things, that’s politics, and it will probably continue.” Follow Saagar Enjeti on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

AMD stock has had a big run, but it doesn’t make money selling its chips By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 9, 2017, 10:05 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Drop Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Ditch Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock and Look for Greener Pastures Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Going to Frustrate You View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares are on a tear this year. Through Mar. 8, AMD stock is up close to 17%. In stark contrast, its two main rivals are down for the year. Longer-term, the opposite will likely occur. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr The hype surrounding Advanced Micro Devices stems from the exciting markets it serves. Namely, it sells chips and technology that are integral in helping computers and video games run, and newer markets such as datacenters and artificial intelligence that help computing systems pursue machine-learning. Unfortunately, AMD doesn’t make money selling its chips. In fact, it hasn’t in some time. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results didn’t indicate its loss-making ways will end any time soon. The market is intrigued about the firm’s future prospects, but may have gotten ahead of itself with Advanced Micro Devices. AMD stock has risen nearly seven fold from around $2 per share to above $13 in the past year. That is more than twice the performance of arch-rival Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which itself nearly tripled in price last year. After some initial skepticism, I have really warmed to Nvidia’s prospects, and the stock has come down in price. It currently sits back below $100 per share. Advanced Micro Devices operates in some of the same markets as Nvidia. Last year, AMD reported $4.3 billion in sales; 54% of the top line stemmed from the processors, customized chip systems and related technology that form the guts of gaming consoles. This includes Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox and Sony Corp (ADR)’s (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation. Where Advanced Micro Devices Is Struggling The remaining 46% consists of selling processors and chipsets that run desktops and notebooks. You could say that this business competes directly with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), but the fact is Intel has been crushing AMD since about 2005 in this business. Back in early 2006, AMD and Intel each had about 50% market share in the CPU market. Since then, Intel has steadily dominated the market and now controls 80% of the market. AMD’s share is down to roughly 20%. There is speculation that Advanced Micro Devices is better competing with Intel lately. AMD’s chip business grew revenue 9% for the year, which is certainly respectable, and operating losses were cut in half to $240 million. Its gaming business reported more modest 5.4% growth and positive operating income of $283 million that was up 32% year-over-year. Unfortunately AMD still lost close to $400 million, or $0.60 per share, for the full year. Free cash flow was positive, but not by much (about $13 million), for all of 2016. Management did sell some equity interests in ATMP JV that brought in $342 million, which it used to pay down debt.

There is now support for OA (Observation Architecture) performance counters via the i965 Mesa DRI driver. The OA performance counters are for Haswell and newer. The Observation Architecture performance counters expose compute metrics, memory reads distribution, and memory writes distribution. Some of the individual counters include the GPU core clocks, the percentage of time the Execution Units are processing, the number of pixels dropped, the number of control shader hardware threads dispatched, the percentage of time when geometry shaders were stalled, the number of VS/CS/FS shader hardware threads dispatched, and more. The new metrics are documented with this commit. These OA counters are exposed to applications via the OpenGL INTEL_performance_query extension.

(Randy L. Rasmussen/The Oregonian) By Anna Marum amarum@oregonian.com Oregonians could learn how much Intel pays in state taxes and find out how much Nike receives in tax breaks if lawmakers pass corporate tax disclosure bills being considered by the House Revenue Committee. Democrats have praised the bills for their attempt at transparency, while Republicans question the benefits of additional disclosure. Tax activists say knowing how much or how little big corporations actually pay would lead to better corporate tax policies in Oregon. But business leaders say letting the public and competitors peek into Oregon businesses' books would hurt their competitiveness and drive business from the state. While the state currently publishes a list of tax breaks, it does not specify, for the most part, which companies receive the credits or exemptions or how much they receive. State law makes it a felony for state employees to disclose income tax return information. Of three bills before lawmakers, House Bill 2019 is by far the most broad. Sponsored by Barbara Smith Warner, D-Portland, and three other Democrats, it would require the Legislative Revenue Office to publish a trove of corporate information gleaned from state tax returns. The office would publish certain large or highly profitable companies' names, Oregon sales, Oregon taxable income, total amount of Oregon tax credits or exemptions, Oregon tax liability and Oregon property taxes paid. The information would be published in the form of four ranked lists: one by sales, one by income, one by tax credits, and one for total taxes owed to Oregon. The disclosure would only apply to C-corporations that have claimed a certain amount in Oregon tax credits or exemptions. (This threshold has not yet been specified in the bill.) C-corporations are distinct from S-corporations and are often large public companies with many investors. The House Revenue Committee is also considering two more corporate tax disclosure bills that would have narrower effects. House Bill 2952 would require the Department of Revenue to publish an annual list of corporate tax credits, along with the recipient corporations' names and the amount of the credit. HB 2774 would require the revenue department to publish a list of companies with tax-exempt property, along with the assessed value of the property and the total estimated revenue loss. Both bills are committee bills, so the sponsor's identity is hidden. Smith Warner has pushed for similar corporate disclosure bills in the past, but says the state needs these bills more than ever after voters defeated Measure 97, a massive corporate tax hike on the November ballot. A publication that puts all tax information in one place is crucial for transparency in the state's budget process, she said. "We give all this money away on tax credits and we don't know what kind of return on investment we're getting," she said. Every budget cycle, however, the Legislative Revenue Office publishes a report on the tax credits up for review that session. Most tax credits sunset after six years. These reports, which lawmakers use when deciding whether to extend them, attempt to measure the impact of the tax credits. Oregon senior economist Chris Allanach acknowledged that truly calculating the results of a given tax break is often challenging. Restrictive disclosure laws and insufficient data can make it difficult to quantify a tax credit's return on investment, he said. Rep. Greg Smith, R-Heppner, said HB 2952 seems punitive. Tax credits should incentivize, not punish the recipients, he said. "What do we as a state gain by finding out that a certain corporation took advantage of something we're trying to support, sustain, enhance, encourage?" he asked. The Oregon Center for Public Policy, a Portland-based nonprofit that advocates for higher corporate taxes, is a longtime supporter of increased tax disclosure. The group's executive director, Chuck Sheketoff, said more disclosure would allow lawmakers and voters to make better informed decisions on tax issues. If it were clear how much or how little companies pay, Oregonians would be more likely to support an increase in corporate taxes, he said. But business groups say forcing Oregon companies to share their tax information will put them at a competitive disadvantage. Ryan Deckert, president of the Oregon Business Association, said competitors in other states would use the information to get a leg up on the competition. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, few states require companies to share tax information, but Massachusetts, per its state website, requires disclosure of sales, profits, taxes paid, and tax credits received. Deckert insists there's no benefit in sharing such information. And companies that invested in renewable energy or in urban renewal zones would feel like they're being punished for taking a tax credit offered to them by the state, he said. "We were hoping we could put the swords down (after Measure 97)," he said. "But this just feels like a poke in the eye." Instead of focusing on bills like these, Deckert said he wishes the Legislature would devote more time to talks for funding a transportation package. Those are the kind of taxes Oregon businesses can get behind, he said. During a hearing last week, J.L. Wilson, lobbyist for Associated Oregon Industries, said the group has traditionally opposed tax disclosure bills. But HB 2952, which focuses on tax credits, is the most targeted he's seen, he said. "I think it will spur honest discussion in our organization about whether that's something that's doable or serves the public purpose," he said. There's a growing conversation in the business community, Wilson said, about the value of tax credits, and whether there are enough credits out there to justify being "tarred with a corporate welfare brush." "There's just not," he said. "And I think we're sick of having those leveraged to pass tax increases, as we've seen in previous sessions." -- Anna Marum amarum@oregonian.com 503-294-5911 @annamarum About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Legal Notices Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Oregon Live LLC.

Gen. Michael Flynn has raised more questions for White House press secretary Sean Spicer to answer. "Was the president aware that Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was acting as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be the national security adviser?" Fox News correspondent John Roberts asked Spicer at a press briefing Thursday. Spicer responded, "I don't believe that that was known." On Wednesday, several outlets reported Flynn's firm registered him as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice for work that "could be construed to have principally benefitted the Republic of Turkey." Though Flynn's firm's lobbying for Inovo BV was previously known and drew concerns since he was getting classified intelligence briefings with the Trump campaign, the most recent filing provides new insight into Flynn's contacts. In August 2016, Flynn Intel Group Inc. was retained by the Netherlands-based consulting firm Inovo BV for research into Fethullah Gülen and his associations with U.S. charter schools. It was paid $530,000 for its work.  According to the filings, which are available online through the Department of Justice, Inovo BV hired Flynn's firm to work on a project that "focused on improving U.S. business organizations' confidence regarding doing business in Turkey." The information would potentially be shared with third parties. Gülen's the former Turkish Muslim cleric who is living in Pennsylvania. The Turkish government blames him for last summer's failed coup and is seeking his extradition. Flynn, at the invitation of Inovo's founder, met with Turkish officials including the ministers of foreign affairs and energy in New York in September. The meeting, as described in the filings, was to provide a better understanding of Turkey's political climate "as background for the project." The filings state Flynn Intel Group's work with Inovo ended Nov. 15, 2016. It shut down later that month after President Trump tapped Flynn to be his national security adviser. The filings say to the best of the firm's knowledge, the information wasn't shared with third parties — like, say, the Turkish government. But to play it safe, it decided to file the necessary paperwork under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Flynn Intel Group Inc. registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act in September 2016 after it was retained. SEE MORE: Trump Says He Would Have Told Flynn To Discuss Sanctions Flynn wrote an op-ed published on Election Day that said the U.S. "should not provide [Gülen] safe haven." Inovo didn't direct Flynn to write the article, but it did get a copy ahead of its publication, according to the filings. The filings state Flynn only made "technical edits" to the article "based on feedback from Inovo." The firm doesn't believe Inovo shared information regarding the op-ed with the Turkish government. In a series of tweets Wednesday, Inovo's founder, Ekim Alptekin, called the foreign agent filing "flawed." He also said Flynn "never engaged in lobbying work for me or my firm. And I never lobbied or contracted lobbyist on behalf of the Turkish Government." The fillings come in the wake of numerous reports that Trump and members of his team — including Flynn — didn't disclose meetings with Russian officials during the campaign and the presidential transition.  Spicer said of Flynn on Thursday: "He wasn't being compensated as part of the transition as far as I am aware, and so he was a private citizen at the time. ... There's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed."

By Stephen Lawson Senior U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 9, 2017 2:34 PM PT Credit: Martyn Williams More like this Enterprises enter the 5G spotlight at MWC Until 5G arrives, some mobile users may get almost-5G Verizon plans 5G trial service in 11 cities this year Video MWC 2017: Top phones get a new lease on life The international body crafting the 5G standard has approved an accelerated roadmap that could see large-scale trials and deployments in 2019 instead of 2020. At a meeting this week in Dubrovnik, Croatia, the 3GPP signed off on a 5G work plan that several top mobile operators and network vendors came out in favor of last week. It would create an interim 5G specification before the full-scale standard is completed. It’s important to get the next generation of mobile out into the world soon because users keep increasing their data consumption, said Lorenzo Casaccia, vice president of technical standards at Qualcomm, in a blog post on Thursday. That’s why his company is backing the in-between spec, which is now expected to be done by the end of this year and available in software about three months later. Qualcomm and most other big players endorsed this plan just before last week’s Mobile World Congress, with a few holding back. Nokia and Verizon, the two biggest names that weren’t on board then, are now there. More than 40 companies, including Intel, Ericsson, Huawei and Samsung, back the new plan. The interim standard, called Non-Standalone 5G NR (New Radio), will let developers create 5G gear and software that still relies on 4G radio and core networks for coverage and mobility management. The final standard, Standalone 5G NR, will have a 5G core network. It’s expected to be done in the middle of 2018 and available in software later that year. Non-Standalone 5G NR will be designed for forward compatibility so carriers don't have to swap out equipment when they move to full-scale 5G, Casaccia said. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] The 3GPP has a lot more decisions to make before these specifications are done, and a lot more pieces need to come together before consumers reap the benefits. Unlike 4G, the next standard will have to address things like low latency for VR and autonomous vehicles, plus how to connect millions of IoT devices that don’t have enough energy for conventional cellular radios. There are dozens of technology trials already in progress, and there will be more. A key milestone will be South Korean carrier KT's live trial at the Winter Olympics next year in PyeongChang. Because 5G will use many frequency bands that are new to cellular, including a shared 3.5GHz block in the U.S. and millimeter-wave bands like 28GHz and 39GHz in many countries, national regulators need to make that spectrum available. On the device side, Qualcomm and Intel both have announced so-called 5G modems, including ones that can work with both millimeter-wave frequencies and lower bands. Carriers and vendors have their own reasons to speed up 5G. With LTE networks largely built out, the cellular equipment business is in an historic slump, according to Dell’Oro Group. The period between now and 2021 will be the worst five years in the RAN (radio access network) market since Dell’Oro started tracking it in 2000, the company said last month. The research company doesn’t expect a rebound until 5G deployment starts in earnest. For carriers, 5G is a chance to expand their business in new areas like IoT. They look forward to moving beyond just selling monthly smartphone plans. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

While everyone's going to crazy over AMD's new Ryzen CPU, Asus is still giving some love to the Intel side of things. Its new Maximus IX Extreme motherboard is based on the Z270 chipset, and has a raft of top-end features. It also costs almost as much as a low-end PC - $999.  The biggest draw of this new board is baked in water-cooling support. The Maximus IX Extreme features in integrated monoblock for watercooling, that can cool both the processor and the board's VRM, and even makes contact with an integrated M.2 heatsink. Embedded flow meters can track pump status in real-time, while temperature sensors can keep track of both water going into the block and out. And a built-in leak detector can alert you to looming disaster, and even shut down your PC automatically. The  Maximus IX Extreme also promises solid audio, thanks to an ESS Sabre Hi-Fi ES9023P digital-to-analog DAC, SupremeFX S1220 codec, and a Texas Instruments RC 4580 op-amp.

Spicer’s comments came two days after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Turkey’s government. Alexander Acosta, the law school dean Trump tapped to run the Labor Department, would face an uncomplicated process for separating himself from his investments and his current job if confirmed for the position, according to ethics documents and financial disclosures made public by the Office of Government Ethics. With less than $1 million in stock funds in brokerage and retirement accounts, Acosta, 48, laid out a simple financial situation that puts him in stark contrast to some of the multimillionaires Trump has named to his Cabinet. The documents were released ahead of his confirmation hearing on March 15. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he is in favor of bringing new enemy combatants to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, reversing eight years of Obama administration policy aimed at shrinking the population at the military detention facility in the hopes of eventually closing it. Sessions also said he supports trying detainees there instead of in the federal courts. Steven Mnuchin said in a letter to Congress that the Trump administration will begin taking steps next week to keep the government from an unprecedented default on the national debt. The treasury secretary told lawmakers that he will employ measures to avoid breaching the borrowing limit once the current suspension of the limit expires on March 16. Once that happens, treasury will use a variety of bookkeeping maneuvers to continue to finance government operations, including making interest payments on the national debt. John Kerry, the former secretary of state, has a book deal. Kerry has signed with Simon & Schuster, the publisher said. The book, a memoir covering his life from childhood through his recent time as secretary of state, does not yet have a title or release date.

At a meeting this week in Dubrovnik, Croatia, the 3GPP signed off on a 5G work plan that several top mobile operators and network vendors came out in favor of last week. It would create an interim 5G specification before the full-scale standard is completed. It’s important to get the next generation of mobile out into the world soon because users keep increasing their data consumption, said Lorenzo Casaccia, vice president of technical standards at Qualcomm, in a blog post on Thursday. That’s why his company is backing the in-between spec, which is now expected to be done by the end of this year and available in software about three months later. Qualcomm and most other big players endorsed this plan just before last week’s Mobile World Congress, with a few holding back. Nokia and Verizon, the two biggest names that weren’t on board then, are now there. More than 40 companies, including Intel, Ericsson, Huawei and Samsung, back the new plan. The interim standard, called Non-Standalone 5G NR (New Radio), will let developers create 5G gear and software that still relies on 4G radio and core networks for coverage and mobility management. The final standard, Standalone 5G NR, will have a 5G core network. It’s expected to be done in the middle of 2018 and available in software later that year. Non-Standalone 5G NR will be designed for forward compatibility so carriers don't have to swap out equipment when they move to full-scale 5G, Casaccia said. The 3GPP has a lot more decisions to make before these specifications are done, and a lot more pieces need to come together before consumers reap the benefits. Unlike 4G, the next standard will have to address things like low latency for VR and autonomous vehicles, plus how to connect millions of IoT devices that don’t have enough energy for conventional cellular radios. There are dozens of technology trials already in progress, and there will be more. A key milestone will be South Korean carrier KT's live trial at the Winter Olympics next year in PyeongChang. Because 5G will use many frequency bands that are new to cellular, including a shared 3.5GHz block in the U.S. and millimeter-wave bands like 28GHz and 39GHz in many countries, national regulators need to make that spectrum available. On the device side, Qualcomm and Intel both have announced so-called 5G modems, including ones that can work with both millimeter-wave frequencies and lower bands. Carriers and vendors have their own reasons to speed up 5G. With LTE networks largely built out, the cellular equipment business is in an historic slump, according to Dell’Oro Group. The period between now and 2021 will be the worst five years in the RAN (radio access network) market since Dell’Oro started tracking it in 2000, the company said last month. The research company doesn’t expect a rebound until 5G deployment starts in earnest. For carriers, 5G is a chance to expand their business in new areas like IoT. They look forward to moving beyond just selling monthly smartphone plans. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Live Watch VP Pence: Turkey lobbying 'an affirmation' of decision to fire Flynn By Katherine Faulders Close Follow on Twitter More from Katherine Jordyn Phelps Close Follow on Twitter More from Jordyn Mar 9, 2017, 8:14 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayJoshua Roberts/Reuters WATCH Highs and lows for Trump administration this week 0 Shares Email Vice President Mike Pence called revelations that former national security adviser Michael Flynn's lobbying efforts may have benefited Turkey an "affirmation" that President Trump was right in firing him. "It is an affirmation of the president's decision to ask Gen. Flynn to resign," Pence said in response to Fox News' Bret Baier asking if he was disappointed by the news. Flynn's lobbying firm, Flynn Intel Group, did lobbying work in the months leading up to his White House appointment that may have benefited the Turkish government, according to a filing made on Tuesday. The vice president's comments came just hours after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer claimed during Thursday's press briefing that Trump was unaware of Flynn's ties to Turkey. White House: Trump unaware of Flynn's foreign agent work Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, resigns amid controversy over Russia call "I don't believe that that was known. I would refer you to General Flynn and to the Department of Justice in terms of the filings that have been made," said Spicer. Asked if Trump would have appointed Flynn as his adviser had he known the nature of his lobbying work, Spicer said "I don't know." "That's a hypothetical that I'm not prepared to ask," said Spicer. "I don't know what he discussed prior to be appointed in terms of his background, his resume, his client base. I don't know any of that. I know that, from what I have read, he has filed the appropriate forms with the Department of Justice." The paperwork filed on behalf of Flynn and his firm indicated a payment of $530,000 for lobbying work he did in 2016 for a Dutch company that "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." Flynn penned an editorial that appeared in The Hill on November 8 last year -- Election Day -- calling Turkey a "vital" ally and criticizing the media for one-sided reporting on the country's "crackdown on dissidents." Flynn Intel Group shut down its operations in November 2016, according to the filing. Flynn's work was previously disclosed in a Lobbying Disclosure Act registration with Congress, but Tuesday's filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act to the Justice Department was the first admission that his actions also affected the Republic of Turkey. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Pence: Turkey lobbying 'an affirmation' of decision to fire Flynn " Republicans dismiss Trump's first budget blueprint " Families face reality of possible budget cuts killing programs they use " Ex-Trump adviser Flynn paid $56,200 by Russian firms in 2015, documents show " Spicer continues to defend Trump's wiretapping claims " GOP health care bill narrowly clears a committee despite conservative opposition " A timeline of Trump's immigration executive order " Senate Intelligence Committee finds 'no indications' of wiretapping, wider surveillance at Trump Tower " McDonald's 'compromised' Twitter account called Trump a 'disgusting excuse of a president' " What's next for Trump's revised travel ban " Read the full White House budget blueprint " Trump wants to slash State Department budget by 28 percent " The Note: Trump's travel ban 0 for 2 " Detroit suspect attacked officers 'unprovoked' with apparent intention to kill: Police " Tree stump turned into 'The Giving Tree' tribute " How meditation helps military cadets be more effective warriors " Can children sleep through a smoke detector alarm?

Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, who was fired from the White House last month, has registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for work that may have aided the Turkish government in exchange for $530,000. (Evan Vucci, File/Associated Press) By Stephen Braun and Chad Day | AP By Stephen Braun and Chad Day | AP March 9 WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump was not aware that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had worked to further the interests of the government of Turkey before appointing him, the White House said Thursday. The comments came two days after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Turkey’s government. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called the action “an affirmation of the president’s decision to ask General Flynn to resign.” At the White House, asked whether Trump knew about Flynn’s work before he appointed him as national security adviser, press secretary Sean Spicer said, “I don’t believe that that was known.” Pence said in an interview later with Fox News that he also did not know about Flynn’s paid work. Flynn and his company filed the registration paperwork describing $530,000 worth of lobbying before Election Day on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. In an interview with The Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn did so after pressure from Justice Department officials. The filing this week was the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency’s first acknowledgement that his consulting business furthered the interests of a foreign government while he was working as a top adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign. Flynn’s disclosure that his lobbying — from August through November— may have benefited Turkey’s authoritarian government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came as Flynn has drawn scrutiny from the FBI for his contacts with Russian officials. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. In paperwork filed with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm acknowledged that his lobbying “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” The lobbying contract ended after Trump’s election in November, according to the paperwork. A spokesman for Flynn, Price Floyd, said the general was not available for an interview Thursday. Floyd referred the AP to Flynn’s filing in response to questions about why he and his firm had decided to register this week. Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. The Turkish Embassy also didn’t respond to questions from the AP. Spicer said he didn’t know what Flynn had disclosed about his background and lobbying work during the White House’s vetting of him for appointment as national security adviser. Spicer said Flynn was free to do the lobbying work because it occurred while he was a private citizen. “There’s nothing nefarious about doing anything that’s legal as long as the proper paperwork if filed,” Spicer said. He declined to say whether Trump would have appointed Flynn if he had known about the lobbying. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Flynn’s newly disclosed lobbying would not have violated that pledge because it occurred before he joined the Trump administration in January, but the pledge precludes Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. More than a month before Flynn was appointed as national security adviser, news accounts and Democratic senators had raised questions about potential conflicts of interest regarding Flynn’s work for the Turkish company. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., criticized Flynn’s work and late disclosure again Thursday as troubling. “Gen. Flynn’s behavior seems to be part of a larger pattern of poor judgment from members of this administration,” she said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement that Flynn should return any foreign money he received. “This astonishing admission is more appalling evidence of foreign entanglements and conflicts of interest involving the Trump team,” he said. He said a special prosecutor should be appointed to look into ties between Trump officials and foreign governments. Alptekin told the AP that Justice Department officials had pushed for Flynn and his firm to register as foreign agents in recent weeks. He said the filing was a response to “political pressure” and he did not agree with Flynn’s decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. He also said that he had asked for some of his money back because of his dissatisfaction with the company’s performance. “I disagree with the filing,” he said in a phone call from Istanbul. “It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government.” Flynn’s consulting firm had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive disclosures about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. Flynn Intel and S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying pressured congressional aides to investigate a cleric who Erdogan had accused of directing a botched coup last summer. The two firms orchestrated meetings with U.S. officials— including congressional staffers and Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, a Republican — as well as journalists. They also worked on research, informational materials and a video on the cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Flynn met privately in September in New York with two senior Turkish government officials, including the government’s ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn’s company did not name the officials, but the current Turkish energy minister is Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan’s son-in-law. Alptekin told the AP he set up the meeting at a New York hotel between Flynn and the two officials while the officials were attending U.N. sessions and a separate conference Alptekin had arranged. Alptekin is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Erdogan, who has accelerated a crackdown against the nation’s weakening secularist faction since the failed coup last summer. Erdogan has accused cleric Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel’s work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report.

Integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Cons Most connections require adapters, which come separately. Only one micro USB port. Significantly slower than full-sized options. Bottom Line Add some accessories, and the Raspberry Pi Zero W is a full PC for pocket change, but its potential for DIY electronic projects is its real draw. By Joel Santo Domingo Linux-based kit PCs like the original $35 Raspberry Pi have been popular with the maker community for years. In its latest iteration, the Raspberry Pi Zero W, the PCB (printed circuit board) is shrunken down to the size of a stick of gum, and the price starts at just $10 ($35 as tested). This tiny PC supports a graphics-based OS, and integrates Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so it's nominally a cheap desktop, but what makes it really exciting is that it can be used as the base for a variety of build projects, from crop monitoring, to vintage arcade gaming, to creating your own science fiction movie props with blinking lights. It's definitely worth the pocket change you'll pay. //Compare Similar Products Compare Raspberry Pi   %displayPrice%%seller% Raspberry Pi 2 Model B   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus Chromebit   %displayPrice%%seller% Raspberry Pi 3 Model B   %displayPrice%%seller% Intel Compute Stick (Core m3)   %displayPrice%%seller% The Raspberry Pi community has grown by leaps and bounds. At the time of this writing, a Google search for "Raspberry Pi projects" returns more than 4.6 million results. Be warned, though, that this is a true DIY PC; you'll have to set everything up and possibly even build enclosures yourself with a 3D printer. If you want to take the easy route to a cheap, tiny PC, pick up an Asus Chromebit or an Intel Compute Stick instead. But it won't be as much fun, and it'll cost you more than the price of a movie ticket. Get Ready to Buy, Then Build The $10 entry point includes just the Raspberry Pi Zero W PCB. You'll need additional accessories (and there are many), which you'll either have to purchase separately, or source from kit resellers like adafruit.com or canakit.com. For example, the $35 starter kit we received from the Raspberry Pi Foundation to test includes a micro USB power supply, a USB OTG (on the go) micro-USB-to-USB-A adapter, a 8GB SD card, and a mini HDMI adapter. View All 12 Photos in Gallery The board measures 0.2 by 2.56 by 1.18 inches, smaller and lighter than the Chromebit and Compute Stick mentioned above. There are several connectors on the PCB, including a mini HDMI jack, a micro USB port for I/O devices like mice and keyboards, a micro USB port solely for power, a connector for a compatible camera cable (a camera kit with a Zero W PCB, cable, case, and camera itself are sold together for $45), and a micro SD slot. That's a far cry from the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, both of which have four USB 2.0 ports, as well as full-sized HDMI and Ethernet jacks, and therefore don't require a handful of adapters. The PCB has holes for the GPIO (general purpose input/output) connector found on older models of the Raspberry Pi, but you'll have to source one and solder it to the PCB if you need connectivity with accessories like LED light bars and sensor modules. An alternate case and top panel that lets you use the GPIO port is available for $6. The do-it-yourself aesthetic is one of the prime draws of the Raspberry Pi brand, since it's up to you to decide when the project is done, and how far to take it. Just to the point of working, or complete it and make it look like a souped up mini PC. The official Raspberry Pi Zero W case you see in our photos is good looking and will keep dust and prying fingers away from the sensitive PCB, but if you're building a classic games emulator, why not 3D print an NES-style case? Other neat builds we've seen are a miniature arcade cabinet and plans for a light saber. A Simple Build It's easy to build a basic desktop PC with all the pieces included the starter kit. We started by slipping the included micro SD card into its slot on the Zero W's PCB. The board then clips neatly into the provided case without tools, while still providing easy access to the card's ports. Then plug the mini HDMI adapter into its jack, and connect it via a cable to any HDMI-equipped display. We used a $30 Kensington PocketHub 4-port USB Hub to connect a keyboard and mouse to the single micro USB port with the USB OTG adapter. The hub's two spare ports could then be used for an Ethernet adapter, a printer, or other accessories. You could theoretically use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse with the Zero W, but you'll need to hook up a wired USB mouse for the initial pairing process. Last, but most importantly, we connected a 1A USB power supply to the Zero W's power connector. It booted up in a few minutes. We connected it to our Lab's Fios Wi-Fi network, and we were online in seconds. A New Linux Flavor The $35 starter kit we tested includes a preloaded 8GB micro SD card with Raspbian Jessie, a version of Linux based on Debian. Jessie replaces Wheezy, the OS found on previous models like the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. Jessie boots into a familiar-looking GUI, so you can easily navigate with a keyboard and mouse in preloaded programs like the LibreOffice suite (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, etc.), the Claws Mail client, and a Pi-optimized version of Minecraft. You can also choose to use the command line interface, like previous versions of Linux, or download and install other disk images including Ubuntu Linux and a core (stripped-down) version of Windows 10 built for IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Not Built for Speed The Zero W packs a single-core ARM11 processor running at 1GHz, with 512MB of memory in a Broadcom BCM2835 system on a chip (SoC) package. This translates into performance that's close to the original Raspberry Pi. This was confirmed when we ran Sunspider 1.0.2, a JavaScript-based benchmark test, which measures performance at tasks like encryption, screen redrawing, and text editing. The Zero W managed a score of 20,064 milliseconds (ms). To put that in perspective, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with a 1.2GHz quad-core Cortex A53 processor took just 2,860ms on the same test, a 604 percent increase in time. The Zero W is fast enough for word processing and mild surfing using the preinstalled Epiphany web browser, but you'll have a better time on your phone if you need to quickly respond to posts on Facebook, Twitter, or surf the selection in Netflix. These simple tasks would each take 5-10 seconds on an Apple iPhone 6s Plus, but took more than a minute on the Zero W. Sometimes we waited up to 5 minutes to locate and start a 1080p HD video stream. A speed demon it's not, but we wouldn't expect quicksilver from a $35 desktop PC kit. The Zero W is a must-buy if you're already a Raspberry Pi enthusiast, and at $10 to start it's a no-brainer. But it's also an inexpensive foundation for your next set of home-built projects. Since it's Linux-based, there is a wide range of resources online to help you along, including step-by-step tutorials on how to turn it into a pocket-sized game emulator, a download manager, or the brains for a motorized skateboard. It's not the fastest piece of hardware, but it does perform as well you'd expect for the price. Because of the performance and connectivity gap, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B is the better choice for the first timer, but if your builds are becoming smaller and more efficient, the Zero W is an intriguing piece of kit.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    President Donald Trump was not aware that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had worked to further the interests of the government of Turkey before appointing him, the White House said Thursday. The comments came two days after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Turkey's government. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called the action "an affirmation of the president's decision to ask General Flynn to resign." At the White House, asked whether Trump knew about Flynn's work before he appointed him as national security adviser, press secretary Sean Spicer said, "I don't believe that that was known." Pence said in an interview later with Fox News that he also did not know about Flynn's paid work. Flynn and his company filed the registration paperwork describing $530,000 worth of lobbying before Election Day on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. In an interview with The Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn did so after pressure from Justice Department officials. The filing this week was the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency's first acknowledgement that his consulting business furthered the interests of a foreign government while he was working as a top adviser to Trump's presidential campaign. Flynn's disclosure that his lobbying — from August through November— may have benefited Turkey's authoritarian government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came as Flynn has drawn scrutiny from the FBI for his contacts with Russian officials. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. In paperwork filed with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm acknowledged that his lobbying "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." The lobbying contract ended after Trump's election in November, according to the paperwork. A spokesman for Flynn, Price Floyd, said the general was not available for an interview Thursday. Floyd referred the AP to Flynn's filing in response to questions about why he and his firm had decided to register this week. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. The Turkish Embassy also didn't respond to questions from the AP. Spicer said he didn't know what Flynn had disclosed about his background and lobbying work during the White House's vetting of him for appointment as national security adviser. Spicer said Flynn was free to do the lobbying work because it occurred while he was a private citizen. "There's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork if filed," Spicer said. He declined to say whether Trump would have appointed Flynn if he had known about the lobbying. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Flynn's newly disclosed lobbying would not have violated that pledge because it occurred before he joined the Trump administration in January, but the pledge precludes Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. More than a month before Flynn was appointed as national security adviser, news accounts and Democratic senators had raised questions about potential conflicts of interest regarding Flynn's work for the Turkish company. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., criticized Flynn's work and late disclosure again Thursday as troubling. "Gen. Flynn's behavior seems to be part of a larger pattern of poor judgment from members of this administration," she said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement that Flynn should return any foreign money he received. "This astonishing admission is more appalling evidence of foreign entanglements and conflicts of interest involving the Trump team," he said. He said a special prosecutor should be appointed to look into ties between Trump officials and foreign governments. Alptekin told the AP that Justice Department officials had pushed for Flynn and his firm to register as foreign agents in recent weeks. He said the filing was a response to "political pressure" and he did not agree with Flynn's decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. He also said that he had asked for some of his money back because of his dissatisfaction with the company's performance. "I disagree with the filing," he said in a phone call from Istanbul. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government." Flynn's consulting firm had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive disclosures about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. Flynn Intel and S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying pressured congressional aides to investigate a cleric who Erdogan had accused of directing a botched coup last summer. The two firms orchestrated meetings with U.S. officials— including congressional staffers and Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, a Republican — as well as journalists. They also worked on research, informational materials and a video on the cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Flynn met privately in September in New York with two senior Turkish government officials, including the government's ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn's company did not name the officials, but the current Turkish energy minister is Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan's son-in-law. Alptekin told the AP he set up the meeting at a New York hotel between Flynn and the two officials while the officials were attending U.N. sessions and a separate conference Alptekin had arranged. Alptekin is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Erdogan, who has accelerated a crackdown against the nation's weakening secularist faction since the failed coup last summer. Erdogan has accused cleric Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel's work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

In this Feb. 1, 2017, file photo, Flynn stands with K.T. McFarland, deputy national security adviser, before speaking during the daily news briefing at the White House. Carolyn Kaster AP White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Thursday, March 9, 2017. Susan Walsh AP 1 of 2 i By Anita Kumar akumar@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON President Donald Trump did not know that Michael Flynn had lobbied on behalf of the government of Turkey before appointing him national security adviser, the White House said Thursday. “I don’t believe that that was known,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said. The assertion that the White House was unaware of Flynn’s lobbying activities raises anew questions of how carefully Trump’s advisers have been investigated for possible conflicts of interest in an administration beset by allegations of such conflicts – beginning with the president’s own businesses. Flynn belatedly registered this week with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit, acknowledging that he had worked last year for a company owned by a Turkish businessman that could have aided that country’s government. He was paid $530,000 before Trump won the presidency. The paperwork indicates that Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., worked for the Turkish company from August to November in a capacity that “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Spicer said he saw no impropriety in Flynn’s work, which was carried out while he was also advising the Trump campaign. “When you’re a private citizen, you’re allowed to engage in legal activities,” Spicer said. “I don’t have anything further on that but I think there’s . . . nothing nefarious about doing anything that’s legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed.” U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of a foreign government or political entity must register with the Justice Department, according to the Foreign Agent Registration Act. Failure to register is a felony. Flynn was fired last month as Trump’s national security adviser for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in late December. But he’s not the first Trump official whose background has raised uncomfortable questions. Democrats accused Trump of trying to force the Senate to confirm his Cabinet-level nominees without allowing them to properly vet them because of a failure to turn in required paperwork and before they’d reached agreements with the independent Office of Government Ethics to resolve potential conflicts. Trump nominees to head the departments of the Navy and the Army both withdrew after saying they could not comply with government ethics rules. Trump himself has been criticized for not divesting himself of his businesses, including his Washington hotel, the building for which he leases from the federal government. On Thursday, Office of Governmental Ethics Director Walter Shaub blasted the White House for claiming that officials in the president’s office are not subject to the same ethics rules that apply to other government officials. In a letter, Shaub questioned the White House’s failure to discipline another Trump adviser, Kellyanne Conway, for touting the fashion line of Trump daughter Ivanka during a television appearance from the White House briefing room. The White House announced last month that it had “counseled” Conway on the breach of ethics rules, but Shaub said that was not enough. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program,” he wrote White House ethics officer Stefan Passantino. Describing a letter from the White House, Shaub said he was “concerned about the extraordinary assertion that ‘many’ OGE regulations are inapplicable to employees of the Executive Office of the President. The assertion is incorrect, and the letter cites no legal basis for it.” EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak also raised questions about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the government run RT news service. Flynn reportedly was paid $40,000 in 2015 to attend a gala marking RT’s 10th anniversary, where he was seated next to Putin. Flynn was believed to have been an advocate for Trump’s campaign position that he would consider lifting sanctions imposed on Russia over its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM When asked if Trump would have hired Flynn if he had known of his lobbying on Turkey’s behalf, Spicer demurred. “That’s a hypothetical that I’m not prepared to ask,” Spicer said. “I don’t know what he discussed prior to being appointed in terms of his background, his resume, his client base. I don’t know any of that.” EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE Trump signed an executive order that forbids government employees from lobbying for five years and permanently from representing foreign governments after leaving the administration. It also prohibits lobbyists turned government employees from participating for two years in decisions about the issues on which they lobbied.

Pence told Fox News’ Bret Baier in an interview airing Thursday evening that media reports about Flynn’s work were “the first I heard of it and I think it is an affirmation of the President’s decision to ask General Flynn to resign.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday that Mr. Trump was not aware of Flynn’s ties to Turkey before appointing him. Spicer’s comments came two days after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Turkey’s government. Asked whether Trump knew about Flynn’s work before he appointed him as national security adviser, Spicer said, “I don’t believe that that was known.” Flynn and his company filed the registration paperwork describing $530,000 worth of lobbying before Election Day on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin.

Donald Trump was unaware his former national security adviser Michael Flynn was working as a “foreign agent” when he gave him the job, according to his press secretary. “I don’t believe that was known,” said Sean Spicer, when asked by reporters at his regular press briefing on Thursday. Flynn resigned in February after just four weeks as national security adviser when it came to light that he had misled the vice-president, Mike Pence, about phone conversations with the Russian ambassador about sanctions in December. The resignation came after a flow of intelligence leaks revealed that he had secretly discussed sanctions with the ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and then tried to cover up the conversations. On Wednesday, it was revealed that from September to November last year, while he was working as a top adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign, Flynn was lobbying for a firm linked to the Turkish government, earning $530,000. He and his company Flynn Intel Group Inc filed retroactive documents with the Department of Justice two days ago to register as a foreign agent.  Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, US citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the justice department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the justice department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. As part of Flynn’s lobbying for Inovo, a Danish firm linked to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Flynn penned an op-ed calling for a “radical” cleric (whom the Turkish government wants to extradite) to be booted out of the US. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, he, like other incoming officials, agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Flynn’s newly disclosed lobbying would not have violated that pledge because it occurred before he joined the Trump administration in January, but the pledge would preclude Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again. Spicer was asked whether the president would still have hired Flynn as his national security adviser if he had known he had been working as a foreign agent. “I don’t know ... That’s a hypothetical,” said Spicer. “I don’t know what was discussed prior to the appointment in terms of his background, his résumé, his client base.” “From what I’ve read, he has filed appropriate forms with the Department of Justice ; ask them and subsequently him if you have any questions about the filing,” said Spicer. Spicer also said he was unaware whether Flynn was involved in any discussions about foreign policy regarding Turkey. “I don’t know. I don’t have anything on that,” he replied. Opaque answers and the reply of “I don’t know” are now regular features at Spicer’s daily press conferences, which have been memorably lampooned by the actor Melissa McCarthy on NBC’s Saturday Night Live. On Wednesday, Spicer confused reporters by initially saying “we need to find out” if Trump was the subject of an investigation by the justice department into Russia’s involvement in the US election, then clarifying that he had “no reason” to believe that Trump was. “I just want to be really clear on one point which is there is no reason that we have to think that the president is the target of any investigation whatsoever,” he said eventually on Wednesday, possibly after looking down at a message on his lectern. “There is no reason to believe that he is the target of any investigation. I think that’s a very important point to make.” On Thursday, reporters returned to the topic, asking the press secretary to clarify whether the administration did or did not know for sure if the president was the subject of a DoJ investigation. “The assurance I gave you was that I’m not aware. That was 100% accurate,” said Spicer, who then seemed frustrated at the close attention paid to the exact wording of his statement. “‘I’m not aware’, ‘I don’t believe’, you could look up in a thesaurus and find some other ways ... I don’t think there’s a distinction there that’s noteworthy,” said Spicer. “The answer is, we’re not aware,” he concluded. “I don’t know how much clearer we can be on this.” Spicer’s frustration continued when he was quizzed about the British politician Nigel Farage’s visit to the Ecuador embassy in London to see the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. Was Farage, the staunchest UK political supporter of Trump and one of the leaders of the Brexit movement, visiting Assange at Trump’s behest? “This is silly. I don’t think asking where random foreign leaders are and whether they are there ... I don’t keep his schedule,” said Spicer. “I have my own concerns here keeping track of what everyone is doing. I generally don’t worry about what’s going on across the pond,” Spicer said.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) White House: Trump unaware of Flynn’s foreign agent work Thu Mar 9th, 2017 2:40pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Stephen Braun And Chad Day / The Associated Press WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump was not aware that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had worked to further the interests of the government of Turkey before appointing him, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday. Spicer’s comments came two days after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Turkey’s government. Asked whether Trump knew about Flynn’s work before he appointed him as national security adviser, Spicer said, “I don’t believe that that was known.” Flynn and his company filed the registration paperwork describing $530,000 worth of lobbying before Election Day on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. In an interview with The Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn did so after pressure from Justice Department officials. The filing this week was the former head of the Defence Intelligence Agency’s first acknowledgement that his consulting business furthered the interests of a foreign government while he was working as a top adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign. Flynn’s disclosure that his lobbying — from August through November— may have benefited Turkey’s authoritarian government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came as Flynn has drawn scrutiny from the FBI for his contacts with Russian officials. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice-President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. In paperwork filed with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm acknowledged that his lobbying “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” The lobbying contract ended after Trump’s election in November, according to the paperwork. A spokesman for Flynn, Price Floyd, said the general was not available for an interview Thursday. Floyd referred the AP to Flynn’s filing in response to questions about why he and his firm had decided to register this week. Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. The Turkish Embassy also didn’t respond to questions from the AP. Spicer said he didn’t know what Flynn had disclosed about his background and lobbying work during the White House’s vetting of him for appointment as national security adviser. Spicer said Flynn was free to do the lobbying work because it occurred while he was a private citizen. “There’s nothing nefarious about doing anything that’s legal as long as the proper paperwork if filed,” Spicer said. He declined to say whether Trump would have appointed Flynn if he had known about the lobbying. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Flynn’s newly disclosed lobbying would not have violated that pledge because it occurred before he joined the Trump administration in January, but the pledge precludes Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. More than a month before Flynn was appointed as national security adviser, news accounts and Democratic senators had raised questions about potential conflicts of interest regarding Flynn’s work for the Turkish company. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., criticized Flynn’s work and late disclosure again Thursday as troubling. “Gen. Flynn’s behaviour seems to be part of a larger pattern of poor judgment from members of this administration,” she said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement that Flynn should return any foreign money he received. “This astonishing admission is more appalling evidence of foreign entanglements and conflicts of interest involving the Trump team,” he said. He said a special prosecutor should be appointed to look into ties between Trump officials and foreign governments. Alptekin told the AP that Justice Department officials had pushed for Flynn and his firm to register as foreign agents in recent weeks. He said the filing was a response to “political pressure” and he did not agree with Flynn’s decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. He also said that he had asked for some of his money back because of his dissatisfaction with the company’s performance. “I disagree with the filing,” he said in a phone call from Istanbul. “It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government.” Flynn’s consulting firm had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive disclosures about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. Flynn Intel and S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying pressured congressional aides to investigate a cleric who Erdogan had accused of directing a botched coup last summer. The two firms orchestrated meetings with U.S. officials— including congressional staffers and Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, a Republican — as well as journalists. They also worked on research, informational materials and a video on the cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Flynn met privately in September in New York with two senior Turkish government officials, including the government’s ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn’s company did not name the officials, but the current Turkish energy minister is Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan’s son-in-law. Alptekin told the AP he set up the meeting at a New York hotel between Flynn and the two officials while the officials were attending U.N. sessions and a separate conference Alptekin had arranged. Alptekin is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Erdogan, who has accelerated a crackdown against the nation’s weakening secularist faction since the failed coup last summer. Erdogan has accused cleric Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel’s work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric.   Most Read Standoff between woman, Everett police ends peacefully EVERETT — A nearly six-hour-long SWAT standoff ended peacefully Wednesday evening on… Mar 16th, 2017 by Herald Staff Cocoon House raises $8 million for new building EVERETT — Cocoon House, a nonprofit that serves homeless youth, is now… Mar 15th, 2017 by Chris Winters Intestinal illnesses linked to Marysville trampoline park MARYSVILLE — The Snohomish Health District is looking into reports of a… Mar 16th, 2017 by Kari Bray Tree house turned into bed and breakfast near Woodinville WOODINVILLE — Tree houses are growing up.

Olga Kharif The Wi-Fi icon glows on nearly every internet-connected device, from the iPhone to thermostats to TVs. But it’s starting to fade from the limelight. Photo: iStock Portland: The Wi-Fi icon — a dot with radio waves radiating outward — glows on nearly every internet-connected device, from the iPhone to thermostats to TVs. But it’s starting to fade from the limelight. With every major US wireless carrier now offering unlimited data plans, consumers don’t need to log on to a Wi-Fi network to avoid costly overage charges anymore. That’s a critical change that threatens to render Wi-Fi obsolete. And with new competitive technologies crowding in, the future looks even dimmer. “You could see a big switch,” said Tim Farrar, founder of Telecom Media Finance Associates Inc. “Your coffee shops may be less compelled to provide Wi-Fi for you now.” In an all-data-you-can-eat world, consumers’ use of Wi-Fi at public places like stadiums and airports will drop to a third of all mobile data traffic from about half, Farrar estimates. This means businesses not upgrading public access Wi-Fi as often. Smartphone users might not even turn on their Wi-Fi capability, according to Barry Gilbert, an analyst at researcher Strategy Analytics in Boston. “At Sprint Corp., where unlimited plans are the norm, customers aren’t waiting until they get to a Wi-Fi hot spot to watch the latest video. They are staying on cellular,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC. “Customers are rational. When pricing incentives favour Wi-Fi, customers use more Wi-Fi. When pricing incentives shift, so does behaviour.” The erosion of Wi-Fi’s influence is likely to be slow and uneven. While unlimited data plans make the technology less necessary for phones, many home devices, from a MacBook to an Amazon Echo, still use Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. Wi-Fi also helps fill in gaps in some office buildings and homes that have spotty cellphone coverage. Some wireless carriers also still rely on Wi-Fi networks to handle a large portion of the growing volume of internet traffic. Putting all of that Netflix-binging and Spotify-listening on cellular networks could strain capacity. “Wi-Fi has consistently stayed ahead in terms of performance and its ability to move large amounts of data,” said Kevin Robinson, vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance, a consortium of more than 700 companies, including Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., LG Electronics Inc., Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Comcast Corp. “The market is going to decide which technology provides the best capabilities for the end user. To displace a technology like Wi-Fi is likely very optimistic.” Unlimited plans aren’t the only threat. Wi-Fi has survived 20 years and spurred a roughly $20 billion industry of gear, service providers and chipmakers — mainly because its technology is open to innovation and it operates freely in the nation’s unlicensed airwaves. Wi-Fi now faces competition from other technologies that also run in those same frequencies. Crowded airwaves A new system called LTE in Unlicensed Spectrum — or LTE-U, which depends on a combination of new small-cell towers and home wireless routers — risks congesting the spectrum upon which Wi-Fi relies. In decades past, the nation’s unlicensed airwaves were mostly known for their use by garage door openers, cordless phones, and the occasional baby monitor. Now they’re full of traffic from Wi-Fi networks that connect smartphones, laptops, set-top boxes, game consoles, and a whole host of smart devices to the internet. As LTE-U moves in, Wi-Fi may get drowned out. “Places where operators have traditionally looked to Wi-Fi, they’ll leverage LTE-U,” said Kyung Mun, an analyst at researcher Mobile Experts. Developed by cellular carriers and their vendors, LTE-U may act as a disincentive for companies experimenting with Wi-Fi calling, including Comcast, and those dabbling in fiber networks, like Alphabet Inc.’s Google. But LTE-U also benefits users. Consumers don’t have to type in passwords and sign in to every network like they do for public Wi-Fi hot spots. They can seamlessly move between their carriers’ cellular network and LTE-U, and not really know the difference. LTE-U — and a related cellular advancement, LTE-LAA — will also require less equipment. A 180,000-square-foot building would need 24 new access points instead of about 80 Wi-Fi hot spots, according to Amit Jain, vice president of marketing and product management at hardware maker SpiderCloud Wireless, which plans to ship LTE-U and LTE-LAA equipment in the second quarter. However, the total cost of deployment will be similar to Wi-Fi, Jain said. Annual shipments of LTE-U/LTE-LAA-capable access points will increase to about 1.1 million units globally by 2020, up from tens of thousands in 2016, according to Mobile Experts. “You could see LTE in the house, in the enterprise, and the role of Wi-Fi morphing into something different: a legacy technology,” said independent wireless analyst Chetan Sharma. Companies like Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 manufacturer of Wi-Fi access points, are already considering developing new gear that can accommodate both Wi-Fi and LTE-U technologies. “It’s too early to say what will win out,” said Mike Iandolo, vice president and general manager at the mobile technology group at Cisco. “LTE has an advantage, but there’ll still be a place for Wi-Fi.” The company’s goal is to ensure its Wi-Fi portfolio evolves to meet the needs of customers, he said. Citizen action Another technology that risks making Wi-Fi outmoded is something called CBRS, short for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. The new system lets anyone share a huge swath of spectrum currently being used by the US Navy. In February, Nokia Oyj, Alphabet and Qualcomm tested LTE technology on the airwaves to broadcast a live high-definition video of cars racing on a track in Las Vegas. More reliable than Wi-Fi, CBRS may ultimately be a better option for factories, airports and ports, according to Michael Peeters, head of innovation portfolio management at Nokia and president of CBRS Alliance, whose membership includes AT&T Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and Comcast. The first CBRS devices should be certified for use in mid-2017, he said. On top of all these threats to Wi-Fi is the coming spread of 5G, which promises to let consumers download a high-definition movie in less than a second. By using CBRS, wireless carriers can deploy 5G faster and easier, using the shared airwaves instead of trying to acquire spectrum licenses at auction or through deals. In the nearer term, Wi-Fi is already starting to disappear from people’s daily routines. “Before I would have to go and find a Wi-Fi hot spot, which was very inconvenient for me,” said Michael Kimbrough, an entrepreneur in Birmingham, Alabama, who last month signed up for an unlimited data plan from Verizon Wireless. “Now I don’t have to do that.” Bloomberg Olga Kharif Topics: Wi-Fi Internet Unlimited Plans Mobile Data Traffic LTE More From Livemint READ MORE Can India reduce dependence on fickle monsoon?

FRIDAY MARCH 17, 2017 COMMENT | Greek Edition Classifieds Subscriptions FAVORITES No favorites Twitter Facebook Term Navigation NEWS BUSINESS COMMENT LIFE WHAT’S ON SPORTS COMMUNITY SURVIVAL GUIDE SPECIAL REPORT MULTIMEDIA   NIKOS KONSTANDARAS General Flynn and the strategic deficit COMMENT 10.03.2017 TAGS: Politics It is as if a torpedo passed under our keel and we saw it only when it exploded elsewhere. The recent revelations from President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, retired General Michael Flynn, showed that we had a close call. A lawyer for Flynn filed paperwork with the Justice Department declaring that last year he undertook lobbying work that “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” For the work between August and November, Flynn Intel Group Inc was paid 530,000 dollars. Flynn was forced to resign from the position of Trump’s top security aide in February when it emerged that although he had met with the Russian ambassador to the United States he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about this, after which the latter repeated Flynn’s lies in public. The extent of Flynn’s dealings with Russia and Turkey is not known, but it is clear that if he had not resigned he would have remained, at least, a former strong supporter of Turkey. On November 8, Flynn had published an opinion piece in The Hill, a Washington-based political newspaper, titled “Our ally Turkey is in crisis and needs our support.” Flynn argued that the United States should extradite the self-exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claims was behind the failed coup in Turkey last July. “We should not provide him safe haven,” Flynn wrote of Gulen. “In this crisis, it is imperative that we remember who our real friends are.” On Wednesday, The Hill’s editor added a note to the piece, clarifying that the newspaper did not know that Flynn had been paid to write it, nor that the draft had been shown earlier to a Dutch company, Inovo BV, which, the note said, is “owned by a Turkish businessman with ties to Turkey’s president.” The Associated Press reported that according to the documents filed, Flynn, who was then a top aide to presidential candidate Trump, met in September with the Turkish ministers of foreign affairs and energy. The cooperation ended in November, and though it is difficult to believe that Flynn was paid half a million dollars for one op-ed piece, we cannot claim that as national security adviser he would have made Turkish interests his priority. At the same time, can we really have expected him to have been completely unbiased in any Greek-Turkish dispute? We still don’t know the interests of people around the American president – who himself has business interests in Turkey, among other countries. Nothing is as it was. Prior US strategy cannot be taken for granted. This makes it imperative for our country to be clear about its own course, to implement its strategy calmly and decisively. We must avoid being caught up in the game of our excitable neighbors and keep our eyes on where we want to go.

Source: AAP 10 Mar 2017 - 8:54 AM  UPDATED 10 Mar 2017 - 8:54 AM Tweet President Donald Trump was not aware his former national security adviser had worked to further the interests of the government of Turkey before appointing him, the White House says. The comment comes two days after Michael Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc, filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Ankara. Asked on Thursay whether Trump knew about Flynn's work before he appointed him as national security adviser, press secretary Sean Spicer said: "I don't believe that that was known." Flynn and his company filed the registration paperwork describing $US530,000 ($A705,900) worth of lobbying before election day for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. In an interview with the Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn did so after pressure from Justice Department officials. The filing this week was the retired US Army lieutenant-general's first acknowledgement his consulting business furthered the interests of a foreign government while he was working as a top adviser to Trump's presidential campaign. Trump sacked Flynn as national security adviser in February for misleading Vice-President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.

Flynn resigned in February after just four weeks as national security adviser when it came to light that he had misled the vice-president, Mike Pence, about phone conversations with the Russian ambassador about sanctions in December. The resignation came after a flow of intelligence leaks revealed that he had secretly discussed sanctions with the ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and then tried to cover up the conversations. Trump transition team 'was told Flynn may need to register as a foreign agent' Read more On Wednesday, it was revealed that from September to November last year, while he was working as a top adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign, Flynn was lobbying for a firm linked to the Turkish government, earning $530,000. He and his company Flynn Intel Group Inc filed retroactive documents with the Department of Justice two days ago to register as a foreign agent. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, US citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the justice department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the justice department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. As part of Flynn’s lobbying for Inovo, a Dutch firm linked to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Flynn penned an op-ed calling for a “radical” cleric (whom the Turkish government wants to extradite) to be booted out of the US. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, he, like other incoming officials, agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Flynn’s newly disclosed lobbying would not have violated that pledge because it occurred before he joined the Trump administration in January, but the pledge would preclude Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again. Spicer was asked whether the president would still have hired Flynn as his national security adviser if he had known he had been working as a foreign agent. “I don’t know ... That’s a hypothetical,” said Spicer. “I don’t know what was discussed prior to the appointment in terms of his background, his résumé, his client base.” “From what I’ve read, he has filed appropriate forms with the Department of Justice ; ask them and subsequently him if you have any questions about the filing,” said Spicer. Spicer also said he was unaware whether Flynn was involved in any discussions about foreign policy regarding Turkey. “I don’t know. I don’t have anything on that,” he replied. Opaque answers and the reply of “I don’t know” are now regular features at Spicer’s daily press conferences, which have been memorably lampooned by the actor Melissa McCarthy on NBC’s Saturday Night Live. On Wednesday, Spicer confused reporters by initially saying “we need to find out” if Trump was the subject of an investigation by the justice department into Russia’s involvement in the US election, then clarifying that he had “no reason” to believe that Trump was. “I just want to be really clear on one point which is there is no reason that we have to think that the president is the target of any investigation whatsoever,” he said eventually on Wednesday, possibly after looking down at a message on his lectern. “There is no reason to believe that he is the target of any investigation. I think that’s a very important point to make.” On Thursday, reporters returned to the topic, asking the press secretary to clarify whether the administration did or did not know for sure if the president was the subject of a DoJ investigation. “The assurance I gave you was that I’m not aware. That was 100% accurate,” said Spicer, who then seemed frustrated at the close attention paid to the exact wording of his statement. “‘I’m not aware’, ‘I don’t believe’, you could look up in a thesaurus and find some other ways ... I don’t think there’s a distinction there that’s noteworthy,” said Spicer. “The answer is, we’re not aware,” he concluded. “I don’t know how much clearer we can be on this.” Spicer’s frustration continued when he was quizzed about the British politician Nigel Farage’s visit to the Ecuador embassy in London to see the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. Was Farage, the staunchest UK political supporter of Trump and one of the leaders of the Brexit movement, visiting Assange at Trump’s behest? “This is silly. I don’t think asking where random foreign leaders are and whether they are there ... I don’t keep his schedule,” said Spicer. “I have my own concerns here keeping track of what everyone is doing. I generally don’t worry about what’s going on across the pond,” Spicer said.

Flynn's disclosure that his lobbying may have benefited Turkey's authoritarian government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan comes as Flynn has drawn scrutiny from the FBI for his contacts with Russian officials. In paperwork filed with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm acknowledged that lobbying from August through November "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." According to the filings, the lobbying contract ended after Trump's election in November. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Flynn's newly disclosed lobbying would not have violated that pledge because it occurred before he joined the Trump administration in January, but the pledge would preclude Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. On Wednesday, Alptekin told The AP that Justice Department officials had pushed for Flynn and his firm to register as foreign agents in recent weeks. Alptekin said in a phone call from Istanbul that the changes were a response to "political pressure" and he did not agree with Flynn's decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. "I disagree with the filing," he said. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government." Calls to phone numbers associated with Flynn and his firm weren't answered Wednesday or Thursday. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond to questions about whether the Justice Department or FBI had contacted Flynn about his lobbying activities. Kelner declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. Reached Wednesday afternoon, an official at the Turkish embassy in Washington said he would refer the questions to the embassy spokesman. The spokesman did not respond. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. As a key member of Trump's transition team last December, Flynn spoke by phone several times with Kislyak during the period when former President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and levied new sanctions in response to Russian election-related hacking.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Everspin unveils MRAM SSDs aimed at the storage accelerator market Everspin unveils MRAM SSDs aimed at the storage accelerator market By Joel Hruska on March 9, 2017 at 11:26 am Comment Intel and its 3D XPoint memory have dominated recent headlines on NAND flash alternatives, but they’ve never been the only game in town. Everspin, a company whose technology we’ve covered several times in the past, announced today that they will bring new MRAM-based drives to market with new partners and commercial relationships. In theory, as we’ve discussed before, MRAM could represent a so-called ‘Holy Grail’ — a non-volatile memory solution that is lower power than DRAM while offering improved performance. MRAM is extremely reliable (much more so than NAND flash) and should be faster than NAND flash, but its storage densities are much lower. Today, Everspin’s densest chips reach 256Mb per die. That’s not particularly large compared with even planar NAND, and the advent of 3D NAND has sent flash densities soaring. Everspin’s new SSDs will be marketed under the nvNitro brand name, and will ship in 1GB and 2GB capacities. These small drives are intended to be used for accelerating storage workloads, not as bootable OS drives, and they offer 1.5 million IOPS with what Everspin terms “six microsecond end-to-end latency.” They can be mapped as either NVMe SSDs or as memory-mapped I/O. The longevity of MRAM means fancy controller schemes to implement wear leveling or write combining aren’t needed, though how much impact this will have on price is open to debate. Anandtech notes that the very high rated performance on these drives compares well against the fastest NAND you can buy today, though the capacity is obviously much smaller. Everspin claims it will introduce 4GB – 16GB capacities this year in one part of its press release, but elsewhere refers to “capacity options ranging from 512MB to 8GB throughout the year.” Either way, it’s clear the company wants to make a name for itself in the storage market and is ramping towards the higher capacities that could make that possible. What’ll be particularly interesting is to see how these drives stack up against both NAND flash and Intel’s 3D XPoint / Optane technology. Optane may well end up being the better comparison point — Intel is expected to bring 16GB and 32GB drives to market this year (which better matches the modest capacities of MRAM drives) and the two non-volatile storage technologies have similar claims of high reliability and superior-to-NAND performance. It may also prove to be the better price comparison, since the sheer volume of NAND produced each year makes it extremely difficult for challengers to match that memory’s price scaling.

Mr Trump sacked Flynn, a former US army lieutenant-general, last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. In the latest development a lawyer for Mr Flynn filed documents with the US Department of Justice registering him as a "foreign agent" over work on behalf of a Turkish company. Watch | Who is Michael Flynn? 00:50 The documents said Mr Flynn and his consulting firm Flynn Intel Group Inc. were voluntarily registering for having carried out lobbying from August to November that "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey". Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act US citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman who hired Flynn's firm, said the filing had been made in response to pressure from Justice Department officials in recent weeks.  Mr Flynn's company had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Mr Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department. In mid-September the company was invited by Mr Alptekin to meet with Turkish officials in New York. Among those officials, the documents said, were Turkey's ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Watch | Michael Flynn resigns as Donald Trump's national security adviser 00:39 Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, has accused cleric Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating an aborted coup and called for his extradition from the US. According to the Department of Justice documents Flynn Intel's work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring US officials to take action against the cleric. Asked if the president had known about Mr Flynn's connection to Turkey before appointing him Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, said: "I don't believe that was known."

This is not the company’s first fitness-focused wearable, Xiaomi has already released multiple versions of its Band wearable, so this is merely an extension of those efforts. Xiaomi’s smart shoes do have a very unorthodox name, though, they’re called the “90 Minutes Ultra Smart Sportswear.” Xiaomi has created these smart shoes in collaboration with Intel which has provided the button-sized Curie module that powers the fitness-tracking features. The smart shoes are capable of tracking the user’s movement so they get data about walking, running, and climbing. They will get a report at the end of the day which details the distance they traveled, their average speed, and the calories that they burned. The shoes themselves appear to be comfortable as they have anti-skid features, air cushions, soles that have an arch design and antibacterial insoles. Xiaomi is going to release them in April with four color options: Black and Surf Blue for men and Black and Pink for women. Those who like running in the night will prefer the special Blue Edition which glows in the dark. As you might have guessed by now, Xiaomi has only released this product in China for now so it’s unclear if and when they will arrive in the United States. They cost CNY 300 which is around $44.

Home Industry A world without Wi-Fi looks possible as unlimited plans rise A world without Wi-Fi looks possible as unlimited plans rise The Wi-Fi icon -- a dot with radio waves radiating outward -- glows on nearly every internet-connected device, from the iPhone to thermostats to TVs. But it’s starting to fade from the limelight. By: Bloomberg | New Delhi | Updated: March 10, 2017 12:08 AM With every major U.S. wireless carrier now offering unlimited data plans, consumers don’t need to log on to a Wi-Fi network to avoid costly overage charges anymore. The Wi-Fi icon — a dot with radio waves radiating outward — glows on nearly every internet-connected device, from the iPhone to thermostats to TVs. But it’s starting to fade from the limelight. With every major U.S. wireless carrier now offering unlimited data plans, consumers don’t need to log on to a Wi-Fi network to avoid costly overage charges anymore. That’s a critical change that threatens to render Wi-Fi obsolete. And with new competitive technologies crowding in, the future looks even dimmer. “You could see a big switch,” said Tim Farrar, founder of Telecom Media Finance Associates Inc. “Your coffee shops may be less compelled to provide Wi-Fi for you now.” In an all-data-you-can-eat world, consumers’ use of Wi-Fi at public places like stadiums and airports will drop to a third of all mobile data traffic from about half, Farrar estimates. This means businesses not upgrading public access Wi-Fi as often. Smartphone users might not even turn on their Wi-Fi capability, according to Barry Gilbert, an analyst at researcher Strategy Analytics in Boston. “At Sprint Corp., where unlimited plans are the norm, customers aren’t waiting until they get to a Wi-Fi hot spot to watch the latest video. They are staying on cellular,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC. “Customers are rational. When pricing incentives favor Wi-Fi, customers use more Wi-Fi. When pricing incentives shift, so does behavior.” At home as well. Almost a third of people don’t use a home broadband internet connection because they have an unlimited data plan on their phones, according to a survey released Thursday by ReportLinker. Also Watch: The erosion of Wi-Fi’s influence is likely to be slow and uneven. While unlimited data plans make the technology less necessary for phones, many home devices, from a MacBook to an Amazon Echo, still use Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. Wi-Fi also helps fill in gaps in some office buildings and homes that have spotty cellphone coverage. Some wireless carriers also still rely on Wi-Fi networks to handle a large portion of the growing volume of internet traffic. Putting all of that Netflix-binging and Spotify-listening on cellular networks could strain capacity. “Wi-Fi has consistently stayed ahead in terms of performance and its ability to move large amounts of data,” said Kevin Robinson, vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance, a consortium of more than 700 companies, including Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., LG Electronics Inc., Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Comcast Corp. “The market is going to decide which technology provides the best capabilities for the end user. To displace a technology like Wi-Fi is likely very optimistic.” Unlimited plans aren’t the only threat. Wi-Fi has survived 20 years and spurred a roughly $20 billion industry of gear, service providers and chipmakers — mainly because its technology is open to innovation and it operates freely in the nation’s unlicensed airwaves. Wi-Fi now faces competition from other technologies that also run in those same frequencies. Crowded Airwaves A new system called LTE in Unlicensed Spectrum — or LTE-U, which depends on a combination of new small-cell towers and home wireless routers — risks congesting the spectrum upon which Wi-Fi relies. In decades past, the nation’s unlicensed airwaves were mostly known for their use by garage door openers, cordless phones, and the occasional baby monitor. Now they’re full of traffic from Wi-Fi networks that connect smartphones, laptops, set-top boxes, game consoles, and a whole host of smart devices to the internet. As LTE-U moves in, Wi-Fi may get drowned out. “Places where operators have traditionally looked to Wi-Fi, they’ll leverage LTE-U,” said Kyung Mun, an analyst at researcher Mobile Experts. Developed by cellular carriers and their vendors, LTE-U may act as a disincentive for companies experimenting with Wi-Fi calling, including Comcast, and those dabbling in fiber networks, like Alphabet Inc.’s Google. But LTE-U also benefits users. Consumers don’t have to type in passwords and sign in to every network like they do for public Wi-Fi hot spots. They can seamlessly move between their carriers’ cellular network and LTE-U, and not really know the difference. LTE-U — and a related cellular advancement, LTE-LAA — will also require less equipment. A 180,000-square-foot building would need 24 new access points instead of about 80 Wi-Fi hot spots, according to Amit Jain, vice president of marketing and product management at hardware maker SpiderCloud Wireless, which plans to ship LTE-U and LTE-LAA equipment in the second quarter. However, the total cost of deployment will be similar to Wi-Fi, Jain said. Annual shipments of LTE-U/LTE-LAA-capable access points will increase to about 1.1 million units globally by 2020, up from tens of thousands in 2016, according to Mobile Experts. “You could see LTE in the house, in the enterprise, and the role of Wi-Fi morphing into something different: a legacy technology,” said independent wireless analyst Chetan Sharma. Companies like Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 manufacturer of Wi-Fi access points, are already considering developing new gear that can accommodate both Wi-Fi and LTE-U technologies. “It’s too early to say what will win out,” said Mike Iandolo, vice president and general manager at the mobile technology group at Cisco. “LTE has an advantage, but there’ll still be a place for Wi-Fi.” The company’s goal is to ensure its Wi-Fi portfolio evolves to meet the needs of customers, he said. Citizen Action Another technology that risks making Wi-Fi outmoded is something called CBRS, short for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. The new system lets anyone share a huge swath of spectrum currently being used by the U.S. Navy. In February, Nokia Oyj, Alphabet and Qualcomm tested LTE technology on the airwaves to broadcast a live high-definition video of cars racing on a track in Las Vegas. More reliable than Wi-Fi, CBRS may ultimately be a better option for factories, airports and ports, according to Michael Peeters, head of innovation portfolio management at Nokia and president of CBRS Alliance, whose membership includes AT&T Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and Comcast. The first CBRS devices should be certified for use in mid-2017, he said. On top of all these threats to Wi-Fi is the coming spread of 5G, which promises to let consumers download a high-definition movie in less than a second. By using CBRS, wireless carriers can deploy 5G faster and easier, using the shared airwaves instead of trying to acquire spectrum licenses at auction or through deals. In the nearer term, Wi-Fi is already starting to disappear from people’s daily routines. “Before I would have to go and find a Wi-Fi hot spot, which was very inconvenient for me,” said Michael Kimbrough, an entrepreneur in Birmingham, Alabama, who last month signed up for an unlimited data plan from Verizon Wireless. “Now I don’t have to do that.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

John Cox, courtesy photo from John Cox via Los Angeles Times. Now, via Conservative Intel, I learn that John Cox has beaten fellow Republicans out of the gate by announcing that he’s running. His campaign website consists of a donation solicitation. Only a week ago, the Los Angeles Times reported that Cox formed an exploratory committee. That article by Phil Willon says that the only other declared Republican candidate is Rosey Grier. (The headshot of Cox provided to the Los Angeles Times is not complimentary, although I am sure it is meant to be complimentary.) Because Cox believes the current California state government is corrupted by special interest money, he is pushing to increasing the number of legislative districts: “I have a plan to make legislative districts small enough that anyone can run, and they won’t need special interest money to do it. These smaller, neighborhood districts will allow elections to be decided on issues and character, not 30 second commercials or vicious mail pieces.” Simultaneously, he wants to cut the budget of the State Legislature. Hailing originally from Illinois, his earlier political career included four unsuccessful runs for office. He even briefly ran for president in 2004. At this point, I am more than a little skeptical.

His main theme that he is financially supporting is Neighborhood Legislature initiative. This was implemented in New Hampshire and works apparently quite well. It will be a revolutionary and huge task to implement in the State of California. Other than personal funds thus far and a desire to return the legislature to the people, I don’t see much of a California connection in his bid to become governor. I want to see blue move to more of a balance in California because the one party system isn’t working for the benefit of our citizens. While there is a steep challenge to get this movement going, I remember other out-of-state candidates (or those with lots of money) making a try to become governor. I have an open mind at this point and wish Mr. Cox well in his effort. Leave a Reply Cancel reply (Click above for more information.) Polls How do you follow important city news?

(QCOM) Stock and Trump the Bulls QCOM stock is gearing up for a leg lower. Profit with a well-placed spread.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is a Short Now. Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Investors Should Bet on the Bears to Win View All Posts Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) saw a rare reprieve in Wednesday’s session. But traders may want to fade the modest cheer with a well-positioned, out-of-the-money put spread on QCOM stock. Source: Shutterstock After bearish jeers prompted by Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) litigation fired at Qualcomm several weeks back, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) offered QCOM stock investors some slight relief Wednesday. Shares of Qualcomm rallied 1.73% after it was learned that Qualcomm’s 10 nanometer Centriq 2400 processors will power certain Microsoft Azure cloud workloads as the company accelerates its cloud platform services. That’s potentially a problem for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and the collaboration also shows Qualcomm’s commitment to an ARM-based server ecosystem. This could prove a boon in the future for QCOM stock, but there are no guarantees it will — and it certainly won’t happen overnight. Having said that, it’s our opinion there’s still a lot for QCOM stock to prove both off and on the price chart. QCOM Stock Weekly Chart Click to Enlarge When I last wrote about Qualcomm, our technical opinion was focused on the possibility for another leg higher. Shares were laterally consolidating around $66.50 and holding key support levels within an existing uptrend, while stochastics approached an oversold reading. QCOM stock did wind up rallying upward of 5% to fresh year-to-date highs, but then the trend turned aggressively bearish. An initial break of the up-channel support line was followed closely by Apple’s litigation news, which sent shares plunging lower deep into bear territory and where they remain today. The past few weeks have been spent digesting the large and technically destructive loss. Now and with the unwinding of the oversold condition in place, QCOM appears to be ready for a bearish continuation move lower. Admittedly, there is some support for higher prices. Stochastics have yet to confirm our view. Further, QCOM did hold the 62% retracement level and is now at its highest price since the January Apple-induced gap. Speaking of which, if Wall Street lore holds true, the gap is a sizable area to fill. Sometimes you just have to call a spade a spade. And for QCOM stock, this means respecting a bearish flag pattern in a stock much closer to 52-week and multi-year lows and well-positioned to challenge those lowly price levels in the coming months.

Mayor Reed will join other elected officials and more than 50,000 leaders and participants representing the business, government, music, film and entertainment sectors. On Friday, March 10, Mayor Reed will serve as a panelist for an opening technology session, “Wireless Network Innovation: Smart City Foundation,” focusing on best practices for establishing smart cities in the United States. Mayor Reed will join Kathleen Grillo, Verizon Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of Public Policy and Government Affairs, Howard Wright, Intel Vice President of Platform Engineering Group and Director of Business Development in the Communication and Devices Group, and Joe Kochan, US Ignite Chief Operating Officer and Co-Founder. Chelsea Collier, founder of Digi.City, will serve as the moderator. “The City of Atlanta is a national leader in smart city innovation because of the strength of our partnerships with the State of Georgia, our colleges and universities and the private sector,” said Mayor Reed. “We are fully committed to combining our infrastructure and transportation assets with next generation technologies to become more competitive and more efficient. I look forward to this important conversation with key stakeholders in the technology community, exploring how collaboration between policymakers and industry is essential to cultivating an environment that leverages 21st century innovation.” Panelists will discuss smart city innovation, the power of wireless connectivity in establishing smart cities and key challenges that must be addressed in partnership by the public and private sectors. Mayor Reed will also discuss the City of Atlanta’s smart city initiatives. Under Mayor Reed’s leadership, the City of Atlanta has prioritized an innovation and technology agenda that will improve local safety, infrastructure and transportation operations. As part of the AT&T Smart Cities initiative, the City of Atlanta, the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) and the Georgia Department of Transportation are gearing up to offer a self-driving vehicle demonstration pilot program on North Avenue, one of the city’s most important and busy streets. North Avenue connects Georgia Tech with Midtown Atlanta, Ponce City Market, the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Freedom Park. The pilot program, expected to launch in fall 2017, is a critical step to introducing autonomous vehicles to the city. Over the past 30 years, SXSW has become the premier destination to discover game-changing new technologies, films and artists while networking with some of the brightest minds in the world.

The Senate Intelligence Committee is already probing Russia's meddling in the presidential race, and the White House has floated the idea that the president's claim be folded into the larger investigation. ADVERTISEMENT Trump appeared to catch lawmakers off guard over the weekend when he tweeted, without evidence, that his predecessor "had my 'wires tapped.'" Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 McConnell said Thursday he has seen "no evidence" to support Trump's claim.  A Senate Judiciary subcommittee overseen by Sens.

In conjunction with International Women’s Day and Women’s History Month, consumer perception research firm YouGov BrandIndex released a ranking of the best-perceived brands by women, as well as the ones that have improved the most in perception in the last year. Women were asked, “Do you have a general positive feeling about the brand?” Rounding out the top 10 are: 6. Clorox 7. Cheerios 8. Craftsman 9. YouTube 10. Dove. Craftsman tools seemed like an odd brand for women to single out, but YouGov BrandIndex’s data suggests that a good number of women consider themselves Craftsman customers, said Ted Marzilli, CEO YouGov BrandIndex. “That could imply more men and women are sharing the household tools,” he said. “It could also reflect more single households in general. I am more surprised by M&M’s being on the list, but apparently everyone likes some degree of indulgence.” On the list of top brands, the traditional household brands are a theme. “But brands like Amazon, Google and YouTube have become a big part of all of our lives — that is true regardless of gender,” he said. The firm also studied t brands whose perception had improved. Snapchat gained the most perception, followed by Uber, Chick-Fil-A, Instagram, Trivago, Bank of America, MTV, PlayStation, Comcast/Infinity and Capital One. “The list runs the gambit from newer, technology-based brands to the more traditional,” Marzilli said. “Virtually any brand has the potential to make inroads with women, who represent roughly half of all consumers.” The takeaway for marketers is that “seeing is believing,” he said. “Women seeing women in advertisements helps to make it more clear that the brand is for women,” Marzilli said. “And of course that has to be done in an authentic and credible way.” Brawny Boasts Women in Plaid Campaign Brawny is the latest brand to unveil a campaign with a female empowerment theme, something it’s doing by featuring a woman on its “Brawny Man” packaging design. For Women’s History Month, the Georgia Pacific-owned paper towel brand is replacing the very masculine-looking “Brawny Man” featured on the pack with a woman wearing the same red lumberjack shirt. The pack redesign is part of a wider campaign, by agency Cutwater, taglined #StrengthHasNoGender, that celebrates women who exhibit strength and resilience and have broken down barriers in traditionally male-dominated professions. It also includes a TV ad that highlights the accomplishments of women including Harriet Tubman, Amelia Earhart and Serena Williams, and an online film campaign telling the stories of four inspiring women in STEM fields. They are Vernice Armour, the first African-American female naval aviator in the Marine Corps and the first African American female combat pilot in the U.S. Armed Forces; Dr. Anna Kornbrot, an oral surgeon and clinical assistant professor of OMFS at Penn Dental School who was the first woman to graduate from Columbia College; Patty Lopez, a platform applications engineer at Intel who holds seven imaging patents and Brittany Wenger, first place winner in the 2012 Google Science Fair who developed the app Cloud4Cancer, a breast cancer diagnosis test. YouTube Viewers Hit 1 Billion Hours of Video a Day YouTube viewership hit a milestone last year, the company said last week, with global users now collectively watching a billion hours of video a day. As the Wall Street Journal first reported, the site reached that milestone in part by powering its recommendations engine with machine learning algorithms. Other factors have contributed to the increase in viewership, including the shift to mobile: a growing number of people have internet access via their mobile devices, and more than 60 percent of YouTube watch time now happens on mobile and tablets. In 2012, YouTube changed the way it measured viewership, switching from the number of clicks a video receives to the time spent watching videos. Since then, viewership is up 10-fold. As YouTube said on its blog, “we thought the amount of time someone spent watching a video was a better way to understand whether a viewer really enjoyed it.” The Alphabet-owned company appears to have a leg up on other platforms: Facebook reported just over a year ago that its users watch 100 million hours of video a day, while Netflix said its users watched more than 116 million hours a day in 2015. Meanwhile, as the Journal pointed out, YouTube’s global popularity almost matches the popularity of television in the US: Nielsen data indicates Americans watch around 1.25 billion hours of live and recorded TV a day. Alphabet doesn’t disclose in its earnings reports how much revenue the video-sharing site brings in. However, facing new competition like Amazon Video Direct, the company last year made the case that the platform provides a robust revenue stream for content creators. Meanwhile, as part of its efforts to boost global viewership, the company last fall introduced a lightweight YouTube app for India. Dropped Mic | Is the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Brand Tarnished? It was the dropped mic heard around the world. At the recent Academy Awards, presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway mistakenly read the wrong Best Picture winner as “La La Land,” not “Moonlight,” after receiving the incorrect card on stage. The flub was quickly, if awkwardly, corrected, but it didn’t take long for PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that has overseen the award process for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences for eight decades, to emerge as a culprit. Experts say the lasting brand damage for the New York-based firm, the world’s second largest by revenue, could be severe for a company that has built its reputation on accuracy. PwC drew early criticism from the likes of Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS Corp. Others took to Twitter under the hashtag #envelopegate to compare the error to their preferred presidential election results and Steve Harvey’s 2015 Miss Universe mistake. For its part, PwC immediately issued an apology, in which it specified “Moonlight,” “La La Land,” Mr. Beatty, Ms. Dunaway and Oscar viewers. In the statement, the firm noted that the presenters were given the wrong category envelope. Moving so quickly was a smart move, but PwC will need to do more in order to repair its reputation. They must back moving quickly with a great dose of transparency and sincerity to add luster back to its brand. It helps that PwC has 83 solid years of helming the 89-year-old Academy Awards tally process under its belt. The setback for PwC could open the door for accounting competitors like Ernst & Young, Deloitte and KPMG, who may take advantage of the situation to build up their own brands. For that, PwC gets a dropped – albeit still working – mic!

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print E&C MARKUP NEARING 24-HOURS – GOP moderates feeling the squeeze – COTTON TELLS HOUSE TO ‘START OVER’ ON REPEAL – Lawmakers demand info on wiretapping claims – MICHEL MEMORIAL TODAY 03/09/17 08:08 AM EST By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) GOOD MORNING FROM WASHINGTON where the Energy and Commerce markup of the GOP Obamacare repeal that kicked off Wednesday morning is still going! GOP Rep. Joe Barton even offered to buy Dems Waffle House if they’d stop offering amendments. The Ways and Means Committee approved their portion of the repeal around 4:30 a.m. Here’s a great gif of E&C Chairman Greg Walden just a short bit ago: http://bit.ly/2lGI0i0. More on Democratic efforts to stall the bill: http://politi.co/2mjXYvj Story Continued Below NEW THIS A.M. — Cotton’s warning bells: The “House health-care bill can't pass Senate w/o major changes. To my friends in House: pause, start over. Get it right, don't get it fast,” Sen. Tom Cotton said in a tweetstorm this morning. More: http://bit.ly/2lH3Guj FEELING THE SQUEEZE — GOP hardliners have made the most hay about the Obamacare repeal bill in recent weeks. But there’s another key voting bloc House Republican leaders need to pay attention to: moderates. “The two dozen House Republicans who outran President Donald Trump at home — in some cases surviving even as Hillary Clinton won their districts — are now facing a vote on health care that could put their political careers on the line,” Kyle and Rachael report. The Republican whip team has been working the moderate wing of the conference for weeks but that doesn’t mean the vote will be easy. “I watched the Obamacare debate back in 2010, and I saw that their more centrist members were put in a difficult predicament,” said Rep. Charlie Dent, leader of the center-right Tuesday Group. “I suspect the flip happens this time.” More: http://politi.co/2lGWT3U AS LONG AS WE GOT EACH OTHER… House Speaker Paul Ryan defended the Obamacare repeal’s bumpy rollout Wednesday, calling early complaints about the bill "typical growing pains." Henry C. Jackson with more: http://politi.co/2lH0LBR TRUMP’S OBAMACARE FALLBACK — If GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare ultimately end up going down in flames, President Trump has a plan B: blame the Democrats. During a private meeting with conservative activists Wednesday, Trump and his aides signaled openness to changes on the repeal bill, like ending the Medicaid expansion earlier. But if that didn’t work, Trump suggested “they could try again in two years, and Obamacare will fail on its own, leaving Democrats to take the blame.” Josh Dawsey and Rachael: http://politi.co/2lH9QdR And as Burgess points out, appeasing conservatives by freezing the Medicaid expansion earlier would tee up a major battle with the Senate where a handful of GOP senators have already come out against the House plan for rolling back the program. NOW ABOUT THAT WIRETAPPING… Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are requesting a briefing from FBI Director James Comey on Trump’s claims that he was wiretapped by President Obama last year. Separately, Sens. Lindsey Graham and Sheldon Whitehouse, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Comey Wednesday requesting more information on the wiretapping claims. Austin: http://politi.co/2m5PSWo Graham told CNN’s Manu Raju he is even “ready to subpoena the intelligence agencies for evidence that would prove” Trump’s claims.

WEDNESDAY’S MOST CLICKED: My story with Bres about Pelosi’s last big fight to save Obamacare STAND (UP) WITH RAND — Despite rumors the president was considering a trip to Kentucky this weeknd, don’t expect Sen. Rand Paul to give up his protest of the GOP repeal plan quite so easy. "I don't feel isolated by this. I actually feel emboldened," Paul told Burgess Wednesday, reiterating his push for lawmakers to vote on separate repeal and replace plans even after Trump singled him out in a tweet earlier this week.

Must be a private meeting with victims of the Bowling Green" Massacre. Update: VP Pence, not Trump, is expected to make the Louisville trip Saturday, Playbook reports. More: http://politi.co/2fgUUPj MARK WARNER 2.0 — Sen. Mark Warner, top Democrat on the Intel panel overseeing the bipartisan probe in Trump and Russia, knows he has an important job ahead of him. So much so, he has immersed himself in Russian war theory and culture and even his colleagues are noticing the reinvigoration. “I’ve never seen him seized by a responsibility as much as he is now,” Sen. Tim Kaine told the New York Times. Warner calls his Intel role “probably the most important thing I’ve done in public life.” Read this Matt Flegenheimer profile: http://nyti.ms/2lGUwxI McCAIN RAISING ALARM ON CIA DUMP — Sen. John McCain is sounding the alarm on the WikiLeaks’ CIA surveillance dump, saying the situation is “really serious” and could “cause a real fundamental evaluation of everything we do.” “You are now looking at ways our intelligence agencies do business being revealed. It has all kind of ramifications,” the Senate Armed Services chairman continued. “I can’t tell you how serious this is." Quote du jour: Sometimes senators are just normal people too. McCain on what he learned from the WikiLeaks dump: “I didn’t know, honestly, that I could be watched from my television, even though it’s off,” McCain said. “That’s a little scary when you think about it: Particularly given my behavior patterns. Throwing things at the set, yelling and screaming: 'It’s a lie!'” Burgess with more: http://politi.co/2mHfqg2 BEAR-RY GOOD DISH WINS CASSEROLE COMPETITION — Rep. Collin Peterson took home his first title in the seventh annual Minnesota delegation hotdish competition Wednesday. The winning ingredient? Ground bear meat. Peterson’s winning casserole recipe also calls for hashbrowns, green beans, gouda cheese, chow mein noodles and a whole lot more. Bres says he can’t wait to replicate the hotdish at home. Check out all the recipes: http://bit.ly/2mHmIjQ DROPPING TODAY: ‘No TRUMP Act’ — Rep. Earl Blumenauer is trying to put a stop to Trump’s children using taxpayer dollars while on business travel. (Eric Trump’s recent business trip to Uruguay cost nearly $100k in hotel bills.) Blumenauer’s bill would nix the use of taxpayer funds to pay for “food and lodging or other expenses at hotels owned or operated by a president or relatives.” The bill won’t go anywhere with Republicans controlling Congress but does make a play on the Trump name: The “No Taxpayer Revenue Used to Monetize the Presidency (TRUMP) Act.” TIPTOEING TOWARD BIPARTISANSHIP? President Trump finally met with Rep. Elijah Cummings Wednesday on prescription drug pricing, with the president tweeting afterwards they had a “great discussion!” “The politics of this ultimately would be good for everybody,” said Rep. Peter Welch, who also attended. The big question is could this kick off a bipartisan relationship that eventually leads to real action — on curbing drug costs or an infrastructure stimulus, both of which Democrats are much more excited about than Republicans. Elana has more: http://politi.co/2lGVjyM “If [Trump] really wants a massive investment in infrastructure that includes real money and not just pretend, then he’s going to have to work with Democrats because there’s a bunch of people here won’t vote for it, a bunch of Republicans,” Rep. Peter DeFazio, top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee, told Huddle. DeFazio had a half-hour chat with Trump’s point man on infrastructure last week. During the meeting, Cummings also told the president “his language describing African-American communities has been ‘hurtful’ and ‘insulting,’” John Fritze reports for the Baltimore Sun. “I think it would be good for him to acknowledge that most African-American people are doing very, very well,” Cummings said. More: http://bsun.md/2lGGUCB KEEPING TABS ON TAX REFORM — Sen. Jeff Flake is the latest Republican to come out against the border adjustment tax, the linchpin of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s tax reform plan. "There will always be winners and losers in a robust debate on reforming the tax code," Flake said on the Senate floor Wednesday. "We ought to make sure that the middle class isn’t in the losing column." The Hill’s Naomi Jagoda: http://bit.ly/2lGUWEt TODAY IN CONGRESS — The Senate meets at 10 a.m. with roll call votes at 12 p.m. and 1:45 p.m. The House meets at 10 a.m. with first votes around 1:30 p.m. and last votes around 5:30 p.m. AROUND THE HILL — Sens.

Michel Bennet, born in New Delhi, India, are the two current senators born in cities (not countries) also home to U.S. embassies.

But it’s starting to fade from the limelight. With every major U.S. wireless carrier now offering unlimited data plans, consumers don’t need to log on to a Wi-Fi network to avoid costly overage charges anymore. That’s a critical change that threatens to render Wi-Fi obsolete. And with new competitive technologies crowding in, the future looks even dimmer. “You could see a big switch,” said Tim Farrar, founder of Telecom Media Finance Associates Inc. “Your coffee shops may be less compelled to provide Wi-Fi for you now.” In an all-data-you-can-eat world, consumers’ use of Wi-Fi at public places like stadiums and airports will drop to a third of all mobile data traffic from about half, Farrar estimates. This means businesses not upgrading public access Wi-Fi as often. Smartphone users might not even turn on their Wi-Fi capability, according to Barry Gilbert, an analyst at researcher Strategy Analytics in Boston. “At Sprint Corp., where unlimited plans are the norm, customers aren’t waiting until they get to a Wi-Fi hot spot to watch the latest video. They are staying on cellular,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC. “Customers are rational. When pricing incentives favor Wi-Fi, customers use more Wi-Fi. When pricing incentives shift, so does behavior.” At home as well. Almost a third of people don’t use a home broadband internet connection because they have an unlimited data plan on their phones, according to a survey released Thursday by ReportLinker. QuickTake The Streaming Revolution The erosion of Wi-Fi’s influence is likely to be slow and uneven. While unlimited data plans make the technology less necessary for phones, many home devices, from a MacBook to an Amazon Echo, still use Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. Wi-Fi also helps fill in gaps in some office buildings and homes that have spotty cellphone coverage. Some wireless carriers also still rely on Wi-Fi networks to handle a large portion of the growing volume of internet traffic. Putting all of that Netflix-bingeing and Spotify-listening on cellular networks could strain capacity. “Wi-Fi has consistently stayed ahead in terms of performance and its ability to move large amounts of data,” said Kevin Robinson, vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance, a consortium of more than 700 companies, including Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., LG Electronics Inc., Intel Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Comcast Corp. “The market is going to decide which technology provides the best capabilities for the end user. To displace a technology like Wi-Fi is likely very optimistic.” Unlimited plans aren’t the only threat. Wi-Fi has survived 20 years and spurred a roughly $20 billion industry of gear, service providers and chipmakers -- mainly because its technology is open to innovation and it operates freely in the nation’s unlicensed airwaves. Wi-Fi now faces competition from other technologies that also run in those same frequencies. Crowded Airwaves A new system called LTE in Unlicensed Spectrum -- or LTE-U, which depends on a combination of new small-cell towers and home wireless routers -- risks congesting the spectrum upon which Wi-Fi relies. In decades past, the nation’s unlicensed airwaves were mostly known for their use by garage door openers, cordless phones, and the occasional baby monitor. Now they’re full of traffic from Wi-Fi networks that connect smartphones, laptops, set-top boxes, game consoles, and a whole host of smart devices to the internet. As LTE-U moves in, Wi-Fi may get drowned out. “Places where operators have traditionally looked to Wi-Fi, they’ll leverage LTE-U,” said Kyung Mun, an analyst at researcher Mobile Experts. Developed by cellular carriers and their vendors, LTE-U may act as a disincentive for companies experimenting with Wi-Fi calling, including Comcast, and those dabbling in fiber networks, like Alphabet Inc.’s Google. But LTE-U also benefits users. Consumers don’t have to type in passwords and sign in to every network like they do for public Wi-Fi hot spots. They can seamlessly move between their carriers’ cellular network and LTE-U, and not really know the difference. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up LTE-U -- and a related cellular advancement, LTE-LAA -- will also require less equipment. A 180,000-square-foot building would need 24 new access points instead of about 80 Wi-Fi hot spots, according to Amit Jain, vice president of marketing and product management at hardware maker SpiderCloud Wireless, which plans to ship LTE-U and LTE-LAA equipment in the second quarter. However, the total cost of deployment will be similar to Wi-Fi, Jain said. Annual shipments of LTE-U/LTE-LAA-capable access points will increase to about 1.1 million units globally by 2020, up from tens of thousands in 2016, according to Mobile Experts. “You could see LTE in the house, in the enterprise, and the role of Wi-Fi morphing into something different: a legacy technology,” said independent wireless analyst Chetan Sharma. Companies like Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 manufacturer of Wi-Fi access points, are already considering developing new gear that can accommodate both Wi-Fi and LTE-U technologies. “It’s too early to say what will win out,” said Mike Iandolo, vice president and general manager at the mobile technology group at Cisco. “LTE has an advantage, but there’ll still be a place for Wi-Fi.” The company’s goal is to ensure its Wi-Fi portfolio evolves to meet the needs of customers, he said. Citizen Action Another technology that risks making Wi-Fi outmoded is something called CBRS, short for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. The new system lets anyone share a huge swath of spectrum currently being used by the U.S. Navy. In February, Nokia Oyj, Alphabet and Qualcomm tested LTE technology on the airwaves to broadcast a live high-definition video of cars racing on a track in Las Vegas. More reliable than Wi-Fi, CBRS may ultimately be a better option for factories, airports and ports, according to Michael Peeters, head of innovation portfolio management at Nokia and president of CBRS Alliance, whose membership includes AT&T Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and Comcast. The first CBRS devices should be certified for use in mid-2017, he said. On top of all these threats to Wi-Fi is the coming spread of 5G, which promises to let consumers download a high-definition movie in less than a second. By using CBRS, wireless carriers can deploy 5G faster and easier, using the shared airwaves instead of trying to acquire spectrum licenses at auction or through deals. In the nearer term, Wi-Fi is already starting to disappear from people’s daily routines. “Before I would have to go and find a Wi-Fi hot spot, which was very inconvenient for me,” said Michael Kimbrough, an entrepreneur in Birmingham, Alabama, who last month signed up for an unlimited data plan from Verizon Wireless. “Now I don’t have to do that.” Watch Next: Ericsson CEO Ekholm Says 5G Is Starting to Happen Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The data center giant made the announcement at the annual gathering of the Open Compute Project (OCP) here, where Facebook unveiled a refreshed line of servers. Both Facebook and Microsoft announced accelerator systems using NVLink to connect eight Nvidia’s Pascal chips. Separately, IBM showed the first boards using its Power 9 processor. They were supported by new Xilinx FPGAs and 100 Gbit/second Ethernet switches from Mellanox all riding the new PCI Express Gen 4 link that Power 9 is the first CPU to support. Overall, the event showed increasing activity and fragmentation in data center hardware. OCP now has 195 members and an online store with 70 products, some not yet providing open hardware design files. Even the latest motherboards from top-tier members Facebook and Microsoft sported radically different designs. Microsoft’s move to evaluate ARM-based servers was the big surprise of the show. As part of its tests, Microsoft ported to ARM a set of production applications from its Azure cloud services as well as its .Net application framework and a version of Windows Server for internal use only. It also helped Qualcomm and Cavium design motherboards for its Project Olympus standard. After initial evaluations in its Redmond, Washington, labs, more than 200 of the new motherboards will be tested as part of a small cluster in a facility in Asia. The company provided no details of its early results or how long the test would last.

They also need Windows Server on ARM , they can't just leave that market to Linux. With HoloLens they can't exactly use x86 in the long run and that's the next form factor. ARM is a must for Microsoft. Good for them that they know it and acting accordingly. The bigger threat to Intel is AMD and they can also hurt Intel in PC quite a lot - Intel makes a lot more in PC than in server while having 97-ish % revenue share. In PC you combine the market's decline with share losses, lower ASPs and lower fab utilization and it gets extra complicated. AMD's core might be a bit slower overall but it does seem efficient and they might get some large server customers. AMD should also have the ARM version of their core ready to go when necessary. Overall AMD is a huge threat short and mid term, ARM is still mid and long. Taking bets on who's Intel's next CEO. Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Analyst comment rick merritt   3/10/2017 12:39:28 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Found in my in-box this morning from Richard Windsor, Analyst at Edison Investment Research: "Intel's 60%+ gross margins are a juicy target. To date, Intel has been able to brush aside any threat to its dominance in processors for the data centre, but with Microsoft deciding to port Windows Server and Azure to ARM, the threat is back. The data centre has long been the saviour of Intel's financial performance as it has been supporting the company as the legacy PC business has been going through its rough patch. ARM has taken pot shots at the data centre before with semiconductor makers announcing chips, but this has never gotten off the ground. We have long been convinced that the main reason for this is software as many servers run huge amounts of legacy software that will need to be ported in order for an ARM based server to work. Until now, no one has been willing to do this. This is why the demonstration of Windows Server running on the ARM based Qualcomm Centriq 2400 is so significant. If this can show to run with similar performance characteristics to Intel, then it would make a lot of sense for Microsoft to begin migrating its servers over. There are some signs of this already and Hewlett Packard mentioned weakness in a large customer on its most recent earnings call which is widely believed to have been Microsoft. However, this solution is still internal only to Microsoft and we doubt that it will be willing to take any risks until it is sure that it can work just as well as Intel. The key to this is performance and here Intel has historically beaten ARM-based processors hands down time and again. This is not because ARM processors are weaker than Intel per se, but because the implementation of x86-based software on ARM involves a translation step to convert x86 instructions to ARM instructions. This translation step adds complexity to an implementation meaning that substantial performance overheads often result leading to a poor user experience. In the data centre, performance is critical and so it is a very big stretch to say that Intel is beaten. In fact, there is a very long road ahead for ARM to make a real impact in servers but with the company now privately owned, there is plenty of money for investment.   The real risk for Intel here is not so much market share but margins.Group gross margins are still way above the industry average at over 60% and if real competition comes into the server market, these are going to come under real pressure.Qualcomm is highly motivated to make this work as its core markets are now saturated leaving it needing other avenues with which to pursue further growth.This is what lies behind its acquisition of NXP as well as its aggressive push into other areas such as automotive. As always, the outcome of this battle for the data centre will be determined by execution and whilst we see no immediate threat to Intel, Qualcomm and Microsoft represent its greatest threat to date."   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Freelancer Re: Intel had 99% market share in Q4 2016 witeken   3/9/2017 1:56:32 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate That 99% MSS is based on units, the revenue market share is somehwat closer to 90% afaik.

Intel x86 had 99% of market share in server CPU in Q4 2016. That is shocking. Power8 died, Power9 is doomed. https://www.itjungle.com/2017/03/06/servers-hit-skids-last-year-year-might-no-better/ I guess there is nowhere to go but down from that dominant position. This article claims that really the AMD Zen will have best chance to grab a little share from Intel. What happened to Applied Micro ARM chips?

Ghost Recon: Wildlands - Crashes, Bugs und Freezes: Das sind die aktuellen Probleme Kurz nach dem Release hat der Taktik-Shooter Ghost Recon: Wildlands mit einigen Problemen zu kämpfen. Dazu zählen unter anderem Abstürze, Freezes und andere Bugs. Ubisoft hat eine Liste mit allen derzeit bekannten Fehlern veröffentlicht - und arbeitet an deren Beseitigung. Von Andre Linken | Datum: 09.03.2017 ; 11:22 Uhr Kommentare (21) Derzeit plagen Ghost Recon: Wildlands zahlreiche Bugs und andere Probleme. Zum Thema Ghost Recon: Wildlands ab 39,95 € bei Amazon.de Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands für 47,99 € bei GamesPlanet.com Am 7. März 2017 kam der Taktik-Shooter Ghost Recon: Wildlands offiziell auf den Markt. Zwar haben die Entwickler seit der Beta einiges an dem Spiel verbessert, doch noch immer gibt es zahlreiche Probleme. Unter anderem im offiziellen Forum beschweren sich derzeit die Spieler über die unterschiedlichsten Macken. Einige klagen über plötzliche Abstürze, andere berichten von nervigen Freeze-Bugs. Manchen Spielern ist es derzeit noch nicht mal möglich, Ghost Recon: Wildlands vollständig via Uplay herunterzuladen - geschweige denn zu starten. Mehr: Der große GameStar-Test von Ghost Recon: Wildlands Um eine bessere Übersicht zu erhalten, hat Ubisoft jetzt eine umfangreiche Liste mit allen derzeit bekannten Problemen in Ghost Recon: Wildlands veröffentlicht. Teilweise gibt es zu den einzelnen Fehlern kurze Erklärungen oder Lösungsvorschläge. Die Entwickler arbeiten derzeit jedenfalls daran, die Probleme schnellstmöglich zu beseitigen. Derzeit bekannte Probleme in Ghost Recon: Wildlands Game General [GAMEPLAY] AI Vehicle Pathfinding Some users have reported issues on some specific locations in relation to the AI pathfinding, causing some vehicle collision. We are currently investigating this situation. [GAMEPLAY] Melee-killed enemies are tagged as "surrendering enemies killed" When trying to kill an enemy with close-quarters-combat (melee), the "surrendering enemy killed" notification may appear. Since surrendering enemies are considered as civilians, killing too many of them may result a mission fail. We are sorry for the inconvenience and have already fixed this issue for the next patch. [MISSION]Boss will not re-initialize after mission replay After a mission fail, mission boss might not re-initialize when trying to replay the mission. This issue has already been fixed for the next patch.

This issue has already been fixed for the next patch. [MISSION] Missing helicopter for Medication air transport activity on Tabacal It can be noticed that when playing in the Tabacal region, the side activity "Medication Air Transport" might not be available due to the fact that the helicopter is not spawning. We are sorry for the inconvenience and are currently investigating this issue. [TACMAP] Bosses might appear in red when un-zooming the map When un-zooming the minimap to reach the Cartel view and going back to the tacmap, some bosses might appear in red despite not being killed by the player yet.

This issue has already been fixed for the next patch. [CONTROLS] Fake controller Some players have been reporting that despite not having any controller plugged into their system, the game is using a gamepad as default controller. This issue can be related to the previous installation of a virtual joystick or previously connected devices - including, for instance, VJoy software. Please verify on your Device Manager > Human Interface Devices that only connected devices are activated. Ghost Recon Network [STATS] Inconsistency in enemy killed statistics It can be noticed in the Ghost Recon Network that the Total Enemy Killed counter is not accurate. We are currently investigating this issue. [STATS] Missing icon for several weapons It can be noticed that some weapon icons are missing in the Weapon Leaderboard of the Ghost Recon Network.

This issue should now be fixed. [Access] Unable to consult profile or taskforce A few players have been unable to connect to the Ghost Recon Network or retrieve their TaskForce information despite owning the game.

[CRASH] Android only- Crash on Satellite view mode When using the Satellite view during an extensive game session, the app may crash. A restart of the app will solve the issue.

Oder unser Pilot ploppt ständig aus dem Heli und wird wieder reinteleportiert. Oder Schalldämpfer, man macht sich den selber drauf aber bei allen anderen ist er nicht drauf. Was auch cool war, wir haben mal ein "leeres" Auto gekapert, aber noch 10min ist dann die KI die eigentlich drin sein müsste wärend wir gefahren sind ausgestiegen :D Sehr lustig verbuggt das Game :D  (3)  |   (2) Runnner #2 | 09.

Bisher bin ich scheinbar verschont geblieben. Ich hoffe das bleibt so. :P  (1)  |   (0) fRedbull #4 | 09. Mär 2017, 12:05 Also mir sind bisher 2 Sachen aufgefallen. (Beide beim alleine spielen) 1. Die KI steht dem Gegner teilweise buchstäblich auf den Füßen und er bemerkt nichts. Wäre auch Mist wenn er es bemerken würde, aber in den beiden Betas haben sich die KI Begleiter bei mir nie soooo dumm verhalten :) 2. In den Betas habe ich immer bei diesen "Aktiviere und verteidige den Sender"-Mission Minen für die im Auto andüsenden Feinde platziert. Gestern hat die Mini aber auch bei Zivilisten ausgelöst, was ziemlich doof war.  (0)  |   (0) Xanta #5 | 09.

Mär 2017, 12:20 Ich hab hier noch 2 Bugs die bei mir (bzw einem Mitspieler) aufgetreten sind: Zunächst mal hat mein Chat gesponnen. Ich konnte das Chatfenster öfffnen, aber die gedrückten Tasten führten die Bewegungs/UI Aktion aus UND erschienen im Chat. Dazu konnte ich die Nachricht nicht abschicken. Und beim Mitspieler hat es weitergepiepst, nachdem wir von einer SAM-Stellung beschossen wurden. Konnten der Rakete ausweichen, aber er sagte das Piepsen ging weiter. Beides erforderte einen kompletten Spiel Neustart. Ins Hauptmenu zu gehen reichte nicht.  (0)  |   (0) Rambos_Nachbar #7 | 09. Mär 2017, 12:29 Bei mir fühlt sich das Fahren mit Auto und Boot sehr ruckelig an (Micro-stutters). Fps bleiben dabei aber konstant, Fliegen funktioniert auch ohne Probleme.

The Chinese computer giant has promoted Thailand as its operations centre in Indochina, taking over the duties and responsibilities of the Singapore business unit, said Jeerawut Wongpimonporn, country manager of Lenovo Thailand. In October, Lenovo grouped its 10 business units in Asean with those in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea, defining them a single region called central Asia-Pacific. "The restructure is aimed at increasing our operational and management efficiency in the region," said Mr Jeerawut, who also oversees Indochina business for Lenovo. LG is considering opening offices in Cambodia and Myanmar. "We expect revenue from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam to account for at least 20% of total revenue for Lenovo Thailand in 2017," he said. Lenovo is widening the price range for its products to cover all market segments. Lenovo yesterday introduced Legion, a new brand for its gaming notebook products in Thailand. The Legion brand offers advanced features and more affordable prices to serve the mass market. Mr Jeerawut said by June Lenovo Data Centre Business Group plans to introduce a hyper-converged appliance that combines server and storage resources into a single device to accommodate increasing demand for enterprise-level solutions. To sustain revenue growth, he said Lenovo will focus on providing more advanced features to tap into high-end consumers. IT spending in Thailand is expected to increase by 3-5% this year. In another development, Intel Microelectronics Thailand has laid off half of its local staff in Thailand as part of a strategic effort to centralise its operations in Singapore, according to a source familiar with the company. The source also said Sontiya Nujeenseng, country manager of Intel Microelectronics Thailand, has been moved from Thailand to oversee channel management operations for the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, the data centre business group and the Internet of Things unit have been transferred to Singapore to operate instead. Intel has moved away from a decentralised management towards centralised operation to increase cost efficiency and in order to seek new revenue sources, the source said.

West Texas Intermediate for April delivery dropped as low as US$48.79 a barrel in New York. “People are nervous about the global supply-demand balance," Adam Sieminski, a scholar at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and former head of the Energy Information Administration, told Bloomberg. "Shale is coming back with $50 oil and there’s uncertainty about whether OPEC and its partners are going to roll-over the production agreement." Wall Street inched higher as investors eyed the latest US jobs data. A Labour Department report showed that initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended March 4. "There is no evidence of a pickup in involuntary employment separations,"John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York, told Reuters. “We view this as evidence of a tight labour market.” Indeed, the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed US private payrolls posted the largest jump in nearly three years, well above economists’ expectations. The government’s nonfarm payrolls report, due on Friday, is expected to show that employers added about 200,000 jobs in February, according to a Bloomberg poll, while a Reuters survey predicts a gain of 190,000 jobs. Fed Chair Janet Yellen last week signalled the central bank will raise interest rates next week. The Federal Open Market Committee begins its two-day meeting on March 14. In 1pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.03 percent gain, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.13 percent. In 12.45pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.09 percent. “The market is setting up for the two-part symphony we are going to see over the next four trading days, the first is tomorrow's jobs number and then the Fed meeting, which is the real big event,” Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US in New York, told Reuters. In the Dow, gains in shares of Johnson & Johnson and those of Intel, up 1.3 percent and 0.9 percent respectively, offset declines in shares of Caterpillar and those of IBM, down 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a gain of less than of 0.1 percent from the previous close amid a more optimistic tone from the ECB’s Draghi. “The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become less pronounced, but remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors,” Draghi said at the end of a policy meeting at which the central bank kept its asset purchase program and interest rate unchanged. Germany’s DAX Index added 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index rose 0.4 percent. Quantitative easing “is here to stay in the euro zone, until at least the end of this year. However, more policy action is less likely because deflation risks have receded,” Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported. “Reading between the lines suggests that the next change from the ECB will be towards removing accommodation and not adding it.” The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.3 percent. Shares of France’s Carrefour slid 4 percent after the world’s second-largest retailer posted results that disappointed investors “in a difficult competitive environment” in its home market.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 9, 2017 at 5:15PM Data center chipmaker Cavium (NASDAQ:CAVM) announced on March 8 that it is "collaborating with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on evaluating and enabling a variety of cloud workloads running on [its] flagship Thunder X2 ARMv8-A Data Center processor for the Microsoft Azure cloud platform." The announcement goes on to say that Cavium and Microsoft are "demonstrating web services on a version of Windows Server developed for Microsoft's internal use running cloud services workloads on Thunder X2." Image source: Intel. This announcement is similar to one that fellow ARM-based server processor maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) made at the same time. Let's take a closer look at what this announcement means for Cavium in the near term and potentially over the long term. Near term? Probably not much The wording of Cavium's press release appears carefully constructed to avoid giving the impression that Microsoft is planning to buy and deploy a bunch of Cavium's Thunder X2 chips in its data centers anytime soon. Indeed, the phrases "evaluating and enabling" as well as the word "demonstrating" seem aways away from "planning to deploy in significant quantities." So, in the near term, I don't expect the joint work that Microsoft and Cavium are doing to lead to significant revenue for Cavium anytime soon. The work that these two companies are doing is much more likely to lay the groundwork for Microsoft to be able to deploy potential successors to the Thunder X2 -- should those products meet Microsoft's needs for certain workloads. Taking a longer-term view At this point, it's starting to look as though Cavium and Qualcomm are the only two merchant ARM-based server processor vendors left in in the game (there are companies building chips for their own internal use like Huawei, for example). Cavium's edge appears to be its heritage is as a data center/networking processor vendor (Qualcomm hails from a mobile processor background), but Qualcomm has significantly greater financial resources to try to slug it out with market incumbent Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). It's likely not going to be easy for either company to wrest away significant market share from Intel to begin with (which invests more in data center-specific technologies and marketing than either Qualcomm or Cavium -- probably more than both combined), and that difficulty is compounded by the fact that Cavium and Qualcomm must compete against each other, too. Success for ARM server chip vendors like Qualcomm and Cavium is, in general, not something that's guaranteed to come at all, and if it does come, it'll be hard won over multiple years after substantial investments in research and development, software/ecosystem enablement, and marketing efforts. It's worth noting that on Cavium's most recent earnings call, CEO Syed Ali said that the company "expect[s] to release [its] next generation products" in 2017. Given that the company had previously said that it would begin sampling Thunder X2 in the beginning of 2017, I'd expect shipments for revenue to occur late in the year. What investors need to keep an eye on, then, is what kind of revenue ramp Cavium ultimately begins to experience with Thunder X2 and the impact it starts having on the company's financials, independent of this announcement from Microsoft.

West Texas Intermediate for April delivery dropped as low as US$48.79 a barrel in New York. “People are nervous about the global supply-demand balance,” Adam Sieminski, a scholar at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and former head of the Energy Information Administration, told Bloomberg. “Shale is coming back with $50 oil and there’s uncertainty about whether OPEC and its partners are going to roll-over the production agreement.” Wall Street inched higher as investors eyed the latest US jobs data. A Labour Department report showed that initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended March 4. “There is no evidence of a pickup in involuntary employment separations,”John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York, told Reuters. “We view this as evidence of a tight labour market.” Indeed, the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed US private payrolls posted the largest jump in nearly three years, well above economists’ expectations. The government’s nonfarm payrolls report, due on Friday, is expected to show that employers added about 200,000 jobs in February, according to a Bloomberg poll, while a Reuters survey predicts a gain of 190,000 jobs. Fed Chair Janet Yellen last week signalled the central bank will raise interest rates next week. The Federal Open Market Committee begins its two-day meeting on March 14. In 1pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.03 percent gain, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.13 percent. In 12.45pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.09 percent. “The market is setting up for the two-part symphony we are going to see over the next four trading days, the first is tomorrow’s jobs number and then the Fed meeting, which is the real big event,” Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US in New York, told Reuters. In the Dow, gains in shares of Johnson & Johnson and those of Intel, up 1.3 percent and 0.9 percent respectively, offset declines in shares of Caterpillar and those of IBM, down 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a gain of less than of 0.1 percent from the previous close amid a more optimistic tone from the ECB’s Draghi. “The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become less pronounced, but remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors,” Draghi said at the end of a policy meeting at which the central bank kept its asset purchase program and interest rate unchanged. Germany’s DAX Index added 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index rose 0.4 percent. Quantitative easing “is here to stay in the euro zone, until at least the end of this year. However, more policy action is less likely because deflation risks have receded,” Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported. “Reading between the lines suggests that the next change from the ECB will be towards removing accommodation and not adding it.” The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.3 percent. Shares of France’s Carrefour slid 4 percent after the world’s second-largest retailer posted results that disappointed investors “in a difficult competitive environment” in its home market.

If the report beats expectations most players will see that as a sure sign that the Fed will raise interest rates next week. The energy and counter-cyclical stocks dragged the markets lower as the healthcare sector put up the day’s largest gain. WTI crude oil for April delivery settled at $49.28 a barrel, down 2% on the day, it’s lowest settlement price since late November 2016. April gold dropped 0.5% on the day to settle at $1,203.20. Equities were headed for a narrowly higher close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.03% on the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.12%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.05%. Stocks traded very near the break-even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could differ from these results. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Thursday was Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) which traded up 1.52% at $125.99. The stock’s 52-week range is $106.07 to $126.21, a new high posted this afternoon. Volume was about equal to the daily average of around 6.9 million shares. The company had no specific news. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) traded up 0.69% at $39.87. The stock’s 52-week range is $29.50 to $38.45. Volume was about 20% below the daily average of around 22.7 million shares. The company had no specific news Thursday. E.I. du Pont de Nemours Inc. (NYSE: DD) traded up 0.60% at $80.25. The stock’s 52-week range is $61.12 to $80.66. Volume was about equal to the daily average of around 2.7 million shares. The company had no specific news. The Travelers Companies Inc. (NYSE: TRV) traded up 0.56% at $121.92. The stock’s 52-week range is $103.45 to $125.49. Volume was about 20% below the daily average of around 1.5 million shares. The insurance giant had no specific news. Of the Dow 30 stocks, 21 are on track to close higher Thursday and 9 are set to close lower.

SPONSORED: FREE Raspberry Pi3 when you spend $77 on Arrow.com Maxs Cool Beans Now I'm Lusting Over a Laser Harp Max Maxfield, Designline Editor 3/9/2017 06:00 PM EST  5 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet When you see a laser harp, several; thoughts spring into your mind, including 'Ooh, Shiny' and 'I want one!' In an earlier column (see One Metallic Step Closer to the Robot Apocalypse), I mentioned that I had been engaged in an email conversation Jason Sipe, who is a Technical Marketer at Opal Kelly. Jason sent me a picture of a robot arm he's building, with the ultimate aim of creating a life-size InMoov humanoid robot. In a later message, Jason asked if I would be building an InMoov of my own. I replied that this might be a possibility at some time in the future, but that I would have to finish some of my current project first. I also pointed him at the classic Animusic Pipe Dreams video and mentioned that one of the guys in the office, my chum Ivan, and I are planning on building a cut-down -- say 6 x 6 foot -- table-top version of this little beauty. Now, many peoples' knee-jerk reactions are that the Animusic version is just an animation, and that it would be impossible to create a real-world equivalent, so I also pointed Jason at this video of Atom-powered Intel Industrial Controllers replicating the Pipe Dream experience. In turn, Jason pointed me at this video and this video of people playing laser harps. Good Grief. I've never hear of a Laser Harp before. Of course, once you see one, several thoughts spring into your mind: "That's a clever idea," "It's an obvious thing to do when you come to think about it," "Ooh, Shiny," and "I want one!" What about you -- could you be tempted to build one of these little rascals?

I've seen it twice live, at that time it was completely incredible (and quite dangerous). Today it's still very impressive. Some people said it was a fake instrument, I can insure it wasn't, it was linked to an old synthesiser to generate the sound and control the envelope. You can hear it in JM Jarre "Rendez Vous".   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Orchestrion Rcurl   3/9/2017 8:51:10 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate That Pipe Dreams animation has been one of my favorites for a long time.  I think the Intel trade show booth was very clever, but I don't believe it was producing the music that accompanied it. ....and then there were all the marbles on the floor afterward.

Leaked budget documents recently made public reveal that President Donald Trump's administration intends to follow through on its campaign rhetoric to ax many of the EPA's signature programs. Those cuts could have a pronounced impact for Mountain View and the rest of the Bay Area, according to experts in the field. On the chopping block are programs for air and water quality, climate research and local bayland restoration. The partial glimpse of the proposed budget shows about $2 billion of the $8.1 billion agency's funding being wiped away. "Trump said during the campaign he would dismantle the EPA, and this budget reflects those priorities to a T," said Alex Formuzis, spokesman for the Environmental Working Group, an independent advocacy nonprofit. "This means dirtier water, dirtier air and far less in the way of cleaning up toxic sites." This doesn't bode well for the city of Mountain View, which has four EPA-administered Superfund sites within its boundaries. For nearly 30 years, those programs have been involved in cleaning up the public health hazard caused by the industrial waste left by the area's former semiconductor factories and the U.S. Navy base at Moffett Field. The San Francisco office of the EPA declined to comment for this story. Environmental groups were disheartened earlier this year to see a longstanding adversary of the EPA appointed by Trump to head the agency. Scott Pruitt, who sued the EPA 13 times as Oklahoma's attorney general, was confirmed to the agency's top post under a promise he would scale back its reach. While mostly a critic of the agency, Pruitt has spoken favorably of the EPA's targeted cleanups, including Superfund and the similar Brownfields Program. Last week, at a gathering of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, he told the crowd that the twin programs to restore contaminated sites were "absolutely essential." Nevertheless, the proposed budget cuts would reduce the EPA's Brownfield programs and grants by about $26 million, or about 35 percent. The new budget documents make no mention of the EPA Superfund program, leaving its fate unclear at this time. Formuzis said he believes the program would likely suffer as linked programs and staffing within the agency are downsized. The silver lining for Superfund sites is that much of the funding for long-term cleanup doesn't come from the EPA. That bill is mostly paid by the parties deemed responsible for causing the pollution. For Mountain View, the companies Fairchild Semiconductor, Raytheon and Intel have carried most of the costs over the last 30 years to remove contaminants such as carcinogenic trichloroethylene (TCE) from the local groundwater. It is probably safe to assume those companies would continue to pay the cleanup costs, said City Councilman Lenny Siegel, who also serves as executive director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight. But he admitted it was hard to predict what would happen. "When it comes to the individual programs that (the Trump administration) didn't target, we really don't know what they're going to do," Siegel said. What is very clear is that the federal government intends to step away from commitments to help restore the local bayland marshes. The EPA cuts would entirely eliminate the $4.8 million earmarked each year for San Francisco Bay Area, just as all nine counties are set to begin an unprecedented remediation effort. Last year, more than 70 percent of voters approved the Measure AA parcel tax to clean up and restore the Bay Area's tidal wetlands. That restoration effort was proposed under the assumption that the federal government would be a willing partner and help put forward one-third of the $1.5 billion estimated cost to restore 35,000 acres, said David Lewis, executive director of Save the Bay. Through 2016, there were nearly 10 times more requests for grants than there was available funding provided by the EPA for local bay restoration, he said. "The real story here is that the Bay needs more federal investment, not less," Lewis said. "It'll only get more expensive the longer we wait." Lewis also highlighted the loss of about $400 million across a variety of EPA grant programs for states. Typically these grants are intended to offset the costs for states complying with federal mandates. The EPA budget is just one small piece of the unusual political situation in the nation's capital. Around this time of the year, the White House is typically presenting its budget proposal to Congress to review. Like so many other issues at the federal level, that process is running behind schedule.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED US stocks stall as oil sinks below $US50 Margreet Dietz Friday March 10, 2017 Share Play NBR radio on Oil dropped for the second consecutive session amid intensifying concern about record US stockpiles, while stocks on Wall Street were largely unchanged.  The euro strengthened as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said risks to the region's growth had become less pronounced. West Texas Intermediate for April delivery settled at $US49.28 a barrel, a 2% fall after dropping as low as $US48.79. This is the lowest settlement since December 7 and the first time it has dipped below $US50 a barrel this year. Brent crude, the global benchmark, lost 1.7%, to $US52.19. "People are nervous about the global supply-demand balance," Adam Sieminski, a scholar at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and former head of the Energy Information Administration, told Bloomberg. "Shale is coming back with $US50 oil and there's uncertainty about whether Opec and its partners are going to roll over the production agreement." Wall Street edgeded higher as investors eyed the latest US jobs data. A Labour Department report showed that initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended March 4. "There is no evidence of a pickup in involuntary employment separations,"John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York, told Reuters. "We view this as evidence of a tight labour market." Biggest job surge in three years Indeed, the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed US private payrolls posted the largest jump in nearly three years, well above economists' expectations. The government's nonfarm payrolls report, due today, is expected to show that employers added about 200,000 jobs in February, according to a Bloomberg poll, while a Reuters survey predicts a gain of 190,000 jobs. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen last week signalled the central bank will raise interest rates next week. The Federal Open Market Committee begins its two-day meeting on March 14. At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.46 points to 20,858.19, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added just over one point to 5838.81 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index also rose marginally to 2364.87. "The market is setting up for the two-part symphony we are going to see over the next four trading days, the first is the jobs number and then the Fed meeting, which is the real big event," Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US in New York, told Reuters. In the Dow, gains in shares of Johnson & Johnson and those of Intel, up 1.3% and 0.9% respectively, offset declines in shares of Caterpillar and those of IBM, down 1.8% and 1.4% respectively. The session marked the eighth-year anniversary of the Dow's low point of 6547.05 on March 9 during the global financial crisis. Since then the index has more than tripled. Lower risk in Europe In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a gain of less than of 0.1% from the previous close amid a more optimistic tone from the ECB's Draghi. "The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become less pronounced, but remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors," Mr Draghi said at the end of a policy meeting at which the central bank kept its asset-purchase programme and interest rate unchanged. Germany's DAX Index added 0.1%, while France's CAC 40 Index rose 0.4%. Quantitative easing "is here to stay in the euro zone, until at least the end of this year. However, more policy action is less likely because deflation risks have receded," Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported. "Reading between the lines suggests that the next change from the ECB will be towards removing accommodation and not adding it." The UK's FTSE 100 Index fell 0.3%. Shares of France's Carrefour slid 4% after the world's second-largest retailer posted results that disappointed investors "in a difficult competitive environment" in its home market.

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)By Meg Wagner A bit of data on the world’s smallest magnet Nanoscientists have managed to pack a bit of data onto a single atom — an impressive milestone that paves the way for smaller computers with bigger memories. On Wednesday, IBM researchers announced the feat in a paper published in Nature, an international science journal. “We conducted this research to understand what happens when you shrink technology down to the most fundamental extreme — the atomic scale,” Christopher Lutz, a nanoscience researcher at IBM, said in a statement. Computer hard drives use magnets — which are made up of atoms — to store information. Hard drives on the market right now can store one bit of data on a magnet made up of 100,000 atoms. But the IBM team packed the same amount of data onto the world’s smallest magnet, which is made up on a single atom. Magnets tend to become more unstable as they get smaller, and scientists previously thought such a small one wouldn’t be able to support data. “It’s a landmark achievement,” Sander Otte, a physicist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said in a press release announcing the research. “Finally, magnetic stability has been demonstrated undeniably in a single atom.” The single-atom magnet is truly tiny: “If an atom was the size of an orange, then the orange would be the size of the whole planet Earth,” IBM researcher Andreas Heinrich explained in a 2013 video. From 1 million, to 12, to one The computer industry’s race to make smaller and smaller hard drives that hold more and more data is a decades-old competitive tradition. Intel co-founder Gordon Moore named it in 1965, when he noticed that computer processors seemed to double in speed and power every two years thanks to rapid progress in engineering. Since then, “Moore’s Law” has been the driving concept of computer innovation: make devices that run twice as fast and hold twice as much every other year. IBM has taken the race especially seriously. In 2012, the company announced its research team had fit a bit of data onto just 12 atoms. Previously, a million atoms would be needed to support that amount of data. While the technology didn’t immediately spread to commercial computers (hard drives sold in stores today still require between 1 million and 100,000 atoms to hold a bit of data), the tech world lauded the achievement. IT blog Compterworld even congratulated IBM on “smashing” Moore’s Law. But IBM said it was ready to go even further. “The ultimate end of Moore’s Law is a single atom. That’s where we come in,” Heinrich said at the time. Decades away from commercialization IBM’s discovery that it’s possible to put a bit of data on a single atom could mean smaller, more powerful consumer electronics. Current computers can store users’ personal music library on a penny-sized device, CNET explained. But with IBM’s breakthrough, a similar sized storage device would hold all 26 million songs available in Apple’s iTunes store. “You could carry around, not just, you know, two movies on your iPhone or something,” Heinrich said. “You could carry around any movie that was ever produced.” But super-powerful smartphones and laptops won’t be hitting electronic store shelves anytime soon. IBM’s research only proves that it’s possible to store data on the world’s smallest unit of matter — not that it’s commercially feasible. After all, consumer electronics haven’t even adopted the 12-atom method IBM outlined five years ago; the single-atom system could be decades off. “This work is not product development, but rather it is basic research intended to develop tools and understanding of what happens as we miniaturize devices down toward the ultimate limit of individual atom,” Lutz told CNET.

Among his first actions upon taking office, Trump vetoed the Trans Pacific Partnership, the controversial free trade agreement which critics rightly said would lead to US job losses while giving transnational corporations massive power over national state policies on health, education and other issues.Trump further plans to ditch the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and US, which would have diluted key state regulations on the activities of transnational corporates on issues like food safety, the environment and banking; and to renegotiate NAFTA, potentially heightening tensions with Canada.Trump appears to be in conflict with the bulk of the US intelligence community, and is actively seeking to restructure the government to minimize checks and balances, and thus consolidate his executive power.His White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has restructured the National Security Council, granting himself and Trump’s Chief of Staff Richard ‘Reince’ Priebus permanent seats on the NSC’s Principals’ Committee – opening the door to the White House politicization of the government’s highest national security body.Trump’s White House has purged almost the entire senior staff of the State Department, and tested the loyalty of the Department of Homeland Security with its new ‘Muslim ban’ order.So what is going on? One approach to framing the Trump movement comes from Jordan Greenhall, who sees it as a conservative (“Red Religion”) Insurgency against the liberal (“Blue Church”) Globalist establishment (the “Deep State”). Greenhall suggests, essentially, that Trump is leading a nationalist coup against corporate neoliberal globalization using new tactics of “collective intelligence” by which to outsmart and outspeed his liberal establishment opponents.But at best this is an extremely partial picture.In reality, Trump has ushered in something far more dangerous:The Trump regime is not operating outside the Deep State, but mobilizing elements within it to dominate and strengthen it for a new mission.The Trump regime is not acting to overturn the establishment, but to consolidate it against a perceived crisis of a wider transnational Deep System.The Trump regime is not a conservative insurgency against the liberal establishment, but an act of ideologically constructing the current crisis as a conservative-liberal battleground, led by a particularly radicalized white nationalist faction of a global elite.The act is a direct product of a global systemic crisis, but is a short-sighted and ill-conceived reaction, pre-occupied with surface symptoms of that crisis. Unfortunately, those hoping to resist the Trump reaction also fail to understand the system dynamics of the crisis.All this can only be understood when we look at the big picture. That means the following: we must look a little more closely at the individuals inside Trump’s administration, the wider social and institutional networks they represent, and what emerges from their being interlocked in government; we must contextualize this against two factors, the escalation of global systemic crisis, and the Trump regime’s ideological framing(s) of that crisis (both for themselves, and for public consumption); we must connect this with the impact on the transnational Deep System, and how that links up with the US Deep State; and we must then explore what this all means in terms of the scope of actions likely to be deployed by the Trump regime to pursue its discernable goals.This investigation will help to establish a ground state for anyone on which to build a meaningful strategy of response that accounts for the full systemic complexity of our Trumpian moment.So the first step to diagnosing our Trumpian moment is to see who is leading it. We’ll begin by looking at a cross-section of some of Trump’s most prominent nominations and appointments.1. The Trump regimeMoney MonstersIf all Trump’s appointees are confirmed, his administration will be among the most business-heavy, corporate-friendly governments in American history.Five of the 15 people nominated by Trump as Cabinet secretaries have no public sector experience, and have spent their entire careers in the corporate sector. “That would be more business people with no public-sector experience than have ever served in the Cabinet at any one time,”, concludesPew Research Center.Betsy DeVos has been nominated for Education Secretary. She’s a billionaire married to the Amway conglomerate.Andrew Puzder has been nominated as Labor Secretary. He’s a billionaire CEO of fastfood chain owner CKE Restaurants.Trump’s nominee for Commerce Secretary is Wall Street veteran Wilbur Ross. He’s a billionaire financier who invests in buying and selling companies in distressed industries, and who made his early fortune as a fund manager at the Rothschild Group.Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s Treasury Secretary, is a former partner at the global investment bank Goldman Sachs, a hedge fund manager and, until his nomination, a board member of the Fortune 500 financial holding company, CIT Group. He’s also a member of the Yale University secret society, Skull and Bones.Vincent Viola is Trump’s nominee for Army Secretary. He’s a billionaire, former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and current chairman of Virtu Financial, a high-frequency trading firm.Linda McMahon is Trump’s Small Business Administrator. She’s a co-founder and former CEO of WWE, which is now valued at around $1.5 billion, and married to billionaire WWE promoter Vincent McMahon.Gary Cohn is Trump’s chief economic advisor and Director of the White House National Economic Council. He just left his previous post as president and chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs for the job.Anthony Scaramucci has served as a senior advisor to Trump on the executive committee of the Presidential Transition Team. Previously he was founding co-managing partner of global investment firm SkyBridge Capital. Like Steve Bannon, he also began his career at Goldman Sachs.Walter ‘Jay’ Clayton is Trump’s nominee for the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), the financial industry’s top regulatory watchdog. Yet Clayton himself is a Wall Street lawyer who has worked on deals for major banks, such as Barclays Capital’s acquisition of Lehman Brothers’ assets, the sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan Chase, and the US Treasury’s capital investment in Goldman Sachs. In the same capacity, he has campaigned to reduce restrictions on foreign public companies, and sought lax enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. His wife, Gretchen Butler, works for Goldman Sachs as a private wealth advisor.Trump’s crack team of money monsters is clearly not planning on acting in the interests of American workers — they will instead do what they know best: use the considerable power of the American state to break down as many regulatory constraints on global banking finance as possible, with a special view to privilege US banks and corporations.Source: Earth Island Journal via Chris van Es www.chrisvanes.comFossil Fuel FreaksTrump’s administration has not just been bought by Wall Street. It’s been bought by the oil, gas and coal industries.Rex Tillerson is Trump’s Secretary of State, and former chairman and CEO of giant oil and gas conglomerate ExxonMobil. As the world’s largest oil major of all, ExxonMobil is the de facto king of fossil fuel interests. Tillerson has close business ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and has previously headed up the joint US-Russian oil company Exxon Neftegas.Tillerson is a friend of Igor Sechin, who heads up the military security services faction of the Kremlin known as ‘Siloviki’. ExxonMobil also had intimate ties with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates under Tillerson. In any case, Trump has richly rewarded Tillerson for services rendered — 91% of the $1.8 million donated to federal candidates by ExxonMobil’s PAC under Tillerson for this election cycle, went to Republicans.It’s well-known that ExxonMobil has funded climate denialism to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. What’s less well-known is that in the 1970s, ExxonMobil’s own scientific research fully validated the scientific reality of climate change. Yet company executives made a self-serving business-decision to suppress these findings, and fund efforts to discredit climate science.Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, is Trump’s Secretary of Energy. Perry holds board directorships at Energy Transfer Partners LP and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, which jointly developed the Dakota Access Pipeline project. The CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, Kelcy Warren, donated $5 million to a super-PAC supportive of Perry. More generally, his two presidential campaigns received over $2.6 million from the oil and gas industry.Scott Pruitt, former Attorney General in Oklahoma, is the new head of the Environment Protection Agency. Pruitt has a track record of launching federal lawsuits to weaken and overturn EPA regulations not just on carbon emissions, but on all sorts of basic environmental rules on air and water pollution. The New York Times reports that he and other Republican attorneys general have forged an “unprecedented, secretive alliance” with the oil industry.Congressman Ryan Zinke is Trump’s nominee for Secretary of the Interior. During Senate confirmation hearings, he refused to admit the accuracy of the scientific consensus on human activity being the dominant cause of climate change. Zinke has supported clean energy measures in the past, but in May 2016, he sponsored a bill for a time limit on Obama’s moratorium on federal coal leasing. He routinely voted against environmental protection measures, supporting fossil fuel use, seeking to minimize public and state involvement in managing public lands, while opposing protections for endangered species.Zinke’s philosophy is basically ‘drill, baby, drill’. That’s why he’s taken over $300,000 in campaign donations from oil and gas companies that want to accelerate drilling across public lands.Mike Catanzaro is Trump’s nominee for Special Assistant for Energy and the Environment. He is also a climate-denying lobbyist for the oil and gas industry, working for Koch Industries, America’s Natural Gas Alliance (ANGA), Halliburton, Noble Energy, Hess Corporation, and many others. Early on in his career, he was Deputy Policy Director of the 2004 Bush-Cheney presidential campaign.The fossil fuel freaks want to burn all the oil, gas and coal they can, at any cost — and they are willing to dismantle whatever environmental protections stand in their way.Black Ops BrigadeIt would be mistaken to assume that Trump’s conflicts with the US intelligence community mean he is necessarily at odds with the military-industrial complex. On the contrary, his defense appointees and advisors are embedded across the military-industrial complex. Trump’s education secretary, DeVos, is the sister of Erik Prince, the notorious founder of disgraced private security firm Blackwater, now known as Academi, which was outed for slaughtering 17 Iraqi civilians.A source in Trump’s transition team confirms that Erik Prince has advised Trump’s team on intelligence and security issues. Prince now runs another security firm, Frontier Services Group. He supports Trump’s proposal for the US military to grab Iraq’s oil and recommends the escalated deployment of private defense contractors across the Middle East and North Africa, such as in Libya, to crackdown on refugees.General ‘Mad Dog’ James Mattis is Trump’s Secretary of Defense. He was also, until his resignation due to his political appointment, on the board of directors of General Dynamics, the fifth largest private defense contractor in the world. Mattis is also on the board of Theranos, a biotechnology company known for its questionable automated fingerstick blood test technology.Lieutenant-General Mike Flynn was Trump’s National Security Advisor until his resignation on February 13 over his ties to Russia. He is a former head of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) under Obama, and a longstanding military intelligence and special operations insider. Previously, he was director of intelligence for the Joint Special Operations Command; director of intelligence for the US Central Command; commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance; chair of the Military Intelligence Board; and Assistant Director of National Intelligence. Flynn also runs Flynn Intel Group, a private intelligence consulting firm.Flynn has just co-authored a book with Michael Ledeen, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and its Allies. Ledeen is a leading neoconservative defense consultant and former Reagan administration appointee who was involved in the Iran–Contra affair as a consultant of then US National Security Advisor, Robert McFarlane. Currently a Freedom Scholar at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), he was a staunch advocate of the 2003 invasion of Iraq (he was directly involved with the Yellowcake forgeries attempting to fabricate a weapons of mass destruction threat to justify the war) and has campaigned for military interventions in Syria, Iran and beyond. Ledeen’s aggressive foreign policy vision was deeply influential in the formation of the Bush administration’s foreign policy strategy.It’s worth noting how low Ledeen stoops with his political philosophy. In his 2000 book, Tocqueville on American Character, Ledeen argues that in some situations, “[i]n order to achieve the most noble accomplishments, the leader may have to ‘enter into evil.’” (p. 90) He even argues that this is sanctioned by the Christian God: “Since it is the highest good, the defense of the country is one of those extreme situations in which a leader is justified in committing evil.” (p. 117)That sort of thinking has led him to endorse the ‘cauldronization’ of the Middle East. In 2002, he wrote in support of invading Iraq that: “One can only hope that we turn the region into a cauldron, and faster, please. If ever there were a region that richly deserved being cauldronized, it is the Middle East today.”General John F. Kelly is Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security. He is a retired United States Marine Corps general who previously served under Obama as commander of the US Southern Command, responsible for American military operations in Central America, South America and the Caribbean. Before that Kelly was the commanding general of the Multi-National Force-West in Iraq, and the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North. Kelly is also a vice chairman at the Spectrum Group, a defense contractor lobbying firm; and on the board of directors of two other private Pentagon contractors, Michael Baker International and Sallyport Global.James Woolsey, the former CIA director and neoconservative stalwart — a former Vice President at NSA-contractor Booz Allen Hamilton and among Michael Ledeen’s bosses at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies — was an early Trump supporter, and a senior advisor to Trump on his transition team. He dropped out over reservations with Trump’s plans to restructure the intelligence community.Lieutenant General Joseph Keith Kellogg is Chief of Staff and Executive Secretary of Trump’s White House National Security Council – but has replaced Flynn as acting National Security Advisor. Kellogg was the US military’s top information technology official during the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq in 2003.He went on to become chief operating officer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, the mechanism for the US occupation of Iraq, from November 2003 to March 2004 — the period widely recognized as being particularly corrupt and inept.In between, Kellogg had joined the board of directors of US government IT contractor, GTSI Corp, where he returned as an independent director after his Iraq stint from 2004 until 2013 — when the firm changed its name to ‘UNICOM Government Inc.’ in an attempt to distance itself from earlier revelations of misconduct....

March 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Dataram Corporation (NASDAQ: DRAM) has announced a Special Meeting of Shareholders to be held at the offices of Sichenzia Ross Ference Kesner LLP at 61 Broadway 32nd floor NY, NY 10006 on March 30, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. EDT. The notice of Special Meeting and proxy statement/prospectus and a Letter to the Shareholders from Dataram's Chairman and CEO, Dave Moylan, can be found on the Company's website at http://corporate.dataram.com/company-info/investor-relations/financial-releases-and-info.  Shareholders may also obtain this information without charge through the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") website (www.sec.gov) or upon your written or oral request by contacting the Chief Executive Officer of Dataram Corporation, 777 Alexander Road, Suite 100, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 or by calling (609) 799-0071. Our shareholder letter follows in its entirety.  Dear Fellow Dataram Shareholders: As I have done periodically, I would like to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on the business and direction of our Company, and in doing so, also ask for your support. A little over two years ago, we re-focused Dataram to concentrate on what it does best, and has done extremely well, since incorporating in 1967 — delivering customized memory solutions into complex technical environments for our business customers around the globe. Throughout this period, our customers have continuously reaffirmed that Dataram's efforts to deliver solutions that provide the lowest cost of ownership in a consistent and service-oriented manner are what they value most. As we refocused, we embarked on a journey to aggressively streamline operations to establish the foundation for global growth and afford us optimum strategic flexibility, while maximizing shareholder value. On our journey, we made many difficult, but necessary decisions to ensure the Company remained viable and relevant. We reset the business strategy, improved Corporate Governance to provide transparency and accountability at all levels, transformed our go-to-market efforts and established powerful market touch points, focused on and improved talent management, and improved financial performance, while significantly reducing operational costs to deliver quantifiable bottom line improvements, establish a leaner, more flexible workforce, facilitate partnerships, and support M&A efforts. Of all these efforts, improving financial performance has proven most challenging. The business environment for enterprise memory solutions has remained as volatile and competitive as it has ever been, and Dataram continues to operate in a market driven by technical product standardization, supplier and manufacturer consolidation, and continuous technology advancements. While our size is an advantage, affording us an entrepreneurial nimbleness to address challenges the larger players may not possess, we remain constrained in that while we can quickly respond to changes, we do not have the deep pockets many of our much larger competitors have. We are also subject to extreme price fluctuations in our raw materials, which ranged from significant decreases in 2015 to steep increases in 2016. To address this challenge, business diversification and growth through acquisition have become increasingly attractive and viable strategic options and we have focused on and evaluated several potential acquisitions to help us grow and diversify business risks across sectors. Diversification and Growth Through Acquisition In May 2016, we identified U.S. Gold Corp., a U.S. based exploration company, as an acquisition candidate, intended to accelerate our existing strategy of growth and diversification. In evaluating the acquisition, we considered Dataram's financial situation combined with the market for our products and services and projected organic growth, and determined that the entry into the natural resources segment represented a market opportunity that would diversify the Company's business model and thereby potentially mitigate risk associated with focusing on one industry. It would also potentially increase the overall value of the Company given U.S. Gold's two specific projects – Copper King and Keystone - and the promising industry analysis regarding the value of gold. The Copper King property located in southwest Wyoming has a Net Present Value (NPV) of $160 million based on measured, indicated, and inferred resources of 1.1 million oz. of gold and 285 million lbs. of copper as presented in a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) by Mine Development Associates (MDA). The Keystone Project, located in North Central Nevada, on the Cortez Trend, consists of 377 unpatented lode mining claims representing approximately 7,500 acres or 11-12 square miles. In mining terms, Keystone represents a large, district scale opportunity. While the memory business and junior mining business have different business models and risk profiles, and also operate in different markets (suppliers, customers), the combination of the two businesses potentially mitigates sector specific exposure and associated risks. Furthermore, the potentially strengthened balance sheet of the combined organization resulting from U.S. Gold having more than $9M in net assets provides the combined entity a strong financial footing from which to grow. Upon closing of the transaction, Dataram will operate as a single entity with two reporting businesses – a junior mining business and a computer memory business. While each of these businesses will be operated and managed independent of one another, they will share common resources and functions to include, without limitation: human resources, legal, facilities, back office operations and administrative support. The sharing of common functions and resources will be of mutual operational and financial benefit. While each business will report as separate business into the parent entity (Dataram), the combined organization will be led by an experienced senior management team with representation from each of the current management teams of Dataram and U.S. Gold, and the Board of Directors will also have representation from each of the current Boards of Directors of Dataram and U.S. Gold. Dataram's Board will also declare a special dividend for the shareholders of record as of no less than five (5) business days prior to closing. This means the Company shareholders of this record date will receive a special dividend from the net proceeds should the Board elect to divest the memory business within eighteen (18) months of the Closing Date of the U.S. Gold acquisition. While there is no current plan to divest, should this become a future consideration, the intent is to ensure the benefit is received by, and only by, the pre-close shareholders. Both Dataram's management and Board believe this acquisition represents a tremendous diversification opportunity that is economically viable and energizing, given the overall landscape and market opportunity within natural resources, and that the combination of the companies will generate significant value for our shareholders. The Proxy – We Are Asking for Your Support on Three Items In this proxy, there are three items we are asking you for your support for and approval of. They are: Approval of the merger and the issuance of the merger consideration; Approval of the certificate of amendment to Dataram's Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized Common Stock and Preferred Stock; and Granting Dataram's Board the authority to implement a reverse split of its common stock within a range of 1 for 2 and 1 for 10. ROTH Capital Partners LLC, a full service investment banking firm, was retained by Dataram. They reviewed the terms of the acquisition and deemed the terms as fair. The amendment to increase our capital stock gives Dataram the ability to complete the transaction and ensure we have sufficient stock available to issue the merger consideration and further support the Company's pursuit of future growth opportunities. Important to note is that the increase in capital stock is, in and of itself, not dilutive. The approval of a reverse split is necessary to ensure the Company meets the listing requirements after closing of the transaction and maintains compliance with listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. In Closing Between May 2008 and April 2015, Dataram lost an average of $4.7 million per year. This was a bleak period in the Company's otherwise respectable history. In January 2015, we took immediate, decisive, and aggressive actions to significantly improve business performance. We established a strong foundation from which to grow, while simultaneously reigniting the entrepreneurial spirit upon which the Company was founded nearly 50 years ago. As we have transformed, we have looked at numerous opportunities to diversify our business, grow the Company, and increase the value delivered to shareholders. Dataram's proposed acquisition of U.S. Gold is intended to accomplish our diversification and growth objectives while also improving the value delivered to you, our shareholders. In 2015, I said it was "darkest before the dawn, and the dawn has started to break. We believe our best days are ahead of us." Our best days have arrived and with your approval, begin today. Thank you for your continued support. ~ Dave David A.

The plea agreement, which remains subject to U.S. District Court approval, also requires ZTE to submit to a three-year period of corporate probation, during which its compliance with export controls will be independently reviewed. In a statement issued by the U.S. Justice Department, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said ZTE not only violated U.S. export controls against Iran but also that the company lied to investigators and even its own corporate counsel. “ZTE Corporation not only violated our export control laws but, once caught, shockingly resumed illegal shipments to Iran during the course of our investigation,” said  John R. Parker, U.S. Attorney  for the Northern District of Texas, in the same statement. “ZTE Corporation then went to great lengths to devise elaborate, corporate-wide schemes to hide its illegal conduct, including lying to its own lawyers.” After being charged last year with using U.S. made components in its products and shipping them to Iran, ZTE faced the threat of being cut off from supply of chips and components made by U.S. firms, including Intel and Qualcomm. The Reuters news service quoted a ZTE spokesperson saying ZTE buys about $2.6 billion worth of components from U.S. firms each year. The guily plea and fine settle charges brought by both the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)  and the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. In addition to the $892 million, the BIS agree to suspended an additional $300 million, which ZTE will pay if it violates its settlement agreement with the BIS. In a statement of its own, ZTE Chairman and CEO Zhao Xianming said, “ZTE acknowledges the mistakes it made, takes responsibility for them, and remains committed to positive change in the company.” ZTE outlined measures it has taken to strengthen compliance to export controls, including Zhao’s appointment last April, the creation of a compliance committee, restructuring of its compliance and legal departments and the appointment of an American lawyer as its chief export compliance officer. -- Dylan McGrath covers the semiconductor industry and business news for EE Times.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | March 9, 2017 -- 18:13 GMT (10:13 PST) | Topic: Cloud Google Google Cloud on Thursday laid out multiple ways it's bulking up the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which already connects more than a billion individual users. The company has spent $24.9 billion on capital expenditures alone in the last three years, Urs Hölzle, SVP of technical infrastructure for Google Cloud, said at the Google Next Conference in San Francisco. The GCP is expanding to three more regions, Hölzle announced, in the Netherlands, Canada and California. All of these will come online this year or next, bringing the total number of GCP regions to 17 and zones to 50. Additionally, Google and Intel announced that Google will be the first to have cloud services running on Intel's next-generation Xeon processor, Skylake. Hölzle also noted that GCP offers virtual machine instances that scale up to 64 cores. Later this year, you'll see even higher core counts, he said.

The former Army general filed paperwork on Tuesday with the Department of Justice revealing he worked for a Turkish company from August to November while he was an adviser to Donald Trump, the Associated Press reported. According to the filing documents, the work “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” A Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin, whose company hired Flynn’s firm, told the wire service that the amended filings were made in response to “political pressure” by the DOJ. Alptekin also said he’s demanding a partial refund of the $530,000 because he wasn’t satisfied with the company’s work, which involved getting information about cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and was accused of organizing a failed coup in July against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Alptekin has ties to Erdogan, according to the filings. Flynn stepped down as President Trump’s national security adviser Feb. 13 after reports revealed he misled White House officials about his contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential campaign. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump wasn’t aware Flynn had been working as a foreign agent when he appointed him to the national security post. Spicer also defended Flynn’s work with Turkey, saying he did so as a “private citizen.” “This is what he did for a living,” Spicer said during a press briefing in the West Wing. “There’s nothing nefarious about doing something legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed.” Alptekin hired Flynn’s consulting company, Flynn Intel Group Inc., to dig up information about Gulen, whom Erdogan wanted extradited to Turkey, and pressure the US government to hold congressional hearings to investigate him, the AP reported. In October, Flynn Intel met with members of the House Homeland Security Committee about Gulen, pressing an investigation, the AP reported, citing a US official. Then, in a blog posted on Election Day, Nov. 8, on The Hill, Flynn made a case for supporting the US ally in the fight against the Islamic State. In the post, Flynn said Gulen “portrays himself as a moderate, but he is in fact a radical Islamist.” He argued that the US should not “provide him safe haven.” Flynn said in the filings that the research for the post about Gulen was provided by Alptekin’s Dutch-based company, Inovo. His lawyer, Robert Kelner, said Flynn Intel closed after its contract with Inovo ended, according to the filings. Calls to Flynn and Kelner weren’t answered, the AP said.

Print Story X Print Story Business March 9, 2017 Share Advertisement China’s ZTE pleads guilty, settles case for nearly $900 million NEW YORK/HONG KONG: Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp has agreed to plead guilty and pay nearly $900 million in a U.S. sanctions case, drawing a line under a damaging scandal that had threatened its cut off its supply chain. While the fine was larger than expected, ZTE, also a major smartphone maker, reported robust underlying earnings for 2016 and was upbeat in estimates for the first quarter. That and the resolution of the case helped its Hong Kong-listed shares surge 6 percent. A five-year investigation found ZTE conspired to evade U.S. embargoes by buying U.S. components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. In addition, it was charged in connection with 283 shipments of telecommunications equipment to North Korea. "ZTE Corporation not only violated export controls that keep sensitive American technology out of the hands of hostile regimes like Iran´s, they lied ... about their illegal acts," U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. ZTE relies on U.S. suppliers for 25 percent to 30 percent of its components, many of which are key to its goods. It purchases about $2.6 billion worth of components a year from U.S. firms, according to a company spokesman. Qualcomm, Microsoft and Intel are among its suppliers. "ZTE acknowledges the mistakes it made, takes responsibility for them, and remains committed to positive change in the company," ZTE Chief Executive Zhao Xianming said in a statement. The company agreed to a seven-year suspended denial of export privileges, which could be activated if there are further violations, as well as three years of probation, a compliance and ethics program, and a corporate monitor. It also agreed to an additional penalty of $300 million that will be suspended during the seven-year term on the condition the company complies with requirements in the agreement.  When asked about the ZTE case, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said relevant departments of the government would continue to pay attention as to whether Chinese firms were receiving fair treatment.   Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory Consensus on military courts as demands accepted Govt will do all to end blasphemy: Nisar Trump’s second bid for Muslim ban blocked Balochistan to become tiger of Pakistan: PM ECP dismisses references against Imran, Tareen View more... see all opinions Opinion Aijaz Zaka Syed UP is not the end of the world Nadir Hassan The Haqqani affair Shahzad Tahir To potential legislators Shahzad Chaudhry South Asian politics: coming of age?

Quick and free-of-charge access to one of the most licensed Cortex-M processors speeds up the development and validation of new, custom SoCs that will enable the growth of smart connected devices. Combine this with the availability of a low-cost, simplified, fast-track license to the Cortex-M0 for the commercialization phase of the development means that a custom SoC based backed by the #1 ecosystem of tools, software and operating systems is now more readily available. So what is this Cortex-M0 DesignStart package and what can a developer do with it? The first thing to know is that there are two components to the Cortex-M0 DesignStart. The first component is the Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit, which is an RTL package containing the Cortex-M0 DesignStart processor preintegrated with an AHB sub-system. In the hands of a Verilog system designer, the package allows for system design and simulation with a suitable Verilog simulator. The second component is the Cortex-M0 DesignStart FPGA Prototyping Kit, which is an FPGA image of the Cortex-M0 DesignStart processor pre-integrated with an AHB subsystem that works with ARM’s Versatile Express MPS2 FPGA prototyping board. The AHB subsystem portion of the FPGA image can be customized, by adding or removing logic, to the users’ system requirements. The two components allow a system designer to design and test on a simulator, and then move their design to an FPGA for hardware prototyping. The Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit can be accessed via the ARM DesignStart portal (designstart.arm.com). Users will need to register, and once approved an email will be sent with instructions on how to download the kit. We do need to do some checks before approving and we do need to set up users on the system, hence it may take approximately one week to do this. For those users who wish to move on to FPGA simulation, instructions on downloading the Cortex-M0 DesignStart FPGA Prototyping Kit are provided in the Design Kit. By agreeing to an on-line end user license agreement (EULA), the two components can be easily accessed and used for design and prototyping. Once ready for manufacturing, a simplified fast-track license agreement offers the licensee rights to manufacture the Cortex-M0 based device through a low-cost, standardized license agreement. More information on the fast-track purchasing option can also be accessed at designstart.arm.com. There are some requirements, in terms of tools, that potential users of the Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit and of the Cortex-M0 Design Start FPGA Prototyping Kit, should be aware of. In addition to providing an overview of these two components, this white paper describes these tool-related requirements. What is the Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit? The Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit is intended for system Verilog design and simulation of a prototype SoC-based on the Cortex-M0 DesignStart processor. The DesignStart Design Kit includes: The ARM Cortex-M0 DesignStart processor An example system-level design for the ARM Cortex-M0 processor Reusable AMBA components for system-level development Figure 1: ARM Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit simplified block diagram The Cortex-M0 processor within DesignStart is delivered as a preconfigured and obfuscated, but synthesizable, Verilog version of the full Cortex-M0 processor. As such, it does not offer the same configurability capability as the full Cortex-M0 processor (which is available within a simplified, low-cost, fast-track licensing option), nor does it offer a hierarchical RTL deliverable for optimal implementations of the SoC. The Cortex-M0 processor within DesignStart does, however, provide a fully compliant ARMv6-M architecture processor that enables system design and simulation. In addition to the Cortex-M0 processor, a pre-integrated AHB subsystem with a useful starter set of peripherals (such as timers, GPIO, UARTs, WDT, etc.) are included to accelerate the users path to a customized functional system. Cortex-M0 processor version in DesignStart Standard Cortex-M0 processor (available with a simplified, lowcost, Fast Track licensing option) ARMv6-M compatible Yes Yes RTL deliverable Obfuscated, flattened, gate-level Verilog Documented, unobfuscated Verilog Configuration options No Yes Interrupt lines 32 0-32 Multiplier fast Slow or fast Debug No in RTL (as it is not used in RTL simulation) Yes in FPGA Yes (optional) Low power mode support and WIC No Yes Table 1: Comparison between Cortex-M0 DesignStart processor and the full Cortex-M0 processor Benefits of the full Cortex-M0 processor The Cortex-M0 processor within DesignStart is not intended for a production system on chip. It is intended for system Verilog design and prototyping. As such, the full Cortex-M0 processor provides additional capabilities above that of the Cortex-M0 DesignStart processor. These are: Low power optimizations The full Cortex-M0 processor is designed for deployment in a multi-power domain system to maximize static power efficiency, featuring a minimal Wake-up Interrupt Controller (WIC). It also makes extensive use of architectural clock gating to minimize dynamic power. For simplicity these are amongst the technologies not included in the Cortex-M0 DesignStart processor. Debug support The full Cortex-M0 processor supports the use of an external hardware debugger to facilitate the development of applications. Connection is possible via either Serial-Wire or JTAG interfaces and provides a host of debug functionality. Both connections provide the ability to access all AHB-Lite connected slaves, including RAM, whilst the processor is running, as well as providing full halting-mode debug. Halting-mode debug allows all processor registers to be examined and modified, and can be configured to provide up to four hardware breakpoints and two hardware watchpoints. Unlimited software breakpoints are possible via the BKPT instruction. Full debug supported is included within the Cortex-M0 DesignStart FPGA Prototyping Kit package so that designs can be debugged on FPGA. Debug is not included within the Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit RTL as this unit is not required in RTL simulation. Note: to facilitate the ease of transition from the RTL simulation to the FPGA prototyping phases, debug pinout from the processor is included in the RTL package. Hardware multiplier options The ARMv6-M architecture provides a MULS instruction capable of performing a 32-bitx32-bit multiply, generating a 32-bit result. The full Cortex-M0 processor product allows implementation time selection between a fast single-cycle implementation and a low-area 32-cycle implementation. The Cortex-M0 processor within DesignStart only provides the single-cycle option. Jitter-free interrupt handling The full Cortex-M0 processor provides the capability to optionally regulate the time between an interrupt-signal being asserted and the point at which the associated exception handler is entered, thus providing zero-jitter interrupt entry. The Cortex-M0 processor in DesignStart always handles interrupts as fast as possible. Requirements for using Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit The Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit can be used for system design and simulation. Appropriate ASIC system design tools are required for each of the steps in the development flow. The Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit has been validated with the following tools: Tool Version Verilog simulator Cadence Incisive 10.20.010 Mentor Questasim 10.3b Synopsys VCS 2011.12 C Compiler RVCT 5.06.21 Synthesis Synopsys Design Compiler 2013.03-SP5 Formal equivalence check Synopsys Formality 2013.03-SP5 Table 2: Example of tools used for validating Cortex-M0 DeisgnStart Design Kit Design Services EDA tooling To help get started with a Cortex-M0 design, ARM has partnered with both Cadence Design Systems and Mentor Graphics to provide simplified and expedited access to chip development tooling, and a free evaluation of the Cortex- M0 within these tools. Instructions on accessing this EDA tooling will be sent to approved registrants of Cortex-M0 DesignStart. Design services companies Companies wishing to supplement their own skills can use ARM Approved Design Partners who are experienced in developing SoCs using ARM IP. ARM Approved partners have been through a robust audit process before they are recommend. The process includes: track record of success, audited quality and management procedures, highly qualified engineering teams, financial stability and business continuity planning. ARM Approved design partners include: eInfochips, Open-Silicon, SoC Solutions, and Sondrel What is the Cortex-M0 DesignStart FPGA Prototyping Kit? The Cortex-M0 DesignStart FPGA Prototyping Kit is an encrypted FPGA image of the Cortex-M0 processor together with a customizable example AHB subsystem. The Cortex-M0 is configured exactly the same as the obfuscated RTL version. The prototyping kit is only usable on the ARM MPS2 board as the encrypted FPGA image is only decrypted by a key pre-installed on the MPS2 board. Requirements for using Cortex-M0 DesignStart FPGA Prototyping Kit Usage of the Cortex-M0 DesignStart FPGA Prototyping Kit requires the purchase of the ARM Versatile Express MPS2 board. More information on this board can be found here: https://www.keil.com/boards2/arm/v2m_mps2/ Unlike the Cortex-M0 processor in the DesignStart Design Kit, the encrypted image of the Cortex-M0 DesignStart processor contains debug logic that supports SW development and debug on the ARM MPS2 board. The AHB subsystem delivered with the FPGA prototyping kit is modifiable, allowing the user to customize logic surrounding the DesignStart processor. This customization process relies on technology supplied by Intel’s Quartus FPGA design tool called partial reconfiguration. Usage of the partial reconfiguration feature requires that the Cortex-M0 DesignStart FPGA project must use the latest Intel Quartus Prime subscription edition (version 15.0 at the time of this writing). Quartus Prime Lite is not suitable. More information on the Quartus Prime subscription edition tool can be found here: https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-ii/quartus-ii-subscription-edition.html In order to enable the partial reconfiguration feature, an additional (free of charge) license is required to the basic Quartus Prime subscription edition license. If you do not have the partial reconfiguration feature enabled in your existing license please contact mps-support@arm.com to request a partial reconfiguration license. Summary The Cortex-M0 DesignStart Design Kit provides a Cortex-M0 and a system design kit provides free access to IP to enable designers to design, simulate and test Cortex-M0 based systems. With this kit, designers can add their own or third party IP to the system, and get a long way with their SoC design with minimal risk. The Cortex-M0 DesignStart FPGA Prototyping Kit enables designers to then test their design on an ARM-supplied FPGA platform. Once ready to commercialize, designers then have a simplified route to license the full IP, with a low-cost, fast-track licensing option.

The international firm reveals that 95% of U.S. broadband households use one or more mobile phones, which in many cases services as the foundation for the connected consumer experience across multiple IoT markets. "Among the 95% of broadband households using a mobile phone, 89% own a smartphone. Quick and easy access to the Internet is changing how consumers interact with technology, driving new innovations and the adoption of new products and services in multiple verticals," said Jennifer Kent, Director, Research Quality & Product Development, Parks Associates. "Companies use our research to identify new use case scenarios, barriers to adoption, opportunities for new partnerships, and the best business models for expanding their businesses." Parks Associates notes that 26% of U.S. broadband households own at least one smart home device, which equates to more than 26 million households. Traditionally most smart home products were sold bundled with services or with multiple components, but the share of sales of standalone devices increased for more than a dozen smart home product categories between 2014 and 2016, which could indicate a transition beyond early adopters and high-income households toward the mass market. Parks Associates analysts note that for smart home companies to continue to grow consumer interest and adoption, they must refine and promote the value propositions for their solutions as they relate to the specific needs of their customers. "There are thousands of consumer use cases for smart home systems and devices," said Brad Russell, Research Analyst, Parks Associates. "This market condition can be challenging for smart home marketers whether they are selling smart home bundles or single-use devices. Parks Associates research helps companies identify their target markets and determine the best strategies to reach consumers, whether they are targeting the bundle buyers, first-time standalone device buyers, or buyers purchasing additions and replacements." New Parks Associates deliverables include the following: Consumer Choice: Standalone or Bundled Smart Home Devices reveals consumer preferences for smart home bundles versus build-as-you-go adoption and highlights the differences between the consumer segments. The report also describes the benefits of the various purchase options, details purchase patterns and retail preferences, and analyzes the key industry players from the security, broadband, and DIY arenas. Smart Kitchens: Intelligent Planning, Shopping, and Cooking addresses how the connected kitchen is changing the competitive landscape for appliances, shopping, distribution, and meal preparation. The report also highlights the major trends in the connected kitchen and their impact on the consumer and related markets. TV Services: Changing the Channel Package examines different factors causing operators to reassess the ways in which they package their pay-TV offerings, including carriage fee battles, changing consumer preferences, new regulations, emerging technologies, and aggressive competition. The report also examines global and regional trends in video service packaging and consumer preferences related to these changes. The Connected Car Experience: Software, Apps, and Services examines the connected car software developer sector to highlight innovations and new consumer experiences that will come to new car models in the next five years. The report hones in on software and apps that can be built on top of a car's embedded operating system, through mirroring technology from a smartphone, or via an aftermarket product. The report concludes with an update on Parks Associates' five-year forecasts of connected car sales in the U.S. Parks Associates will present new research findings and analysis at the upcoming research workshop Crossing the Chasm: Understanding Growth in the Smart Home, sponsored by Ayla Networks, on March 21 in San Francisco. The firm also hosts the 21st-annual CONNECTIONS™: The Premier Connected Home Conference, May 23-25 in San Francisco, featuring keynotes from Comcast, Cox Communications, Intel, and Vivint Smart Home. Registration is open, and media are invited to attend both events.

Through a series of creative elements, the campaign reasserts the company’s bullish commitment to the Houston business market and is representative of Lucas Group’s long-standing mission to serve companies and professionals through customer-centric, locally driven recruiting solutions. “Houston took painful economic and employment hits when oil prices dropped and energy activity crashed. We understand the deep cuts the region suffered because we were here, too.” said Chief Marketing Officer, Scott Smith. “Working side-by-side with local customers, our belief in Houston’s economic revitalization has never been stronger. This is our opportunity to show companies and professionals across the city that we’re not only optimistic about Houston’s future, we’re fired up.” “Together, we own Houston” is both reflective and forward-looking. Citywide, it’s an opportunity for Lucas Group to share its appreciation for 40+ years of strong customer relationships with thousands of Houston-area hiring companies and job seekers. The campaign also demonstrates Lucas Group’s continued confidence in the city’s dynamic business environment, including its optimism for Houston’s growth and enthusiasm for the companies and people who call the city home. Lucas Group’s investment in the Houston market stretches back more than 40 years. When the Atlanta-based company first opened its local office in 1973, initial recruiting services focused on helping area companies identify and hire highly skilled, experienced professionals who were transitioning from the US Military into civilian careers. Over the decades, Lucas Group’s “customer-first” philosophy led the company to deepen its service commitment in response to the region’s changing employment market. Today, the Houston office provides a full suite of executive and management level recruitment solutions. Throughout the three-month campaign, the firm will launch a series of market-facing elements designed to engage with Houston’s businesses and professionals, across industries and functional roles. Creative includes both digital advertising and out-of-home components, like billboards. In addition, Lucas Group will publish a library of fresh thought-leadership content via its career advice site, Your Career Intel. This collection of original blogs, infographics and videos provides local-expert insights into the Houston recruiting and hiring market. Online and via social media, the campaign will also highlight shared stories and successes from the firm’s 40+ year history in Houston. In addition to engaging businesses and job seekers across the region, “Together, we own Houston” includes professional development and training resources for the firm’s Houston executive recruiters. The company recently rolled out a multi-departmental, in-person training curriculum focused on ongoing professional and leadership development. Additional skills improvement initiatives include continued training programs and performance coaching dedicated to providing useful sales tools and learning resources for Lucas Group’s Houston recruiters. “We’re excited to launch this multifaceted campaign, connecting Houston businesses and professionals with our amazing team of local recruiting experts,” said Smith. “For us, this is an opportunity to proudly reaffirm our commitment to the Houston market and to reemphasize our mission of delivering customer-centric, locally driven recruitment solutions here in Houston.” Since opening its doors in 1970, Lucas Group has built a reputation as the North American leader in executive search.

They mark the end of the era of maximizing the degree of standardization in IPCs and introduce a new concept of modular design, allowing a higher level of customizing IPCs to specific client needs. One of the new Industrial PCs is the RXi2-EP. Optimized for heavy usage in harsh industrial environments, it delivers mid-to-high performance computing capabilities to run e.g. data analytics applications right at the machine, enabling improved control of operations in real time. GE Industrial PC RXi2-EP “Our new, customized IPCs deliver on the promise of lower total cost of ownership. When compared to standardized products, they require less maintenance and have longer life-cycles. They allow for operating periods of 7 to 10 years throughout which the computers can continuously be deployed, hardly requiring reconfiguration. Expenses for software modifications are lower, and there is less regression testing“, says Rudolf Krumenacker, Head of Engineering and Site Leader at GE in Augsburg, Germany. All aspects of the new IPCs have been designed to further advance the Industrial Internet, as they provide more computing power at the heart of GE’s Field Agents which are the critical link and gateway of machine controllers to data analytics in the cloud.

  SOFTPEDIA®   Windows   Drivers   Games   Mac   Android   Linux   News Softpedia > News > Microsoft > Surface FLASH SALE: SpyShelter Firewall      30% OFF! Microsoft Launches March 2017 Firmware Update for Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 GO New firmware updates now available for download Mar 9, 2017 10:40 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft has released this month’s firmware updates for the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book, both of which are getting new driver versions with performance and stability improvements. The driver packs are released in MSI and ZIP formats, and users should go for the first version because it offers a straightforward installation method with only a few prompts displayed during the process. First of all, let’s see what’s new in the Surface Book update. According to Microsoft, the so-called “ultimate laptop” is getting the recently-released NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M driver up to version 21.21.13.7667 which improves system stability, but we’re hearing from some of our readers that gaming performance is substantially improved with this release. Furthermore, it appears that some rendering glitches experienced during gaming are no longer there, so those who are using the Surface Book for playing games should hurry up to deploy this new firmware update. Then, there are updates for the Surface UEFI, NVM Express Controller, the Integration Service Device, and the USB Hub Firmware Update, all of which are getting improved stability, performance, and bug fixes. Surface Pro 4 update Some of the improvements that were shipped to the Surface Book are also available for the Surface Pro 4 and that’s pretty normal given that the two devices use similar components. For example, the Surface Pro 4 is getting updates for the Surface UEFI, the display, the NVM Express Controller, and the Intel Management Engine Interface, but you can check out the full changelog in the box below to see all the new drivers and their versions. Just like it happens with every Surface firmware update, make sure that the device is charged or at least plugged in, and in case you’re afraid that anything could happen, backups are your safest bet. If the firmware update appears to freeze before the process comes to an end, don’t interrupt it and wait a little bit longer because otherwise you could brick the device.

By Bill Alpert Biography Updated May 28, 2011 12:01 a.m. ET Regulators are hotly pursuing insider trading. On May 11, federal prosecutors secured the conviction of Galleon hedge-fund boss Raj Rajaratnam for reaping over $60 million in profit by trading stocks on inside information, and federal prosecutor Preet Bharara -- who's called the practice "rampant"–has warned more cases are coming.Still, the government might be missing a lot of the action. Some insider cases allege wrongful trading in the options markets, but most concern only trading in stocks. Yet a new and alarming finance study finds spikes in options trading ahead of breaking news and other surprise events across diverse industries. For instance, a few days before Bank of America BAC 0.15885623510722796% Bank of America Corp.

In the days before the Feb. 15 announcement and an accompanying report in the medical journal Lancet, volume in Baxter call options rocketed more than a 500 fold -- as shown in the upper right-hand chart. The good news lifted Baxter stock almost 10% over a couple of weeks. Read It Here First Well before the news, there were big jumps in the cumulative trading volume of Bank of America and Baxter options (the dark lines in the top charts), shown as multiples of the starting volume level. Stock-trading volumes (top edge of the shaded area) didn't jump as much above starting levels (the bottom edge of the shaded area). The announcements by Bank of America and Baxter weren't scheduled -- but some traders seemed to know something was coming or were very lucky. These instances weren't isolated. Seven years of high-frequency trading data (allowing the researcher to look at five-minute intervals of trading) on the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Index show that options volume rose more than 30-fold in the two hours before news announcements that should have come as surprises -- as shown on the next page's charts -- while stock volumes roughly quadrupled. "We didn't expect that there would be so much going on in the Dow stocks," says Nitish R. Sinha, the University of Illinois at Chicago finance expert who performed the options study with a Citigroup credit-risk analyst Wei Dong. "Am I saying there's evidence of inside-information trading in the Dow stocks? It's likely." "Informed traders like to hide, and the options market has a lot of nooks and crannies in which to hide," says Sinha. The stock market may be liquid, but it's fairly centralized and exposed, says Sinha, and options on individual stocks can trade at dozens of strike prices, across more than five major exchanges. The tools the two researchers used to flag suspicious options trading could produce leads for regulators. Market-surveillance types at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Securities and Exchange Commission ought to give themselves this, well, option. Insider-trading cases rarely emerge from options trading. In September 2010, a former executive of Merck MRK -0.80370942812983% Merck & Co. Inc.

Administrative charges by the SEC in March alleged that onetime Goldman Sachs director Rajat K. Gupta supplied inside information to Galleon's Rajaratnam that led Galleon to load up on Goldman call options and stock. Gupta's fighting the charges. Separately, Rajaratnam has asked a judge to dismiss his criminal conviction. AND THIS MONTH, the Wall Street Journal reported that Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) received reports from Finra of about 20 instances when that securities industry self-regulator had referred suspicious trades by SAC Capital Advisors to the SEC. According to the Journal, the senator is also looking into SAC's options trades. The senator wants the SEC to tell him by June 7 if it did anything about these referrals. SAC is cooperating with Grassley's office, and neither SAC nor its founder Steven A. Cohen has been accused of any wrongdoing by authorities. Before becoming an assistant professor of finance at UIC, Sinha worked at Goldman Sachs and India's Tata Group. Dong was a physicist before going into finance. They began studying options trading as a way to measure the impact of news on investors' uncertainty about a stock—with that uncertainty represented by the volatility implied by the options on that stock. Sinha and Dong noticed some stocks with suspicious options activity ahead of news of earnings or mergers, as had previous finance researchers. But earlier studies only examined a narrow selection of news announcements. Sinha decided to expand his sample by taking advantage of the Thomson Reuters Sentiment NewsScope database, one of a number of computational-linguistics products that classify articles according to their tone, novelty and relevance to a particular company. The researchers then mapped the Reuters news stories to high-frequency trading data on the 30 companies in the Dow Industrials from 2003 to 2009, obtained from the five largest options exchanges and the central Options Price Reporting Authority (actually, just 29 of the Dow stocks, because Philip Morris' transformation into Altria rendered those entities not comparable). The researchers expected traders to anticipate certain kinds of news, such as scheduled announcements of earnings. They expected that trading volume in stocks and options might rise ahead of such events, but figured they would find less trading in advance of news stories that ought to be surprises: mergers, changes in an analyst's rating or earnings forecast, judicial outcomes, credit-rating changes and the breaking news items that Reuters calls "Alerts." "Before we started the study, we expected there'd be a difference in trading ahead of scheduled and unscheduled news," says Sinha. That turned out to be true for stocks, but not for options. Measuring from 100 minutes before the news stories appeared on Reuters terminals, they found that the rise in options volume ahead of scheduled news wasn't statistically different from the rise ahead of a news surprise. The pair of charts on this page show the trading volumes before and after news for the 29 Dow-component stocks and options, measured in multiples of the volume level at the start of the measurement window (and using logarithms, so that stocks and options can fit on the same chart). News boosts stock trading volumes several-fold, but options volume jumps 60-to-400-fold. Suspicious Trading, Even in Dow Stocks Composite graphs of stock (gray lines) and option (black) volumes show eerie rises -- even ahead of surprise news -- in seven years of trading in the Dow Industrial stocks. To better model actual trader behavior, researchers used computer simulations to estimate the Dow stocks' response to news events. THE SURPRISE IS, the clear volume jump in Dow stock options in the 80 minutes before a news surprise. Sinha's working paper politely calls such trading "informed," rather than "insider trading," since some traders may legitimately know enough about a company to anticipate news. But given that options expire on a particular date, says Sinha, "if you're trading options, you must have time-sensitive information." Insider-trading cases in Dow component stocks aren't unheard of -- but they typically involve the stock, not options. In recent years, cases have concerned shares of Pfizer, Disney, Intel, IBM, Merck and Johnson & Johnson. But Sinha and Dong seem to have found new cause for suspicion. Sinha's discovery of the February activity in Baxter options, which postdated their study's time frame, came by accident as he was looking for examples of earnings disappointments for one of his UIC finance lessons. In addition to the suspicious options trading before Countrywide's 2008 takeover by Bank of America, the researchers' seven-year survey found curious options activity before rating changes on other Dow components. The conventional wisdom holds that guilty traders would favor the liquid market for stocks. But Sinha thinks that "informed" traders use options because it's easier to hide among all the strike prices and markets. Put options also furnish a quick way to make a bearish bet, compared to the borrowing chores involved in a stock's short sale. And options market makers tend to ask fewer questions, says Sinha, than would an investor who got skinned taking the other side of an informed investor's stock trade. "When you're buying or selling an option," he says, "the other side is a market maker, not another guy like you, and the options market makers instantly hedge their exposure in the stock market." As with any kind of corruption, insider-trading prosecutions probably catch just a small portion of the activity. The trading in thousands of securities on dozens of markets generates an overwhelming amount of data to analyze. For just the 29 stocks in Sinha's study, the data amounted to five terabytes (that is, five trillion pieces of data). But the researchers' idea of conditioning their surveillance on news "surprises" makes the job tractable. "So you don't need to watch all the options of every stock," says the UIC professor. "If you look at the most liquid of the at-the-money or near-the-money options -- you'll catch them."  E-mail: editors@barrons.com Email Print 0 Comments Order Reprints Facebook Share Twitter Google+ smaller Larger Latest in Feature 1.

I suspect that this is a very conservative estimate based on limited data from the Department of Employment and the OLCC.” In summary, Whitney’s report found: • As of February 21, 2017, there are 917 OLCC licensed cannabis businesses and an additional 1,225 applications for a cannabis business. 2,142 in total. The Oregon Employment Department lists 776 cannabis businesses in Oregon • There are approximately 12,500 jobs associated with the cannabis industry in Oregon. These are jobs that directly touch cannabis and are not jobs associated with auxiliary businesses such as security, regulatory, accounting, consulting, real estate, etc. This is a very conservative estimate and these numbers are expected to increase once the more detailed analysis is completed • At an average wage of $12.13/hour, the total annual wages associated with these jobs are $315 million. With a multiplier of 4, this implies that there is $1.2 billion in economic activity related to these wages Whitney said the report does not extend into the supply chain for “shovels or picks,” meaning lights, greenhouses, insurance, real estate, accounting, security, etc. “At present, I feel there are roughly 300,000 – 400,000 cannabis-touching jobs in the USA,” Whitney said. “That number will grow to more than a million as more states come online as legal markets. Cannabis is a job-creation machine.” Whitney said a more comprehensive jobs report will be researched and published later in 2017, but this initial update should demonstrate the cannabis industry is a powerful force in the Oregon economic engine. Download the news release and Whitney’s report here. Beau R. Whitney is an economist, a university professor and is the former COO of Golden Leaf Holdings, a vertically integrated, publically traded company. Prior to working in the cannabis industry, Beau spent 15 years in the high-tech industry in business operations roles, most notably at Intel and TriQuint Semiconductor. Whitney has published a series of white papers on the cannabis market in the USA and is considered an authority in cannabis economics. He recently presented a paper at the 91st annual Western Economics Association International conference on economics’ role in shaping public policy and was recognized by his peers as being a pioneer in this field of study.

Senators voted 50-49 on Thursday to roll back a regulation that placed tougher accountability measures on schools. The rule detailed how public schools must carry out laws meant to ensure they are meeting the needs of all students.  Republicans are using the Congressional Review Act to nix the Obama regulations, allowing them to undo the rules without any support from Democrats.  Thursday's vote comes after senators voted 59-40 on Wednesday to nix teacher preparation requirements.  Under that regulation states had to issue ratings for teacher-prep programs, and poorly performing schools would be penalized by being ineligible for some federal aid.  ADVERTISEMENT The House has already voted to eliminate both of the education regulations, meaning the bills will now head to the desk of President Trump, who is expected to sign them.  The rules stem from the Every Student Succeeds Act, an overhaul of the George W. Bush-era No Child Left Behind law. Democrats argue the rules are needed to clarify what schools must do to comply with the 2015 law.  Sen.

"Eliminating this rule will give Secretary DeVos more power over our higher-education programs — a risk we should not be willing to take without learning more about Secretary DeVos's vision for our higher education system," Murray said about the teacher prep rule.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 March 2017 by Military News Q30 Innovations Wins MIT Award for Product Innovation WESTPORT, Conn., March 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Q30 Innovations today announced it has won the 2017 Alpha Award for Best Analytics Innovation/Technology for its Q-Collar – a novel device designed to mitigate the dangers of concussive blows. The award was presented by the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference (SSAC) advisory board, whose Alpha Awards recognize achievements in sports analytics and innovation. The Q-Collar, which employs the body’s own physiology to create a bubble-wrap effect for the brain, is being developed by Q30 Innovations for athletes, soldiers and industrial workers. It gently compresses the jugular vein to mildly increase blood volume in the cranium, creating a „tighter fit” of the brain inside the skull. This action is proposed to reduce „slosh” – i.e., the twisting and slamming of the brain against the skull’s interior walls, which is one cause of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion. For more than five years, Q30 has been focused on the development of the Q-Collar to reduce the risk and severity of brain injury suffered by athletes and military personnel who are at risk. „The Alpha Award for Best Analytics Innovation/Technology is a tremendous honor that goes to the heart of how the Q-Collar was conceived – a blend of eureka moments and painstaking R&D,” said Tom Hoey, co-CEO of Q30 Innovations. „We won’t stop until every athlete has the opportunity to reduce their chances of mild traumatic brain injury in sports and beyond.” The Q-Collar was the centerpiece of two scientific studies published in 2016 that showed early evidence it may reduce brain injuries in high-school football and hockey players. The studies, performed by Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, constituted the first evidence of the effectiveness of the collar on human subjects. The 11th annual SSAC was hosted by the MIT Sloan School of Management at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, Mass., attracting a number of leaders in the sports technology industry as well as major sponsors including Rebook, SAP, Intel, and lead sponsor ESPN. About Q30 Innovations A global company based in Westport, Conn., Q30 Innovations, LLC, uses independent scientific research and innovative thinking to design products intended to reduce traumatic brain injury in athletes, soldiers, and industry workers.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft’s Surface Studio comes to France in July, wider rollout from September -1 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Mar 9, 2017 at 16:15 GMT1 week ago Microsoft’s Surface Studio was announced at the Windows 10 Creators Update event back in October last year to fanfare and rave reviews praising its beautiful hardware. The device – alongside with the usual Surface staples of touch support, an included Surface Pen and a new Surface Keyboard and Mouse – also debuted the Surface Dial one of the first puck based peripherals for Windows. While it has since been made available in the US from $2,999, it has been unclear for a while when Microsoft would bring the device to potential buyers in the other Surface markets like the UK, France, Germany and so on. This week Microsoft confirmed to the French news site Numerama at the IT Partners Industry event in France that the Surface Studio would be available for sale in July – albeit in limited quantities. There would be a bigger ramp up of sales towards the end of Summer, around September. Despite the many innovations the Studio packs in its chassis, there ae concerns about the viability of selling or purchasing a relatively underpowered device for such a high price a year after release. For while the Surface Studio is indeed powerful, it still comes with the older Skylake and not Intel’s newer and more powerful Kaby Lake processors. Are you in the market for a Surface Studio?

Moore's Law has seen the power of computer chips double every two years without them growing in size, while data storage plateaued somewhat.  But in a breakthrough that could revolutionise the way information is stored, researchers have managed to store data on a single atom. Researchers at IBM successfully coded an individual atom with a binary value of 0 or 1 in what is a major step forward for information storage. Experts in the field have described the research as a "landmark achievement" and said it could be used to increase hard-drive storage density by 1,000 times. "It's a landmark achievement," Sander Otte, a physicist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, told Nature.  "Finally, magnetic stability has been demonstrated undeniably in a single atom."  Data is currently stored in vast centres that require masses of computer power Credit: Phototek The researchers were able to imbue two Holmium atoms with separate binary values using a magnetised scanning tunnelling microscope. They then connected them to make a miniscule hard drive with four possible combinations. With the majority of the data ever produced having been created in the past six years, atomic storage could be vital for reducing the space and energy used in keeping information.  If the system was scaled up it would be possible to store an iTunes library of 35 million songs on a credit card sized device, according to IEEE Spectrum. To date, the smallest matter to have stored data was a magnetic grain with a diametre of 5 nanometers. A Holmium atom has a radius of 0.2 nanometres. The researchers plan to further explore if the atoms of other elements, clusters of atoms and small molecules could also be used to store data.  It could also be used eventually to replace an electrical current in devices as the atoms could move information within a device, according to Otte. This could make for more energy efficient computers.  Brian Krzanich said Moore's law was not over Credit: Getty The breakthrough indicates that there are still steps to be made to create more powerful, smaller and efficient computers.  Intel, whose founder was behind the Moore's Law maxim that the power of chips doubling every two years without them growing in size, recently announced that the company will release a 10 nanometre chip in 2017. The news allayed doubts that manufacturers had reached a crunch point where it was no longer cost effective to uphold Moore's Law.   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: IBM Gadgets Show more Technology latest 16 Mar 2017, 5:17pm Comment: East Africa famine: How do I tell my daughter about children starving in places like Yemen and South Sudan?
