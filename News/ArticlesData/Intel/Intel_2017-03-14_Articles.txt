Intel is making a huge investment in autonomous driving. The chip giant on Monday announced plans to acquire Jerusalem-based self-driving technology firm Mobileye for $15 billion. The transaction is expected to close within the next nine months. Mobileye makes computer vision, machine learning, data analysts, and mapping technology for advanced driver assisted systems and autonomous driving. Intel said the acquisition will position it as a "leading technology partner for the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles." With Mobileye under its wing, Intel said it will be able to "accelerate innovation for the automotive industry." Intel sees huge moneymaking opportunities here. The company estimates the vehicle systems, data, and services market to reach $70 billion by 2030. Following the acquisition, Mobileye will combine with Intel's existing automated driving group. The team will be headquartered in Israel and led by Mobileye's Co-Founder, Chairman, and CTO Amnon Shashu. Related How Delphi, Mobileye Are Fast-Tracking Driverless Car Tech How Delphi, Mobileye Are Fast-Tracking Driverless Car Tech "This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement (PDF). "Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car's path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry's best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers." Intel said fully autonomous vehicles are increasingly becoming "data centers on wheels," and estimated they will generate 4TB of data per day by 2020. The company said that the complexity and computing power of automated vehicles created big opportunities for its high-end processors and other technologies. Meanwhile, Intel and Mobileye already have one big-name customer: BMW. The companies in July 2016 announced they were teaming up to bring fully automated vehicle to market by 2021. AT CES this year, the companies announced that autonomous BMW 7 Series vehicles would be hitting roads in the US and Europe this year for testing.

The deal announced Monday is the latest in a series of big acquisitions for Intel, which have historically produced very little for the company. “There’s general acknowledgment within the executive team and the board at Intel that we haven’t done as well as we could do on past acquisitions,” Wendell Brooks, president of Intel Capital, told Bloomberg in 2015. He said Intel is putting more work into planning how to integrate its acquisitions. And with its core PC market fading, Intel is under increasing pressure to continue diversifying into new technologies. That’s why it was willing to make the $15 billion gamble on Mobileye, which reported just $358 million in revenue last year. Here’s a look at some other notable Intel acquisitions, and how they fit in — or don’t — with the overall company: Wind River, 2008: The $884 million deal was the company’s largest in a decade, helping position Intel in the market for “embedded systems” — cars, planes, telecommunications gear and industrial equipment. Intel has continued to operate Wind River as an independent subsidiary, but the acquisition helped position the chipmaker for the emerging Internet of Things — wearable computing, appliances and other new applications. McAfee, 2010: This $7.7 billion transaction was a high-profile failure for Intel, which had hoped to incorporate McAfee’s online security technology directly into computer chips. Intel paid a 60 percent premium for McAfee but never succeeded in achieving its technological goals. Intel announced last fall it would spin McAfee out but retain a 49 percent stake in the business. That transaction valued the security company at $4.2 billion, 45 percent below the purchase price. Infineon’s wireless group, 2010: Late to the wireless market, Intel spent $1.4 billion in 2010 to buy the wireless division of Germany’s Infineon Technologies. Intel remains a laggard in wireless, but does have modems in some models of Apple’s latest iPhone. Intel is now focused on the forthcoming 5G wireless standard. Basis Science, 2014: Reports valued this deal between $100 million and $150 million, buying Intel a pioneer in the smartwatch market. Consumers have been cool on wearable technologies, though, while the Basis Peak smartwatches turned out to be too hot. Intel recalled them last year, warning they could overheat and injure wearers. Altera, 2015: Intel’s largest deal ever, the $16.7 billion transaction brought programmable chip technology Intel said could help its data center chips. Intel indicated that Altera gained market share in 2016, its first year under Intel ownership. Lantiq, 2015: The deal bought Intel technology for the “connected home,” which was briefly a top Intel priority. Intel didn’t disclose a purchase price for the German company and hasn’t focused on home technology in recent months. Intel made a series of relatively small deals last year, the results of which are too early to asses. Here’s a rundown: Itseez: A computer vision technology, like Mobileye, for self-driving cars and other autonomous technologies. Replay Technologies: Replay technology for wraparound, 360-degree views at big-time sporting events. Intel has featured this technology at major events, including last year’s Super Bowl. Ascending Technologies: Intel paired the German companies’ aerial drones with Intel’s own RealSense 3D cameras to give drones enhanced navigation capabilities. Drones remain a priority for Intel. Movidius: Like the Mobileye deal, this transaction gave Intel new computer vision technology — this time focused on aerial drones and virtual reality. Nervana: Pegged at $350 million, this acquisition gave Intel “machine learning” technology — enabling computers to observe the results of their actions and adjust to improve the results. Voke: Intel created a new sports group inside the company for Voke, whose technology is designed to stream sporting events for virtual reality.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 14, 2017 at 6:30PM Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has, for years, claimed that it has had a manufacturing lead over the rest of the industry. It has routinely asserted superior manufacturing technology density relative to its peers, and last year Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said at the 2016 stockholder meeting that he expected the company to maintain a sizable lead in the performance of its manufacturing technologies relative to competing technologies. To refresh your memory, here's what he said:  My commitment to you is that, yes, you can, as an investor, count on Intel having a clear manufacturing lead. You have to remember these measurements don't necessarily mean all the same thing and how people are measuring the 10-nanometers versus 14-nanometers is different. You really need to take a look at the performance of the devices and what's being delivered. And, so, we believe our 14-nanometer technology will still outperform any of the other technologies that'll be introduced in the next several years. Our 10-nanometer technology will again make another large leap in performance and be even further ahead than we think the 14-nanometer will be. However, a recent disclosure from rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) seems to suggest that Intel may soon lose its edge in chip manufacturing technology.  Image source: Intel. Samsung to ramp Gate-All-Around FETs in 2018 According to an article in DigiTimes, Samsung VP of Technology Ho-Kyu Kang told attendees of the China Semiconductor Technology International Conference (CSTIC) that it will be adopting a fundamentally new transistor structure for its 7-nanometer technology that it expects to be ready for volume production in 2018 called a gate-all-around (GAA) FET. In an interview with Semiconductor Engineering, Intel senior fellow Mark Bohr said, "GAA transistors provide better electrostatics than finFETs, which should allow for some additional gate length scaling." Those aren't Samsung's words -- they come from a key Intel technologist. Furthermore, from reading the entire article linked above, it seems that getting that technology ready for high-volume production is quite the challenge. Even if Samsung's 7-nano tech using this GAA structure is only ready for mass production by late 2018, that should still put it well ahead of Intel. Intel sticking with tried-and-true finFETs Intel has already disclosed that its upcoming 10-nanometer technology -- which it says will begin mass production late in 2017 for 2018 product shipments -- will continue to use the older finFET structure. Moreover, Semiconductor Engineering's sources confirmed back in February what I reported back in September  2016 -- that Intel's 7-nanometer technology, scheduled for high-volume production in 2020, will continue to use the finFET structure. What this seems to indicate is this: Intel has not only seen its lead with respect to chip manufacturing density erode (right now both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) are in mass production on their respective 10-nanometer technologies, both of which are denser than Intel's currently in production 14-nanometer technology), but it may be on the verge of seeing its leadership in transistor technology and materials science disappear as well. Indeed, Intel was the very first to transition to the finFET transistor structure back in late 2011 (the rest of the industry didn't start mass producing finFETs until 2015), but now it seems that as the rest of the industry transitions to the "next big thing" (gate-all-around FETs), Intel may be left scrambling to catch up.  Time for some clarity, Intel At this point, Intel needs to start providing shareholders with some real answers vis-a-vis chip manufacturing technology. The company avoided going into detail about this at its Feb. 9 investor meeting, but it has promised to host a separate day dedicated to manufacturing technology at some point in the first half of this year. Intel needs to make a compelling -- and intellectually honest -- case for why it believes it has a "leadership" position in manufacturing technology because right now things don't look good on its manufacturing front at all.

The sequel to last year's $2000 Tag Heuer Connected, the Connected Modular 45 is another beast of a smartwatch, with a huge 45mm face and a lot of Intel inside. And according to the Verge, even more Intel is coming to the watch later this year — in the form of a new, genderless artificially intelligent assistant. Image: Tag Heuer The Connected Modular 45 will already have Google's AI built-in, thanks to running Android Wear 2.0, but it's going to be powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor. According to Jerry Bautista, vice president of Intel's New Technology Group, that means the Connected Modular 45 should be able to run Intel's future virtual assistant. Bautista didn't give the Verge many details on the AI, and when reached by email, Intel declined to provide Gizmodo with any further information. We do know, at least, that it will have contextual responses like Siri and Google's AI, and it will supposedly be able to extrapolate and understand data provided by the smartwatch. The AI's personal details — which is to say, its lack of name or gender — are especially interesting, however. Apple, Amazon and other companies with digital AIs have faced some criticism for their decision to "feminise" their digital assistants. Even Google, who notably has given no human-like name to Google Assistant, still has the AI default to a feminine sounding voice. While studies show women and many men prefer the sound of a feminine voice when uttered by a robot it still remains puzzling, as scientists agree women's voices are no easier to understand than men's. Intel's decision to eschew gender in the pursuit of an AI almost feels like a radical departure as a consequence, and in our society, where gender is normally expressed in extremely binary ways, it will be curious to see how Intel expresses its AI's agender nature. What does an agender robot even sound like? Wall-E? Eve? Bender Bending Rodríguez? We won't know until the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45, which ships later this year, receives an update to include the new AI.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Apollo lake touchscreen mini PCs are coming soon 03/10/2017 at 5:37 PM by Brad Linder 13 Comments Over the past few years a group of Chinese manufacturers that had been making Android-powered TV boxes with ARM-based chips have started offering small, cheap Windows PCs powered by Intel chips. Then things took a turn for the weird in 2015, when some companies started adding touchscreens and batteries, blurring the lines between TV boxes, tiny desktops and tablets. Now it’s time for the 2017 refresh. Mini PC DB got the scoop on a new all-in-one mini PC with an 8 inch touchscreen display, Windows 10 software (or Ubuntu Linux), and an Intel Apollo Lake low-power processor. This particular model is coming from Shenzhen EC Technology and it’ll likely be sold under the company’s ECDREAM brand. But I suspect we’ll see a bunch of similar computers with Apollo Lake chips in the near future, because when one Chinese manufacturer does this, it usually means a bunch of others are already working on something similar. The ECDREAM model will reportedly be available with a choice of Intel Celeron N3350, Celeron N3450, or Pentium N4200 processors. Each model features Intel HD graphics with support for 4K video playback. Other features include support for up to 8GB of RAM, up to 128GB og eMMC and/or up to 128GB of M.2 SSD storage, Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, HDMI and VGA output, and five USB ports (one USB Type-C, two USB 3.0, and two USB 2.0). The display features a 1280 x 800 pixel IPS panel, and the system features a 10,000 mAh battery, which should let you unplug the computer and keep using it for at least a few hours at a time. According to Mini PC DB, the ECDREAM computer should be available in about a month for around $450.

This could be because a bitly user has reported a problem, a black-list service reported a problem, because the link has been shortened more than once, or because we have detected potentially malicious content. …. bitly suggests that you: (1) Change the original link, and re-shorten with bitly (2) Close your browser window (3) Notify the sender of the URL Also: Got a click-jacking attempt (noScript) when clicking on the “I’m not a robot”.

That’s the highest price ever paid to acquire an Israeli tech company — and also the highest paid for a self-driving tech company. To be more specific, as per the agreement, a subsidiary of Intel will be acquiring all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash (an equity value of around $15.3 billion, and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion). So, I guess that those wondering about the long-term prospects and strategies of Intel have their answer — Intel is banking on capturing a large market share in the self-driving vehicle and machine learning spaces. (Rival NVIDIA is of course pursuing a similar strategy as well.) The press release provides context: “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data, and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030. This transaction extends Intel’s strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that build on the company’s strengths in computing and connectivity from the cloud, through the network, to the device. …  ”The combined global autonomous driving organization, which will consist of Mobileye and Intel’s Automated Driving Group, will be headquartered in Israel and led by Prof. Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s Co-Founder, Chairman and CTO. The organization will support both companies’ existing production programs and build upon relationships with automotive OEMs, Tier-1 suppliers and semiconductor partners to develop advanced driving assist, highly autonomous, and fully autonomous driving programs. Intel Senior Vice President Doug Davis will oversee the combined organization’s engagement across Intel’s business groups and will report to Prof. Amnon Shashua after the transaction’s closing.” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich commented: “This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers. Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car’s path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” Interesting news — though, not completely surprising. Intel has been making overtures suggesting such a move in recent times. The acquisition is expected to be closed within the next 9 months according to the press release on the matter. Both of the companies’ Boards of Directors have approved the deal.

The $63.54-per-share cash deal marks the largest purchase of a company solely focused on the self-driving sector and could significantly alter the competitive landscape among key technology and systems suppliers, including chipmakers Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc. and systems integrator Delphi Automotive Plc. Mobileye's shares jumped 30 per cent to $61.3 in late morning US trading, while Intel's shares were down 2 per cent. Shares of Delphi, which has partnerships with both companies, were up 3 per cent. The deal underscores the expanding alliances between automakers and their suppliers as they race to develop self-driving cars, a concept that once seemed a science-fiction dream but is drawing closer to reality. While Intel is known for hardware chips and Mobileye for collision detection and mapping software, the merger promises to create an expanded portfolio of technologies needed for driverless vehicles. It also strengthens Intel's position in the sector against rival chipmakers Nvidia and Qualcomm. The Intel-Mobileye portfolio includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. "It's an area where [Intel] has had very little presence — the automotive market, and so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair," she added.   The offer represents a premium of about 33 per cent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday.

Now, the company's Sky X9E3 laptop really stretches the definition of what can be classified as a mobile device, packing a Intel Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K desktop processor, a pair of Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards in SLI, and support for up to five internal storage devices. Buyers can choose from three Intel seventh-generation Core i5 or Core i7 desktop processors. The CPU gets data from up to 64 GB of memory ensconced in four DDR4 SODIMM slots. Three NVMe M.2 drives and two 2.5" SATA drives can come along for the short ride from wall outlet to wall outlet. The big bruiser has a pair of Killer E2400 Gigabit Ethernet jacks along with three antennas for Wi-Fi connectivity. Eurocom lets buyers choose between Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 graphics cards, available singly or in SLI pairs. The graphics card (or cards) splatters pretty pictures on one of four different 17.3" displays, ranging from a rather pedestrian 1920x1080 unit with a 60 Hz refresh rate all the way to a 4K display with G-Sync. Interestingly, there's a middle-ground option at 2560x1440 with 120Hz refresh. If the onboard display doesn't pack enough pixels, the Sky X9E3 can connect to up to four external monitors via a pair of DisplayPort connectors, one HDMI jack, and one HDMI or USB 3.1 port. There are three methods for powering the machine: a single 330W power brick, a pair of 330W units with an additional converter box to tie them together, and a massive 780W charger that weighs 3 lbs (1.3 kg) all by itself. The laptop comes with an eight-cell 89 Wh battery, though given the desktop-class hardware and the specifications of the power bricks, the battery life probably isn't competing with Microsoft's Surface Book Pro. The Sky X9E3 is available now with prices starting around $2300 with a Core i5 processor, GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card, 16 GB of DDR4 memory, and a 1 TB hard drive. Buyers might also need to spring for a new laptop bag to hold the machine's bulky dimensions of 17.1" x 12.3" x 1.9" (or 43 cm x 31 cm x 4.7 cm) and and 12.1 lb (5.5 kg) weight. Eurocom didn't say if that figure includes the aforementioned giant power brick. Tags: Graphics Systems Mobile computing Gaming Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous-vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. Last October, Qualcomm announced a US$47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about US$3 billion in 2015 to US$96 billion in 2025 and US$290 billion in 2035. Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German carmaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. Sceptics have questioned whether car companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Analysts raised concerns on Monday about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, cloud software and data fusion and management. "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Loop Capital Markets analyst Betsy Van Hees. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair." Still, industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors wrote on Monday that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise". The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet's Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car". Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assistance systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. Founded in 1999, Mobileye accounts for 70 per cent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German carmaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye had also partnered systems integrator Delphi Automotive, which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems.

What makes this Siri competitor special according to the chipmaker is the fact that it is genderless.  Intel’s New Technology Group VP Jerry Bautista said at the launch event that Intel is preparing a genderless digital assistant for the andro that will arrive later this year. Though Bautista did not expound on how this genderless nature would be possible, he did drop a few details about the AI assistant. It is said to be smart enough to adjust reminders based on the user’s current activities. Like if one is staying up late at work, the AI will move the home reminders to a later time when the user has already left work. It will also be capable of extrapolating and answering follow-up questions like Google’s Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri. Lastly, it will not have a name, as first reported by The Verge.  Tag Heuer’s new smartwatch actually runs Android Wear 2.0, so it already has Google Assistant built-it. Hence, it isn’t clear why Intel is creating a smart assistant for the device. However, Bautista says Intel is going to differentiate its own AI assistant from rivals by making it smarter in its own way. Intel’s decision to come up with a genderless AI assistant could be met with positive responses from consumers. According to Gizmodo, Apple, Amazon and other companies that have their own digital assistants have gotten some criticism and faced backlash from people who are questioning their decision to use the feminine voice and names for their technology. And though Google chose to have a simple and non-human name for its assistant, it still utilizes a female voice for its digital aide.  Tag Heuer’s Connected Modular 45 smartwatch is powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor. It comes with 1.39-inch 400 x 400 AMOLED display, a modular design and a battery that can last up to 30 hours on paper. The device also features Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC and GPS connectivity. The timepiece starts at $1,600 and is scheduled to start shipping later this year — no specific date given yet.  Related Stories Intel Venturing Into Self-Driving Technology TAG Heuer Connected 2 Debuting Next Week Microsoft Debuts Revamped Cortana; Now Better Than Apple’s Siri?

After Arrow revealed plans to follow up on its Qualcomm-backed DragonBoard 410C SBC with three more Linux ready, open spec 96Boards SBCs, one of the boards — the Chameleon96 — has been detailed on RocketBoards.org. The Cyclone V based, 85 x 54mm Chameleon96, which is the first 96Boards form factor SBC to include an FPGA, was also announced by SecureRF, which is offering its quantum-resistant cryptography technology on the board (see farther below). Chameleon96 (click image to enlarge) We have more details on the Chamelon below. The two other Arrow boards, which have yet to be fully documented, are the Meerkat and the Oxalis. The Meerkat runs Linux on a dual-core, Cortex-A7 NXP i.MX7D, which also includes a Cortex-M4 MCU, and offers an Arduino-ready mezzanine add-on board. Like the Chamelon96, the DragonBoard 410C, and most other 96Boards offerings, the Meerkat is a Consumer Edition board with 40-pin low-speed and 60-pin high-speed expansion connectors. The upcoming Oxalis board is a larger 96Boards Enterprise Edition (EE) board, such as the AMD A1100 based Lemaker Cello. The Oxalis taps NXP’s single, 800MHz Cortex-A53 based QorIQ LS1012A, which is billed as the world’s smallest 64-bit ARM SoC. 96Boards EE is typically aimed at higher end server operations, but the Oxalis is “optimized for battery-backed or USB-powered, space-constrained networking and IoT applications,” says Arrow. No OS support was listed, but Linux is the typical install on LS1012A boards. Last June, Arrow joined with eInfochips to announce a $279 SD 600eval board based on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 600. This was rumored to be originally called the DragonBoard 600. A product page is still posted on the eInfochips website, and Arrow has a shopping page, but it’s still listed as out of stock. The board was notable for being the first to comply with the 100 x 85mm Extended version of the 96Boards CE spec.   Chameleon96 The Chameleon96 runs Debian Linux on a Cyclone V SE SoC from Intel PSG (Programmable Solutions Group), the new post-acquisition name for its Altera FPGA unit. The SoC, which like the Xylinx Zynq-7000 combines dual 800MHz Cortex-A9 cores with an FPGA subsystem, can be found on boards such as iWave’s iW-RainboW-G17D module. It offers lesser FPGA powers (110K LEs) than Intel PSG’s newer, dual-A9 based Arria 10 SoC, and far less ARM and FPGA performance than its quad-core Cortex-A53-based Stratix 10. Chameleon96 block diagram (click image to enlarge) Interestingly, the Chameleon96’s video processing, based on Intel Video Suite for FPGA, uses the FPGA subsystem rather than the ARM subsystem. It can drive 60fps 1080p streams via HDMI and encode such video via a two-lane MIPI-CSI camera interface. The use of the FPGA fabric for video processing “allows development of custom IPU/GPU/VPU solutions,” says Arrow. Chameleon96 detail views (click images to enlarge) The Chameleon96 ships with 512MB of DDR3 SDRAM, with optional 1GB, linked to the ARM Hard Processor System (HPC). Other ARM-linked I/O includes a microSD slot, a serial UART interface, a warm reset button, and 4x user LEDs. You will also find a micro-USB OTG port and two USB 2.0 host ports, but you can’t use the OTG and host ports at the same time. An audio interface supports PCM/AAC+/MP3/WMA, ECNS, plus optional Audio+ post-processing. The FPGA subsystem provides the HDMI output, as well as a wireless module that includes 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1, backed up by antennas and dual LEDs. There’s also a micro-USB connected USB Blaster II JTAG cable. Both subsystems connect to the low- and high-speed connectors, although in the latter category, the only FPGA-linked interface is the MIPI-CSI2 interface. This is said to be the sole 96Boards non-standard component on the board. The low-speed connector provides UART, SPI, I2C, I2S, and GPIO, while the high-speed offers USB 2.0 host, SPI, I2C, and GPIO, as well as MIPI CSI-2. A 12V DC input is provided, and there’s also an Altera Enpirion PowerSoC power management chip. The board can be made compatible with Arduino using an add-on mezzanine board, one of a growing list of 96Boards mezzanines that are now available.   SecureRF’s quantum resistant cryptography The Chameleon96 board’s FPGA subsystem is also home to SecureRF’s quantum-resistant Ironwood Key Agreement Protocol and Walnut DSA Digital Signature Algorithm reference design. These Public Key methods are specifically designed for reduced footprint, low-energy IoT deployments.

This results in dramatically faster large-scale analytics and transactions without significantly increasing development and management overhead. Get the GridGain White Paper. Intel has agreed to acquire Mobileye, a developer of autonomous vehicle technology, for US$15.3 billion in cash, the companies announced Monday. Intel will integrate Mobileye's computer vision and mapping technology for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles into its Automated Driving Group, to be led by MobileEye CTO Amnon Shashua. Intel SVP Doug Davis will oversee engagement across various Intel groups, and report directly to Shashua. The combined company will be the leading technology provider in the autonomous vehicle industry, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told Wall Street analysts in a Monday conference call. "We believe this combination will accelerate this auto industry innovation by delivering the world class edge-to-edge solutions at a much lower cost [and] faster time to market," he said. Lucrative Market The market for the vehicle systems, data and services market will reach more than $70 billion by the year 2030, Intel has estimated. The agreement extends Intel's strategy to invest in data-intensive opportunities that build on its strengths in cloud computing and connectivity to devices. Autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day by 2020, the company estimated, creating large-scale opportunities for Intel Xeon processors, EyeQ4 and EyeQ5 SoCs, high-performance FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), memory, high-bandwidth connectivity and computer vision technology. The acquisition will be accretive to earnings and cash flow immediately, and it will be funded with cash from its balance sheet, Intel said. The deal has been approved by both companies' boards of directors. Mobileye, founded in 1999, is one of the world's leading suppliers of computer vision solutions for advanced driver assist systems, with more than 16 million cars worldwide using its EyeQ chips. The company had revenue of $358 million in 2016 and non-GAAP net income of $173 million, or 73 cents a share. The Mobileye name and brand will remain intact, except for a slight logo change to reflect the Intel integration, Shashua and Mobileye CEO Ziv Aviram said in a memo to employees. The company's relationships with OEM customers, Tier 1 partners and STMicro, its EyeQ roadmap and its after-market division operations, will not be interrupted. The acquisition strengthens Intel's aim to become a major supplier to the semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicle market, building upon its initial acquisition of Wind River from 2009, according to Jack Nerad, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book. Wind River's embedded devices are used in vehicle infotainment and telematics, which are key building blocks in semi-autonomous driving, he said. "Intel sees vehicle computing as a growth area at a time when its desktop and laptop opportunities may have peaked," Nerad told the E-Commerce Times. Other Relationships Intel and Mobileye have been working with BMW on self-driving cars, making theirs one of a dozen or so ventures involving technology firms with automakers, Nerad noted. The three companies announced an agreement in January at the Consumer Electronics Show to begin testing a fleet of 40 autonomous vehicles by the second half of 2017. The cars will feature Intel Go solutions for autonomous vehicles, including Xeon processors, Intel Arria 10 FPGAs and Intel solid state drives. BMW last month entered a deal to use Mobileye's road experience management technology to crowdsource mapping information for BMW's 2018 vehicles equipped with advanced driver assist system technology. The pace of consolidation in the autonomous vehicle industry could have a limited impact on competition down the road, as various teams work on their own unique sets of technologies, observed Steven Polzin, director of mobility policy research at the University of South Florida's Center for Urban Transportation Research. "It also begs the question of the relative merits of retaining a competitive and arguably creative set of players versus the consequence that new knowledge will not necessarily be shared," he told the E-Commerce Times, "perhaps delaying the pace of innovation and/or introducing the inefficiency of duplicative learning experiences."

When the $15.3 billion, all-cash deal closes later this year, Mobileye will become an Intel subsidiary in a self-driving technology market that the chipmaker believes could grow to $70 billion by 2030. The deal was generally well-received among analysts, who said the merger should put Intel ahead of the pack in the race to develop the critical components for safe and reliable self-driving cars. Some, however, said that Mobileye has fundamental problems that Intel will have to resolve to make its investment pay off long term. However, both Intel and Mobileye hailed the deal, saying they can work collaboratively toward improving self-driving car technology well into the future. 2 of 12 What Intel Is Buying According to the companies, Intel will acquire Mobileye for $15.3 billion in cash it already has on its balance sheet. The deal has been approved by the boards at both companies. Upon completion, Mobileye will merge with Intel’s Automated Driving Group and be led by Prof. Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chairman. 3 of 12 Why Intel Made the Acquisition In a statement, Intel said it is acquiring Mobileye to expand its presence in the automated car business. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he believes the combined company can create a highly desirable “cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” 4 of 12 Why Mobileye Signed the Deal It’s easy to say Mobileye signed the deal to cash in on its development efforts to date, but it goes beyond that. Mobileye CEO Ziv Aviram said the Intel buy will dramatically ramp up its efforts in mapping, data centers and computing platforms, among other technologies. 5 of 12 Intel Sees a Huge Market Opportunity Intel believes the Mobileye buy is a sound investment. The company says the self-driving car market could grow to $70 billion by 2030, and it believes its solutions, with Mobileye’s inclusion, could nab a sizable chunk of that revenue. 6 of 12 Diversification to Give Intel New Look Several analysts wrote in research notes to investors March 13 that Intel’s acquisition signals a change in the company’s makeup. While Intel is still heavily involved in building processors, it’s also trying to diversify its business. The Mobileye underscores the diversity in the company’s business model. 7 of 12 Mobileye Focusing on Next-Generation Technology Mobileye is focused on car technology and next-generation technologies that could complement that. For instance, it has a technology called Road Experience Management that features sharable, high-definition maps for car fleets. It also is working on cloud-based tools for car localization and navigation technology. 8 of 12 A Sign of Things to Come? In an interview with The New York Times March 13, Gartner analyst Martin Birkner said the Intel acquisition could kick off an arms race in the self-driving car market as other prominent companies look to make strategic acquisitions in this field. While Birkner didn’t point to any specific deals, he believes consolidation will happen rather quickly. 9 of 12 Some Negative Implications Not everyone is so sure that the deal makes sense. In fact, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry told investors in a note March 13 that Mobileye is a potential problem for Intel because of massive research and development costs and so far no return on Mobileye's investments. He believes “Intel has now inherited Mobileye’s problems,” but won't be able to fix those problems. Analyst group Semiconductor Advisors noted the acquisition might prove to be “a small incremental net negative” for Intel’s revenue and profit figures. 10 of 12 Intel Won't Close the Deal for at Least Nine Months Don’t expect this deal to close anytime soon. Intel said in a statement it believes the deal will require nine months for the companies to get regulatory approval. In the meantime, they will both operate independently and will not share resources. 11 of 12 How the Deal Affects the Self-Driving Car Market Looking ahead, the market may be affected in dramatic ways. Intel now may be slightly ahead in self-driving car technology, putting its chief rivals Nvidia and Qualcomm on notice. Several analysts believe Nvidia and Qualcomm will respond by boosting their investments in self-driving cars. 12 of 12 10 Reasons the Samsung Galaxy S8 Will Be a Hot-Selling Smartphone Samsung has scheduled a media briefing on March 29 to introduce its Galaxy S8 smartphone, which is predicted to have the latest Qualcomm 835 processor.

Mobileye shares trading in New York were poised to surge more than 30% on the news. × Intel buys Israeli self-driving car firm for $15 billion Intel is snapping up self-driving car firm Mobileye in a deal worth $15.3 billion. The chipmaker confirmed the acquisition Monday, March 13, 2017, saying it will pay $63.54 per share in cash for the Israeli tech firm. Mobileye shares trading in New York were poised to surge more than 30% on the news. LONDON (CNNMoney) — Intel is snapping up self-driving car firm Mobileye in a deal worth $15.3 billion. The chipmaker confirmed the acquisition Monday, saying it will pay $63.54 per share in cash for the Israeli tech firm. Mobileye shares in New York soared 29% to $61.20 in midday trade, while Intel stock was down more than 2%. “Together we expect to be the global leader in autonomous driving,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on a call with investors following the announcement of the deal. Jerusalem-based Mobileye has already been working with Intel and BMW to develop a fully autonomous, self-driving vehicle. The company is a leader in collision prevention sensors that alert drivers if a pedestrian is in the road, or if they’re approaching another car too quickly. The technology uses artificial vision sensors placed in the cars, which Mobileye says act like a “driver’s third eye.” By 2030, Intel expects the vehicle systems, data and services space to be a $70 billion market. Mobileye was founded in 1999. Its technology helps cars navigate on and off ramps independently and even pass other vehicles without input from a human driver. It employs about 660 people. The company says that more than 10 million vehicles worldwide are equipped with its technology. Mobileye offices in the U.S., China, Germany and Japan. The deal is expected to close within the next nine months, subject to regulatory approvals, and boost Intel’s earnings right away. Tech companies have been heavily investing in the auto industry and racing to develop self-driving cars, including Alphabet’s Google, Tesla and Uber, which bought autonomous truck company Otto last year.

Most of those answers, however, won’t be terribly favorable opinions regarding the deal. Source: Shutterstock Either the iconic chipmaker overpaid for Mobileye shares, or Intel has no business leaving its comfort zone (CPUs and chipsets), or both. Besides, long-term INTC owners know the company doesn’t have the best track record when it comes to making acquisitions. There’s a certain “crazy like a fox” quality to this purchase, though. Intel stock holders may want to take a step back and look at the same long-term picture CEO Brian Krzanich is seeing. Not Optimistic On Monday, tech-giant Intel announced it was acquiring Mobileye — the maker of the “eyes” used by self-driving and auto-braking automobiles — for $63.54 per share of MBLY, or $15.3 billion in all. That’s a 45% premium to Friday’s closing trade! But perhaps more concerning is that at $15.3 billion, Intel will be paying 42.7 times last year’s sales and 141.7 times 2016’s income from Mobileye. Both are on the order of ten times the norm. Analysts were mixed on the matter, although a few were particularly optimistic. Perhaps the most bullish view came from Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann, who explained: “Intel is seeking relevance in automotive with the Mobileye acquisition in a market that is moving at a faster-than-expected pace. The acquisition is in line with the Altera acquisition in that it is defensive in nature and meant to defend Intel’s historical CPU (central processing unit) incumbency from various accelerator technologies.” At the more pessimistic end of the scale, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry opined: “Basically, Intel has now inherited Mobileye’s problems, and we don’t think Intel has the capacity to fix Mobileye’s issues.” All those views may be too short-sighted, however. What Intel Sees in Mobileye Krzanich justified the decision to INTC shareholders by saying: “It’s important now, because if you take a look at what you’re doing – talking about car models in 2020, 2021 – and so we need to get in there. We need to get this platform developed, brought to them, and have that confidence so that we can really influence the real start of autonomous driving in that time frame.” He’s right, in all ways. He’s right in the sense that although self-driving cars aren’t exactly new, the market isn’t gelled yet — there’s room for new players to step up and shape what the future of autonomous driving looks like. Better for Intel to shape it on its terms then end up chasing the lead pace set by the likes of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). He’s also right in the sense that by 2020/2021, the landscape of the self-driving car market is going to look radically different. Not only will the market leaders be well-entrenched by then, there’s going to massive growth in the number of autonomous cars on the road by that time. How massive? BCG recently crunched some numbers, concluding that by 2035 annual sales of fully autonomous vehicles will reach 12 million. Annual sales of partially-autonomous cars will rise to 18 million by that point. Investors won’t have to wait that long to see big-time growth, though. BCG thinks the market will be worth $42 billion by 2025, and grow to $77 billion by 2035. At the end of the timeframe, roughly a fourth of all new cars sold will offer autonomous driving features.

Name: Subject: Message: New Balance RunIQ and PaceIQ review by David Imel2 days ago 7.9 183 4 A fitness watch and headphone combo that offer great hardware and high price tags Rating Full Article Comments 299.99 Buy at Amazon Positives 5ATM water resistance Solid battery life Stylish yet durable design Solid GPS tracking in Strava Negatives Occasionally laggy and buggy Buttons not programmable No Android Wear 2.0 yet MyNB app is basically a big New Balance advertisement Rating Battery 8.1 Display 8.2 Performance 7.1 Software 7.2 Design 8.8 Bottom Line 7.9 7.9 RunIQ and PaceIQ by New Balance The New Balance RunIQ provides a solid Android Wear and fitness watch experience at a premium price, but lacks the recent Android Wear 2.0 update and can experience lag and stuttering when utilizing more than a couple sensors. The PaceIQ are a decent pair of Bluetooth earphones that cost more than they should and lack bass. Fitness watches – they’re what many wearables have migrated towards since the inception of the technology, as they can provide us useful information and metrics such as heart rate, step count, and now even reps from your weights. While we’ve seen a steady development in the functionality of this hardware, much of the core components have remained the same. Battery technology has gotten slightly better over the last couple years, but that is mainly due to software, not hardware. So what does one watch offer over the many, many others available on the market? Often it will be slightly custom software, sometimes an extra button, but most of the time, it is a minor tweak to both these things. So what has New Balance, a shoe company, done to make their watch stand out? There’s quite a lot going on here, from the specialized hardware buttons to the sensors made to track your body to a super finite degree. With a built-in GPS, optical heart rate monitor, a solid water resistance rating, and integrated Strava running software, there is a lot to like here. Since it runs Android Wear, you still get all the same benefits of the OS, including the ability to download music directly onto your watch. So does the RunIQ warrant its high $300 price tag? What about New Balance’s PaceIQ fitness earbuds? Find out in our full New Balance RunIQ and PaceIQ review! See also: Best fitness trackers 4 days ago Design There’s no doubting that New Balance is aiming this watch at the sports/fitness crowd here. It has a relatively large 1.39-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 400 x 400 that shows up great in direct sunlight, and doesn’t need a separate proximity sensor to dim the screen when you don’t need it. The pixel density comes in at 287ppi, so while you’re obviously not going to get smartphone resolution on this thing, it is still more than decent for a smartwatch. It doesn't feel a huge amount larger than a traditional sports watch Though relatively thick, it doesn’t feel a huge amount larger than a traditional sports watch. Quite honestly, there are a number of traditional watches that are much more hefty than this thing, even with all the included internals and sensors. The bezel raises slightly from the surface of the touchscreen, likely to protect it from getting smashed if you trip while on a run. The casing is made of a hard plastic which feels very solid for what it is, and would likely only come away with a number of scratches and scuffs if you were to land on it directly. Though, if this were the case, your wrist would likely be in a lot more trouble than your watch. Unfortunately, the three physical buttons aren't reprogrammable There are three buttons attached to the right side of the device, each with varied functionality. While it would have been nice to be able to be able to reprogram these to your own liking, New Balance it really pushing running functionality with the watch. A quick tap of the top button will instantly launch Strava, which is interestingly built right into the watch, with no separate app “technically” required on your phone in order to view current metrics, though you will have to download the full Strava app in order to see your route and historical data. This app in particular is full-fledged, with four different screens showing distance, time, BPM, steps, and a lap counter. There are also music controls built in here, which syncs with Google Play Music to play whatever tracks or playlist you run to best. The center lug essentially works as a ‘back’ button, returning you to previous screens without the need to swipe applications away. This will also turn on and off the screen depending on if you’re sitting on the watch face home screen. You can also hold the button while on the home screen to open up the app menu, where you will be able to select the local apps that have custom functionality with Android Wear. There isn’t much functionality past this, but it is another method of interactive with the watch if you would prefer not to swipe around the display. Don't miss: Best Android Wear watches 1 week ago The bottom button controls playback of music. When you tap it, you get the option to play music either on the watch, or from your phone. Since you can store music files locally on the watch itself, there becomes very little need to actually take your phone with you on runs. The manufacturer says you should be able to store up to 50 hours of music locally on the device, meaning you should be able to load up all your favorite playlists to take with you on your favorite trails. While this is a feature embedded into Android Wear itself and not part of the watch, it is still quite useful, especially for a watch that is so focused on running. The top of the watch features stationary time markers, which more or less align with the marks on an analog Android Wear watch face, but prove a bit redundant since this is already provided on the screen. This is more than likely provided solely for the aesthetic of the device, and we’re not necessarily complaining that it is included. One of the best parts of the RunIQ's design is the strap One of my favorite parts of the RunIQ’s design is the strap. The included watch strap is a soft rubber one, which has an incredibly high amount of cutouts to be locked into place. Since the rubber is relatively stretchy, in combination with the super high amount of cutouts, it is extremely easy to get a good fit. Never once did I feel that I was forced to wear the watch too loosely or too tightly around my wrist – it always seemed to fit just right. The rubber also makes it so those who sweat during intense workouts will not have to worry about damaging the device. These bands are interchangeable, so you should be able to swap it out with a color that matches your style. The model we have for review was black on black, and while I personally think that it is the most understated and professional color available, some may want to swap it out for one of the other colorful options offered by the company. The bottom of the device reveals the heart rate sensor which flashes green while active, as well as the inductive charging plates which magnetically attach to the included charger. I’m personally a big fan of the way this device charges. The magnets hold the watch to the charger quite securely so it won’t fall off from a bump, but you can still grab the watch and go without the need of any locking/unlocking mechanism. The watch's charger is very well designed While some watches like the Moto 360 offer angled charging docks that allow you to use your watch as a bedside clock as you sleep, the security and strength of the magnets in this device make it feel more secure on my desk. The 410mAh battery charges pretty darn quickly, so you should be able to get a solid charge out of the device if you’re only home for a shower and have to run out again. The watch is rated for waterproofing up to 5ATM, so while you shouldn’t go deep sea diving with this thing, it will do fine for casual swimming and running in the rain. With Apple touting the ability to swim with the Watch Series 2 as one of its primary features, we think it’s important to mention that quite a lot of watches with waterproofing exist, and the New Balance RunIQ is just one of those options. Features and performance One of the most marketed features of the New Balance RunIQ is that is was developed in partnership with Intel. It uses an Intel Atom Z34XX to compute all of that data from the sensors as well as run the OS, and while such a big name demands big performance, we did notice a number of issues when using some of the more data intensive parts of the watch. When doing simple things like notification mirroring and music playback, the watch worked just fine, smoothly informing me of all those Allo messages (don’t hate) and emails I get on a daily basis. Related: Best GPS running watches 4 weeks ago Strava on the RunIQ is pretty glitchy The biggest performance strain I experienced presented itself when I launched the integrated Strava app, which is completely confined to the watch, though you can sync this data with the Strava app on your phone. For the most part, Strava offers the functionality and metrics you’re likely to use while on a run. While I would say that the app works pretty flawlessly while using it, backing out to the home screen while the app is paused caused the device to freeze up, and then start opening other apps and features at random. I had to just let the watch die before I could use it again at this point, as it was launching and closing Strava over and over again without me pressing anything. While this could just be some random bug that I encountered in the semi-custom software that New Balance has running on top of Android Wear, I think the 512MB of RAM in tandem with the Atom Z34XX SoC on board the device is not quite enough to store all the services that are accessed when using the application. The Strava app in particular launches the watch’s on-board GPS, heart rate sensor, and pedometer all at the same time. Intel’s Atom Z34XX chip is made to be able to handle all of these sensors on the fly, though it is seldom that devices utilizing the SoC will use all these services at one time, and may take some more tweaking or require more voltage in order to perform the necessary calculations. I can’t say that the performance issues I experienced were all due to Intel or the New Balance team, but I can say that this thing needs just a bit more power in order to utilize all its sensors to the required level. The only other major performance issue I encountered had to do with the speed at which the watch mirrored notifications. I’ve owned a 1st Generation Moto 360 since it launched way back in 2014, and I’ll sometimes feel the watch buzz with a notification before I even see my phone light up. The RunIQ did not offer quite the same experience in my testing. Often it would be one to two full seconds after my phone received the notification that the watch would alert me of the same thing. While this is not a huge issue for a lot of users, seeing the information on my phone’s lock screen before my watch received the same message created a redundancy which was more annoying than anything. I have to assume this issue is due to whatever Bluetooth module the company has opted to use in the device, but one can never be too sure with these things. Just know that in my personal experience, this issue did exist, so if instant notification mirroring is a make-or-break feature for you, you may want to look elsewhere. LG Watch Sport and Watch Style review Which smartwatches will get updated to Android Wear 2.0? The RunIQ runs Android Wear, so you have access to all the features that come along with that software. New Balance’s offing is currently slated to receive the Android Wear 2.0 update that many have been fawning over since LG released the Watch Sport and Style last month, but the device is currently running the older Android Wear version 1.5. Of course, the consumer-ready version of Android Wear 2.0 was just released a couple weeks ago, so we know this device couldn’t have launched with it out of the box. Still, it’d be nice to see a brand new Android Wear watch running the latest version of Google’s smartwatch OS. If you’re wondering about battery life, New Balance says you can expect to get 24 hours out of this thing with normal use, or about five hours of active GPS usage. While I obviously didn’t go running for 5 hours to test this because I am a technology journalist, the regular usage I experienced actually surpassed the 24 hour mark. I was generally seeing about 30 hours or so on each charge, and that is actually with the ‘always on’ display feature enabled. That is pretty impressive coming from a 410mAh battery, and proves that Intel’s Atom Z34XX chip can be quite efficient when it wants to be. That said, efficiency and performance are almost mutually exclusive factors, and caused the performance issues that we discussed earlier. Software The New Balance PaceIQ runs Android Wear. This is essentially the same software across a number of different watches, but there are a few small tweaks including additional built-in software among other things. The RunIQ in particular has a full blown Strava app built right in, which utilizes the built-in GPS, heart rate sensor, pedometer, and more to give you the most accurate information possible regarding your run. I tested this app multiple times, and have to admit I had more issues with it than I would have liked. While the activity the app actually tracks is chock full of metrics and useful information, it really is hit or miss right now whether the app will tell you the activity was tracked or not. I ran with just the watch on five separate occasions, and three of these times the watch told me that I did not have enough GPS coordinates to be tracked. Initially I thought this may have been due to the fact that I didn’t have the Strava app downloaded on my phone, but then I continued to have occasional issues. The activity was actually tracked on my phone even if it said it wasn’t though, so this seems more like a minor software bug. That being said, the paths tracked on Strava were quite accurate, so it seems the onboard GPS does do quite well when it works. I did a couple of factory resets and the GPS seemed to work better after that point, but the fact that it is randomly buggy still needs to be said. Hopefully these issues will be fixed with the Android Wear 2.0 update, but we will have to wait and see if that is the case. Requiring the Strava and New Balance apps for your phone did leave me a little frustrated, though. New Balance markets this watch as if you don’t need your phone at all, but that’s really not the case. While you can’t exactly view all of your intricate metrics about your run on a small screen like this, it still felt like I was tracking a lot of this information for no reason if I didn’t have the Strava mobile app. I would have liked if you could at least view historical data about your runs on the watch, but it seems that they only optimized it to be able to view what is going on in the moment. The in-app music browser worked well for switching songs and adjusting the volume, but the tracks listed stopped reflecting what was actually playing past the first song. I first noticed this when Maneater by Hall and Oates started playing and I wanted to turn it up. I tried skipping back and forth between different music and jumping in and out of the music browser, but the watch never updated with the current song. This was also probably a minor bug and will hopefully be fixed in the future. New Balance does offer an app for your smartphone, the MyNB app, which allows you to sync a lot of the data from the watch to your device. The app will ask all about you: what sports you are into, your gender, birthday, and even what kind of clothes you wear. I found this a bit invasive, as they are obviously trying to figure out how to best market your apparel, but you can skip this step entirely, so don’t fret too much if you would prefer not to answer these questions. From here, you can read a huge amount of content related to running and fitness, and can spend “New Balance points” on new clothes and shoes. The navigation in the app is actually pretty great, and uses smooth animations to get you where you need to go. While it’s obvious that this was originally designed as a shopping app, the company has gone ahead and slid RunIQ integration right into it, which in my opinion is probably better than making a whole separate app to bog down the Play Store. The app will prompt you to connect your Strava account to the watch, and for some reason is required to get Strava working on the watch itself. The app will get a lot of documentation detailing how to use the watch, and you can also modify things like the color theme and distance information shown on the face of the watch on the fly, though that is essentially all it does for you besides being a New Balance shopping app. The MyNB app is basically a big New Balance advertisement What is most frustrating about the MyNB app is the fact that you need to have it installed for setup of Strava on your RunIQ. Besides being able to change a few colors on the watch and connect your Strava account, the app is essentially used completely for shopping. After you connect Strava through this app you can essentially get rid of it, but it seems incredibly cumbersome that you should be forced to install a standalone app that does almost nothing. After this you can download Strava and use that like normal, but why should you have to use a separate app to use Strava? Since this is Android Wear, you would think you would be able to use Strava like on any other smartwatch, but New Balance seems to think forcing the MyNB app is a better way to sell its shoes and accessories. Of course, if Strava isn’t your thing, you can always use one of the many other fitness apps available for Android. This is Android Wear after all, so if you like, you can make use of Runtastic or Endomondo as well. Yes, New Balance has partnered with Strava for this particular watch and if you don’t use it the top lug on the unit is essentially useless, but you do you. Other apps will work just fine. New Balance PaceIQ earbuds While the RunIQ smartwatch can be purchased on its own, the company designed it in tandem with the PaceIQ earbuds. These are Bluetooth earbuds that were designed with Jabra, and are actually based on the the Jabra Sport Pace. See also: Jabra Sport Pace Wireless review There is a button on the side of the left ear bud that will give you statistics from your watch, so you’ll never have to look down to get all the statistics while on your run, which is a great feature considering focusing on anything except your path is pretty dangerous when running. Unfortunately, pushing a button that goes directly into your ear is a bit uncomfortable, and you do have to exert a decent amount of force into your ear before the button actually clicks. As far as sound quality goes, the headphones are pretty decent. The mids and highs were especially good, but the bass and lows left quite a bit to be desired. Especially for a set of headphones designed specifically for running, you would think the company would want to make bass an integral part of the design, but I didn’t particularly feel that was the case here. Perhaps with a decent equalizer you could get a good mix out of these things, but I feel they should emit these frequencies right out of the box for those that want to just grab them and go. New Balance says you should be able to get about five hours of playback time out of these things, but from the testing I did, it was more accurate to say I got around four. Calls through the headset will definitely drain the battery a bit faster due to activating the on-board microphone, but they sounded fine. I would say that these things are a bit quiet, so if you’re in a busy coffee shop you probably won’t be able to hear the person you are talking to very well, but if you are just out for a run or walk they should do ok. In terms of shape, these things are great. When I originally put them on, I had the absolute hardest time getting them to fit correctly. I realized a bit later that I was attempting to wear them completely wrong though, so make sure you actually read the manual and see how to get the best fit. They come with four different sets of buds to get the best fit with your ear, so you can change those out and decide which set you like. The hoop that goes around your ear is protective enough to keep them from falling out of your ears, but is also not obstructive to the point where it puts pressure on your ears. I generally can’t wear regular buds without some sort of fastening to my ears since I have particularly slippery insides (you probably didn’t need to know that), but the hoops keep them on safely and securely. There is also a small plastic clip which is used to keep extra wire from flinging around while on a run, and I feel that this is an absolutely essential accessory. It is very small and extremely easy to lose however, so I would have liked for New Balance to have the clip hang off the headphones themselves or something of that caliber in order to keep them safe. I haven’t lost mine, but I could absolutely see how that would be the case, especially with someone that isn’t good at keeping track of their technology. Should you buy one (or both)? The New Balance RunIQ comes in at $299.99 USD, which is a bit of a steep price to pay for something that doesn’t necessarily offer a ton more features over something older like the Moto 360 Sport. This watch really does feel premium, however. Even if the lugs on the side of the watch don’t function like that on a traditional sports watch, they still give off that “premium” look that have demanded such an inflated cost from traditional watches over the years. The extremely adjustable and customizable band also gives you the option of letting the world know you’re a fitness junkie or looking a bit more professional. Buy the New Balance RunIQ Buy the New Balance PaceIQ earbuds There are some caveats that keep me from recommending this thing whole-heatedly, though. The biggest one being that it’s feature with the biggest focus feels a bit lacking. For a fitness watch that is marketed as completely separate from your smartphone, it should not require a device application to actually record and view historical data. It would be nice to be able to view and compare your old runs on the watch itself, as though the Strava and MyNB smartphone apps are extremely well made, they should not be required for someone that doesn’t want to have their phone on them all the time. Performance and bugginess are the RunIQ's main issues The other major issue for me is performance. While Intel’s Atom Z34XX chip gave me faith that the company really knows how to do efficiency, I think that that chip needed to be clocked higher to produce the performance needed for a device like this. This would have needed a bigger battery if that was the case, and while it almost seems like a joke to be asking for a bigger battery at this point, smartwatch battery capacities have essentially not improved whatsoever since their introduction in 2014. Looking at this from the perspective of purely being a piece of fitness tech, there is quite a bit to like here. It has all the bells and whistles you’re probably going to need for running and other exercise, but the integrated GPS has issues displaying data on the device itself, though this may be a minor software bug for now. The heart rate monitor and pedometer work great, but is that enough to make it this a great fitness watch? It’s comfortable and water resistant, can be used anywhere, and should last long enough to track the entirety of almost any workout, so those are positives that do give this thing a bit of desirable characteristics. With all that being said, should you buy one, even if only for the fitness tracking it provides? At the moment, my answer is no. If this thing had launched alongside the Moto 360 Sport, I would be much more inclined to say yes. The New Balance RunIQ is effectively a more premium version of that watch with a few more bells and whistles, and for someone who may have wanted the best of the best at the time, this would have been it. Unfortunately, by the time this thing actually launched the market was much more inflated with other options that can do the same things to the same caliber or better at a price that can either match or beat it. The New Balance PaceIQ spells a very similar story for the brand. Coming in at $109.99 USD, they fall into a very similar pricing structure as something like the Jaybird X2s or X3s. And while they offer a great fit and nice battery life, they really don’t have any one ‘killer’ feature that would make me drop my X2s and pick them up. If you have the watch, they do offer functionality that you won’t be able to get from any other headphones, but is this something that you absolutely need? The New Balance RunIQ and PaceIQ are very capable pieces of hardware that offer many of the same features as competing technology on the market, but don’t offer any ‘killer features’ that make them worth the price the company is asking. If you’re a fitness junkie who needs something right now, they may be worth a look, but it would be well advised to look around the market for more updated competitors such as the Huawei Watch 2 and the Jaybird X3s. 299.99 Buy at Amazon Features News Reviews Android Wear, Android Wear 2.0, New Balance, new balance runIQ, New Balance PaceIQ Android Wear, Android Wear 2.0, New Balance, New Balance PaceIQ, new balance runIQ David Imel David Imel  is a 21 year-old technology enthusiast hailing from Smartville, Califorina.

It will be the largest takeover of an Israeli tech firm and follows a series of deals and partnerships inked in recent years by major tech and auto companies. “The deal proves in a dramatic manner that our vision is coming true. Israel is becoming a global technology center, not only in cyber, but also in the automotive area,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Israel had already singled out the automotive technology sector as a possible economic boon, allotting it 250 million shekels (US$68 million) for the next five years. At least five major car manufacturers have made investments in Israel. Ford Motor Co. bought computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS AC in August and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG invested in transit app Moovit in 2015. Daimler AG and General Motors Co. have also opened research and development centers in the country. The Mobileye deal went far beyond the $4.7 billion sale of fiber-optic company Chromatis Networks Inc. to Lucent Technologies Inc. in 2000, which was the country’s biggest tech deal before Mobileye. Founders Ziv Aviram, who is also the CEO, and Chairman Amnon Shashua, will share just under $1 billion from the sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Dec. 31. Shmuel Harlap, the largest shareholder, will make $1 billion, according to Bloomberg data as of April 1, 2016. Netanyahu’s Director General Eli Groner said the autonomous tech sector could potentially boost economic growth by 50%. Popular Now Five Elements to Include in a Compelling Business Case First Look at Trump Budget Isn't Pretty: Commentary Five Rules for Selecting the Best KPIs to Drive Operational Improvement Fast Track Israel is not renowned for its car-making industry, once turning out fiberglass-shelled cars that were briefly popular in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the country is now benefiting from the automobile industry’s increasing focus on software rather than hardware. In Israel, the automotive technology sector currently counts about 350 startups, according to industry monitor IVC Research Center, with the potential, according to Gruner, to grow bigger than the cybersecurity industry, which drew 15 percent of global capital raised by the sector in 2016, according to Start-Up Nation Central, a group that promotes Israel startups. Argus Cyber Security, based in Tel Aviv, in January announced a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies to protect cars from hackers. Otonomo Technologies Inc., a data platform that tells users when to stop driving due to a malfunction and can call emergency services when there is an accident, is working with nine car manufacturers, including Daimler. Aquarius Engines, which has designed and developed an engine to generate electric power, is working with Peugeot SA and three other automobile companies. Gal Fridman, chairman of Aquarius Engines, said the deal “definitely makes our lives easier.” “It validates Israel’s ability in technology in the automotive industry, traditionally American and German and not at all Israeli,” Fridman said. “Mobileye has dramatically helped us open the door wider into this industry.” Growing Pains The autonomous sector is expanding even as Israel’s tech sector suffers from growing pains. Although the country’s tech industry grew faster than gross domestic product nearly every year between 1998 to 2009, in the five years following it surpassed national growth only once, in 2012. The Finance Ministry acknowledged in a report last year that the industry that fueled Israel’s economy for the past two decades was stagnating. Mobileye has also had its issues. Last year, Elon Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla Inc. stopped using Mobileye’s systems and the two companies argued publicly about the breakup. After the Mobileye acquisition was announced, Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who have been reducing corporate taxes, announced they would consider further cuts. “We view this deal as an indication that the more attractive Israel is for foreign investors, the more tax revenue we will generate,” Groner said. Tax breaks are already part of the government’s program to encourage global technology companies to do more research and development in Israel as other countries vie for companies like Intel to put down roots on their soil. “The deal will increase the attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups,” said Jon Medved, founder of OurCrowd, an equity crowdfunding platform based in Jerusalem.

This is a timepiece that both embraces its Swiss roots (it is assembled in the La Chaux-de-Fonds workshop) and makes a giant leap forward in watch tech. While it's assembled in Switzerland, the project is clearly a Silicon Valley collaboration — the result of a years-long partnership with Intel hardware and Google’s Android Wear operating system. The marriage is clear in the product: This watch is able to host both digital and mechanical modules that attach to the watch’s lugs. In short, users will be able to switch from a smartwatch to a mechanical one. PREVIOUSLY: Tag Heuer and Google Team Up to Take on the Apple Watch Both modules will be the same size, 45mm, which is 1mm smaller than the original Connected. The electronic module has received quite a few upgrades, too. Powered by the Intel Atom processor Z34XX series, the watch now operates on Android Wear 2.0. This gives it the ability to run standalone apps — including Android Pay — without the need for a smartphone nearby. Users will be able to connect their watches to the Internet via Wi-Fi and cellular networks, connect to GPS, and store images on 4GB of flash storage in the watch. Note: those early adaptors with the original Connected will be getting a software update to 2.0. Phew. The watch has a 1.39-inch AMOLED touchscreen and is water resistant for up to 50 meters, partly because all the parts have been engineered into a compact cylindrical structure. Another unique feature: water won’t pass through the headphone jack (yes, there's a headphone jack). Intel promises a 30-hour battery life.  The smartwatch’s cases, straps, lugs, and other parts can be easily swapped, and buyers have the option to pick up one of up to 56 versions. The TAG Heuer Studio is a watch face configurator that will give shoppers the ability to customize their watch by picking from 30 different faces, and give them the option of adding and removing specific features, such as the SuperLuminova effect on the hands and changing the colors of specific details. All in all, TAG Heuer promises up to 4,000 unique configurations for the Connected Modular 45. Best of all, by making the transition from smartwatch to mechanical watch seamless, TAG Heuer still maintains the classic notions of watches as heirloom pieces while remaining completely technologically relevant. MORE: 40 Watches Your Grandkids Will Fight Over The original Connected was launched with the promise that wearers could trade it in for a mechanical Carrera for a $1,500 premium. Likewise, TAG Heuer is launching Modular 45 with two compatible mechanical modules, but more will follow. Available now is the Calibre 5, with time-and-date automatic movement, and the Calibre 02T, the company’s entry-level tourbillon. The watch is available starting today at $1,650. Eleven standard models will be available, but up to 56 references will be available on demand, including titanium, ceramic, and gold-plated components. The chronograph Heuer-02T tourbillon mechanical module is at the top of the range and will be offered in a deluxe box set that includes a connected module and an additional black rubber strap. Price tag: a cool $17,000. [tagheuer.com] Topics: Watches Want More? Sign up for our newsletter to get the latest adventures, workouts, destinations, and more.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Klint Finley. Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 03.14.17. 03.14.17 Time of Publication: 2:36 pm. 2:36 pm Intel’s 15 Billion Reasons Why an AI Chip Revolution Has Arrived Mobileye AI isn’t just changing internet services, cars, robotics, and healthcare. It’s changing the computer chip market too. This shift was underlined on Monday when Intel said it would pay $15.3 billion to acquire Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes chips and cameras for cars and trucks, including the self-driving variety. The purchase will be Intel’s second largest ever, following its $16.7 billion acquisition of chip-maker Altera in 2015. The Altera buy was also driven, in part, by the recent rise of machine learning, where machine can learn discrete tasks on their own. These are enormous acquisitions in many respects. After acquiring Mobileye, Intel will move its autonomous driving team to the Mobileye’s headquarters, not vice versa. In other words, Intel is letting Mobileye take over a growing wing of its company. The world’s largest chip maker knows the market is changing rapidly, and it’s determined to change with it. As long as PCs and servers dominated the computing landscape, Intel reigned supreme. But PCs now share the stage with phones, tablets, drones, TVs, smart thermostats, and, yes, cars. For the most part, the smartphone and tablet revolution sidestepped Intel in favor of chips from ARM, and though these gadgets still connect to data centers in the cloud, where Intel chips are still dominant, this hegemony is now being threatened by the rise of chips suited to running neural networks, complex mathematical systems that can learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, including recognizing images and translating from one language to another. Typically, neural networks analyze data with help from graphics processing units, or GPUs, chip originally built to help power video games in the late 1990s, and most of these are supplied by Intel rival nVidia. But other companies are exploring more specialized chips for machine learning. Last year, Google unveiled its own AI-focused chip called the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPUs, and Microsoft revealed that it uses Altera’s customizable chips to power its own AI applications. That’s why Intel acquired Altera. But increasingly, specialized AI chips are also needed in devices, including cars. Think of it this way: companies need chips in the data center to train the neural networks, and as these machine learning models get more complex, they will also need chips in the devices to help execute the models. Once a company teaches a system to recognize detailed images, for instance, it will need a way of running a system on a phone or a car. With this in mind, Intel has bought-up mobile-focused AI chip company Movidius and now Mobileye. Plus, it has already makes the RealSense 3D camera for drones, cars, and any other gadget that needs artificial eyes, and it has acquired drone-makers Ascending Technologies. You saw some of the fruits of these efforts during the Super Bowl half time show this year. Intel is determined not to miss the next chip wave the way it missed the switch to mobile. But there are obstacles aplenty. Microsoft recently revealed that it’s exploring the use of ARM chips in its data centers, another push against Intel’s hegemony in the data center. However the battle of the chips plays out, one thing is certain: the market isn’t what it used to be. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

As leaks had suggested, the Android Wear 2.0 from TAG Heuer has been launched at an uncannily expensive price of $ 1700, which roughly amounts to INR 1,12,000. Intel and TAG Heuer have come together to introduce this all-metal customizable modular Android wearable. The successor of the TAG Connected, the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 will have customizable lugs as well as interchangeable straps. Moreover, the watch can be customized before it is bought. The customization allows you to choose from a range of 500 styles and 56 different versions (11 standard models offered in-store with an additional 45 upon request) of the watch. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 has  a 1.39-inch AMOLED touch-screen display with a round flat tire. The ring surrounding it consists of all the requisite antennas for WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is equipped with Intel’s Atom Z34XX processor. TAG Heuer and Intel claim that the Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch has a batter life of up to 30 hours. Among other features, the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 has NFC, enabling it to make contact-less payments, and it can track your location and fitness using onboard GPS. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 has a 2.5D sapphire crystal cover with a titanium case. The second-gen smartwatch from TAG Heuer packs 4GB of RAM and is water resistant up to 5ATM. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is also fitted with a small microphone which allows the user to communicate with it via voice recognition (aka, it has the Google Assistant!). TAG Heuer’s CEO, Jean-Claude Biver, said This innovative, unique and distinctive TAG watch is at the forefront of the latest technologies available in Silicon Valley and, at the same time, a genuine Swiss watch, bearing the Swiss Made label While it costs a lot, the makers have offered a series of options to users in terms of buckles (black PVD or titanium), bracelets (ceramic, titanium, leather or rubber), 30 dial options and the watch’s lugs. Given that its predecessor swept the market with its launch, all eyes will be set on how the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 does on the sales front. likethis What's your reaction?

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Friday March 17, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Making autonomous car play, Intel offers US$15 billion for Mobileye AP  Wednesday, March 15, 2017, 12:07 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ DETROIT -- Computer chip maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than US$15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year's end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver's seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye's technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. "They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market." Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of US$10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about US$2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel's growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday's deal combines Mobileye's software with Intel's hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems.

Be careful how you customize it: some options will set you back many thousands of dollars. Didn't buy an iPhone or an Apple Watch Edition because you were waiting for a worthy alternative from Google? Maybe you own a Pixel now. You might want to check out the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. That's because the Swiss luxury brand's second smartwatch, launched on Tuesday, is partly designed by both Google and Intel. The Modular 45, which starts at $1,650 and can nudge $17,000 depending on the options you select, is the gorgeous timepiece you'd expect from Swiss engineers. But it also appears to be a showpiece designed to make Google's Android Wear platform look its best. True to its name, the Modular 45 is modular: you can choose from among 56 lugs, straps, and buckles that can be swapped out in seconds with no tools required. Material options for the straps include rubber, leather, titanium, and ceramic in many different colors, so you can go as gaudy or classy as you wish. The watch module itself even has separate versions: the main Android Wear-powered smartwatch, and two mechanical watches if you want the latest from Tag Heuer but don't want to wear what amounts to a smartphone on your wrist. And this truly is a smartphone alternative for many activities. An Intel Atom processor, Android Wear 2.0, and a full suite of antennas (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and GPS) mean that you'll be able to complete payments, log your workout, and browse your calendar, email, and much more without tethering the Modular 45 to a larger mobile device. Intel and Google representatives joined Tag Heuer at a press event in San Francisco on Monday night, where they detailed the division of labor that makes the Modular 45 tick. Intel worked on packing in the chips and sensors, a challenge for the watch's full-metal case, which inherently blocks RF signals. Tag Heuer itself was responsible for the design, and Google brought the operating system, which, as far as I could tell from a brief demo, is pretty much stock Android Wear. There's a 1.4-inch AMOLED multi-touch display with a tenth of an inch of sapphire crystal on top of it, which makes for a marked improvement over the Modular 45's predecessor, the Tag Heuer Connected. Inside is an Intel Atom Z34 processor, 512GB of memory, 4GB of storage, and all the sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, tilt detection, microphone, vibrations and haptics engine, and ambient light sensor. There's also a 410mAh battery, with up to 25 hours of life and a charging time of under two hours. To customize watch faces, you can use the new Tag Heuer Connected app on your phone to chose from among 30 different pre-selected designs that approximate stately mechanical faces, or you can customize individual components to create your own look. Speaking of customization, the physical components you choose will greatly influence the Modular 45's final price. Rubber bands are the cheapest, while you can select diamond-encrusted bands and a titanium finish for the watch face to push the price past $6,000. And if money is truly no object, you can opt for a $17,000 package that includes both the titanium Android watch module and a mechanical one, as well as leather and rubber straps. Those prices make the $1,250 Apple Watch Edition seem like a downright bargain.

Recommended for You Google’s New Tool Says Nearly 80 Percent of Roofs Are Sunny Enough for Solar Panels The Entrepreneur with the $100 Million Plan to Link Brains to Computers Scrutiny Intensifies on the Warrantless Collection of Americans’ Communications How to Upgrade Judges with Machine Learning Facebook’s AI Chief: Machines Could Learn Common Sense from Video Intel’s proposed $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that supplies carmakers with a computer-vision technology and advanced driver assistance systems, offers a chance to measure the scale of this rebuild. In particular, it shows how valuable on-the-road data is likely to be in the evolution of automated driving. While the price tag might seem steep, especially with so many players in automated driving today, Mobileye has some key technological strengths and strategic advantages. It’s also developing new technologies that could help solidify this position. Mobileye uses a single camera, together with a proprietary computer chip and some clever software, to provide various advanced driver assistance features. Its systems can, for example, identify the speed limit from road signs, or identify vehicles and pedestrians for an automatic braking system.  David Keith, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who studies technology adoption in the automotive industry, says besides offering a simple, low-cost solution, Mobileye has amassed a huge amount of data—something that is vital to the machine learning that underpins automated driving today. “Their technologies are highly reliable, honed over millions of miles of driving experience, which competitors cannot easily replicate,” he says. It isn’t hard to see why Intel should want to enter the auto market. The increasingly capable computers, sensors, and wireless connections now found in vehicles are enabling big changes across that industry. Meanwhile, Intel has seen its position of dominance eroded in recent years as desktop and laptop computers fade in importance, and as different types of computer chips have become more popular. Competitor Nvidia has already captured a sizable share of the growing auto market. Mobileye’s technology can automatically identify lane markings and curbs. Keith adds that Intel will aim to use its hardware expertise to develop the increasingly sophisticated fusion systems—combining cameras, radar, and possibly laser sensing, or lidar—needed bring fully automated vehicles to market. If your car is capable of identifying a road sign or a pedestrian on the road ahead, there’s a good chance it already uses one of Mobileye’s chips for the task. The company’s vision systems are a simple, low-cost solution that offers surprisingly sophisticated sensing. The company therefore offers Intel a good way into the automated driving market, which promises to grow as the technology matures in the coming years.  For its vision system, Mobileye employs deep learning, a machine-learning technique that has given computers powerful new capabilities in recent years. This involves capturing images as cars drive around, and annotating them to identify things like road markings, traffic signs, other vehicles, and pedestrians. The images are fed into a big neural network, which is tweaked until it can reliably recognize the relevant elements of an image. If Mobileye’s system is unable to identify something, it’s usually possible to simply annotate some new images and add them to the learning data set. What do you think driving will look like in 10 or 20 years? Tell us what you think. This isn’t to say that it’s perfect, or all that’s needed for automated driving. Tesla had been using Mobileye’s vision technology for its Autopilot semi-automated driving system until last year. The companies ceased working together after a fatal accident involving a car controlled by Autopilot. In the fallout from the crash, the carmaker criticized the vision system provided by Mobileye. Executives from Mobileye countered that its technology was never meant to be used in this way. Technology now under development at Mobileye could help automated cars drive more safely in the future. In December, I met with Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s CTO, and Shai Shalev-Shwartz, VP for technology. They explained how Mobileye is now using reinforcement learning, a technique inspired by the way animals learn through experience, to teach computers how to drive safely in complex and subtle situations (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2017: Reinforcement Learning”). As part of this effort, Mobileye is developing a simulated driving environment to enable learning. It hopes this will become the standard environment for testing automated driving software. They also explained that Mobileye is working with several carmakers on a way for them to share the data collected with other companies for a price. This could help accelerate (no pun intended) progress toward fully automated driving. The result could be a transformation of transportation as we know it. Indeed, the prospect of profound disruption has caused a stampede for technology and talent among automakers, suppliers, and startups. Stephen Zoepf, executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, agrees that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye shows how critical data and machine learning are to the auto industry’s future. But he adds, “It’s also evidence of the degree to which demand for talent is outstripping supply in the autonomous vehicle space.” Become an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.

Daniel Miller (TMFTwoCoins) Mar 14, 2017 at 12:11PM It's been clear for some time now that the automotive industry is on the verge of evolving more over the next two decades than it has in the past hundred years. Further proof came Monday morning when Silicon Valley pushed more chips onto the table with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announcing it would acquire Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), a leader in developing driverless car technology. By the numbers Intel's deal to purchase Mobileye came with a $15.3 billion price tag, a hefty sum that valued Mobileye at $63.54 per share. That's a 34% premium to Mobileye's price at Friday's close, and is the driving force behind the company's 30% surge in stock price Monday morning. While this move was unforeseen, it does make a lot of sense and is just one of many recent big moves in the automotive industry. Intel already had made a move to buy a 15% stake in digital map-making company Here International B.V., to own more navigation technology. Samsung Electronics made its own move a week ago when it closed an $8 billion deal to purchase Harman International, a company devoted to designing and engineering connected products and solutions for automakers. Even the automotive industry's own General Motors spent roughly $1 billion to purchase Cruise Automation to ignite its own self-driving research, and has invested $500 million in ride-hailing company Lyft in its effort to bulk up smart mobility projects. Ford's Fusion testing self-driving technology. Image source: Ford Motor Company. A big step forward In the press release announcing the acquisition, Ziv Aviram, Mobileye co-founder, president and CEO, said: We expect the growth toward autonomous driving to be transformative. It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers. By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centers and high-performance computing platforms. Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry. What's in it for Intel? Intel paid a hefty price tag for Mobileye, which generated a modest $358.2 million in revenue last year. But Intel is getting a serious foot in the door of markets it wants to dominate in the future. Image source: Intel Corporation Mobileye acquisition presentation. Mobileye brings a lot to the table in that regard with its thoroughly respected expertise in self-driving sensors and technology, as well as numerous partnerships with the largest automakers in the business. Mobileye is a leader in advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) technologies and has a portfolio of vision, sensor fusion, mapping, and driving policy products. And if you're going to get into the automotive industry, which is plagued by capital-intensive operations and historically low margins, this is the place to be. Consider that during 2016 Mobileye generated 76% gross margin, 48.3% adjusted-EBITDA margin, and 34% operating margin, thanks to its low fixed costs and less intensive marketing and SG&A costs compared to OEM (original equipment manufacturer) automakers. As a bonus, Mobileye is expected to be immediately accretive to Intel's non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow. Intel management also believes it can wring out $175 million in cost synergies annually by 2019, which will only improve margins in the years ahead. With Intel making a significant push into self-driving vehicle technology, the company now has the products to offer automakers a larger and more complete package of components, which could help seal future contracts. The future of the automotive industry is autonomous vehicles, and it's going to be a lucrative market in a couple of decades -- Intel is just the latest tech company to spend billions carving out its spot in the coming automotive evolution, but it certainly won't be the last.

Mobileye Computer processing giant Intel has outlined its intention to expand into the driverless cars market with the acquisition of Israeli technology business Mobileye.14 Mar 2017 M&A Corporate TMT Diversified industrial Advanced Manufacturing & Technology Europe Asia Pacific Intel announced that it had agreed a $15.3 billion deal to buy Mobileye on Monday in an acquisition which will see Intel's automated driving division integrated into Mobileye. Mobileye develops technology that helps advanced driver assistance systems to 'see'. Intel said the combination of Mobileye's technology and expertise with its business has the potential to "deliver driving solutions that will transform the automotive industry", including "advanced driving assist, highly autonomous and fully autonomous driving programs". "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said. "The combination of Intel’s high performance computing and connectivity solutions with Mobileye’s best in class computer vision technology will put us in a position to accelerate innovation for car-makers and lead in delivering the technology foundation for highly and fully autonomous driving." Krzanich said growth in driverless cars will spur the generation of mass volumes of data. "Our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across every technology and every industry," he said. "At four terabytes of data per day, the average autonomous car will put out the data equivalent of approximately 3,000 people. Put just one million autonomous vehicles on the road and you have the data equivalent of half the world’s population. This massive amount of data requires all of Intel’s assets to provide the cost-effective high-performance solutions our customers need. The addition of Mobileye to our family provides the data path to our computing solutions becoming the intelligent set of eyes that will allow a vehicle to see and define the world around it." Ziv Aviram, co-founder, president and chief executive of Mobileye, said that the company expects to see "transformative" growth in the driverless cars market. “[Autonomous driving] will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers," Aviram said. "By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centres and high-performance computing platforms. Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry." The deal is subject to approval from regulators and is expected to be closed "within the next nine months", Intel said. Intel is not the first major technology company to look to move into the connected and driverless cars market. Google and Apple are both developing autonomous vehicles, while last November Samsung Electronics announced that it had agreed to buy in-vehicle technology supplier Harman International Industries in an $8 billion deal. Car manufacturers have also taken steps to strengthen their propositions in the market. BMW, Daimler and Audi group together acquired Nokia's Nokia Here mapping unit, and BMW also has a joint venture with SGL Group which is aimed at enabling the car manufacturer to utilise carbon technologies in electric vehicles.

Adar 19, 5777, 3/17/2017   MainAll NewsTechnology & HealthMobileye CEO: We will be an example to the world Mobileye CEO: We will be an example to the world Company bought by Intel for $15 billion pledges to reduce fatal car accidents with revolutionary self-driving technology. Contact Editor Gary Wllig, 14/03/17 18:31 Using Mobileye Moshe Shai/FLASH90 One day after US computer chip giant Intel agreed to buy Israeli car technology firm Mobileye in a deal worth more than $15 billion, Mobileye CEO Ziv Aviram met with Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz, Yediot Ahronot reported. "When we established Mobileye, we had an absurd little dream, to fight against the traffic accidents which claim the lives of a million and a half people each year," Aviram said during his meeting with Katz. Now that Mobileye is part of "the giant machine of Intel, we will establish the largest center for autonomous cars right here in Israel. We will be an example to the world. We are very excited about the transaction and it is very important for us. I would like to thank the media for their positive coverage and well-wishes [for us]." Yaniv Garty, the General Manager of Intel Israel, said: "All of Intel's global operations in this field will be managed from Israel. This is a vote of confidence both in the company and in Israeli regulations. It will take more time to close the deal." Mobileye is the world leader in autonomous car technology. Last year, car company BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Mobileye, which also develops systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Mar 15, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Intel to buy Mobileye, move into autonomous cars AP, DETROIT, Michigan Intel is to buy Israel’s Mobileye in a deal valued at about US$15 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The deal, announced on Monday, combines Mobileye’s market-leading software — which processes information from cameras and other sensors — with Intel’s hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination, expected to close by year’s end, would allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye’s leadership position, officials from the companies said. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Nearly all of them use Mobileye’s software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 automakers. It also controls about 70 percent of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems that are in cars and trucks on the road today. Intel’s involvement and the big price tag show that autonomous cars are coming in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way people travel, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. “Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,” Carone said. Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the Internet and access to bigger data centers, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts. Automakers want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place, Krzanich said. “If you put all of that together, you really get an end-do-end solution for autonomous driving,” said Mobileye chairman and cofounder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit. In the deal, Intel Corp is to pay US$63.54 for each share of Mobileye NV, a 34 percent premium on its closing price on Friday. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at US$15.3 billion. The deal is the latest combination as automakers and technology firms race to build autonomous cars and for leadership in auto electronics. It moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google’s Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. The deal also is likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he said. Mobileye, with 660 employees, has been forming partnerships worldwide as its growth continued as a separate company. BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnered last year, and Mobileye teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Competitors also formed partnerships last year. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a US$300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co invested US$500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2171 times. Comments will be moderated.

Intel has agreed to buy the Israeli company for $15.3 (14.3 billion euros) which could give it a dominant role in the autonomous-driving sector. It is the biggest technology takeover in Israel’s history and the largest purchase of a company solely focused on self-driving. The price represents a premium of around 33 percent to the Friday closing price of Mobileye’s shares. Intel to Acquire Mobileye: https://t.co/od1jaLXi3L pic.twitter.com/ARTTcdDCQ7— Intel Official News (@intelnews) March 13, 2017 Intel is known for hardware chips and Mobileye for collision detection software. Speaking about the deal to unite Intel’s processors with Mobileye’s computer vision, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich likened it to merging the “eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car”. He called it “a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers,” adding: “Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving.” #Intel buys #Mobileye in $15.3B deal, moves its automotive unit to Israel https://t.co/G52gnBodLM— KMH (@Korey_Michael) March 13, 2017 Ziv Aviram, Mobileye’s chief executive, said: “When you look at the combined assets of both companies, you see that they are really complimentary to each other.” Analyst reaction “It’s an area where the company (Intel) has had very little presence – the automotive market, and so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets who has a “buy” rating on Intel shares. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical … The price seems fair,” she added. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. Not a science-fiction dream Carmakers and their suppliers have been expanding alliances in the race to develop self-driving cars, a sector that once seemed a science-fiction dream but is drawing closer to reality month after month. Mobileye and Intel are already working together with German carmaker BMW on putting a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road later this year. Intel moves into automated driving with $15 billion acquisition of machine vision leader Mobileye https://t.co/CIUjaAajE1 pic.twitter.com/71DcERZF55— Forbes (@Forbes) March 13, 2017 The merger promises to create the most complete portfolio of technologies needed for driverless vehicles, including cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning and cloud software, as well as the data-centres needed to manage all the data involved. Latest deal Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads into the market for autonomous driving components, including Intel, Mobileye and rival Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.

( NASDAQ: INTC – Free Report ), Mobileye NV ( NYSE: MBLY – Free Report ), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA – Free Report ), General Motors (NYSE: GM – Free Report ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL – Free Report ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ”Buy” stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free . Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog: Are More Driverless Car Deals in the Future? On Monday, semiconductor chip maker Intel Corp. ( NASDAQ: INTC – Free Report ) announced a huge move in the self-driving car race, buying Israeli firm  Mobileye NV ( NYSE: MBLY – Free Report ) for a reported $15.3 billion. The deal values Mobileye at about $63.54 per share, which is a 34% premium to its closing price last Friday. MBLY stock skyrocketed around 30% to $61.35 per share in morning trading on Monday, while shares of INTC were down about 2% to $35.22 per share. Intel plans on integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s renowned operations, and the combined entity will be run by Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua. The deal will combine Intel’s processors with Mobileye’s renowned computer vision, making it the biggest purchase of a company that’s solely focused on the self-driving market. Not only is this acquisition a huge deal for Intel, but it’s also an endorsement of both the Israeli tech scene as well as the entire self-driving vehicle industry as a whole. Big-name automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA – Free Report ), General Motors (NYSE: GM – Free Report ), among many others, are racing to get a self-driving car model on the road, while tech giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL – Free Report ) and Uber sprinting just as fast to perfect the technology behind the cars. Last year, GM spent $1 billion to speed up its self-driving program with the acquisition of Cruise Automation, while Uber recently bought self-driving truck maker Otto for $680 million last August. These two transactions are just the tip of the iceberg, and with 2020 fast approaching, we should expect even more deals from the biggest players in the driverless car market If the necessary regulations are in place, 2020 is the year every company, tech and automaker, in the race plans to have a working self-driving car-or fleet-on the road. Intel and Mobileye already have previous ties, having partnered with German automaker BMW AG to test about 40 self-driving cars on the road. It will be interesting to see which automaker will be lucky enough to be able to utilize the new entity’s technology. The deal will add to Intel’s adjusted per share earnings, and is expected to close in the next nine months. 5 Trades Could Profit „Big-League” from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington’s changing course.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 March 2017 by Military News Why Intel Needed To Own Mobileye – Even If It Overpaid Shutterstock photo Painfully, Intel (INTC) has little to no presence in mobile devices, save for a few modem chips here and there. Most everything on mobile devices is ARM-based due to its lower power consumption and cheaper costs. Intel and its -x86 platform simply cannot compete on price or power performance. Having realized this, Intel has decided to do what any company in its position should do — try and buy its way into the future, acquiring Mobileye (MBLY) for $15.3 billion. No Matter the Cost The acquisition, which is being billed as helping Intel turn into a data company (whatever that means), isn’t likely to move the financial needle for Intel anytime soon.  Mobileye generated just $240.6 million in revenue in fiscal 2016. By comparison, Intel’s full year revenue was $59.4 BILLION and its Data Center Group (which Intel is saying Mobileye will fit into) had $17.2 billion in sales. The Israeli-based Mobileye generated $108.4 million in GAAP net income in 2016, making the deal worth 141 times net income. That isn’t exactly cheap, even if Mobileye is growing revenues at 46% year over year. This deal is about the future of the car, one that will generate more data (thus needing more computing power) than at any time in history. Intel said cars could generate as much as four terabytes of data per day, so it’s important cars have the computing power to understand and make sense of all that data. Mobileye is best known for its role in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), having worked with companies like Tesla (TSLA), GM (GM), BMW (in conjunction with Intel) and others to bring self-driving cars to the forefront. (In 2017, another 6 OEMs will come online using Mobileye’s chips, according to Jefferies analyst David Kelley.) Limited Impact This deal isn’t likely to hurt Nvidia (NVDA), which makes GPUs for self-driving cars or Qualcomm (QCOM) or NXP (NXPI), which also makes chipsets for cars. Chips for ADAS systems and the cameras that go into them is a much smaller market than being the brains of a self-driving car platform. However, it’s clear that Intel needed to do something to get into this space, or risk losing out like it did with mobile devices. There is still the risk that car manufacturers will cut Mobileye’s units out of its cars (as happened with Tesla), but with Intel’s muscle behind it, that seems less likely to happen. Mobileye has deals with a number of auto manufacturers, including Volkswagen and BMW, enough to get its EyeQ chips into 16 million cars by the end of 2016.  Ultimately, this is a deal Intel had to do. It missed out on buying Nvidia when it should have, as it was too focused on the Altera acquisition. It can’t buy AMD (AMD) because of the implications for the PC market and -x86 chips. The PC market has had little to no growth for quite some time now, leading PC chip makers to wonder what’s next. Intel’s latest acquisition of automotive chip maker Mobileye shows that under Brian Krzanich, Intel is focusing on the future — no matter what it costs.

It will be the largest takeover of an Israeli tech firm and follows a series of deals and partnerships inked in recent years by major tech and auto companies. “The deal proves in a dramatic manner that our vision is coming true. Israel is becoming a global technology center, not only in cyber, but also in the automotive area,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a text message. Israel had already singled out the automotive technology sector as a possible economic boon, allotting it 250 million shekels ($68 million) for the next five years. At least five major car manufacturers have made investments in Israel. Ford Motor Co. bought computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS AC in August and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG invested in transit app Moovit in 2015. Daimler AG and General Motors Co. have also opened research and development centers in the country. The Mobileye deal went far beyond the $4.7 billion sale of fiber-optic company Chromatis Networks Inc. to Lucent Technologies Inc. in 2000, which was the country’s biggest tech deal before Mobileye. Founders Ziv Aviram, who is also the Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman Amnon Shashua, will share just under $1 billion from the sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Dec. 31. Shmuel Harlap, the largest shareholder, will make $1 billion, according to Bloomberg data as of April 1, 2016. Netanyahu’s Director General Eli Groner said the autonomous tech sector could potentially boost economic growth by 50 percent. Fast Track Israel is not renowned for its car-making industry, once turning out fiberglass-shelled cars that were briefly popular in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the country is now benefiting from the automobile industry’s increasing focus on software rather than hardware. In Israel, the automotive technology sector currently counts about 350 startups, according to industry monitor IVC Research Center, with the potential, according to Gruner, to grow bigger than the cybersecurity industry, which drew 15 percent of global capital raised by the sector in 2016, according to Start-Up Nation Central, a group that promotes Israel startups. Argus Cyber Security, based in Tel Aviv, in January announced a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies to protect cars from hackers. Otonomo Technologies Inc., a data platform that tells users when to stop driving due to a malfunction and can call emergency services when there is an accident, is working with nine car manufacturers, including Daimler. Aquarius Engines, which has designed and developed an engine to generate electric power, is working with Peugeot SA and three other automobile companies. Gal Fridman, chairman and chief marketing officer of Aquarius Engines, said the deal “definitely makes our lives easier.” “It validates Israel’s ability in technology in the automotive industry, traditionally American and German and not at all Israeli,” Fridman said. “Mobileye has dramatically helped us open the door wider into this industry.” Growing Pains Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The autonomous sector is expanding even as Israel’s tech sector suffers from growing pains. Although the country’s tech industry grew faster than gross domestic product nearly every year between 1998 to 2009, in the five years following it surpassed national growth only once, in 2012. The Finance Ministry acknowledged in a report last year that the industry that fueled Israel’s economy for the past two decades was stagnating. Mobileye has also had its issues. Last year, Elon Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla Inc. stopped using Mobileye’s systems and the two companies argued publicly about the breakup. After the Mobileye acquisition was announced, Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who have been reducing corporate taxes, announced they would consider further cuts.  “We view this deal as an indication that the more attractive Israel is for foreign investors, the more tax revenue we will generate,” Groner said in a phone interview. Tax breaks are already part of the government’s program to encourage global technology companies to do more research and development in Israel as other countries vie for companies like Intel to put down roots on their soil. “The deal will increase the attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups,” said Jon Medved, founder of OurCrowd, an equity crowdfunding platform based in Jerusalem.

(LULU) Stock After Earnings Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) and Tesla Inc (TSLA) GameStop Corp. (GME) Stock Is the Next Blockbuster — Time to Sell View All Posts When I last checked in on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) back in late February, the company was on the verge of lifting the embargo period for reviews on its much-hyped new CPU. Ryzen was supposed to be an Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) killer, both in terms of price and performance. Considering the pre-release hype, the end of the embargo period appeared to be a solid opportunity for bullish AMD options traders. The reality was a bit different. Click to Enlarge AMD stock plunged in the following week, as nearly every major PC and review publication essentially said that while Ryzen was impressive for its price point, the new CPU failed to live up to the extreme hype currently in the market. Furthermore, in a rare move, Intel quickly cut prices on its competing i7 processors to mitigate the damage from AMD’s new price war. As the analysts reservations piled onto the mounting PC reviews, AMD stock eventually hit a low of $12.38 on March 6. Unfortunately, barring a major development this week, the March $15/$16 bull call spread I talked about on Feb. 27 isn’t going anywhere. But the AMD stock price appears to have once again found its feet, and the shares are poised to trade north of $14 once again today, making the March $12.50 put sell a winner (well, as long as the shares don’t plunge again this week). Which begs the question, is AMD once again a potential bullish options play? The sentiment backdrop certainly seems to suggest so. Yes, AMD had a bad review week when compared with pre-Ryzen release hype, but the CPU is still a major competitor in the market — enough so that Intel was forced to cut prices. What’s more, despite a few vocal reviews last week, analysts remain largely in wait-and-see mode. According to Thomson/First Call, 11 of the 26 analysts following AMD stock still rate the shares a “buy” or better — the same configuration as before Ryzen was released. Additionally, the average 12-month consensus price target has risen from $11.79 on Feb. 27 to its current perch at $11.92. It’s a small bump, but still a bullish one, and there is plenty of room for improvement$13.91 on Friday. Furthermore, there is still a very real threat of a short-squeeze situation for AMD stock. As of the most recent reporting period, roughly 104,000 shares of AMD stock were sold short, representing more than 13% of the stock’s total float. If the shares can bounce back from their post-review selloff, it could create enough doubt for these short sellers to begin buying back their positions. Finally, AMD options traders remain firmly bullish on the shares. At last check, the April put/call open interest ratio rested at 0.57, with calls nearly doubling puts among short-term options. Once again, more than a few of these calls could be hedges for short positions, but the outlook remains bullish for AMD stock. Checking in on implieds, April options traders are pricing in a move of about 16% for AMD stock, placing the upper bound at $16.24 and the lower bound at $11.76.

The Blizzard Edition Of The Samadhi Tech Update (Seeking Alpha) Related MBLY From Mobileye Purchase To 5G Modems, Intel's Investments Could Hurt Chances Of Positive Returns Big Winner Of Intel-Mobileye Deal: Blackberry? The Vetr community has upgraded $MBLY to 2-Stars. (Vetr) Betsy Van Hees of Loop Capital says Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)’s deal to buy Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY) is a critical step in the transformation of the chip maker beyond being just a PC company. Intel agreed to buy Israel-based Mobileye for about $15.3 billion, as part of its move to expand in the fast-growing market for fully autonomous vehicles. Van Hees, who reiterated Buy rating and $42 price target on Intel, noted that the deal puts Intel in a leading position in an end market that is more predictable and steady with considerable long-term growth opportunities. “We weren't surprised by the pending acquisition given INTC’s already strong partnership with MBLY and view it as a considerable positive as this leap frogs INTC’s position within the nascent autonomous car market and opens INTC up to $70B system, data, and services TAM by 2030,” Van Hees wrote in a note. From the deal, Intel gets a strong base business with deep design-win pipeline and enhanced MSS and revenue opportunities through superior AD platforms. Intel also sees considerable recurring revenue streams in mapping and data services and expects to achieve cost synergies rising to $175 million per year by 2019. Lessons Learned From Past The combined global autonomous driving organization, which will consist of Mobileye and Intel's Automated Driving Group, will be headquartered in Israel and led by Prof. Amnon Shashua, Mobileye's Co-Founder, Chairman and CTO. Van Hees says Intel might have learned some lessons from the unsuccessful track record with its prior acquisitions and may have opted for the reverse integration. Shares of Intel closed Monday at $35.16, while Mobileye ended at $60.62.

The US chipmaker will pay $15.3bn (£12.5bn) for the Israeli company, which develops autonomous driving systems, as it looks to move into a market it believes could be worth as much as $70bn by 2030. Explaining the deal, Intel said that as cars "progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels". According to the BBC, the company believes that by 2020, "driverless cars will generate 4,000GB, or four terabytes, of data a day that can be mined for information". Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, says: "It's an area where [Intel] has had very little presence - the automotive market - and so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said. Earlier this month, Nissan tested its self-driving electric Leaf car, which it hopes to make available by 2020. Google and Uber have also extensively tested driverless cars and Apple is reported to be running trials.

Twitter Facebook Why Intel put a smartphone chip in Tag Heuer's $1,600 smartwatch Smartphone chips can extend the life of smartwatches, so they won't need to be replaced every few years Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 14 March, 2017 22:15 - - - - print email Comments Do smartwatches need upgrades every few years like PCs? It's not clear yet, but Intel's powerful chip in the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45, a US $1,600 luxury smartwatch, will ensure the wearable isn't outdated anytime soon. The smartwatch, which runs Android Wear 2.0, uses Intel's Atom Z34XX, a smartphone chip. The Atom processor seems like overkill but extends the wearable's shelf life and adds processing power for artificial intelligence, a feature Google is building in Android Wear. The watch has a 1.39-inch AMOLED touch screen, and modularity is a big selling point of the wearable. The smartwatch's heads, straps, and other parts can be easily swapped, and buyers have the option to pick up one of 56 versions. The smartwatch can be turned into a mechanical watch by replacing the head. Swiss watches -- like the one made by Tag Heuer -- have been treated like family heirlooms and passed down from generation to generation. Keeping the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 relevant for as long as possible was part of Intel's thinking. Like in PCs, smartwatches could need upgrades as chips age and applications demand more resources. The Atom chip will last over multiple versions of Android Wear, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. The processor also brings many valuable security features to the chip, which are important for mobile payments via NFC, Bautista said. Later in the year, Intel plans to add AI features to the smartwatch via apps. For example, the smartwatch will be able to approximate when a person needs to buy milk by analyzing trends from multiple data sources. Those applications will need processing capabilities on the device, and the Atom chip can handle those needs. Tag Heuer is stressing the "Swiss made" aspect of the smartwatch, and the wearable has interesting tech in it. It has Wi-Fi, GPS, and 4GB of flash storage, and it can run applications like Google Fit. It is water resistant for up to 50 meters, partly because all the parts have been engineered into a compact cylindrical structure. Water won't pass through the headphone jack, a unique feature. The NFC goes through the face of the watch. The interfaces can also be customized. A smartphone chip in the smartwatch does affect battery life. In tests, the smartwatch ran for about 30 hours before needing a recharge, according to Intel. Intel last year said it would start making Atom smartphone chips. Older smartphone CPUs are now getting a new lease on life in devices like smartwatches. The company is optimizing chips and developing software to fit the profile of devices, Bautista said. The wearables unit isn't a major division at Intel, unlike PCs, IoT, or servers, but the unit wants to develop software and analytics tools as the world becomes increasingly connected. Collecting and developing software for biometric data is unique to wearables, which is why Intel is interested in the area, Bautista said. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch will be available worldwide starting on Tuesday. Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

The deal may have been inspired by QualComm’s decision last fall to purchase chip maker NXT for $47 billion. NXP is the largest maker of computer chips for the automotive industry. Computers and cars are in convergence mode and no one wants to get left behind. The MobilEye transaction is expected to close in 9 months time. MobilEye was deeply involved with the development of the original Autopilot system for the Tesla  Model S that debuted in October, 2015. But when Joshua Brown was killed on a Florida highway 8 months later while his car was operating in Autopilot mode, the relationship quickly fell apart with both companies pointing accusatory fingers at each other. That setback has not kept MobilEye from controlling 70% of the market for autonomous driving systems, however. MobilEye is currently working closely with Delphi, one of the largest Tier One automotive suppliers. It is also cooperating with BMW on autonomous driving technology. The Bavarian automaker plans to have 40 self driving test cars on the road using MobilEye components later this year. Until recently, MobilEye has relied on chips manufactured by European chip maker STMicroelectronics but intends to use Intel’s fifth generation chips in the autonomous driving system it is developing for BMW. In a joint press release, the two companies say the deal is expected to “bring together Mobileye’s leading computer vision expertise with Intel’s high performance computing and connectivity expertise to create automated driving solutions from cloud to car.” “This acquisition will combine the best-in-class technologies from both companies, spanning connectivity, computer vision, data center, sensor fusion, high-performance computing, localization and mapping, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Together with partners and customers, Intel and Mobileye expect to deliver driving solutions that will transform the automotive industry.” The automotive industry is seeing a lot of transformation these days as companies race to get self driving cars on the road. The only question is, who will buy them? Building autonomous cars with internal combustion engines is just flat out stupid. Only electric cars lend themselves to the self driving revolution. Yet mainstream car makers are reluctant to build many electric cars and largely refuse to pay for the infrastructure needed to help them appeal to mainstream car buyers. The answer seems to be that the car companies themselves intend to own and operate fleets of self driving cars. Some business models suggest there is more money to be made from doing that than actually selling cars direct to consumers. We may actually be watching the beginning of the end of the private automobile. Tomorrow’s cars will be as much computers on wheels as transportation devices. Intel thinks self driving cars will generate 4 terabytes of data every day by the year 2020 and it expects its chips to play a major role in collecting, disseminating, and processing all that digital information.

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Tag Heuer Modular 45 Smartwatch Takes Modularity To A New Level Posted: Mar 14 2017, 1:41pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   Gallery 15 images   The first luxury connected watch with Swiss Made label. The Tag Heuer Modular 45 is designed, developed and assembled in Switzerland by TAG Heuer. Today, luxury Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer unveiled the second generation of its connected watch, with its partners Intel and Google. In Switzerland, the press conference we reported live from, was held near the highly symbolic Rütli Meadow in the heart of Switzerland, was led by Jean-Claude Biver, CEO of TAG Heuer & President of the LVMH Group Watch Division, accompanied by Josh Walden, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the New Technology Group at Intel, and David Singleton, Vice President of Android Engineering at Google. Don't Miss: Find a NES Classic in stock online Jean-Claude Biver, TAG Heuer CEO & President of the LVMH Watch Division, said: "After the huge success of the first TAG Heuer Connected watch, today I am very proud to present the Connected Modular 45. This is a Swiss watch which embodies the luxury codes of tomorrow, and which not only enables you to connect to the future, but also to connect to eternity thanks to its simple and smart modular design. This innovative, unique and distinctive watch is at the forefront of the latest technologies available in Silicon Valley and, at the same time, a genuine Swiss watch, bearing the Swiss Made label. It is the incarnation of our leading position with luxury connected watch and with this high level of technology.” “Engineering the next wave of smart and connected devices with iconic partners is a core strategy for Intel,” said Josh Walden, Senior Vice President and General Manager, New Technology Group, Intel. “We are thrilled to continue our strong collaboration with TAG Heuer. With innovative design and technology, the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 redefines the capabilities of a luxury smartwatch.”  “The first generation of the TAG Heuer Connected pushed the boundary of what is possible when you combine traditional watchmaking and cutting-edge technology,” said David Singleton, Vice President of Android Engineering at Google. “We’re excited to work with TAG Heuer again to create a new powerful connected watch that demonstrates the ongoing innovation of TAG Heuer’s craftsmanship and the Android Wear platform." Why choose Brunnen with the view on the Rütli, in the heart of Switzerland as the symbolic place in which to launch the watch?  Rütli in German means "Little meadow". It is Switzerland's founding legend and considered a national monument. Back in 1291, it was in this clearing, just above Lake Lucerne, that the representatives of the primitive cantons took the oath of Rütli to seal their alliance. Over time, the Rütli meadow has become a "national shrine". Here, on the 1st August every year, Switzerland celebrates an official national holiday. It was this deep-rooted connection to true Swiss values that Jean-Claude Biver wanted to highlight by gathering his partners from Silicon Valley and the world press here. What is the essence of the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 watch? The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 has been designed and engineered in the pure Swiss watchmaking tradition. It is a luxury Swiss watch which benefits from over 150 years of Swiss expertise, savoir-faire and heritage as cultivated by TAG Heuer, a watchmaker based in La Chaux-de-Fonds, the cradle of Swiss watchmaking (and a UNESCO World Heritage site). For more than 150 years, TAG Heuer has been inventing and manufacturing elegant sports watches here, including some of the most accurate chronographs produced by the Swiss watchmaking industry. Why the Modular 45 is Swiss Made Just like the brand's famous mechanical chronographs, the Connected Modular 45 has been designed, developed, and assembled in the TAG Heuer Manufacture, in La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland, in the same spirit and with the same high standards as a luxury product with Swiss Made quality. The same techniques, the same meticulous finish, the same attention to the minutest detail, the same exacting standards. This Swiss rigour and accuracy, this watchmaking expertise has earned it the "Swiss Made" label, the guarantee of the highest standards of Swiss quality. The original concept of modularity: only a luxury and avant-garde watchmaker could offer this. Above all, the connected watch is a Carrera Model. It fits in this famous TAG Heuer collection, the perfect representation of avant-garde, Art of Manufacture and accessible luxury. Measuring an elegant 45 mm in diameter, the design of the TAG Heuer Connected Modular is primarily that of a genuine watch whose lugs, strap, buckle and, in particular, case - its central module - are interchangeable elements. Made from satin or polished grade 5 titanium, or plated with 18K 5N rose gold, or in black ceramic, with or without diamonds: after choosing a watch from the 56 different versions available from its launch (a selection of 11 standard models are systematically offered in store + 45 others on request), the entire exterior of the watch can be customized. This customization will enable a multitude of combinations in terms of materials and colors. For the choice of strap alone, there are no fewer than 18 references available, made from rubber, natural leather or anthracite grey leather, titanium or ceramic.  You can complete your connected module by purchasing a Swiss mechanical movement module such as a 3 hands calibre 5, or the most prestigious of Grande Complication timepieces, the ultimate expression of the watchmaker's art – the tourbillon. But not just any tourbillon. The manufacture chronograph Tourbillon Heuer 02-T, with a titanium and carbon case, COSC certified. TAG Heuer is today the only manufacture in the world able to reach this level of production. In this way, you can very easily change the heart of your watch – the module – from a connected watch to a mechanical watch, and back again, to suit the occasion and your mood. Ultimately, this watch has all the elegance of a genuine timepiece, all the characteristics and the level of finish of a magnificent Swiss watch on your wrist.  The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 simplifies your life, thanks to our engineering collaboration with Intel. Incredibly practical, the built-in GPS enables you to track your journeys and sporting performance, with no need for your phone: all the information you need is right there on your wrist. All this technology can also be taken with you into water, thanks to its 50m water resistance. So you can swim, run, ski, explore, and live life to the full. The watch also makes your day-to-day life easier, saving you time, as you can make contactless payments using its NFC chip and the Android Pay app- means you can use your watch to pay directly at enabled points of sale.  Finally, screen uses OLED technology which offers incredible resolution and amazing colors, providing high contrast to stunning effect on the highly sophisticated watch dials – you won't believe your eyes! The modularity concept extends to the watch's software, with dial customization. The brand has developed 30 watch dials, all retaining TAG Heuer's identity, some of which are inspired by historical pieces such as the famous panda dial, drawing on the brand's great heritage. Colored white, black, light grey, anthracite grey, chocolate brown, navy blue or gold, with sunray finish, skeleton dial, 3 hands, GMT, a chronograph with 1, 2, or 3 counters, plus a date and day window, these dials are interchangeable with a single swipe of the finger.  The TAG Heuer Studio dial configurator also offers customers the chance to create their own dial, just like a watchmaker. In the blink of an eye, you can choose your standard dial with its functions, and customize all the colors, the look of the metals on the indices and hands, the details in SuperLuminova™ and the lacquered tips for the finishing touches!  With TAG Heuer Studio, you can coordinate your watch to match your business suit, your running gear or even your swimsuit. And if you fancy setting the wallpaper to show one of your own photos – perhaps a photo of a loved one, a beautiful sunset or a fond memory – you can give your creativity free rein, because anything is possible. Thanks to interactive counters, customers can choose to display up to three of their favorite apps on the dial: the number of steps taken, the number of calories burned, the dollar rate, free time before the next meeting... these are just some of the many options depending on your interests. Everything you need, at your fingertips.  A new TAG Heuer Connected app available on Android, with iOS support coming soon The new Companion app is designed to help you get started with your new watch and make the whole experience nice and easy. To take advantage of all the options available on these watches, Android users can download the new TAG Heuer Connected app to preview the various dials available and benefit from TAG Heuer Studio on a larger screen. You can also set your watch screen to show one of your own photos using this app. Coming soon TAG Heuer will soon be launching a brand new world exclusive time management experience: as modular as the watch faces, its unique watch display and companion app understand your plan for the day, and show you what you need to know about your meetings, tasks, calls, plans, travels and more. This isn’t about remembering to swing by for flowers at 6pm anymore – the new experience adapts to your schedule, and if you’re behind, it’ll still remind you when you’re on your way, even if that’s 15min later than originally planned. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is redefining time, for an experience that reflects the modern lifestyle. Stay connected and experience a watch that reflects what time means to you. TAG Heuer has worked closely with Intel and Google to create a luxury watch which combines connectivity and smart technology with Swiss watchmaking expertise. The watch is powered by an Intel Atom processor Z34XX series and operates on Android WearTM 2.0. Power meets technology, like in a modern GT car. TAG Heuer collaborated with Intel to engineer the smart technology behind the watch's superior performance and multitude of connectivity options including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS and NFC, and which also enables users to benefit from a wide range of functions offered under the Android Wear operating system. The motherboard is produced in Switzerland.  The final assembly step and testing are completed in TAG Heuer’s own workshop in La Chaux-de-Fonds. Featuring 4 GB of storage memory and a latest-generation lithium battery providing more than a full day of power, the TAG Heuer Connected is fitted with a small water-resistant microphone enabling the wearer to communicate with it using Google Assistant, as well as a sapphire crystal touchscreen, to be used alongside the command crown at 3 o'clock. What if the phone is off? No problem: the watch will continue to compute, display and exchange information while you have a Wi-Fi connection and so remain in contact with the Cloud. Naturally, the applications installed on the watch (music, timer, alarm, pedometer, etc.) remain active even when no connection is available. Thanks to the very latest Android Wear 2.0 update, iPhone users can now benefit from the almost infinite universe of platforms with apps available for download directly on that watch, and an enhanced ecosystem. The watch can easily be synchronized with a mobile phone operating on Android 4.3+ or iOS 9+. It is recharged using a contact charger. Simply place the watch on top to recharge it. Warranties and prices for Modular 45 The connected and mechanical modules benefit from a two-year warranty. This period – longer than usually offered on a product of this type - meets the same high warranty standards which luxury Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer offers for its timepieces. All the accessories (strap, buckle, lugs, charger) are covered by a one-year warranty. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is on sale from 1690 CHF, 1650 USD (ex.VAT), 1600 Euros, 1400 GBP, 13,100 HKD, 175,000 JPY (ex.VAT), 2300 AUD, 7350 MYR, 2400 SGD. A Deluxe box set including a connected watch (in grade 5 titanium, with titanium lugs and brown natural leather strap), complete with the prestigious COSC-certified chronograph Heuer-02T tourbillon mechanical module, plus an additional black rubber strap is available for a total price of 17,900 CHF/16,650 Euros/17,000 USD (ex.VAT).  The set comes in a magnificent presentation case with three drawers, complete with a desktop display stand to hold the watch and its charger.

Just last week we reported that Civil Liberties advocates are more concerned than ever about the warrantless collection of Americans’ communications, and representatives of the British government have warned that widespread use of big data is putting public privacy at risk. So a glimmer of good news from Facebook, which has finally announced that data about its users must no longer be used by developers to produce systems that can provide surveillance capabilities. Your Doctor App Could Amplify Your Health Anxieties On-demand digital consultations with doctors are convenient, but they could prove problematic. Technology is changing medicine, and new apps that provide a short video consult with a doctor for a small upfront fee are helping people save time by avoiding a trip to the hospital. But the app makers are observing that they’re proving popular with people who suffer from health anxieties. That raises ethical concerns: in many settings, such people would be so-called super-users who drive revenue, but here it may be more appropriate to suggest that they seek mental help. Ten Fascinating Things   American teenagers are less likely to use drugs than previous generations. The New York Times suggests that smartphones and computers may fill the void. Spinning sails, which use a physical peculiarity to generate thrust via interactions with the wind, were invented a century ago. Now they're making a comeback. When the emotions of an artificial intelligence system become more human-like, you might expect human-robot relations to blossom. That may not be the case. Researchers can now neatly determine how mammalian DNA is folded up inside a cell, revealing how parts of a genome are made readily available for use. Using laser pulses to guide electrons through semiconductors in computer chips could help make clock speeds far, far faster. In the village of Bana, Burkina Faso, locals don’t have a word for “gene”—which is making it hard to prepare the community for a malaria battle using GM mosquitoes. In the hostile conditions of Chile’s Atacama Desert, NASA has been testing a new breed of do-it-all Mars rovers. Researchers have shown that they can use audio tones to control accelerometers and influence devices like smartphones and wearables.

Significantly, this acquisition comes as the biggest one of an Israeli tech company, at $15.3 billion. The company noted that a subsidiary of Intel Corporation will start a tender offer; to acquire all issued and also the outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye, for $63.54 per share in cash. This represents an equity value of about $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion. The chip giant expects that this deal with Mobileye will close in around nine months. Intel Acquires Mobileye Mobileye is a tech company covering a wide range of services; including front and rear facing camera tech, mapping, and sensor fusion, among others. Starting from 2018, it will also start crowdsourcing the data for high definition maps; along with driving policy intelligence. In the long run, Intel will gain benefits of having a bigger range of various pieces that are needed for autonomous driving systems; along with having more relationships with different automakers. Mobileye’s CTO and co-founder, Amnon Shashua has informed that the tech company is working with 27 car manufacturers currently; including 10 production programs with BMW, Audi, and others. Meanwhile, Intel’s CEO, Brain Krzanich, said that the acquisition is a great step for the automotive industry, their shareholders, and consumers. He said that Intel Corporation provides foundational technologies; that include deciding the car’s path and making the real-time driving decisions. Meanwhile, Mobileye creates the best automotive grade computer vision and has a strong momentum with suppliers and automakers. He further added that these two companies together can boost the future of autonomous driving; and improve performance in the cloud to car solutions, at lesser costs for automakers. Biggest Acquisition by Intel Intel has confirmed that its autonomous driving division will be based in Israel; and it will be lead by Mobileye’s co-founder and CTO, Amnon Shashua. Intel’s SVP, Doug Davis will be responsible for overseeing that how both the companies are working together and report to Amnon Shashua. Working at a higher end in the self-driving market and technology can be considered as Intel’s major strategy. This way it can position itself and increase its goodwill in the emerging areas of autonomous technology and computing. Intel is not the only company that is acquiring and investing in computer vision, and autonomous technology based start-ups. The Santa Clara company knows it has a tough competition, which is why it is buckling up to raise its game. As a concluding fact, it is interesting to know that this is probably the largest Israeli tech acquisition in history. Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye is almost fifteen times bigger than the acquisition of Waze by Google, for $1.1 billion. Eventually, Intel expects a major opportunity of approximately $70 billion in the data, vehicle systems, and services market; after this acquisition.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 14, 2017 at 8:45AM For years, there has been very little intersection between Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) core businesses and Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM). Intel's revenue today comes primarily from sales of personal-computer processors, processors for enterprise and cloud servers, and networking applications. Qualcomm, on the other hand, makes most of its profit from licensing wireless technologies and patents, and generates most of its revenue by selling chips that go into smartphones and, to a lesser extent, other mobile devices like tablets. Image source: Qualcomm. For years, it has been widely known that Qualcomm was working on processors designed to attack Intel's data-center dominance; first commercial shipments are expected to begin in the second half of 2017. And for years, Intel has been going on about trying to attack Qualcomm's wireless-chip business -- achieving its first real success last year when it captured cellular-modem share from Qualcomm in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7-series smartphones. In other words, these two chip giants are on a collision course. Let's look at what each side could lose, what each side stands to gain, and what this coming battle might mean for investors in either company. Intel deals its major -- but potentially only -- blow In the past, Intel had told investors that it expected to compete broadly across the mobile-processor market. Indeed, the company said it was developing a whole stack of chips, designed to span everything from low-end smartphones to what the company referred to as "hero devices." In addition to those chips, Intel had been pursuing stand-alone cellular-modem efforts for quite some time, though with little success until recently. Investors might be aware that Intel canceled its pipeline of mobile-processor products and substantially reduced its investment levels there. (Intel said at its most recent investor meeting that from 2015 to 2017, its spending in mobile will go down about 55%.) So, Intel is, by and large, neutralized as a threat to Qualcomm's mobile-processor business. However, the company won a large portion of the cellular-modem spots inside Apple's iPhone 7 series of smartphones, which led to a reasonable bump in revenue for Intel and a corresponding decrement to Qualcomm's revenues. Qualcomm sharpening its knives Though Intel's mobile efforts ultimately translated into Qualcomm losing some business at Apple, Qualcomm's ambitions are much more significant. Qualcomm announced that it will be working with software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to bring personal computers running Windows 10 on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processors to market during the second half of 2017 -- directly attacking Intel's largest business. To make matters worse for Intel (and perhaps sweeten the deal for Qualcomm), Qualcomm seems committed to developing data-center processors for now. Significant share gains on Qualcomm's part (and corresponding share losses on Intel's part) -- should they occur -- aren't likely to happen overnight. However, Qualcomm's upcoming Centriq 2400 chips have already gotten Microsoft's blessing for its internal use, which lends credibility to the notion that major data-center customers may be willing -- and, frankly, eager -- to work with alternative suppliers rather than Intel. The upside and downside for each company For Intel, the only upside I see in this contest is its potential to gain some additional cellular-modem share from Qualcomm at Apple. The opportunity likely isn't that big from the standpoint of annual revenue, and that revenue would likely come at a much lower margin than Intel's corporate average. Right now, Intel's ability to hurt Qualcomm in its core wireless-chip business seems limited. The upside for Qualcomm, on the other hand, seems greater. It can take share from Intel in the latter company's core business of personal-computer chips, as well as its data-center business, starting from essentially zero share. Intel certainly has significant resources with which to defend itself, so it's probably not prudent for investors in either company to model in substantial market-share shifts to Qualcomm anytime soon. But, in terms of which company has more to gain and which has more to lose: The answers come up Qualcomm and Intel, respectively.

Sean Williams, Tim Brugger, and Brian Feroldi (TMFUltraLong) Mar 14, 2017 at 9:26AM The stock market has been in full rally mode since the November elections, but that doesn't mean a number of great stocks haven't been left behind. After some careful weeding, our Foolish contributors have come up with three great stocks that they believe are on sale and potentially ripe for the picking. Making the list were gold miner Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY), chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and entertainment technology company IMAX (NYSE:IMAX).  Image source: Getty Images. Make your portfolio shine with this stock  Sean Williams (Yamana Gold): Great stocks come in all shapes and sizes. One great company that looks to be on sale with a share price that's now well below $3 is gold miner Yamana Gold. Yamana was tripped up in February like most precious-metal mining companies after it reported its fourth-quarter earnings results. Though Yamana wound up generating $484.4 million in sales, a 10% increase from the prior-year period, and produced a $0.01 adjusted profit per share, a nice reversal of the $0.01 per share it lost in Q4 2015, this still wasn't good enough for Wall Street. The consensus had been for $489.9 million in revenue and $0.02 in adjusted EPS. Compounded with the potential for a Fed rate hike in March (higher interest rates are usually bad news for gold stocks since physical gold has no yield), Yamana shares took a pounding. However, this recent pain is your gain if you're looking for a great stock on sale. Yamana Gold has a laundry list of upcoming expansion opportunities that are going to dramatically increase its production, help lower its all-in sustaining costs (AISC), and crank up its cash flow over the next two or three years. Image source: Getty Images. In 2018, Yamana is expected to begin seeing commercial production from C1 Santa Luz and Cerro Moro. C1 Santa Luz is capable of 130,000 ounces of gold during its first year, with an average output of 114,000 over its first seven years, while Cerro Moro is anticipated to yield 130,000 ounces of gold annually. Also, the recently acquired Riacho dos Machados mine, which produces copper as well, is expected to nearly double its gold output to approximately 100,000 ounces annually by 2018. And finally, beginning in 2019 the Chapada mine in the Suruca development is expected to add between 45,000 and 60,000 ounces of gold for four of five years. In effect, Yamana's production is going to explode higher. In terms of cash flow, after producing $0.57 per share in 2016, Wall Street is forecasting $0.88 in cash flow per share by 2019. Considering that most gold and silver miners trade at roughly 10 times their future cash flow per share, Yamana appears completely undervalued at roughly three times its future cash flow per share. Yamana does have nearly $1.5 billion in net debt, which could certainly be weighing on its valuation, but with $600 million to $800 million annual in cash flow expected, it's perfectly manageable. Yamana Gold is on sale, and value investors should take notice. Patience is a virtue Tim Brugger (Intel): Though its stock price has slowly inched up the past year a solid, if not spectacular, 16%, Intel still can't seem to get investors to fully buy into its transformation. CEO Brian Krzanich is laser-focused on transitioning to a data center first provider, yet investors can't shake the notion that Intel is still reliant on PCs for growth. Since announcing record quarterly and annual revenue of $16.4 billion and $59.4 billion, respectively, to end 2016, Intel stock is actually down 5%. What? Image source: Intel. A surprisingly strong PC market helped Intel generate its record sales, but it was its data center, Internet of Things (IoT), and security revenue that put it over the top. Better still, each of those markets represents huge growth potential in the coming months and years. While its client computing segment posted a 2% annual increase in revenue to $32.9 billion, Intel's data center group jumped 8% year over year to $17.2 billion. When you add to that a 15% increase in IoT-related sales to $2.6 billion and 9% jump in security revenue to $2.2 billion, it's clear Intel's shift away from PCs is firing on all cylinders. Despite its recent successes, Intel stock is still an incredible bargain. At a mere 12 times forward earnings, Intel remains one of the best values in the tech sector. Toss in its 2.9% dividend yield and Intel isn't just a great stock on sale -- it's one of the top long-term growth and income alternatives around. Look beyond the headlines Brian Feroldi (IMAX): Profits in the movie industry are highly dependent on blockbuster hits, which is why I never place much emphasis on IMAX's results in any given year. Thankfully, the market doesn't always approach this stock with a similar long-term outlook, which occasionally affords investors an opportunity to buy this growth stock at an attractive price. I believe that's the situation that exists today, which is why IMAX's stock is a great bargain at the moment. Image source: Getty Images. 2016 proved to be a decent year for the movie industry, but the results looked quite tame when compared to 2015's. That caused IMAX to report full-year top-line growth of less than 1%, which is hardly worthy of an applause. However, the company actually had a blowout year if you look beyond the headlines. IMAX sold a record 319 new screens during the year, bringing its backlog up to 498. That provides investors with a lot of installation visibility over the next few years. What's more, the bulk of these installs features joint revenue-sharing agreements, where IMAX gets a cut of ticket sales. That should nicely add to IMAX's recurring revenue stream as these new screens come online. Another win for investors is that IMAX is taking on the potential threat of virtual reality head-on. The company announced a partnership with Alphabet to develop a next-generation VR camera. By experimenting now, it could possibly help to develop a new immersive experience that could only be obtained by visiting one of its theaters. That promises to keep ticket sales flowing even if VR takes off.  And yet, despite a growing backlog, the new partnerships with Alphabet, a deal extension with Disney,  and a slew of blockbuster titles waiting in the wings, shares are only trading for around 24 times forward earnings estimates. With the promise of double-digit profit growth over the next five years, I'd argue that 's a bargain. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The deal announced Monday combines Mobileye’s market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel’s hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination, expected to close by year’s end, will allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye’s leadership position, officials from the companies said. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Nearly all use Mobileye’s software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar, and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 different automakers. It also controls about 70 percent of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems that are in cars and trucks on the road today. Intel’s involvement and the big price tag show that autonomous cars are coming in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. “Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,” he said. Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the Internet and access to bigger data centers, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts. Automakers, Krzanich said, want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place. “If you put all of that together, you really get an end-do-end solution for autonomous driving,” said Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit. In the deal, Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The deal is the latest combination as automakers and technology firms race to build autonomous cars and for leadership in auto electronics. It moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google’s Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. The deal also is likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. Mobileye, with 660 employees, has been forming partnerships worldwide as its growth continued as a separate company. BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnered last year, and Mobileye teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Competitors also formed partnerships in 2016. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. Ford has invested $150 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne, and it recently announced a $1 billion purchase of budding robotics startup Argo AI. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the Intel acquisition of Mobileye, which he said was the largest deal in the country’s history. He said he’s been assured that the company’s operations will stay in Israel. “The purchase dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is coming true. Israel is turning into a global technology center,” he said. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel’s autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel, supporting both companies’ existing production programs and building on relationships with automakers, Tier-1 parts suppliers and semiconductor partners, the companies said. Mobileye’s stock jumped nearly 30 percent Monday to $61.25 in midday trading. Intel shares fell 2.4 percent to $35.06. ——— Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed to this report.     Tags: autonomous, mobileye, intel, companies, automakers, technology, Other stories from today: Facebook says its data can’t be used for ’surveillance’ Intel drops $15B on Mobileye in race for a driverless future Verizon had sought $925 million penalty for Yahoo’s lax security     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of electric cars?

With its new purchase, Intel is hoping to break into the driverless auto systems industry. (Photo taken from Flickr) Intel’s driverless shakeup Reuters reports that Intel has agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion on Monday. The deal could thrust the American company into the competition to develop driverless systems for global automakers. Intel has been looking to reach beyond its core computer semiconductor business, and the move promises to escalate the already high stakes among self-driving start-ups. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for driverless car systems would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Chinese to pay Kushners $400 million The family of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is set to receive more than $400 million from a prominent Chinese company that is investing in the clan’s marquee Manhattan office tower. The planned $4 billion transaction includes terms that some real estate experts consider unusually favorable for the Kushners—including both a sizable cash payout from the Anbang Insurance Group and an equity stake in a new partnership, Bloomberg reported. It is unclear whether the deal could prompt federal review, as has occurred when Anbang bought other properties in the United States, including Manhattan’s famous Waldorf Astoria. Airbnb IPO? Don’t hold your breath Airbnb might have just closed a billion-dollar funding round, but CEO Brian Chesky is in no rush to take his company public, according to Fortune. Speaking on Monday at the New York Stock Exchange luncheon, Chesky insisted that while the company is working to ensure it is ready to go public, the IPO process can take two years. Investors would do well to take Chesky’s statement with a grain of salt though, as he made a similar remark in a 2015 interview. Say goodbye to easy money The Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, signaling another nail in the coffin of its era of easy money, according to the New York Times. Economists also expect that the Fed will signal two more increases will be in the cards before the end of the year, barring any major economic setbacks. It’s not just the policy that is striking investors. Over the past month, half a dozen senior Fed officials made public comments that suggested greater collective confidence and unanimity that the economy is strong enough to handle higher borrowing rates.   Get a quick snapshot of the day’s most newsworthy business stories in your mailbox each morning.

Why Intel put a smartphone chip in Tag Heuer's $1,600 smartwatch Smartphone chips can extend the life of smartwatches, so they won't need to be replaced every few years Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 14 March, 2017 22:15 0 - - - - print email Do smartwatches need upgrades every few years like PCs? It's not clear yet, but Intel's powerful chip in the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45, a US $1,600 luxury smartwatch, will ensure the wearable isn't outdated anytime soon. The smartwatch, which runs Android Wear 2.0, uses Intel's Atom Z34XX, a smartphone chip. The Atom processor seems like overkill but extends the wearable's shelf life and adds processing power for artificial intelligence, a feature Google is building in Android Wear. The watch has a 1.39-inch AMOLED touch screen, and modularity is a big selling point of the wearable. The smartwatch's heads, straps, and other parts can be easily swapped, and buyers have the option to pick up one of 56 versions. The smartwatch can be turned into a mechanical watch by replacing the head. Swiss watches -- like the one made by Tag Heuer -- have been treated like family heirlooms and passed down from generation to generation. Keeping the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 relevant for as long as possible was part of Intel's thinking. Like in PCs, smartwatches could need upgrades as chips age and applications demand more resources. The Atom chip will last over multiple versions of Android Wear, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. The processor also brings many valuable security features to the chip, which are important for mobile payments via NFC, Bautista said. Later in the year, Intel plans to add AI features to the smartwatch via apps. For example, the smartwatch will be able to approximate when a person needs to buy milk by analyzing trends from multiple data sources. Those applications will need processing capabilities on the device, and the Atom chip can handle those needs. Tag Heuer is stressing the "Swiss made" aspect of the smartwatch, and the wearable has interesting tech in it. It has Wi-Fi, GPS, and 4GB of flash storage, and it can run applications like Google Fit. It is water resistant for up to 50 meters, partly because all the parts have been engineered into a compact cylindrical structure. Water won't pass through the headphone jack, a unique feature. The NFC goes through the face of the watch. The interfaces can also be customized. A smartphone chip in the smartwatch does affect battery life. In tests, the smartwatch ran for about 30 hours before needing a recharge, according to Intel. Intel last year said it would start making Atom smartphone chips. Older smartphone CPUs are now getting a new lease on life in devices like smartwatches. The company is optimizing chips and developing software to fit the profile of devices, Bautista said. The wearables unit isn't a major division at Intel, unlike PCs, IoT, or servers, but the unit wants to develop software and analytics tools as the world becomes increasingly connected. Collecting and developing software for biometric data is unique to wearables, which is why Intel is interested in the area, Bautista said. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch will be available worldwide starting on Tuesday. HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 More from HP Inc Join the PC World newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days.

Playing the name game with Intel’s object recognition software Object recognition tools are key for things like self-driving cars and surveillance systems, and Intel’s SXSW demo shows us how it works. Leah Yamshon (PC World (US online)) on 14 March, 2017 23:00 0 - - - - print email Intel does a lot of the heavy lifting to power some of our most-used products, working silently behind the scenes to make things run. But South by Southwest is far from a subtle, behind-the-scenes kind of place—and Intel’s pop-up lounge was full of demos that showed off what the company is doing in the AI space. My favorite demo may not have been flashy, but it showed off a key component of machine learning: object recognition. I held up a series of photos showing a wide variety of stuff—animals, people, vehicles, household items, plants—and the software correctly named it all. It also told me how confident it was in its answer, and many objects were named with 100-percent accuracy. The demo was limited to just 20 objects, but the full scale of Intel’s platform can process many, many more. This tech is key to the development of self-driving cars, and Intel has partnered with other engineers in that space to get more autonomous cars on the road. And if you’re a developer, you can even tap into Intel’s Deep Learning SDK to bring object recognition to your apps.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days.

Intel said Monday it is buying Mobileye in a $15 billion deal, the latest push by a major tech company into autonomous vehicles. DETROIT (AP) — Computer-chip-maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than $15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year's end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver's seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye's technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. "They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market." Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still haven't aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel's growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday's deal combines Mobileye's software with Intel's hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees. The deal moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google's Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. It's likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. The acquisition should have little short-term impact on competitors such as Autoliv and Continental, and Intel and Mobileye already are working with supplier Delphi and BMW to test cars, Jefferies analyst Ashik Kurian wrote in a note to investors. But in the long-term as the market moves toward more autonomous vehicles, the hookup "confirms our concern about the emergence of new large and well-capitalized competitors" threatening auto suppliers, Kurian wrote. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. That's below Mobileye's record high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the shares to $80. Mobileye NV's stock closed Monday up 28 percent to $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel's autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel.

But South by Southwest is far from a subtle, behind-the-scenes kind of place—and Intel’s pop-up lounge was full of demos that showed off what the company is doing in the AI space. My favorite demo may not have been flashy, but it showed off a key component of machine learning: object recognition. I held up a series of photos showing a wide variety of stuff—animals, people, vehicles, household items, plants—and the software correctly named it all. It also told me how confident it was in its answer, and many objects were named with 100-percent accuracy. The demo was limited to just 20 objects, but the full scale of Intel’s platform can process many, many more. This tech is key to the development of self-driving cars, and Intel has partnered with other engineers in that space to get more autonomous cars on the road. And if you’re a developer, you can even tap into Intel’s Deep Learning SDK to bring object recognition to your apps. Check out the video above for more.

Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately $15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in “autonomous driving” that could provide the technology at a lower cost. “The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” it said. “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030.” Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for “highly and fully automated driving” to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999 and employs some 660 people. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that “together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry.” “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” he said in the statement. “It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers.” Topics: Intel , Mobileye , self-driving vehicles , BMW iNext Related stories: PLDT HOME unveils new TVolution Stick by Intel Davao blast blamed on ISIS-linked Maute The CIA More from this Category: BSP to keep interest rates steady SMC’s net profit jumps 80% to P52b Megawide contests JG’s bid for Clark COMMENT DISCLAIMER: Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by The Standard.

(Miriam Alster /Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - After the Bank of Israel managed to rein in the shekel’s march on the dollar last week, buying up greenbacks to raise the value of the dollar against the Israeli currency, it faced a new challenge this week — one that the central bank may not be able to so easily overcome. In the wake of Monday’s announcement on the buyout of Mobileye by Intel, the dollar lost half a percent against the shekel, despite the U.S. currency’s general strength against other currencies — and that could be just the beginning, according to foreign-currency-trading experts FXCM Israel. “The Mobileye deal is likely to attract more investors to Israel,” as the “smart money” seeks out other Israeli tech investments. “The rush of investments is likely to further increase the value of the shekel,” the firm said, citing what it calls the “Mobileye Effect, which has been raising consciousness among investors around the world in the wake of the biggest tech deal in Israel’s history, and in Intel’s history as well.” According to an announcement by Intel, the company is set to buy all outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion. That sum is larger than the military and defense budgets for Israel. The state is likely to take in well over a billion dollars in taxes, money that will go to close budget holes and lower taxes. The dollar has again fallen to the NIS 3.66/dollar level, after massive purchases of dollars last week brought the greenback to the NIS 3.70 level. With the resources of Intel behind it, Mobileye will be expanding — doubling its office space and its workforce — and the new clout that the company has as part of the world’s largest maker of microprocessors makes Israel a center of auto technology, and especially self-driving vehicle tech. That is likely to attract more multinationals to Israel to invest in that area — already, several carmakers, including GM and Hyundai, have research and development offices and facilities in Israel — and bring with them more cash. Last week, analysts cited the announcement that the Leviathan gas field would soon begin exporting natural gas as a factor in the shekel’s strength along with the economy’s overall positive performance. “The shekel is likely to continue appreciating in the coming months,” the analysts said. “It is hard to argue with the factors that are contributing to this, including a current account surplus of 3.9 percent in 2016, and an increase in real investments of some 3 percent during the year. Israel is also benefiting from positive investments, especially in the technology sector.” Add to that receipts from sales of natural gas that are starting to pour in. Israelis, the analysts said, need to get used to the idea that their currency is among the world’s strongest, and is likely to remain that way for some time to come. Whether the Bank will engage in more dollar buying or throw in the towel to what appears to be an irresistible force — the strength of the Israeli economy — remains to be seen. If there was one “ray of light” for the Bank in its struggle to keep the shekel down, it was the likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve will decide to increase interest rates after it meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. That announcement will come at 2 p.m. Wednesday, New York time, and the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter percent. While that, not too long ago, would have been enough to accelerate the dollar’s value and a plunge in the shekel, that is not likely to be the case this time, said FXCM. “It appears that the scenario of a quarter-point increase in interest rates has already been factored into the markets and into the current value of the dollar,” the analysts said. “However, there is a strong danger that the dollar will plunge, and not only against the shekel, if U.S. interest rates are not raised.”   Filed under: Currency, Economy Print Email Gmail Related Dollar Falls Again After Bank of Israel $200M Intervention Report: Dollar Could Go Through Floor Stronger Dollar, Weaker Shekel Shekel-Dollar Exchange Rate Hits Three-Year Low Experts: Dollar Could Sink vs. Shekel After Positive Economic News More in Israel Greenblatt Has 3-Hour Meeting With Netanyahu Before Leaving Netanyahu Flies to China on Sunday — on Business Ben Gurion Named Number One for Duty-Free Shopping Parents Up in Arms Over School Mosque Bowing Incident ANALYSIS: In Week of Middle East Talks, Trump Envoy Avoids Disruption OP-ED The Intelligence Committee’s Hearing On Russia Won’t Satisfy Democrats A Head Start on Discrimination Antidote to Amalek More Can Be Done for Missing IDF Soldiers Mitzvos and “Making It” More Than a Buzz Cellphone Withdrawal Down the Conspiracy Rabbit Hole Laziness isn’t why People are Poor, iPhones Aren’t why they Lack Health Care.

Twitter Facebook Why Intel put a smartphone chip in Tag Heuer's $1,600 smartwatch Smartphone chips can extend the life of smartwatches, so they won't need to be replaced every few years Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 14 March, 2017 22:15 - - - - print email Comments Do smartwatches need upgrades every few years like PCs? It's not clear yet, but Intel's powerful chip in the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45, a US $1,600 luxury smartwatch, will ensure the wearable isn't outdated anytime soon. The smartwatch, which runs Android Wear 2.0, uses Intel's Atom Z34XX, a smartphone chip. The Atom processor seems like overkill but extends the wearable's shelf life and adds processing power for artificial intelligence, a feature Google is building in Android Wear. The watch has a 1.39-inch AMOLED touch screen, and modularity is a big selling point of the wearable. The smartwatch's heads, straps, and other parts can be easily swapped, and buyers have the option to pick up one of 56 versions. The smartwatch can be turned into a mechanical watch by replacing the head. Swiss watches -- like the one made by Tag Heuer -- have been treated like family heirlooms and passed down from generation to generation. Keeping the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 relevant for as long as possible was part of Intel's thinking. Like in PCs, smartwatches could need upgrades as chips age and applications demand more resources. The Atom chip will last over multiple versions of Android Wear, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. The processor also brings many valuable security features to the chip, which are important for mobile payments via NFC, Bautista said. Later in the year, Intel plans to add AI features to the smartwatch via apps. For example, the smartwatch will be able to approximate when a person needs to buy milk by analyzing trends from multiple data sources. Those applications will need processing capabilities on the device, and the Atom chip can handle those needs. Tag Heuer is stressing the "Swiss made" aspect of the smartwatch, and the wearable has interesting tech in it. It has Wi-Fi, GPS, and 4GB of flash storage, and it can run applications like Google Fit. It is water resistant for up to 50 meters, partly because all the parts have been engineered into a compact cylindrical structure. Water won't pass through the headphone jack, a unique feature. The NFC goes through the face of the watch. The interfaces can also be customized. A smartphone chip in the smartwatch does affect battery life. In tests, the smartwatch ran for about 30 hours before needing a recharge, according to Intel. Intel last year said it would start making Atom smartphone chips. Older smartphone CPUs are now getting a new lease on life in devices like smartwatches. The company is optimizing chips and developing software to fit the profile of devices, Bautista said. The wearables unit isn't a major division at Intel, unlike PCs, IoT, or servers, but the unit wants to develop software and analytics tools as the world becomes increasingly connected. Collecting and developing software for biometric data is unique to wearables, which is why Intel is interested in the area, Bautista said. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch will be available worldwide starting on Tuesday. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 device, will come with a hefty price tag. Back in February, rumors started swirling that Tag Heuer was looking for a follow-up device to its 2015 model. Flash forward to today and the company’s collaboration with Intel has officially come to light in the form of the Connected Modular 45 smartwatch. What sets this new device apart from the rest of the market is its modularity. Virtually every single component of the device can be swapped out for a different option, leading to numerous combinations and styles, as long as your wallet can afford them. Up to 500 style choices are reportedly available, with users being able to buy different modules, horns, bracelets and buckles, as well as 30 watch dial options. But if that’s not enough, customers can actually buy a mechanical watch module. That would seem to sort of negate the idea of a smartwatch, but to each their own. In terms of specifications, this is what the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 offers: 1.39” AMOLED touchscreen display Intel® Atom™ Z34XX processor 5 sapphire cover glass and durable titanium case More than a day of power 4GB of memory Water resistance to 5ATM Support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and Near Field Communications including Tap to Pay The device also comes with a sort of digital assistant from Intel, which is separate from Google’s own Assistant that comes in Android Wear 2.0. Intel’s system brings “a new experience of time” which can tell you if you’re late to the next meeting and hurry you on your way. The digital assistant will reportedly know what you’re doing at that particular moment, not just read your calendar and go off the time of day like most other systems do. It’s still a bit of a mysterious addition that won’t be there from the very start, but will come later according to Intel. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 will cost $1,600 and the device is available right now at the manufacturer’s website.

The American technology company announced it will buy Israel’s Mobileye in a deal valued at about £12.3 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. Getty Images 3 Intel will buy Israel’s Mobileye. The deal announced late on Monday combines Mobileye’s market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel’s hardware, data centres and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous car systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination, expected to close by year’s end, will allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye’s leadership position, officials from the companies said. EPA 3 The purchase will push Intel to the front of the driverless vehicle race. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in the United States, with nearly all using Mobileye’s software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar, and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 different automakers. It also makes software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems that are in cars and trucks on the road today. Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the Internet and access to bigger data centers, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts.

SILVER LINING Some relief for diesel drivers with announcement of free future valuations Automakers, Krzanich said, want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place. “If you put all of that together, you really get an end-do-end solution for autonomous driving,” said Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit. AP:Associated Press 3 Uber joined in partnership with Volvo as part of autonomous vehicle research. In the deal, Intel Corp. will pay £52.39 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 per cent premium to its Friday closing price. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at £12.6 billion. The deal is the latest combination as automakers and technology firms race to build autonomous cars and for leadership in life-saving electronics. Mobileye, with 660 employees, has been forming partnerships worldwide as its growth continued as a separate company. BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnered last year, and Mobileye teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Competitors also formed partnerships in 2016. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a £247 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. Ford has invested £124 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne, and it recently announced a £820 million purchase of budding robotics startup Argo AI.

Read the latest rumours on the 2017 MacBook Pro specifications, price and UK launch date. All the information you need about the new Apple MacBook Pro By Marie Brewis | 14 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When is the 2017 MacBook Pro release date? What are the rumoured specifications? All about the MacBook Pro 2016 How much does the MacBook Pro cost in the UK? In October Apple unveiled its long-awaited MacBook Pro with a fancy new Touch Bar, but we won't be waiting as long for the next update.New MacBook Pros with updated processors - potentially Intel Kaby Lake chips - are expected this year, . We outline the 2016 MacBook Pro UK release date, price and specification, plus new MacBook Pro 2017 rumours. See also: Best laptops 2017. Also see: Apple October Event as it happened | MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review When is the 2017 MacBook Pro release date? KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is predicting updated MacBooks with Intel Kaby Lake processor later this year. Kuo says new 12in MacBooks will enter mass production in Q2 (March), potentially with a new 16GB RAM model. Meanwhile new 13- and 15in MacBook Pros will begin mass production in Q3 (July). In Q4 (September) we could see a high-end 15in MacBook Pro with 32GB of RAM as "the most significantly redesigned product this year". What are the rumoured specifications? The notion of new MacBook Pros in 2017 is backed up by a new Bloomberg report. It says a new model is planned for later this year but it might herald a shift away from Intel processors. According to people familiar with the matter the chip, codenamed T310 and built ARM technology, will handle low-power functionality and work along the main Intel processor. This move could mean better battery life as moving the 'Power Nap' feature to the new chip will use even less power. Apple's ARM-based T1 chip is already in the latest MacBook Pro - see below. But what about AMD Ryzen? An article on Arcitosh.com suggests "AMD’s new Ryzen 7 CPUs look to promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel and offer a nicer philosophical fit for Apple." The current MacBook Pro isn't much faster than the model it replaced, since Apple looks to provide performance while conserving battery life. Arcitosh suggests that rather than producing its own or using Intel's chips to look for the ultimate performance per watt, it could instead use AMD's Ryzen CPUs.  As with Microsoft and the Surface Pro 5, Apple is apparently considering AMD for the 2017 MacBook Pro. In fact, it could be powered by the upcoming Raven Ridge APU - a combination of Ryzen chipsets for CPU and Vega-based chipsets for GPU. Raven Ridge was originally planned for 2018 but an updated roadmap shows a 2017 release instead. Watch this space for more updates. All about the MacBook Pro 2016 In October 2016 on the week of the Apple laptop's 25th anniversary, Apple announced the best MacBook Pro yet. There are 13- and 15in models with new all-aluminium designs that are significantly thinner and lighter than their predecessors, just 14.9mm thin and 3lb for the 13in model and 15.5mm and 4lb for the 15in model. The new MacBook Pros, available in Silver and Space Grey, have a two times larger Force Touch trackpad and a new context-sensitive Retina display Touch Bar that replaces the row of Function keys. Touch ID is also built-in with Secure Enclave and protected with Sapphire glass. The new Touch Bar consumed most of Apple's demonstration, and it does look cool. What functions it offers entirely depend on the app you're in. For example, you might get emoji in the Messages app, favourite sites in Safari, and options to reply or delete in Mail. In Photos are useful editing controls, and we particularly like the look of the quick type function in relevant apps, which may speed up typing. The keyboard itself has also been improved, with new second-generation Butterfly-style switch mechanisms that are more responsive and offer better travel. The new MacBook Pro is a sixth-generation Skylake machine with a 2133MHz Intel Core i7 inside (you can opt for a Core i5 in the 13in model). There's up to 2TB of storage via a superfast SSD, and in the 15in model AMD Radeon Pro graphics with up to 4GB VRAM (the 13in model has Intel Iris graphics). Apple says the 15in model is 130 percent faster than its predecessor on graphics, 60 percent faster for gaming, and 57 percent faster for video editing. The 13in model, meanwhile, is 103 percent faster than its predecessor for gaming, and 76 percent faster for both video editing and 3D graphics. The display is better than ever, now 67 percent brighter with 67 percent higher contrast and 25 percent more colours. Each MacBook Pro is fitted with four Thunderbolt 3 ports that can go up to 40GB/s. Each of these ports can be used for power or as Thunderbolt, USB-C, DisplayPort, HDMI or VGA connections. How much does the MacBook Pro cost in the UK? The new MacBook Pro comes in three models, all available direct from Apple. 1. 13in MacBook Pro without Touch Bar and Touch ID, 2GHz Intel Core i5 dual-core processor, Intel Iris Graphics 540, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 2x Thunderbolt 3.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 14, 2017 6:12 AM PT Credit: Tag Heuer More like this TAG Heuer's Connected Modular 45 is the Android Wear 2.0 watch you want but... TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45: Hands on with the swankiest Wear watch of all Intel pursuing new chips as it plots a wearables future Video Levi's and Google Jacquard bring you a connected jacket you'll actually wear Do smartwatches need upgrades every few years like PCs? It’s not clear yet, but Intel’s powerful chip in the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45, a US $1,650 luxury smartwatch, will ensure the wearable isn’t outdated anytime soon. The smartwatch, which runs Android Wear 2.0, uses Intel’s Atom Z34XX, a smartphone chip. The Atom processor seems like overkill but extends the wearable’s shelf life and adds processing power for artificial intelligence, a feature Google is building in Android Wear. The watch has a 1.39-inch AMOLED touch screen, and modularity is a big selling point of the wearable. The smartwatch’s heads, straps, and other parts can be easily swapped, and buyers have the option to pick up one of 56 versions. The smartwatch can be turned into a mechanical watch by replacing the head. Swiss watches—like the one made by TAG Heuer—have been treated like family heirlooms and passed down from generation to generation. Keeping the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 relevant for as long as possible was part of Intel’s thinking. Like in PCs, smartwatches could need upgrades as chips age and applications demand more resources. The Atom chip will last over multiple versions of Android Wear, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. The processor also brings many valuable security features to the chip, which are important for mobile payments via NFC, Bautista said. Later in the year, Intel plans to add AI features to the smartwatch via apps. For example, the smartwatch will be able to approximate when a person needs to buy milk by analyzing trends from multiple data sources. Those applications will need processing capabilities on the device, and the Atom chip can handle those needs. TAG Heuer is stressing the “Swiss made” aspect of the smartwatch, and the wearable has interesting tech in it. It has Wi-Fi, GPS, and 4GB of flash storage, and it can run applications like Google Fit. It is water resistant for up to 50 meters, partly because all the parts have been engineered into a compact cylindrical structure. Water won’t pass through the headphone jack, a unique feature. The NFC goes through the face of the watch. The interfaces can also be customized. A smartphone chip in the smartwatch does affect battery life. In tests, the smartwatch ran for about 30 hours before needing a recharge, according to Intel. Intel last year said it would start making Atom smartphone chips. Older smartphone CPUs are now getting a new lease on life in devices like smartwatches. The company is optimizing chips and developing software to fit the profile of devices, Bautista said. The wearables unit isn’t a major division at Intel, unlike PCs, IoT, or servers, but the unit wants to develop software and analytics tools as the world becomes increasingly connected. Collecting and developing software for biometric data is unique to wearables, which is why Intel is interested in the area, Bautista said.   The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch will be available worldwide starting on Tuesday.

The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair," she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise." The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the "very expensive transaction" improved Intel's position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye's earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands' NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye's shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel's shares were down 2.1 percent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc . Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC , which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. MERGING 'EYES' AND 'BRAIN' Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car." Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data." Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. BATTLE FOR SELF-CONTROL Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia.

The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair," she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise." The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the "very expensive transaction" improved Intel's position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye's earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands' NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye's shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel's shares were down 2.1 percent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu. Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive, which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. Merging 'eyes' and 'brain' Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car." Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems — the building blocks for self-driving cars — to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data." Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. Battle for self-control Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

It continues the dubious traditions of word salad branding and smartwatches that cost an arm and a leg, in this case $1,600. That’s $100 more than 2015’s Tag Heuer Connected, but what’s a Benjamin between low-tier luxury watch friends? Jerry Bautista, vice president of New Technology Group at Intel insists that this is much more than an Android Wear module in an expensive body. He says that Intel worked with Tag to build this watch like any other expensive mechanical watch, with exacting standards on the internals. The “modular” part of this watch denotes that you’ll be able to customize a ton of the parts of the watch before you buy it. You can choose different colors, “modules, horns, bracelets, and buckles.” And when the tech inside inevitably becomes obsolete, Tag will let you swap out the module for something mechanical or trade the whole kit in for a Heuer 02T Tourbillon Chronograph. (Tag’s trade-in program sounds weird, but it’s kind of clever, as Dan Seifert wrote in 2015.) Intel Before I get into the details, let me just set the context. On paper, this seems like a frustratingly good watch. It’s probably the most reasonably sized and reasonably specced Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch. Everything else out there so far this year is too big or has terrible battery life. It’s the one I would probably get and recommend... if it cost $1,300 less. It’s also an all-metal design, which is notable because Intel and Tag pulled that off without having to cut out NFC, which means this will work for Android Pay. Bautista says that the 1.39-inch AMOLED display is round without a flat tire, surrounded by a ring that contains all the necessary antennas for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It also manages to fit an ambient light sensor in, with a light pipe from the sapphire cover glass on the watch channeling down and inside to the board. Spec-wise, you’re looking at Android Wear 2.0 with Intel’s Atom Z34XX processor — they’re claiming even with ambient mode on you should get 30 hours of battery life. There’s GPS, too, though there’s no LTE or a heart rate monitor. It’s good underwater down to about 100 feet with a tympanic membrane over the microphone. Intel says it’s 13.2mm thick, which is still more than an Apple Watch but blessedly less than the massive watches other Android Wear manufacturers have been shipping lately. One last thing, and maybe the most interesting thing for most of us (aka people who can’t imagine spending $1,600 on a smartwatch): Intel is developing its own intelligent assistant that will eventually appear on this watch — and elsewhere. Bautista couldn’t tell me much about it, although he dropped some hints: It will be able to help based on your current activities instead of just the time of day. So, for example, it might realize you left work late and still give you your home reminders rather than annoy you by giving them to you when you’re still at the office. Like Siri and Google, it will be able to handle asking follow-up questions without losing context. Although it won’t be on the Tag at launch, it’ll come. It’ll also show up on other devices from companies Intel partners with, like Oakley. It won’t have a name or a gender. Its not super clear why Intel is putting its own intelligent assistant on a device that already has the Google Assistant, but Bautista insists that it’ll be differentiated and smart in its own way. Intel and Tag call it a “new experience of time,” which is precisely the sort of dangerous language that damages eyeballs from excessive rolling. I guess if Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon all have assistants, Intel just doesn’t want to feel left out. Intel Anyway, don’t buy the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 for the assistant, buy it if you like the look of the watch and don’t blink at spending $1,600 on a piece of jewelry. Google’s strategy with Android Wear 2.0 is to get as many different kinds of companies making smartwatches as it can. So I don’t have a lot of angst that an expensive Android Wear watch exists. The angst I do have is that this Tag seems like the best of the Android Wear 2.0 generation right now — everything in the sub-$500 range is either too big or has worse battery life.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Your Swiss smartwatch might very well have Intel Inside. Intel and Tag Heuer are unveiling the fruits of their alliance today with the Modular 45, a Swiss luxury watch that has all of the electronics and smarts of competitors such as the Apple Watch. The watch is modular, which means you can select the band, the buckles, and the watch face. You can also change the face on the dial by tapping on the screen and mixing and matching different options. “They’re all interchangeable,” said Tom Foldesi, vice president of connected products and technology at Tag Heuer, in a joint press conference at the luxurious St. Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco. Tag Heuer also held a parallel event in Switzerland. “This is a connected luxury Swiss watch. People have moved mountains to enable this project, on time and on spec.” Above: Tag Heuer’s Modular 45 watches. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Based on Google’s Android Wear 2.0 software, the watch is the second that Intel and Tag Heuer have worked on together. Among the cool features on this watch is near-field communication that lets you instantly pay for goods. Another cool feature: You can tell the watch to remind you to buy milk after work (via an app). And you don’t have to set the exact time for the reminder. The app, with its artificial intelligence, will remind you as you’re leaving work, based on its understanding of your global positioning system (GPS) data. Foldesi added, “It’s a connected watch that does not look out of place. Tech can be shoehorned into a wearable, and it may be a wearable you may not want to wear. This speaks to you as an individual.” Above: All the different versions of the Tag Heuer Modular 45 watch. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The entry-level watch costs $1,650, while the Tourbillon version of the watch costs $18,000. There are actually about 56 different possible versions of the watch, depending on what you choose in terms of faces (there are 11 of them), buckles, and straps. “Don’t drop it,” said Jerry Bautista, vice president at Intel’s new technology group, in an interview with VentureBeat. He also said that the smartwatch doesn’t necessarily take advantage of the performance side of Moore’s Law, the prediction that computing power will double every couple of years. Above: Guy Semon (left), Tom Foldesi, and Jerry Bautista. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi “You won’t have a 4-billion transistor server chip in this,” he said. “Except for the fact is that the chip was one that we once had in smartphones. There’s a phone-class processor in this watch, and that gives it good connectivity and high performance. It collects data from your body for hours at a time.” Where it does count is in the miniaturization and power management. Intel created antennae for the various Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS radios in the device by wrapping it around a band near the face of the watch. Meanwhile, the watch is encased in metal, which would otherwise make wireless reception much tougher. The battery life is about 30 hours. “With this approach, we get about 70 percent better Wi-Fi performance than we did on the prior watch,” Bautista said. Above: Tag Heuer smartwatches have Intel Inside. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The watch has a proximity sensor that can tell whether you are wearing the watch. That goes together with the near-field communication that enables you to make instant payments. If you are not wearing the watch, you might be prompted for a security code during payment. Foldesi said the design does not include a heart-rate monitor, as it is not a fitness watch and that feauture “was not a key to this.” “Luxury is like a pyramid. If you buy an entry-level car, you check off all the options,” said Guy Semon, general manager of Tag Heuer, in an interview. “You want value for money. If you buy an Aston Martin, you won’t check for what kind of GPS it has. You buy it because it is emotional. This watch is an emotional purchase. It combines the top technology of Silicon Valley and the best that we can deliver.” Tag Heuer does the final assembly of the watch at its headquarters in Switzerland. The watch is water-resistant to a depth of 50 meters. “This is a collaboration between the two companies,” Bautista said. “The engineering really goes deep.”   Above: A Tag Heuer employee shows off an Intel-based smartwatch.

Self-driving cars are widely seen as the future of transportation and a growth area, but the Intel deal depends on more than technology as it looks to expand revenue in an increasingly competitive nascent sector. The company's largest-ever deal, the $16.7 billion acquisition of programmable chipmaker Altera, has so far failed to meet its objective of helping to offset the continued decline in Intel's larger PC business. Intel also spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, last year in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, about five years after having bought the anitvirus software maker for $7.7 billion. "We can recall few cases where so much has been spent(habitually) to buy so little," said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Rasgon, who rates the stock "underperform", notes Intel has spent over $30 billion in the last few years, while only adding about $2 to $3 billion in revenue. Perhaps learning from those missteps, Intel's Mobileye deal is uniquely structured. The Santa Clara-based company's Automated Driving Group (ADG) will combine with Mobileye and will be led by Mobileye Chief Executive Amnon Shashua. Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said that Intel has previously attempted to fold acquisitions into its structure but they have not always been the right fit. Intel's deals for embedded systems software maker Wind River Systems and McAfee exemplified that strategy. "One of the things Intel has tried to do in the past is that they've taken a square peg, and they have taken a round hole, and tried to put it in a square peg," said Van Hees, who rates Intel a "buy". Intel, which is the largest private employer in Israel, hopes to bank on its experience to maintain Mobileye's startup culture, bringing Mobileye's "quick moving, fast acting culture" into Intel's autonomous driving division, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call with analysts. Intel, which has been looking to shift away from its traditional business, missed the smartphone boom in the last decade but analysts hope the company will avoid a repeat. "Investors should be pleased with the perspective that they(Intel) are getting in on this trend fairly early," according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.

(Nati Shohat/Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - The biggest business deal in Israeli history will also bring into the government’s coffers its biggest one-time windfall ever, with the tax man collecting an estimated NIS 4 to 10 billion, mostly in income, luxury and capital gains taxes from the Israeli shareholders of the company. Even at the lower end, the ensuing proceeds will enrich the state to an extent that all Israelis will benefit – both in increased spending on public projects, as well as in lower taxes. According to an announcement by Intel, the company is set to buy all outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion. That sum is larger than the military and defense budgets for Israel. Hours after the deal was affirmed by Intel on Monday, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kachlon jointly announced that they would be lowering taxes for Israeli middle-class taxpayers. The state was already running a surplus, and the Mobileye deal provides an even greater cushion for the government. “Over the past year the Israeli economy has broken growth records,” Kachlon said at a news conference Monday. “Our economic statistics are excellent and Israelis deserve to benefit from the fruits of their hard work.” According to Netanyahu, “this deal proves that the vision we are leading is coming true. Israel is becoming an international technological powerhouse. Not only in regard to cyber, but in regard to vehicles as well.” Along with a reduction in income taxes, sources in the Treasury said that the government would increase transfer payments to several groups, including the elderly and disabled. A reduction in VAT (value added tax) sales tax is also possible. Not everyone was happy about the tax breaks. Zionist Camp MK Amir Peretz said that Israel “remains at the head of the list of countries with large income gaps. The state continues to be unsympathetic to the needy. The proceeds should be invested in social services, such as providing the elderly with more services or easing the pressure on hospitals.” Meretz head Zehava Gal-on said that “Netanyahu and Kachlon smell elections in the air, and they want to sell the public a false narrative, pretending to be giving to the poor when all they are doing is enriching the already well-off.” About an hour after Intel confirmed the deal, Kachlon spoke with Mobileye cofounder Ziv Amiram, and congratulated him. “The best news about this is that we could retain the intellectual property of the company in Israel, that Mobileye’s management will remain in Israel, the brainpower remains in Israel, and the honor remains in Israel. As a result of this deal Israel becomes a center of the development of self-driving cars. This deal displays a strong faith in Israel and the Israeli economy.” The deal was not only the largest one in Israel’s history, but the largest in Intel’s as well. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is set to visit Israel Tuesday to meet Amiram and Mobileye founder Amnon Shashua. “This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers,” Krzanich said in Intel’s announcement on the buyout. “Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” According to Intel, the market for the vehicle systems, data and services with which Mobileye will be helping the company will be worth up to $70 billion by 2030.

The reason for Intel’s big buy is Mobileye’s self-driving car technology, which earns the company the plaudits of the local media. For Yedioth Ahronoth, the big issue is the breakdown of the booty among Mobileye employees. The two founders get $1 billion apiece, and their vice president takes home $11.3 million, while the deputy CEO gets a paltry $6.85 million. The more veteran employees “will become millionaires” from their cut of the $340 million divided between the staff. But the newcomers, according to the paper, will have to be satisfied with a relatively paltry “few hundred thousand shekels.” “By my estimation,” writes Yossi Vardi, “the father of Israeli start-ups,” — as Yedioth Ahronoth brands him in his Page 3 column — “we will continue to see more hi-tech companies being sold to big companies. I have no doubt that in the short term there will be a whole industry developing here connected to smart cars — there are today 400 start-ups in Israel that deal with this field.” The fact that the parent companies keep their Israeli subsidiaries here “is wise, and this will help the development of local industry,” he writes. “On the other hand, Israel needs to invest not just in children with five [course] units of mathematics — for the hi-tech industry to blossom it needs to place emphasis on children who are taking three courses.” Haaretz‘s financial pages break down the particulars of the deal, but the paper’s analyst Ami Ginzburg uses his column to rap Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for celebrating the sale as a boon for Israel. He acknowledges that Israel will get a bump in tax earnings and draw some new employees to the country with its future cooperation with Intel, “but what else?” The remainder of Ginzburg’s full-page analysis of Mobileye’s sale is a rambling speculation whose ultimate conclusion is a prognosticator’s equivalent of a shrug. “Will Mobileye under Intel turn into a giant company and realize its great potential in the developing world of autonomous and semi-autonomous cars? Will it become a company that brings in earnings of billions of dollars a year and employs thousands of workers?” he asks. “Only the future will tell.” He warns that not every buyout of an Israeli tech company has led to great success, citing Mercury Interactive’s acquisition by Hewlett Packard in 2006 and the closing of operations in Israel last year. “Is a similar fate expected with Mobileye? We can hope not,” he says. The bottom line for Israel Hayom is that the deal — which is mentioned on the front page — is expected to rake in around $4 billion in taxes for the Israeli government, “and bring a reduction of taxes” for the rest of us schlubs. Unlike the other papers, the free pro-Netanyahu daily is sure to mention that the prime minister and president expressed their pride in the success of an Israeli company. As one might expect from a hypernationalist publication like Israel Hayom, its op-ed writer Hezi Sternlicht regurgitate’s Netanyahu’s celebration of Mobileye’s success as that of the state. His headline calls the sale “A Mark of Honor for Start-up Nation,” and he says that if Israel is destined to “continue to see giant exits for Israeli companies, that don’t grow into ‘the next Teva’ [the Israeli pharmaceutical giant], it’s apparently not such a terrible fate.” The fact that Intel is convinced “that the way for it to grow and look ahead needs to be done through buying an innovative product of the Israeli brain” is “a certificate of honor, and it serves the Israeli economy by strengthening the brand value of the Start-up Nation,” he writes. Aside from the Mobileye exit, Haaretz also engages in rampant speculation in the aftermath of Monday’s terror attack in Jerusalem, the first in a dog’s age. “The terror attack in Jerusalem may augur the beginning of a new wave of violence around the Temple Mount,” reads the headline on Nir Hasson’s analysis. Valid point, but at the same time, it might not. He says that a series of recent incidents connected to the Temple Mount “raise concerns” of renewed Palestinian violence. But he doesn’t say who else is concerned besides himself and one analyst he spoke to. He points to a constellation of recent Israeli actions regarding the Temple Mount — from the inauguration of a visitor’s path at the Ophel that irked Palestinians, to the conviction last month of a Palestinian woman who assaulted an Israeli MK at the contested holy site, and the growing number of Jewish visitors to the Temple Mount — which, “as in the past, the Palestinians now connect between various incidents, that point, as far as they’re concerned, to a growing threat to the agreements regarding the Temple Mount, even if nobody on the Israeli side intends it.” Israeli officials are ignoring the building tensions, he says, which “are growing a month before Passover (the most important holiday for Temple activists), and two and a half months before celebrations for the 50th anniversary of uniting the city, and with the background of the US moving its embassy to Jerusalem.” The latter, it should be noted, is currently speculative at best. He then drags his personal political opinions into his unchecked speculation. Former US secretary of state John Kerry came to the rescue twice in recent years to calm tensions around the Temple Mount. “Without a responsible adult in Washington, and with many irresponsible adults in Jerusalem, there’s certainly cause for concern,” he says.

Read the latest rumours about the 2017 Mac mini specs, price and UK launch date. by Karen Haslam | 14 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When is the Mac mini 2017 UK release date? Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? How much will the Mac mini 2017 cost in the UK? What are the rumoured features of the Mac mini 2017? Will the Mac mini 2017 have a new design? Also, what is the Mac mini?! When will Apple release a new Mac mini in the UK? And what new features and design changes can we expect from the updated Mac mini in 2017? A new Mac mini is expected to launch in 2017, since the line wasn't updated at all in 2015 or 2016; but Apple (as usual) is giving nothing away. Nevertheless, based on past experience and the specs of current Macs, we've got a fair idea of what to expect from the new Mac mini, and when to expect it. We've got all the new Mac mini hints and rumours for you right here. Read on for the next Mac mini's likely release date, specs, design changes and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information is unearthed, so check back regularly for the latest Mac mini update rumours. And remember to check our Mac buying guide 2017 for current buying advice, and our guide to the best Apple deals. Last updated, 21 February 2017, to report on Apple's announcement of WWDC 2017, and to briefly discuss the chances of a new Mac mini appearing at the event; and previously with the news that Apple has officially made the Mac mini (Early and late 2009, and mid 2010) vintage and obsolete. When is the Mac mini 2017 UK release date? When will the next Mac mini come out? We think March 2017 is a decent bet. (Read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event.) There were rumours suggesting that Apple would do a low-key update to its Mac desktop range by the end of November 2016, focusing on the Mac Pro but potentially covering the iMac and Mac mini at the same time. But it seems Apple disliked the idea. Instead, we would expect the mini to be updated during the company's usual spring event in March 2017. Availability of chipsets may influence the timing of the launch. The next generation of Intel chips was made available to OEMs in Q4 2016 - they're called Kaby Lake, and it's possible that the new Mac mini could feature processors from this batch. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We'll talk about processors, and other specs, in a later section of this article. The next slot in Apple's launch calendar after its usual spring event is WWDC. WWDC 2017 has just been announced, and while this event always focuses primarily on software (iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 will be the headline announcements), there is sometimes room for hardware. If we still don't see a Mac mini update by this point, it's probably safe to assume that Apple has killed off the Mac mini line - a possibility we address in the next section. Apple last updated the Mac mini on 16 October 2014 after a two-year wait: the previous model came out on 23 October 2012. Mac mini fans are now waiting for the next iteration of the smallest and cheapest Mac. See also: New iMac release | New Mac Pro release Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? Apple, to paraphrase a colleague, is generally very good at killing its darlings: at knowing when it makes sense to drop a much-loved product or product feature - one which is often still popular and/or profitable - and switch focus to something else that has more of a future. Think the iPod classic or the optical drive, or dropping the headphone port from the iPhone 7. There are a couple of candidates to be the next iPod classic. The MacBook Air is one. But the Mac mini, which hasn't been updated since 2014, is rarely mentioned at events, and feels surplus to requirements now that the Apple TV is making its claim as a media centre device (although for storing a large number of films the mini remains an excellent choice, offering 500GB as standard and up to 2TB as a configuration option), will be expecting a P45 more than most of Apple's product line-up. The design of the Mac mini hasn't changed significantly since it was first launched and is starting to feel a little dated, and the device doesn't have a clear selling point (or at least, Apple isn't doing a good job of communicating one). So it wouldn't surprise us if Apple quietly retired the line at its next Mac launch event. It's either that or give it a radical overhaul. If Apple does kill off the mini, we'd have to start asking questions about the 'mini' branding in general, and wondering if the iPads are going to be reorganised: there's already a sense that the 'Air' brand is on the way out, across both MacBooks and iPads. But that's a story for another day. How much will the Mac mini 2017 cost in the UK? There are currently three models of the Mac mini available; the one that's best for you will depend on your budget and computing needs. The cheapest model currently costs £479, the middle model is £679, and the priciest model is £949 - this is a price increase since its launch, likely due to Brexit. Of course, you'll still need to factor in the price of a monitor, keyboard and mouse. (For advice on that, see our roundups of the Best Mac monitors, Best Mac keyboards and Best Mac mice.) However, we don't anticipate Apple reducing the price with the new model when it launches, so you can expect similar pricing. Hopefully better specs for your money, though, of course. Which leads us on to... What are the rumoured features of the Mac mini 2017? The Mac mini is Apple's most budget-focused desktop system and as such features relatively low-end components. But what specs upgrades should we expect from the next Mac mini? Processor: The Kaby Lake question It's unlikely that Apple will include an AMD processor in the next generation of Mac minis... unlikely, but not out of the question, given that AMD's new CPUs are set to come out this year. We'd rate the chances of an AMD chip appearing in the 2017 Mac mini as slight. However, we do expect Kaby Lake, the latest generation of Intel chips. Intel has now started shipping its Kaby Lake processors. But the key word there is 'started': the Kaby Lake processors that would be suitable for a Mac mini may not appear for some months, assuming Apple decides to plump for a Kaby Lake chipset at all. According to MacRumors, in fact, mini-appropriate Kaby Lake chips may not roll out until very late 2016 or even early 2017, so any Mac mini launched before then would be limited to Skylake, the previous generation of Intel processors. That would still represent a significant power boost over the current Haswell processors. Kaby Lake supports Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2, as well as 4K video. The chips are manufactured using a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake. The next generation, Cannonlake, will switch over to a more accurate 10nm process. As we discuss in our iMac rumour roundup, Intel has laid out a roadmap for its next four generations of processor. After Skylake and Kaby Lake, Intel will release Cannonlake, then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019. Read next: Mac mini vs MacBook Air  Graphics Our iMac predictions also include new graphics chipsets: Polaris 10, by AMD, which is particularly interesting because it may make the next iMacs VR-ready. But the current range of Mac mini models feature integrated graphics, and we expect this to remain the case in the next generation. RAM Right now, the entry-level Mac mini features just 4GB RAM as standard, which we think should be ramped up to 8GB in the new entry-level model. Storage The other big change we hope to see in the new Mac mini is the addition of more flash drive options. Currently the 2.8GHz model comes with a Fusion Drive, or you can add 256GB flash storage to that model, or the 2.8GHz model. While the 500GB hard drive in the current entry-level model (and the 1TB hard drive as standard in the £569 model) might appear attractive to some, flash memory is so much faster that we believe it is well worth the compromise of storing additional files on an external hard drive. However, it seems unlikely that Apple would do away with the hard drive storage option altogether, as many workgroups choose the Mac mini as a server and will need the extra capacity and lower prices that HD storage makes possible. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook Air release | New MacBook release USB-C It's felt like the USB port has been on borrowed time ever since Apple launched the first-gen 12-inch MacBook - with its lone USB Type-C (or, more commonly, just USB-C) port for both data and charging - in 2015. Like the optical drive circa 2012, it seems likely that bog-standard USB 3.0 is no longer in Apple's thoughts, and (unless the market rejects USB-C comprehensively, which despite some qualms about there only being one port on the MacBook, hasn't happened yet) it's surely a matter of time before the rest of the Mac line-up switches across to the newer tech. USB-C offers more advantages than just being reversible and thereby easier to connect when you can't see what you're doing; in theory, it offers twice the data throughput of USB 3.0 and the ability to deliver far more power. The latter factor enabled Apple to use USB-C as a combined data and power port and further slim down its laptop design. Our feeling is that the Mac mini won't be next on Apple's update list, however - our money's on the revamped MacBook Pro. As a budget-focused (and somewhat neglected) line, the Mac mini isn't likely to get the love and cutting-edge componentry of more favoured products. And power delivery - and the ability to remove extraneous ports and slim down the chassis - is far less of a concern for a static machine like the mini than for a portable like the MacBook. Will the Mac mini 2017 have a new design? It's possible that the Mac mini will get a new design. We're not expecting a major visual or build redesign, but it is certainly possible that it could get thinner and smaller, especially since it no longer has to accommodate a CD drive. Right now the dimensions are 3.6cm high, 19.7cm wide, and it weighs 1.22kg. How about a Mac mini that has similar dimensions to an Apple TV? (That's 9.8cm wide, 2.3cm high, and a weight of 0.27kg.) There was some speculation that the reason for the long delay prior to the Mac mini update in 2014 was that Apple was looking at redesiging the Mac mini along the lines of the Mac Pro. This was probably intended as an April Fool's Day prank, but we like this render of a flat Mac mini, as seen on Apple User. Even better, how about a Mac mini that's also an Apple TV? Adding Apple TV functionality to a Mac mini would be a great way of getting the Mac mini into people's living rooms as a home entertainment device. Also, what is the Mac mini?! Not the no-brainer it might sound like to keen mini-heads: plenty of otherwise tech-savvy folk aren't aware the Mac mini even exists. Indeed, sometimes it seems like Apple itself isn't aware of its presence. That would certainly explain the long gap before the 2014 model was launched. The Mac mini is Apple's smallest desktop Mac and also its cheapest Mac, at £479. It's a full-blown OS X or macOS Sierra desktop that fits into a self-contained chassis no bigger than a set-top box. It's an inexpensive living-room Mac that lacks the power of even some MacBooks and comes with no keyboard, mouse or display, but one that works perfectly as the centre of your digital home - not least because it comes with HDMI sockets, so that plugging it into a modern TV is a doddle. There used to be a Mac mini with OS X Server available for £849 but Apple removed that option from the line-up in October 2014.

Yesterday, the global semiconductor giant Intel announced that it would acquire the Israel- based startup Mobileye N.V. for $15.3 billion. Founded in 1999, Mobileye has developed computer vision software it says can propel self-driving cars into the mainstream. The value for data systems within the autonomous vehicle market will reach $70 billion by 2030, according to Intel estimates. And McKinsey projects that 15 percent of all automobiles will be fully autonomous by 2030. Last summer, Morgan Stanley estimated that the entire driverless car sector could be worth $2.6 trillion at the end of the next decade. From Intel’s point of view, its purchase of Mobileye is necessary to compete in an emerging sector ripe with opportunities. This industry is now dominated by the global automakers and upstarts such as Tesla Motors, as well as technology and ride-sharing companies like Google and Uber. If Intel hopes to continue to placate its shareholders, the company must venture beyond the hyper-competitive and commoditized semiconductor market. Analysts have noted that Intel missed the boat when the time was right to seize opportunities within the smartphone market – and its continued strength in the personal computer and server market is not a sure long-term bet. Therefore, a forward-looking eye on the self-driving market makes sense. But this acquisition is not without risk. Bloomberg’s Tara Lachaelle noted that when measured on an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) basis, Intel just dived into one of the most expensive takeovers since the heady dot-com days around the turn of the century. Investors responded in kind. As of press time, Intel’s stock price was down 2 percent. Nevertheless, Intel purchased one of the world’s leading self-driving car technology firms, and one that can boast a track record of almost two decades. Headquartered in Jerusalem, the company says it has at least 450 engineers working a bevy of software systems, including the LiDAR-based driving technologies that allow an autonomous car to ‘see’ what is on the road and eliminate the bane of commuting: human error. As LiDAR (light detection and ranging) software evolves and proves to be more sophisticated, watch for self-driving cars to become more of a reality. Hence the fierce competition — and even litigation: Google, for example, recently sued Uber for patent infringement, unfair competition and the stealing of trade secrets related to autonomous cars. Tesla has also staunchly defended its turf and taken a former engineer to court for allegedly poaching employees as he launched his own self-driving car software startup. Meanwhile, the conventional automakers are considering their own chess moves, as it makes more sense for them to develop what are currently expensive software systems in-house, rather than having to license the technology or attempt what would be a far more expensive acquisition in the future. In early 2016, General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft as it viewed that ridesharing company as a ticket to continued viability in a rapidly evolving automobile market. And last month, Ford Motor Co. plunked $1 billion on an artificial intelligence company that in the future could be the brains behind its driverless cars. The rise of autonomous vehicles will most likely mean fewer cars on the roads, so everyone is scrambling to snag their pieces of the pie — and, in the meantime, creating a bubble that may burst before these next generation of cars even become a common sight on the streets.

The S&P 500 traded in its tightest range of the year, in and out of slight losses, while the CBOE Volatility index was on track to close at its lowest in more than a week. Shares of Mobileye jumped nearly 30 percent to a high of $61.51 after chipmaker Intel agreed to buy the driverless technology maker for $15.3 billion. Mobileye closed up 28.2 percent at $60.62 and Intel fell 2.1 percent to $35.16. Investors looked ahead to the Fed’s two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday. Traders saw a 94 percent chance that the U.S. central bank will lift interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. “Other than the Fed on Wednesday I don’t see anything going on to make any (investment) decisions on,” said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. “Intel buying Mobileye is the story of the day, moving into that market sector,” he said, adding they advised some clients to “fade in” into Intel stocks. “We think this is a very good support point,” said Mendelsohn. Nvidia rose 2.8 percent to $101.85 while Delphi Automotive added 4.0 percent to $80.20. Both are involved in developing technology for cars. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,881.48, the S&P 500 gained 0.87 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,373.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.06 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,875.78. Citrix Systems jumped 6.8 percent to $84.93 after Bloomberg reported that the cloud-services company is working with advisers to seek potential suitors. Wynn Resorts gained 4.8 percent to $104.30 after Morgan Stanley reiterated its “buy” rating and said the company could gain a meaningful market share in Macau. About 6.14 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.93 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 107 new highs and 48 new lows. The S&P 500’s average true range hit 5.9, its lowest of the year. The year-to-date average of that daily measure of volatility is 14.   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion A missing comma keeps Oakhurst Dairy labor lawsuit alive Out-of-staters owe Maine almost $17 million in taxes Plow drivers stranded on I-295 escape unharmed — ‘except their pride’ What snowplow drivers really think of people who drive in a storm Caribou man charged with threatening business owner Downsizing Maine’s bottle redemption program would be a recycling disaster This is no time to sow doubt about climate change I should not lose health insurance so the wealthy can get a tax cut Friday, March 17, 2017: A solution for daylight saving time, Real ID trouble, Trump stocks the swamp Thursday, March 16, 2017: Border wall a costly investment, time to consider the 25th Amendment, tax carbon emissions UMaine nursing major claims third straight national wrestling title The Bruins little ball of hate becomes a star Linebacker Hightower returns to Patriots on $43.5M deal UMaine wrestling club team captures national championship Positive mindset, determination fuel Washburn star’s track success STATE & CAPITOL Data undercut LePage claim that many dump private insurance for Medicaid STATE & CAPITOL LePage says he didn’t sign emergency budget bill because of provision he proposed STATE & CAPITOL LePage didn’t sign his own supplemental budget bill MAINE AT WAR You’ve got the wrong guy in that coffin!

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Intel buying Mobileye for $15.3bn By Sead Fadilpašić News  Intel is joining the autonomous vehicles race. Shares American technology giant Intel announced this Monday that it’s buying Israeli company Mobileye for $15.3 billion. With this acquisition, Intel is joining the race to produce autonomous vehicles.  This is the largest overseas acquisition in the history of Israeli companies, local media state. The company will, together with Intel’s autonomous driving department, be headquartered in Israel. It will be led by Amnon Shashua, Mobileye president and co-founder.  Both Intel and Mobileye have already cooperated with German BMW to create autonomous vehicles. They expect the merger to create a global leader in the autonomous vehicles segment. This could mean lower prices for the consumers, as well.  “The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” it says sin the press release. Announcing the agreement, Intel says autonomous cars have “progressed from assisted driving to being fully autonomous”, and have such become data centres on wheels. It is estimated that such vehicles will create four terabytes of data daily, by 2020.  “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030,” the report also says. “This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO. “Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car’s path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” Image Credit: StockStudio / Shutterstock Topics intel Mobileye autonomous vehicles self-driving cars acquisition Load Comments GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

Among our favourite convertible Windows-based laptops is the Lenovo Yoga series, which has been tweaking its 360-degree hinge-based formula over the years. In the Lenovo Yoga 910 that means ultra power, ultra slimness and an ultra-trim bezel around the screen - which brings this fashion-focused, adjustable laptop in-line with its nearest Dell XPS competitor. The Yoga 910 is quite the ultra-laptop at first glance, then, but having used one for a week does it disappoint in the details? Lenovo Yoga 910 review: Design 323 x 224.5 x 14.3mm; 1.29kg Watchband hinge for 360-degree rotation Edge-to-edge screen with minimal bezel Grey, silver and champagne gold finishes The age of giant bezels is almost over. That's the thing that immediately sets the Yoga 910 apart from most of its competition: the edge-to-edge display style which fills to the side and upper edges with mere millimetres of the black stuff. Pocket-lint Well, it's sort-of edge-to-edge. Like any screen there has to be some bezel to contain the display, but it's the lower bezel that perplexes - because it's about 10 times thicker, like a large black bar across the bottom of the screen. It undoes some of the other three bezel edges' achievements. That aside the Yoga 910 is one ridiculously good-looking laptop. Sure, that "watchband" hinge could be a little too bling for some tastes, but we think it looks sophisticated and, especially in its grey/silver finish, understated compared to its champagne gold-colour alternative (no whacky orange colours are available for this newer generation). For a 13.9-inch laptop the Yoga 910's 14mm thickness is slim, but doesn't lead to the abandonment of the traditional USB port. There's one USB 3.0 fitting, along with two C-Type connections on the opposite side of the device. So Lenovo could have probably made the 910 thinner still by ditching the full-size port, but we prefer the future-proof yet "today-ready" out-the-box approach. The laptop's aluminium shell feels solid, while the grey finish model on review has a soft-touch finish on both its lid and interior sections. The trackpad and separate fingerprint scanner each cut their way into this material finish with more spangly embossed chamfered edging that adds to the classy look. Pocket-lint We won't dwell on the hinge as its concept is simple: use it to swivel the screen all the way around to tablet-like form; allow the laptop to stand upright in stand mode; flip it over in a v-shape for tent mode; or use it like a simple laptop with the screen titled at any given angle. It moves easily, holds into position incredibly well and is an elegant solution indeed. Lenovo Yoga 910 review: 4K screen 13.9-inch touchscreen panel 3840 x 2160 4K UHD resolution There's no doubting the Yoga 910's impressive screen. Because of the trim bezel, which we've already waxed lyrical about, the laptop can squeeze a 14-inch screen into typical 13-inch real-estate. Pocket-lint This Lenovo is almost identical in width to the smaller-screen Apple MacBook Air… it just happens to be taller, given that thicker bezel arrangement at the bottom. This size of laptop is perfect to cart around and use when on the go, or pop on a desk and use as your household laptop too. Beyond the scale, Lenovo hasn't scrimped in terms of resolution in the Yoga 910. Even at its entry-level (for the UK market) it comes with a 4K panel (3840 x 2160 pixels; elsewhere in the world there's a Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) model). There's an eye-watering amount of detail on display - we've really noticed the difference compared to our usual MacBook Air, with photos displaying that additional fidelity where available. However, such ultra-high resolution might see you need to adjust icon sizes within Windows, otherwise things can look tiny across the desktop and it makes using the touchscreen a little bit fiddlier. But it's easy to adjust as you please. Pocket-lint Brightness is ample and can auto-adjust, or you can tweak the levels using the shortcut hotkeys. Sometimes when at supposed maximum brightness, however, the system will suddenly kick in an additional notch of brightness rather than it seemingly being available via manual selection, which is strange. Reflections aren't to excess, but the screen is glossier than our day-to-day Air. Lenovo Yoga 910 review: Keyboard and trackpad Full size, backlit keyboard Responsive trackpad Fingerprint scanner (Windows Hello) Given the Yoga 910 is fairly slim its keys don't have a huge degree of travel, but we've found it sufficient and comfortable with a crisp action. The way the keys sit in a sunken tray and the backlight kicks in when it's dark is in-line with other high-end laptops with full-size keys. The only downside is the small-scale shift keys. Pocket-lint The trackpad is a responsive experience, too, but can misbehave from time to time. Its setup is unusual in the laptop world: its split down the middle from left to right, with each portion of the pad acting as a traditional left/right click on a mouse - so too often we would end up with pop-up menus on screen, rather than clicking through. It's ultra-responsive for tracking, too, so navigating around the screen is fast and effective. However, sometimes mean the deftest touch will act as a click when not desired. Until you get used to it, this ultra-responsiveness might be initially irritating. Once you are used to it, however, going back to another trackpad will feel unresponsive by comparison. Pocket-lint One other addition that you'll notice on the Yoga 910 is a secondary sunken pad, beneath the right arrow key. Herein lies the fingerprint scanner for use with Windows Hello for rapid login. It's a great idea with the potential to expand deeper into secure payments and beyond. Not an essential, but a nice-to-have that lacks on much of the competition. Lenovo Yoga 910 review: Over-powered performance Intel Core i5 / Core i7 options 8GB - 16GB RAM options 256GB - 512GB SSD options No discrete graphics; Intel HD built-in Now the Yoga 910 comes in various forms, with varying degrees of power available. That ranges from the £1,299 entry-level 4K model, with an Intel Core i5 and 8GB RAM, through to an Intel Core i7 with 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD for £1,749. Pocket-lint We've got the maximum settings model on review, which might well be Lenovo's way to show off just how much a slender laptop can do, but it also shows off just how flawed this concept is: because of the Yoga 910's design it can't dissipate heat particularly well and, given the high-end 7500 CPU, that means the fan kicks in at the drop of a hat. And that fan noise is horribly irksome. We've been to audio labs before; we know that laptop makers test laptops in anechoic chambers to get a sense of how their fans sound. It's almost as though Lenovo bypassed that stage with the 910 as with one Edge browser window open the fan will kick in under little pressure. Sync Bluetooth with nothing else running and - even when rested on its side so the hottest area won't be touching material and therefore letting air best reach in and out of the unit - that fan noise is relentless. We're in discussion with Lenovo and awaiting a second model for review because the earlier Yoga 900 model didn't pose such issues for us. It could well be a glitch in this particular model - something a second sample and review update will address in the near future - but we suspect it's simply that the highest-end processor option is too much for this design form. Pocket-lint Our advice, therefore, would be to look for the so-called lower-power Intel Core i5 model because, frankly, there's still plenty of power on offer there. And as no models offer discrete graphics, the gap between one model and the next is unlikely to make a huge difference for most day-to-day tasks - unless you're always crunching through batches of big images or video, for example. Lenovo Yoga 910 review: Battery power With so much power under the hood and a 4K panel to render, battery life in a slim laptop is always going to take a hit. Even Lenovo thinks the 4K option will deliver a third less life per charge than the Full HD model (which you can't buy in the UK, so forget about that). Pocket-lint Actually, even with the fan whirring away, we've not found battery life to be that bad. A bit of browsing, word processing and some music playing saw a full charge dip to 35 per cent charge over around seven hours. We would expect eight hours of use per charge to be reasonable, which is better than, say, a Surface Pro 4 or similar. Verdict To look at the Lenovo Yoga 910 is an absolute triumph. That trim bezel, ultra-high resolution and great-looking watchband hinge ensure it's one of the most striking laptops on the market, without overdoing the bling. But there's a big problem with our review sample: the fan noise as a result of, we suspect, overpowering the innards in this slender design is horribly irksome. For a laptop this pricey that shouldn't be an issue; but it's a big one, kicking in with the most menial of apps open (we wouldn't cite it as an issue if it only happened when running heavy apps). It could be an isolated incident, so we'll update this review upon receiving a second, lower-power sample if we find that to be the case. That's the Yoga 910 in short: it looks great, many elements are very well considered, it's ultra-powerful and ultra-portable given its size. But all that wonderment is scuppered by going big on the power. It's like buying a supercar with a wheel missing. And that wasn't the case with our earlier Yoga 900 or fan-free Intel Core M-powered Yoga 900S models, so those are, unexpectedly, the better options to track down. The alternatives to consider... Pocket-lint Dell XPS 2-in-1 Dell has made the smallest 13-inch convertible laptop thanks to its infinity display - the minimal bezel design, which Lenovo has largely captured in its Yoga 910. Similar price points between those two do-it-all convertibles ought to see stiff competition. Read our first-look preview: Dell XPS 2-in-1 preview: The convertible king? Pocket-lint Apple MacBook Pro If you're not about Windows 10 and fancy Apple's latest OS X then the MacBook Pro provides a quieter, more traditional laptop experience with plenty of power to boot. There's no touchscreen, but that's where the Touch Bar comes into play, keeping the laptop's screen nice and clean as a result. Read the full review: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: A touch of brilliance or totally brainless?

And what tech specs, new features and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2017? Or is it more likely that Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? We've had a long wait for the new Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013, shipping that December, and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. In addition, many of the Mac Pro's traditional creative professional audience (videographers, designers, photographers) have hung onto their ancient Mac Pro towers that predate the 2013 redesign because their old Mac Pros, which could be customised, offered more flexibility and power, at least at the time Apple launched the new-look 'trash can-style' Mac Pro. So we're long overdue an update to the Mac Pro before creative Mac professionals turn towards Windows and Linux for their workstation needs... those that haven't already turned their back on Apple, at least. Some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued, though, we look at the reasons why they think that below. If Apple is going to launch a new Mac Pro when are we likely to see it? And what hardware improvements, design changes, tech specs and new features will we see in the new Mac Pro for 2017? Read on to find out everything we (think we) know.

And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide 2017. Updated 1 March 2017: Tim Cook has been talking about the importance of the professional and creative markets in the biggest hint yet that a new Mac Pro could be on the way... See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours Some Apple appreciators are even working on concept images and videos of what an updated Mac Pro could look like. A concept video by a French designer sees the Mac Pro take the route of looking like an iMac while borrowing a lot of ideas from the Microsoft Surface Studio. Take a look for yourself here. Will Apple update the Mac Pro? There is always going to be the question of whether Apple will turn its back on the Mac, with the iPhone becoming such a significant part of its business, and with Steve Jobs having said that the desktops days were numbered when he spoke about how the iPad would revolutionise computing. However, we can confidently say that Apple isn't turning away from the Mac desktop just yet, based on CEO Tim Cook's comments below. Further comments from Tim Cook indicate that Apple isn't about to give up on the professional market either. Speaking at the Shareholders meeting on 28 February 2017, Cook indicated that Apple is still focused on its professional customers and has plans to "do more" in that area. Cook said: "You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular. "Don't think something we've done or something that we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere," Cook added. However, the 'and' between 'creative' and 'professional' could be telling, and a way out of giving a clear answer about the Mac Pro (or the iMac or FCP). Regarding Cooks comments, our colleague on Digital Arts suggested that the "people who are creative-but-not-professional and professional-but-not-creative would probably look to the MacBook Pro (which is fine for photo-editing and Office)". He feels that the MacBook Pro is more suited to people who see themselves as creatives, rather than creative professionals. Could the same be said to apply to Mac Pro users. Regardless of nitpicking about what constitutes a 'creative professional', Cook's comments give us hope that Apple will update the Mac Pro, despite all the commentary to the contrary (more on that below). While the updated unit may no longer meet the requirements of professional creatives, and while the cost of production may not justify its existence (and the cost is probably high due to Apple building it in the US rather than outsourcing to China), we don't think that Apple is about to turn its back on a product that allows it to show off its best technological advancements. There is some evidence that a new Mac Pro (one with 10 USB 3 ports) is in the pipeline - some code in Mac OS X El Capitan was discovered that referenced a machine with the codename AAPLJ95,1. The current generation of Mac Pro was codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it seems a fair bet that the new model is also a Mac Pro. Although El Capitan has now been superseded by macOS Sierra so maybe that was just an anomaly in the code. (More on this code below). In addition, a few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect a new Mac Pro by the end of November 2016, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it is certainly possible that things have been delayed and we could still see a new Mac Pro soon. When is the new Mac Pro release date? We expect (hope that) the new Mac Pro to be launched in March 2017 (read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event), although it may be a more likely star of the WWDC keynote in June, since that event tends to have more of a focus on pro Macs. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013. That's nearly four years ago (although the Mac Pro didn't actually ship until that December - and supply was so restrained that most users didn't get theirs until the following spring). It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. As it turned out, Apple did unveil a new MacBook Pro at the October event, so there was something for 'creative professionals' (although whether creative pros feel that it is meant for them is another question). You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) If the new Mac Pro doesn't appear at Apple's spring press event in March, then WWDC 2017, whose dates and ticket lottery were announced in February, would be the next slot in the Apple launch calendar. While Apple tends to focus on software at WWDC, and iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 will dominate the event, the launch of the 2013 Mac Pro shows there is a place for hardware at Apple's summer event if the circumstances are right. Could Apple launch a Pro iMac instead of a new Mac Pro? In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac desktop, referring only to the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" In response, Cook wrote the following (failing to mention the Mac Pro, or the Mac mini for that matter): "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important before speaking about the iMac. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why the question was asked and why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. Does this suggest that Apple will condense its Mac desktop offering into the iMac, discontinuing the Mac Pro and the Mac mini? Such a move would certainly help simplify its desktop offering. Perhaps Apple plans to do exactly that, with the launch of a Pro iMac that goes above and beyond what the 5K iMac offers currently. It's possible that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, but it's unlikely that such a model will ever meet the needs of Apple's traditional Mac Pro market, many of whom are still using old Mac Pros from pre-2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) Those who did upgrade to the trashcan-like Mac Pro are finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. Other professional creatives have abandoned the Mac and moved to Windows. It's a shame because these creative professionals, while a niche market, wield a lot of influence. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. Is the new Mac Pro 2017 release date delayed? When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. What are the rumoured Mac Pro 2017 specifications? Currently, there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. Ports: Thunderbolt and USB 3 The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon offering more Thunderbolt ports in the form of USB-3. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. (Read more about Thunderbolt and the Mac Pro here). Many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays. Processor: Intel Kaby Lake or AMD RYZEN 7? The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Another idea, although somewhat crazy, is that Apple could abandon Intel chips altogether and move to AMD. AMD has launched RYZEN 7 CPUs that "promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel" and, according to a report the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X just set a new world record score for Cinebench, a respected CPU performance benchmark. That report states that the new RYZEN 7 chip lineup roughly competes with Intel’s i7 line including the i7-6900K, i7-6800K, and i7-7700K. Perhaps more at home in an iMac then. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively, there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. An article by a video professional refers to the Nvidia GTX 1080 which is such a big deal that he thinks: "This card alone will most likely cause a shift in computer workstation ownership. However the card isn't compatible with the Mac Pro: "Even a Thunderbolt-connected PCIe expansion chassis to a Mac Pro trashcan won't help, due to the inherent bandwidth limits that Thunderbolt has as compared to the buss speeds of these GPU cards. And forget about stacking these cards in an expansion chassis… just not going to happen." Because using this card with the Mac Pro is out of the question he predicts: "a huge migration of longtime Apple users (such as me) going to Windows systems for their main workstation needs." Apple could move away from AMD with the next Mac Pro though (it has tended in the past to flit between the two graphics card manufacturers). And this time there may be a good reason: a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple.

The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as KRCS and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 March 2017 by Military News Intel’s $15 billion purchase of Mobileye shakes up driverless car sector Mobileye’s technologies were originated at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Licensed to Mobileye by Yissum, the Technology Transfer arm of the University. Tamir Huberman is VP Business Development at Yissum which is reponsible for all the Computer Science Researchers at the University including Prof Amnon Shashua. By Tova Cohen, Ari Rabinovitch and Paul Lienert | JERUSALEM/DETROIT Intel Corp (INTC.O) agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye (MBLY.N) for $15.3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) to develop driverless systems for global automakers. The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. „This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. „Mobileye’s technology is very critical… The price seems fair,” she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move „very far outside its core business franchise.” The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the „very expensive transaction” improved Intel’s position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye’s shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel’s shares were down 2.1 percent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc’s Waymo (GOOGL.O) to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O). Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC (DLPH.N), which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. MERGING ‚EYES’ AND ‚BRAIN’ Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the „eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems – the building blocks for self-driving cars – to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: „If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player… The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel’s biggest car importer and one of Mobileye’s earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. BATTLE FOR SELF-CONTROL Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW (BMWG.DE) on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

The chipmaker announced Monday it will acquire Mobileye for $63.54 per share, a 34 percent premium to Mobileye’s closing price Friday. The blockbuster deal marks Israel’s biggest acquisition, and Intel’s second-largest after its $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, a field-programmable gate array technology provider, in 2015. Mobileye is a leading developer of digital vision technology, which detects objects and space surrounding a vehicle, responsible for a number of key self-driving functions such as making sure that the vehicle stays in its lane and warning drivers of potential collisions. Its chips are installed in more than 300 car models, including BMW, according to Mobileye. The Israel-based company that currently employees over 600 workers was co-founded by Amnon Shashua, a computer science professor at Hebrew University, and CEO Ziv Aviram in 1999. Mobileye flagged $358 million in revenue last year, marking a net income of $108 million. “Intel’s landmark acquisition reflects the company’s strong will to promptly enter the self-driving car market. The company has missed out on the smartphone boom, and the personal computer market is shrinking,” said Kim Pil-soo, a professor of automotive engineering at Daelim University. With an aim to shift its business model, Intel has been expanding investments in driverless technology. It recently acquired deep learning chipmaker Nervana Systems last year, and FPGA maker Altera in 2015. Intel and Mobileye had already been working together with BMW to test-drive 40 autonomous cars in the US this year. Autonomous driving technology is estimated to grow into a $25 billion market by 2025, according to global consulting firm Bain & Company. Intel created Automated Driving Group, a division dedicated to autonomous driving, spun out of the Internet of Things business last November. The chipmaker also launched a new brand for its software and hardware tools for the development of driverless vehicles, dubbed Intel GO, in January. Intel’s latest acquisition follows a slew of active acquisitions made between global information technology firms and auto parts makers. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics announced last week it had completed the acquisition of Harman International Industries, a US car and audio systems maker, at $8 billion. Last year, US ride-sharing company Uber Technologies spent $680 million in purchasing self-driving truck company Otto, established by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google executive. US carmaker General Motors acquired Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle software producer, for some $1 billion last July. Meanwhile, South Korea’s No. 1 mobile carrier SK Telecom is expected to benefit from the latest deal. The local firm is currently working with Intel, Mobileye and BMW to commercialize 5G-based autonomous driving services by 2021.

Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a 7 per cent stake. Battle for self-control Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT All Advice People Employers Jobs People Aine Munroe, process engineer, Intel. Image: Intel The wonderful networking opportunity that is working in tech 2 days ago102 Shares Sometimes, it seems as though tech workers have been placed on pedestals. How do you get to know the people behind the tech? In the current climate, tech workers can seem so celebrated that it’s hard to see them as real-life people with backgrounds and opinions. Obviously, that’s not the case. Here, Aine Munroe, a process engineer at Intel, talks us through her career path and the variety that comes with working in the STEM community. What drew you to this career area? I had completed an internship in Intel while doing my undergraduate and enjoyed it so much I came back. I always enjoyed maths and chemistry, and working in Intel as a process engineer is a daily mix of both! What’s the best thing about working in this area? Every day, I get to work on cutting-edge technology. There are lots of opportunities to solve complex problems and make improvements. What’s the most exciting development you’ve witnessed in your sector since you started working in it? Moving from 65-nanometre (nm) manufacturing to 14nm manufacturing at the Intel Ireland site has been very exciting. What aspect of your job did you struggle to get to grips with? Working in a 24/7 manufacturing environment means I work with four different shifts. It took me a while to get to know all the shifts in my area, but I attended the shift-to-shift pass-downs in the fab [plant] and gradually got to know everyone! What’s been the hardest thing you’ve had to face in your career? I had to relocate to Arizona as part of the technology transfer of 14nm technology. It was like starting a new job all over again, but getting involved with the new group from day one really helped integration into the Arizona site and it was a great experience. If you had the power to change anything within the STEM sector, what would that be? I would like to see more secondary school students considering a career in STEM. Which of your personality traits makes you best suited to your job and this sector? I like solving problems and that helps. Is there something in your personal life that helps you/has helped you in your job? I really enjoy baking, which is a science in itself. Baking is its own process, which I use a lot to compare to some of the processing we do in Intel. Need to bake your cake faster? How would you do that? You are cleaning up post-baking. Is it harder if you leave the bowls hanging around for hours? Why? How do you make connections with others in the STEM community? With so many people working onsite in Intel Ireland, I get to work with lots of people from different STEM backgrounds daily. In the morning, you might be working with a statistician on a technical paper. After lunch, it might be an environmental engineer about chemical waste. Has mentorship or coaching been important in your career? Yes, mentorship is an important part of my career. I have a mentor and I also mentor new engineers and a college student. What advice would you give to someone thinking about a career in your area? Go for it!

The company has just bought Mobileye, a pioneer in the autonomous driving sector, for a huge $15bn. See related  Tesla Autopilot review: We test Elon Musk’s autonomous tech in the UK BMW is putting IBM's Watson AI in the passenger seat You may not have heard of Mobileye – like many other automotive companies, their products are sourced by car makers and left unbranded. But since its creation in 1999, the Israeli company has become a leader in the autonomous sector. According to the Financial Times, its chips and cameras are installed in 15m vehicles, the company is in partnership with 25 automakers, and it has a 80% market share. When you see those figures, Intel’s acquisition makes a lot more sense. So why is Intel buying Mobileye? Mobileye might seem like a great company, but why is Intel buying it rather than, say, Mercedes-Benz? The answer is pretty simple. While car makers may label everything as their own, the truth is that much of the technology you see on the road today is developed by third party companies – including autonomous tech. And now, as growth in the smartphone and computer market slows, chip makers believe that driverless cars offer a new revenue stream. When you look at the amount of cars fitted with it, and the technology it’s using, there’s clearly huge scope for growth, and therefore a huge market for a chip maker like Intel. However, by buying Mobileye – a company which makes everything but chips for driverless vehicles – Intel can now offer a complete solution for car makers looking to buy driverless tech. Despite the high asking price, Intel is well aware of how much money it can make. In a speech last year, Intel’s chief executive Brian Krzanich said, “Together, we expect to be the global leader in autonomous driving, and we see this market as growing to an over $70bn TAM [total addressable market] by 2030.” Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Loop Capital Markets, told the BBC. “This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities". This isn’t a new trend either. For the last few years, nVidia has been hugely involved in the driverless tech market, while last year Qualcomm bought NXP for $47bn and Samsung bought Harman for $8bn.

Have you given all your money to the homeless? If not why do you think it is OK to give away other people's savings?

Close Intel to buy Mobileye in $15.3B deal Viknesh Vijayenthiran Mar 14, 2017 Follow Viknesh Add to circle Mobileye logoEnlarge Photo Intel on Monday agreed to pay $15.3 billion to  Mobileye, a leading supplier of driver assistance and self-driving technology. Mobileye’s claim to fame is its EyeQ technology which uses proprietary image recognition software to help self-driving cars see the world, and the company is already a supplier to over 20 automakers and automotive supply firms. Intel first got involved with Mobileye last summer when the two joined forces to help develop self-driving cars with BMW. As self-driving technology evolves, it will grow to rely on various data that experts estimate will average as much as 4,000 GB per day as early as 2020. The data will come from highly-detailed 3D maps, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, and advanced monitoring systems. Powerful and reliable computers will process the incoming data and then through artificial intelligence make decisions to control the vehicle. Thus, the latest deal will position Intel as a leader in the field by combining its data-crunching abilities with Mobileye’s sensor technology. In a statement, the combined companies said they will have proficiencies spanning connectivity, computer vision, data center, sensor fusion, high-performance computing, localization and mapping (via Mobileye's partnership with HERE), machine learning and artificial intelligence. As part of the deal, Intel will move its own self-driving car team to Mobileye’s headquarters in Israel. The combined team will be led by Mobileye Chairman, CTO and founder Amnon Shashua. Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030. It’s why there are numerous rivals in this space including some automakers developing proprietary self-driving systems, as well as tech giants Uber, Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple (most likely), and a handful of smaller firms.

FILE PHOTO - Gameplayers demonstrate vitual reality headsets during the Intel press conference at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. on January 4, 2017.  The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair," she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise." The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the "very expensive transaction" improved Intel's position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye's earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands' NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye's shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel's shares were down 2.1 percent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's Waymo (GOOGL.O) to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O). Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC (DLPH.N), which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. MERGING 'EYES' AND 'BRAIN' Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car." Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data." Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. BATTLE FOR SELF-CONTROL Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW (BMWG.DE) on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

It surfaced into the automotive scene at two occasions. The first, was when the company announced that it had split up with what appears to be the current leader in the autonomous driving space, Tesla. The second instance was when the chipmaker earlier this year announced that it was teaming up with automaker BMW and chipmaker Intel to collect high-definition map data for its self-driving cars. Today, we have learnt that Intel has agreed to buy Mobileye. $15.3 billion sounds like a pricey deal, and the move as Reuters rightfully pointed out will shake up the driverless car sector. While Mobileye is no small fry in the autonomous driving space, it is Intel who benefits the most out of this acquisition. Mobileye NV is a technology company that develops not just chips but entire vision-based technologies and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Its headquarters is located in Jerusalem, Israel and with a $15 billion dollar acquisition, it also makes Mobileye’s sale one of the biggest for the country and the largest exit in Israel’s tech industry till date. Mobileye early years The company was founded back in 1999 by Amnon Shashua. Shashua took his academic research a step further from what everyone else was up to at that time, by developing a vision system for vehicles, one that could detect vehicles on the road using just a camera and software running on a processor. It was and still is a big deal, as the price of a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system was a lot higher back then and today is a standard fitment on all self-driving vehicles that are currently under testing (except for a Tesla). The price tags for these modules have dropped by a fair margin today (earlier ones would cost as much as the whole car itself), but LiDAR prices continue to remain high, keeping today’s demand in the automotive sector in mind. The black LiDAR lump on top of this Waymo Chrysler Pacifica does not comes cheap. In times where automakers and technology giants like Google (and earlier Apple) are still struggling to push out a fully autonomous self-driving car, Mobileye’s chips are indeed worth a lot and will be a bigger deal when the self-driving race picks up in the near future. Moreover, thanks to Tesla (and its crazy videos) it is proven tech even though a software problem led to the death of a Tesla owner when using its experimental Autopilot system. So how and where does Intel come into the autonomous driving picture? Well, Intel had to step up its game. Late last year, its competitor, Qualcomm acquired NXP for $47 billion, a move that came after the company, who had already done well in Q2 2016, had now locked its horns onto the connected car, a space that is quickly growing, has fewer regulations to deal with and will pave the way for the first generation of autonomous cars. Looking at the way things are going, smartphones are the key products in the consumer electronics space (even Apple knows this) for the current day and for the next decade. It’s a product that’s closer to the customer, one that the consumer can carry about literally anywhere with them. It’s also a space that Qualcomm dominates like no other. There’s a chipset for every smartphone segment, wearable, IoT product and NXP adds to the number of platforms by adding cars to its bouquet. This also makes sense keeping Qualcomm’s designs for 5G future in mind. And by now, it gets crystal clear why Intel wants in. Intel in that same quarter saw a decline in profits, which was blamed on its restructuring. Moreover, Intel’s chips so far only connect the back end, chips that power the cloud, and on the front end for consumers, laptops and desktops. Intel’s push with processors or mobile phones was not so great and the company quickly withdrew after smartphone manufacturers like Asus themselves chose to switch over to Qualcomm. Which is why the move to acquire Mobileye at $15 billion seems like a steal of deal. It adds another platform for Intel, self-driving cars that will work with its current Intel GO platform and give them the best hardware bits in the business to offer 360 degree packages to manufacturers for autonomous cars (read Waymo). In fact, Intel is already working with Delphi to develop the same. Right now autonomous cars are the buzzword in the auto space since everyone out there is trying to push out the first wholly autonomous car, that is set for a world tied up with regulations that refuses to budge. Tesla has the perfect recipe, Uber is pursuing it, and Google along with auto manufacturers are still deciding. Heck even Nvidia is into autonomous cars and is even working with Baidu to build one from scratch. Intel’s now betting $15 billion on it so now let’s all hope it happens… soon, at least for Intel.

Mobile version Sign Up Login Home Lebanon Middle East World Business Sports Climate Change & Environment Entertainment Offbeat Culture Science Obituaries Technology Health Entrepreneurship Roundup En ع Intel Buying Israeli Car Tech Firm Mobileye for $15 Billion إقرأ هذا الخبر بالعربية by Naharnet Newsdesk 13 March 2017, 15:41 Comment 7 Tweet Intel will buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than $15 billion (14 billion euros), the companies said Monday, in a deal signaling the U.S. computer chip giant's commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately $15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm.  It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in "autonomous driving" that could provide the technology at a lower cost. "The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles," it said. "Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030." Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. - 'Data centers on wheels' - Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that "together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry." "We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative," he said in the statement. "It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers." The companies said the transaction, approved by the boards of both Intel and Mobileye, is expected to close within the next nine months. "As cars progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centers on wheels," the statement said. "Intel expects that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day, which plays to Intel’s strengths in high-performance computing and network connectivity." Israeli officials were also touting the deal as a sign of confidence in the country's high-tech sector -- an industry that has given it the nickname the "start-up nation". "What's important now is that the production remains in Israel, where some 300 international companies are located," Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen told army radio. Intel has long had operations in Israel, opening its first development center in 1974.  In 2014, the firm announced it was to invest close to $6 billion in upgrading its Israeli production facilities.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) DETROIT — Computer chip maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than $15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year’s end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. “Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,” he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver’s seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye’s technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. “They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market.” Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still haven’t aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel’s growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday’s deal combines Mobileye’s software with Intel’s hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees.

The deal moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google’s Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. It’s likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. The acquisition should have little short-term impact on competitors such as Autoliv and Continental, and Intel and Mobileye already are working with supplier Delphi and BMW to test cars, Jefferies analyst Ashik Kurian wrote in a note to investors. But in the long-term as the market moves toward more autonomous vehicles, the hookup “confirms our concern about the emergence of new large and well-capitalized competitors” threatening auto suppliers, Kurian wrote. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. That’s below Mobileye’s record high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the shares to $80. Mobileye NV’s stock closed Monday up 28 percent to $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel’s autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel.

By: Bloomberg | Updated: March 14, 2017 12:44 pm Intel will pay .54 per share in cash for Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes chips for cameras and driver-assistance features. (Source: Bloomberg) Intel Corp. will acquire Mobileye NV for about $15 billion, paying one of the highest takeover premiums this century to play catch-up in the market for technology that helps cars drive themselves. The US chipmaker will pay $63.54 per share in cash for Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes chips for cameras and driver-assistance features. The offer, the largest ever for an Israeli company, is a 34 percent premium to Mobileye’s closing price on Friday. The shares surged 29 percent to $61.10 at 12:45 p.m. in New York. Intel stock dipped 1.8 percent to $35.28. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Intel is trying to accelerate a push into what many chip companies view as the next big opportunity: self-driving cars and the data they generate. With Mobileye, Intel gains the ability to offer automakers a larger package of components they will need as vehicles become more autonomous. The Santa Clara, California-based company estimates the market for vehicle systems, data and services will be worth as much as $70 billion by 2030. “They’re paying a huge premium in order to catch up, to get into the front of the line, rather than attempt to build from scratch,” said Mike Ramsey, an analyst with technology researcher Gartner. Mobileye has been pushing to sign up more carmakers for its advanced products. (Source: Bloomberg) The deal is the third most expensive acquisition in the technology industry this century, based on transactions over $5 billion and Mobileye’s trailing 12 month earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The deal gives Mobileye an enterprise value of about 29.5 times this year’s projected sales, according to Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. That’s more than 10 times the average of companies in the US benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shashua and Aviram Mobileye was founded in 1999 by Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram and made its name with systems that alert drivers to pedestrians, unintended lane departures and speed limit violations. The technology, which can also trigger braking to prevent an accident, counts General Motors Co. among its customers. Recently, Mobileye has been pushing to sign up more carmakers for its advanced products, such as technology that collects data from vehicle fleets to build a real-time, crowd-sourced mapping service. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. invested $100 million in 2007 for a minority stake in Mobileye. Intel will combine its existing autonomous vehicle technology unit with Mobileye and the new group will be run in Israel by Shashua, the companies said in a statement. “Shashua is the personification of car safety and autonomous driving,” said Shmuel Harlap, chairman of car importer Colmobil Ltd. and Mobileye’s biggest shareholder. “Just look at his quarrel with Elon Musk and you understand the personality.” Last year, Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla Inc. stopped using Mobileye’s systems and the two companies argued publicly about the breakup. The Israeli company expressed concerns about the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot hands-free highway driving feature, while Tesla accused the supplier of trying to block its in-house efforts to develop computer vision capabilities for cars. Mobileye was founded in 1999 by Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram and made its name with systems that alert drivers to pedestrians, unintended lane departures and speed limit violations. (Source: Mobileye) While Intel’s chips are dominant in personal computers and data centers, the world’s largest semiconductor maker has struggled to spread the use of its products to other areas where semiconductors based on ARM Holdings Plc. designs have prevailed. Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, Intel has sought to break into everything from drones to cash registers. That hasn’t fired up Intel’s overall sales growth yet, leaving the company reliant on PCs and servers for its profit. Mobileye is the second-biggest acquisition for Intel after Altera Corp., which it bought in 2015 for $16.7 billion. As of the end of 2016, Intel held about 80 percent of its $17.1 billion in cash and equivalents overseas. It could use some or all of that to buy Mobileye, a potentially efficient use of cash that would be taxed more if brought back to the U.S. The company had total debt of $25.3 billion at the end of last year. On a conference call with analysts, Krzanich said the deal will immediately add to Intel’s adjusted earnings and cash flow. But the acquisition won’t have much impact on revenue. Last year, Intel reported sales of $59 billion compared with Mobileye’s $358 million.”We are looking beyond just the revenue it’s going to grow into,” the Intel CEO told Bloomberg Television. “If you look at where autonomous vehicles are going, you have to make a deal in order to be there in 2021 when models hit the road.” Qualcomm Rivalry In the highly competitive market for autonomous cars, Intel’s purchase is a shot at rival Qualcomm Inc. The mobile phone chipmaker is in the process of making itself the world’s biggest producer of chips used by the automotive industry through its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV. “Intel are so far behind in this space the only way they could catch up was via an acquisition,” said Neil Campling, head of technology research at Northern Trust Securities. In the highly competitive market for autonomous cars, Intel’s purchase is a shot at rival Qualcomm Inc. (Image for representation, Source: Reuters) Carmakers and technology companies are scrambling to stake out a leading market position. Intel’s chips are already in 30 vehicle models currently on the road and are being used in hundreds of autonomous test vehicles, the company said in January. Intel and Mobileye had already teamed up with BMW AG and plan to introduce fully autonomous cars by 2021. The companies are dispatching a fleet of 40 self-driving 7-Series sedans this year to hone systems for complex urban traffic. $2 Trillion Alphabet Inc.’s Google has clocked more than 2 million self-driving test miles on public roads, Tesla has gathered data from 1.3 billion miles of data from Autopilot-equipped vehicles, and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG has partnered with Uber Technologies Inc. Much of Mobileye’s success was to the fact that it was first in its field. (Image for representation, Source: Bloomberg) Google, which separated its self-driving car project into a new unit called Waymo last year, plans to start a ride-sharing service using semi-autonomous minivans made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV as soon as the end of 2017. Volkswagen AG is rolling out Moia, a new division that will focus on ride-sharing and other mobility services. Mercedes already offers cars that can pilot themselves at highway speeds.

In an interview earlier this year he attributed much of Mobileye’s success to the fact that it was first in its field. Intel Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan said the company expects to see $175 million a year in cost and tax savings from the transaction and that this will help cover the premium Intel is paying for Mobileye.

The cash deal of $63.54 (R832) a share marks the largest purchase of a company solely focused on the self-driving sector and could significantly alter the competitive landscape among key technology and systems suppliers, including chip-makers Nvidia and Qualcomm and systems integrator Delphi Automotive. Mobileye’s shares jumped 30 percent to $61.30 (R803) in late-morning US trading, while Intel’s shares were down 2 percent. Share this story The Mobileye logo on a screen at the post where it trades on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Intel is said to be positioning itself for a dominant role in the fast-moving autonomous-driving sector.Photo: AP Shares of Delphi, which has partnerships with both companies, were up 3 percent. The deal underscores the expanding alliances between vehicle makers and their suppliers as they race to develop self-driving cars, a concept that once seemed a science-fiction dream but is drawing closer to reality. While Intel is known for hardware chips and Mobileye for collision detection and mapping software, the merger promises to create an expanded portfolio of technologies needed for driverless vehicles. It also strengthens Intel’s position in the sector against rival chip-makers Nvidia and Qualcomm. Opportunities The Intel-Mobileye portfolio includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software, and data fusion and management. “It’s an area where (Intel) has had very little presence - the automotive market - and so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” Betsy van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical The price seems fair,” she added. The offer represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 (R616) on Friday. Intel will integrate its automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations, with the combined entity being run by Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua from Israel. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the “eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car”. Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: “If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player. The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Read also: Job cuts loom as Intel looks to future Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last year after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Intel said it expected the vehicle systems, data and services market to rise to $70billion (R917bn) by 2030. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70percent of the global market for driver- assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3million last year. Analysts said that mounting a counter-bid would be difficult because Shashua would remain in charge and the combined entity would be based in Israel. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7percent of the company. Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German vehicle maker BMW on a project to put a fleet of about 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. Partnership At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery in about 2021. Mobileye has also partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chip-makers seeking to make inroads in the market. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later this year.  Reuters Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Garsfontein reels after double killing horror 2 'I was beaten and robbed because train was late' 3 'Car thieves laugh at us' say KZN residents 4 Toilet lock-up officials 'severely traumatised' 5 Net1 boss dares state Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

Mobileye’s suite of autonomous tech including cameras, sensor hardware and the software and processors that run them will be added to Intel’s current self-driving technology portfolio when the deal is finalised by the end of this year. Mobileye’s shares have been valued at $63.54 ($A84.23) per share, totalling $14.7b ($A19.5b) enterprise value, but Intel has predicted that by 2030, market opportunity in vehicle data systems will climb to as much as $70b ($A92b). Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement to employees that computing technology will play an increasing role in the automotive sector, and will eventually be considered more important than the mechanics of a vehicle. In his speech Mr Krzanich claimed that “Data is the new oil”, and added that the question of “what’s under the hood” will “increasingly refer to computing, not horsepower.” Put just one million autonomous vehicles on the road and you have the data equivalent of half the world’s population. “At four terabytes of data per day, the average autonomous car will put out the data equivalent of approximately 3000 people. Put just one million autonomous vehicles on the road and you have the data equivalent of half the world’s population,” he said. “This massive amount of data requires all of Intel’s assets to provide the cost-effective high-performance solutions our customers need. “I believe that today’s announcement puts us in the driver’s seat to achieve our vision of creating the technology foundation on which the future of autonomous driving will be built.”  Mobileye’s centre in Israel will be used to headquarter the newly-named Automated Driving Group, and will be headed by existing Mobileye chairman Amnon Shashua. The newly-merged company will go up against the likes of Qualcomm and Nvidia in the race for automated technology development. The purchase will have obvious knock-on implications for vehicle brands who are looking to establish relationships with technology firms to co-develop self-driving tech. Mobileye has existing partnerships with Volkswagen Group and BMW Group in developing autonomous cars, which could put the heat on rival Nvidia, who is partnered with VW Group-owned Audi. The other heavy-hitter is Qualcomm Technologies, who finalised a deal to purchase car electronics manufacturer NXP, and has existing ties with both Daimler and Renault. According to Mobileye co-founder, president and CEO Ziv Aviram, Intel will now be a more lucrative option for car-makers looking to develop autonomous technologies with Mobileye on board. “By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centres and high-performance computing platforms,” he said. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry.” Both companies will continue with business as usual until the merger is finalised at the end of the year.

Mobileye to be sold to Intel in $15.3 billion deal - Poland Sun Volume 076/15 Poland Sun        http://www.polandsun.com   Poland News Europe News Breaking Business News Breaking Sports News Science News Breaking Sports News Lifestyle News Travel News Breaking Health News Public Health News Arts News Breaking Financial Markets News Mobileye to be sold to Intel in $15.3 billion deal Poland Sun Tuesday 14th March, 2017 • This was the latest investment by a technology company in future of self-driving cars • Mobileye makes chip-based camera systems that power semi-automated driving features • Mobileye shares rose 31 percent to $61.77 in premarket trading, Intel shares fell 1.1 percent to $35.51 CALIFORNIA, U.S. - In yet another deal that displays the increasing interest in self-driving cars, that the Silicon Valley has dubbed as the future - Intel Corp decided to buy Mobileye. The Israeli technology firm, Mobileye makes chip-based camera systems that power semi-automated driving features. The deal worth $15.3 billion, values Mobileye at $63.54 a share, which is a 34 percent premium to its closing price Friday.  After the deal was announced on Monday, Mobileye shares rose 31 percent to $61.77 in premarket trading, while Intel shares fell 1.1 percent to $35.51. The deal became one of the largest ones to date.  Jerusalem-based Mobileye is working on putting its chip-based camera systems in the center of self-driving cars of the future. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in a note to employees that the deal "merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.”  Krzanich added, “The saying 'what's under the hood' will increasingly refer to computing, not horsepower." With a prior collaboration already in place, between Intel, Mobileye and BMW AG - to put about 40 self-driving cars on the road in test mode, the acquisition paves the way to Intel’s future in the domain. Both the companies said in a statement that the deal provides Intel with closer relationships to suppliers and car makers.  Further, Mobileye informed executives that Intel's existing automated-driving efforts will be integrated into the company, based in Israel and run by its existing leaders. The transaction will add to Intel's adjusted per-share earnings and is expected to close in the next nine months. Mobileye currently accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems.  The company employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year.

Featured Story Chinese Artist Ai Brings New Refugee-themed Piece to Prague "To refuse somebody so desperate is almost a crime," Ai told The Associated Press. "It's immoral, it's short-sighted, and it is not going to benefit this nation. We cannot lose our fundamental beliefs in human rights and human dignity." His largest piece so far, the 70-meter (230-foot)-long black rubber boat hangs from the ceiling at the National Gallery's Trade Fair Palace. The site-specific installation that went on exhibit Thursday was made in a Chinese factory that produces dinghies used by actual refugees, Ai said. The 59-year-old artist has exhibited similar works elsewhere. He used 14,000 discarded life vests collected from the beaches of Lesbos to wrap the columns of Berlin's Konzerthaus and to create lotus blossoms floating on a pond in Vienna's Belvedere park. The artist also posed as Alan Kurdi, a Syrian toddler whose lifeless body was famously photographed lying face-down on a Lesbos pebble beach. Ai was criticized for exploiting the child's tragic death. More than 1.2 million people have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe since 2015, data from the International Organization for Migration show. According to the European Commission, the Czech Republic has so far accepted 12 migrants for relocation.

The company is cutting 784 jobs at its facility in Washington County. (Laura Rauch/The Associated Press, 2010)   By Mark Scott The New York Times March 14, 2017   Today’s Business stories Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rate .25 percent, sees more increases as U.S. economy improves Lane County home sales transforms to ‘super sellers’ market, expert says U.S. homebuilders’ optimism surges to 12-year high in March McDonald’s tests mobile ordering, payments Americans spent slightly more at retail stores last month More Business »   In the world of driverless cars, household names like Google and Uber have raced ahead of rivals, building test vehicles and starting trials on city streets. But when it comes to what is under the hood, a wide array of lesser-known companies are looking to supply the technology required to bring such driverless cars to the masses. And in a $15.3 billion deal announced on Monday, Intel made a play to corner the market on how much of that technology is developed. The chipmaker’s acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles, is one of the largest in the fast-growing sector and sets the stage for increasing competition between Silicon Valley giants as well as traditional automakers over who will dominate the world of autonomous cars. The likes of Google and Uber have already invested billions of dollars in their own technology, signing partnerships with automakers like Chrysler and Volvo and sending test vehicles onto the road in a bid to cement their place in the industry. The sector is estimated to be worth $25 billion annually by 2025, according to Bain & Co., the consultancy firm. Faced with an existential threat to its legacy computer business, Intel — alongside competitors like Qualcomm — has focused on autonomous cars as a new and potentially lucrative market. Many of these driverless vehicles, experts say, will require immense computing power, including the latest microchips able to crunch reams of data in seconds to keep the cars on the road and safe. And by acquiring Mobileye, whose digital vision technology allows autonomous vehicles to safely navigate city streets, Intel aims to broaden its offerings beyond just chips to a wider suite of products that driverless vehicles will require. It hopes, as a result, to appeal to automakers that want to offer autonomous driving but lack the in-house expertise and do not want to rely on the likes of Google. “Scale is going to win in this market,” Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, told investors on Monday. “I don’t believe that every carmaker can invest to do independent development into autonomous cars.” Intel has a history with such strategic moves. It cornered the personal computer market during more than three decades, supplying hundreds of millions of desktop computers with much of their internal architecture, after dominating which microchips were used in the industry. But in recent years, Intel has struggled to find its feet as people’s habits have increasingly turned to the mobile world, where the company’s chips have lost out to rivals. Last year, for instance, the company announced that it was laying off 12,000 people, or 11 percent of its global workforce, as demand for personal computers continued to decline. While Intel still makes more than half of its annual revenue from traditional computing chipmaking operations, the company’s sales from its “internet of things” division, a unit that includes its burgeoning automaking team, grew 15 percent in 2016, to $2.6 billion, according to regulatory filings. During the last 18 months, Intel has signed partnership deals with BMW and Delphi Automotive, an auto parts supplier, to expand its presence in the field. It also acquired a 15 percent stake in Here, a digital mapping business owned by a consortium of German automakers, and announced last year that it would invest $250 million in startups working on driverless car technologies. Mobileye, founded in Jerusalem in 1999, has signed deals with several automakers, including Audi, for the use of its vision and camera technology, which uses machine-learning and complex neuroscience to help drivers — and increasingly cars themselves — avoid obstacles on the road. It also has long-standing ties with Intel. The chipmaker was a partner with Mobileye and BMW last year over efforts to bring autonomous cars to city streets by 2021. In January, the companies announced plans to have up to 40 autonomous cars on American and European roads by the end of this year as part of initial trials. As that collaboration grew, Intel and Mobileye executives began talking about a potential takeover at the end of December, holding meetings, mostly in New York, to complete a deal that will see Mobileye’s executives take the lead in Intel’s new expanded efforts. “This deal makes Intel a tier-one partner for the automotive industry,” said Martin Birkner, an automotive analyst at Gartner, a technology research company in Munich. “As the industry moves towards autonomous driving, new types of digital suppliers like Intel are developing quickly.” Intel’s efforts to stamp a claim on driverless cars represents a recognition that chipmaking rivals like Nvidia and Qualcomm had moved slightly ahead in the race to provide the computing power needed for autonomous vehicles. As part of the deal, Intel said it would buy Mobileye’s outstanding shares at $63.54 a share, a 34 percent premium to Mobileye’s closing price on Friday. The acquisition requires shareholder and regulatory approval, and is expected to close by the end of 2017. Much of Intel’s success will depend on Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chief technology officer, who has a doctorate in brain and cognitive sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Part of Shashua’s plan is to have cars with Mobileye’s advanced driver assist systems collect imaging and location data that can be used to create what the company calls RoadBook — a vast digital map of roadways in the United States and Europe. The goal, Shashua said, is to provide carmakers with a complete product line of digital services that go beyond what they can do for themselves. “The collaboration that we want to do can’t happen if we are two different organizations,” he said on Monday. “The collaboration already runs deep.” Despite Intel’s high hopes for autonomous cars, experts say such vehicles are unlikely to hit the roads by the end of the decade, at the earliest, because regulators are beginning to question which rules such cars should follow and because companies are struggling to make the technology work seamlessly. Uber, the ride-booking service, halted its driverless car tests in California after local officials said the company did not have the required permits, though its tests in Pittsburgh are continuing. Google’s own efforts ran into difficulties after the company’s driverless cars were involved in a spate of collisions. And in Europe, regulators are divided on the issue of self-driving cars, causing the automotive industry to complain that the delays could hamper plans to take the technology to the Continent’s streets. Still, with technology companies and global automakers making hefty — and costly — bets on autonomous cars, experts that say more deals like Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye are likely to follow as firms jostle for position.

From staff and wire reports Intel buying Mobileye in bid for self-driving car technology Intel is buying Mobileye for about $15.3 billion as the race for self-driving car technology heats up. The chip giant based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it will pay $63.54 a share in cash for the Jerusalem-based maker of camera systems for autonomous vehicles. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a message to employees that “this acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” The two companies are no strangers to each other’s technology. Last summer, they announced a partnership with BMW to create an open platform for self-driving cars. U.S. aluminum group files complaint against China China appealed to Washington to refrain from imposing sanctions on Chinese aluminum suppliers after U.S. producers filed a complaint against them in the Trump administration’s first trade case. An industry group, the Aluminum Association, accused Chinese producers of selling at unfairly low prices that hurt foreign competitors in the case filed Thursday. It asked the U.S. Commerce Department to impose anti-dumping duties of 38 percent to 134 percent on aluminum foil for consumer and industrial uses. A flood of low-cost Chinese aluminum exports has pushed global prices so low that U.S. and European smelters are closing. Producers say thousands of jobs are at risk.

Ms. Mayer will receive a golden parachute of $23 million. It was not immediately clear why that figure was lower than the $55 million Yahoo specified in an earlier proxy statement. Mr. McInerney is to receive $2 million in annual base salary, double Ms. Mayer’s base pay. He’ll also be eligible for a performance-based annual incentive award of another $2 million, plus “long-term deferred compensation” in the form of a grant of up to $24 million after the sale closes, the Monday SEC filing said.

Intel Corp. said Monday it will acquire the Israeli firm. (Photo: Richard Drew / AP) 10 CONNECTTWEET 15 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Mobileye NV Chairman Amnon Shashua didn’t mince words when a group of Michigan CEOs dropped by headquarters in Jerusalem 16 months ago: Silicon Valley, he said, is “not interested in automotive.” It sure is now. Intel Corp. said Monday it will acquire the Israeli maker of digital automotive cameras and sensors for $15.3 billion. The move is validation by one of the valley’s heaviest heavyweights that the battle for autonomous driving will be waged with data collected under the metaphorical hood. The global auto industry and its high-tech rivals are scrambling for leadership in the emerging mobility sector of car-sharing, self-driving cars and everything in between — and Intel’s move is a sign that the pace is quickening. At stake are positions in the $70 billion vehicle systems space and a worldwide transportation services business Ford Motor Co. pegs at $10 trillion annually. “Many of you have asked why we think autonomous cars and vehicles are so important to Intel’s future,” CEO Brian Krzanich wrote to Intel employees Monday. “The answer is data. At four terabytes of data per day, the average autonomous car will put out the data equivalent of approximately 3,000 people. “Put just one million autonomous vehicles on the road and you have the data equivalent of half the world’s population. The addition of Mobileye to our family provides the data path to our computing solutions becoming the intelligent set of eyes that will allow a vehicle to see and define the world around it.” Mobileye and Intel already partner with Delphi Automotive PLC on a self-driving car system the three showcased in January at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas. Mobileye’s digital vision systems are the eyes transmitting the contours of the outside world to Intel processors, which then issue commands to drive the car. In a note to investors, Wells Fargo Securities LLC called the Intel-Mobileye tie-up a “positive” for the three-way partnership and said it means the “autonomous drive platform can accelerate.” Emphasis on accelerate, an apt metaphor for the mobility fervor sweeping the auto and tech industries. While President Donald Trump and his economic nationalist message cast attention on the auto industry’s traditional decision-making on plant investments, product allocation and blue-collar job creation — notes the president is likely to hit when he comes to Michigan on Wednesday — the real action in the industry continues to be in mobility. It commands increasing amounts of attention from auto industry CEOs, even as a new White House and near-record sales focus interest on the cars, pickups and SUVs that still account for all their automotive revenue and profits. And the mobility craze is proving Mobileye’s Shashua wrong: Silicon Valley is very interested in next-generation automotive because that’s where growth and profits are. More, leaders in both industries have tempered their historic arrogance and come to understand that neither has the technical capability to master mobility without the other. That’s why Google’s Waymo is partnering with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on self-driving vans. It’s also why Apple for now is scaling back its autonomous car ambitions; getting there ain’t easy. Intel’s move is a simultaneous play for two trends animating deal-making in mobility: the bids for capability and scale. Same for General Motors Co.’s acquisition of Cruise Automation, its investment in Lyft Technologies Inc. and its creation of the Maven car-sharing brand; to get capability and scale, mobility players are buying it or leveraging what they already own. What Intel’s move likely is not is the beginning of a tech industry roll-up of the auto supply space. Too many of the industry’s largest suppliers still produce low-margin commodity products for today’s car and truck business, hardly the high-margin whiz-bang gadgetry that makes a “pure play” acquisition like Mobileye so attractive to Intel. The same logic holds for automakers. The “haves” like GM, Ford, Toyota Motor Corp. and Germany’s Big Three are investing in mobility to grow their business, to answer rising demands from China and the European Union to deliver emissions-free mobility solutions in crowded cities, to fatten profit margins and reduce capital investment in traditional manufacturing. Think of it this way: California-based Intel gets the techy present and future of the next-generation auto industry without the past burdens of Old Auto baggage. The biggest beneficiaries of any trend signified by the Intel-Mobileye deal are likely to be tech startups whose expertise can strengthen the pushes for integration and scale. The biggest players in both industries — from GM, Ford and Toyota to Intel, Apple and Google — are in what appears to be a continual hunt for capability that can bolster their chances to emerge as major players in a space that accounts for little, if any, revenue and profit. Outside of the car- and ride-sharing businesses, mobility is an if-come play. But it’s real. And the surest way to know is to follow the money going after the technologies most likely to make it happen.

PHOTO: YOUTUBE Intel will buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than $15 billion (14 billion euros), the companies said Monday, in a deal signalling the US computer chip giant’s commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately $15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in “autonomous driving” that could provide the technology at a lower cost. “The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” it said. “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030.” Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for “highly and fully automated driving” to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999 and employs some 660 people. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. – ‘Data centres on wheels’ – Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localisation. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that “together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry”. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” he said in the statement. “It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers.” The companies said the transaction, approved by the boards of both Intel and Mobileye, is expected to close within the next nine months. “As cars progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels,” the statement said. “Intel expects that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day, which plays to Intel’s strengths in high-performance computing and network connectivity.” Israeli officials were also touting the deal as a sign of confidence in the country’s high-tech sector — an industry that has given it the nickname the “start-up nation”. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone with Aviram to congratulate him, a statement from the premier’s office said. “The deal dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is being realised,” Netanyahu said. “Israel is becoming a global technology centre not only in the field of cyber but also the automotive field.” Economy Minister Eli Cohen told army radio that “what’s important now is that the production remains in Israel, where some 300 international companies are located”. The centre for work on the combined autonomous vehicle will be Mobileye’s headquarters in Jerusalem, the firms said. Aviram told Netanyahu that a global development centre will be established in Israel and “will be responsible all the international activity of Intel’s autonomous cars”, the statement from the premier’s office said. Intel has long operated in Israel, opening its first development centre in 1974. In 2014, the firm announced it was to invest close to $6 billion in upgrading its Israeli production facilities.

Under the agreement, a special subsidiary of Intel will begin a tender offer to acquire all Mobileye shares for $63.54 each, all in cash. Intel says the deal will allow it to combine its computing and connectivity expertise and Mobileye’s leading computer vision expertise for future semi-autonomous and fully-autonomous vehicles. In a letter to employees, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said “The acquisition of Mobileye brings together the assets of Intel’s Xeon processors, FPGAs, 3D XPoint memory, and 5G modems with the world leader in automotive computer vision. This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye once provided the autonomous hardware for Tesla but split last year. Nevertheless, the company is working with numerous established automakers and startups to bring its technology to the streets, including BMW, General Motors and Lucid. Intel expects the vehicle systems, data and services market to be valued at up to $70 billion by 2030.

Global chipmaker Intel had last September spun out McAfee as a separate company with private equity player TPG owning 51% share in the new entity. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017. “One of our largest sites around the world is in Bangalore. We continue to invest in that. “We are actually adding new functions into the site there,” Intel SecurityGeneral Manager and SVP Christopher Young told PTI. “Under Intel, it was primarily development centre, but now we are adding finance, IT, HR to that site as well to support the new (unit),” Young added. While Young declined to comment on investment or specific number of jobs to be created, he said the new roles will be created “over the course of the year”. “India is one of our fastest growing markets. We have been growing in the double digits over the last several years and we expect to continue that trajectory and that is across public and private sector,” he said. India is “a really unique place” as apart from contributing to global development, there is a “healthy growing local market here”, he added. “We will continue to invest heavily into that duality,” Young said. McAfee, which has been a part of Intel as Intel Security Group, had witnessed 20% year-on-year growth in 2016. It has close to 2,000 people in India with over 1,700 engineers. “Revenues are growing double digits in India, so I expect that India over the next couple years could easily be one of our top markets,” said Young, who will be the CEO of the new company. Chipmaker Intel had acquired McAfee in 2011for $7.7 billion to build security features directly into its silicon products. The company’s business had $1.1billion in revenue in the first half of 2016, up 11% increase from the same period last year.

Tools  Print  Email Share This JERUSALEM/DETROIT--Intel Corp agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc to develop driverless systems for global automakers.   The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business.   It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups.   The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035.   Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price.   Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management.   "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair," she added.   Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise."   The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the "very expensive transaction" improved Intel's position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end.   Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye's earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands' NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015.   Mobileye's shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel's shares were down 2.1 percent.   The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc. Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC, which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies.Merging 'Eyes' and 'Brain' Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion.   Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car."   Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data."   Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system.   Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year.   Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake.Battle for Self-Control Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year.   At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems.   Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia.   The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

Intel will buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than US $15 billion, the companies said on Tuesday, in a deal signalling the US computer chip giant's commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately US $15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German auto maker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in "autonomous driving" that could provide the technology at a lower cost. "The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles," it said. "Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to US $70 billion by 2030." Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global auto makers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999 and employs some 660 people. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localisation. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that "together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry". "We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative," he said in the statement.

"It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers." The companies said the transaction, approved by the boards of both Intel and Mobileye, is expected to close within the next nine months. "As cars progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels," the statement said. "Intel expects that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day, which plays to Intel's strengths in high-performance computing and network connectivity." Israeli officials were also touting the deal as a sign of confidence in the country's high-tech sector -- an industry that has given it the nickname the "start-up nation". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone with Aviram to congratulate him, a statement from the premier's office said. "The deal dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is being realised," Netanyahu said. "Israel is becoming a global technology centre not only in the field of cyber but also the automotive field." Economy Minister Eli Cohen told army radio that "what's important now is that the production remains in Israel, where some 300 international companies are located". The centre for work on the combined autonomous vehicle will be Mobileye's headquarters in Jerusalem, the firms said. Aviram told Netanyahu that a global development centre will be established in Israel and "will be responsible all the international activity of Intel's autonomous cars", the statement from the premier's office said. Intel has long operated in Israel, opening its first development centre in 1974. In 2014, the firm announced it was to invest close to $6 billion in upgrading its Israeli production facilities.

Intel will buy Israel's Mobileye in a deal valued at just over $14 billion, the latest push by a major tech company to advance autonomous vehicles that could change the way traffic moves globally. (AP/Richard Drew) Computer chip maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than $15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year's end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver's seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye's technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. "They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market." Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is interviewed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, March 13, 2017. Intel will buy Israel's Mobileye in a deal valued at about $15 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology.(AP/Richard Drew) Read also: Google finally bids farewell to manual captchas But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still haven't aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel's growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday's deal combines Mobileye's software with Intel's hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees. The deal moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google's Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. It's likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. The acquisition should have little short-term impact on competitors such as Autoliv and Continental, and Intel and Mobileye already are working with supplier Delphi and BMW to test cars, Jefferies analyst Ashik Kurian wrote in a note to investors. But in the long-term as the market moves toward more autonomous vehicles, the hookup "confirms our concern about the emergence of new large and well-capitalized competitors" threatening auto suppliers, Kurian wrote. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. That's below Mobileye's record high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the shares to $80. Mobileye NV's stock closed Monday up 28 percent to $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion.

FREE Registration Home News Archive Features Directory Recruitment Events About Us Advertising Contribute News 13 March 2017 Peregrine hires general manager of Intel’s mobile communications business as CEO as Cable steps back to CTO Peregrine Semiconductor Corp of San Diego, CA, USA – a fabless provider of radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) – has appointed Stefan Wolff as its new chief executive officer. Existing CEO Jim Cable is stepping into the role of chairman & chief technology officer and will serve as global R&D director for parent company Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd. Picture: CEO Jim Cable becomes chairman & CTO and will serve as global R&D director for parent company Murata. In nearly 15 years of general management experience in semiconductor and communications technologies, Wolff served most recently as VP & general manager of Intel’s mobile communications business in Munich, Germany. While at Intel, he led a global team in developing and producing cellular modem and mobile connectivity products, securing high-profile development contracts and scoring major wins with leading vendors. Prior to Intel, Wolff managed the smartphones and RF business unit at Infineon and led an RF development center for Siemens Mobile in the USA. He started his career in automotive electronics as RF design engineer at Bosch. Wolff also has a technical background that includes a B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Applied Sciences in Berlin. Peregrine reckons that Wolff is suited to his new role as CEO, in which his education and accomplishments will enable him to guide the firm’s technological growth at an executive level. Picture: New CEO Stefan Wolff. “We have known Stefan and have collaborated with him and his team for many years, and I am delighted to bring him on board to accelerate our growth and the growth of our parent company Murata,” says Cable. “I am eager to get back to my technology roots and focus on shaping innovation for Murata,” he adds. “I have admired the Murata and Peregrine teams for years. There is such synergy in the two groups,” comments Wolff. “Together, I see innovations not possible from any other company,” he adds. In addition, Cable has appointed Dylan Kelly as chief operating officer. Kelly has held the position of VP and general manager of Peregrine’s mobile wireless solutions business unit since 2010. He joined Peregrine in 2000 and has held technical and management positions in product development, marketing, and sales. Prior to joining Peregrine, Kelly was with Motorola engaged in transceiver design. He holds a B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin and an M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, San Diego.

Intel will buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than USD 15 billion, the companies said, in a deal signalling the US computer chip giant's commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately USD 15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in "autonomous driving" that could provide the technology at a lower cost. "The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles," it said. "Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to USD 70 billion by 2030." Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999 and employs some 660 people. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localisation. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that "together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry". "We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative," he said in the statement. tags #BMW #innovation #Intel #Israeli car tech #Mobileye #PTI #Technology #vehicles #Volkswagen #Wire News #World News Related news Business BMW to hike prices by up to 2% from April in India BY sandeep sinha Mar 16, 2017 08:19 PM World Eight injured in French school shooting, one arrested - sources BY Deepak Kumar Mar 16, 2017 07:04 PM World Trump proposes USD 1.1 trillion budget; defence spending up by USD 54 bn BY sandeep sinha Mar 16, 2017 06:42 PM Business No country for populism: Dutch PM Rutte fends off far-right's Wilders BY Faizan Javed Mar 16, 2017 03:33 PM Business Fed rate hike marks normalisation of US monetary policy: Fitch BY Faizan Javed Mar 16, 2017 12:01 PM World Apple, Google, Facebook skip legal challenge to new travel ban BY Faizan Javed Mar 16, 2017 10:10 AM Business Renault CEO Ghosn targeted in French diesel probe BY Faizan Javed Mar 16, 2017 10:05 AM Business Hawaii judge halts Trump's new travel ban before it can go into effect BY Faizan Javed Mar 16, 2017 09:59 AM Business Fed obliges markets, but Trump could play spoilsport BY Shweta Mungre Mar 16, 2017 08:58 AM News Most Popular Top News Copper to trade in 387.1-396.9 range: Achiievers Equities Preview: RBI seen cutting rates, but it will be a close call Silver to trade in 41719-42623 range: Achiievers Equities Crude oil to trade in 3534-3662 range: Achiievers Equities Are markets simply high or on a high? 10 reforms which are still work-in-progress These stocks are as hot as the coming summer, but valuations need to cool Market cheers Fed rate hike: Nifty, Midcap at record closing high Decks cleared for GST rollout from July 1 see more Video of the day See Nifty at 10,300 in March 2018 with 2 caveats; like private banks: IL&FS Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Gamechanger Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch Power your Ttade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info info@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

The purchase, scheduled to close by year's end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver's seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye's technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. "They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market." Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still haven't aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel's growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday's deal combines Mobileye's software with Intel's hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees. The deal moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google's Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. It's likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. The acquisition should have little short-term impact on competitors such as Autoliv and Continental, and Intel and Mobileye already are working with supplier Delphi and BMW to test cars, Jefferies analyst Ashik Kurian wrote in a note to investors. But in the long-term as the market moves toward more autonomous vehicles, the hookup "confirms our concern about the emergence of new large and well-capitalized competitors" threatening auto suppliers, Kurian wrote. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. That's below Mobileye's record high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the shares to $80. Mobileye NV's stock closed Monday up 28 percent to $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel's autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel.

Self-driving cars are widely seen as the future of transportation and a growth area, but the Intel deal depends on more than technology as it looks to expand revenue in an increasingly competitive nascent sector. The company's largest-ever deal, the $16.7 billion acquisition of programmable chipmaker Altera, has so far failed to meet its objective of helping to offset the continued decline in Intel's larger PC business. Intel also spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, last year in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, about five years after having bought the anitvirus software maker for $7.7 billion. "We can recall few cases where so much has been spent(habitually) to buy so little," said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Rasgon, who rates the stock "underperform", notes Intel has spent over $30 billion in the last few years, while only adding about $2 to $3 billion in revenue. Perhaps learning from those missteps, Intel's Mobileye deal is uniquely structured. The Santa Clara-based company's Automated Driving Group (ADG) will combine with Mobileye and will be led by Mobileye Chief Executive Amnon Shashua. Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said that Intel has previously attempted to fold acquisitions into its structure but they have not always been the right fit. Intel's deals for embedded systems software maker Wind River Systems and McAfee exemplified that strategy. "One of the things Intel has tried to do in the past is that they've taken a square peg, and they have taken a round hole, and tried to put it in a square peg," said Van Hees, who rates Intel a "buy". Intel, which is the largest private employer in Israel, hopes to bank on its experience to maintain Mobileye's startup culture, bringing Mobileye's "quick moving, fast acting culture" into Intel's autonomous driving division, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call with analysts. Intel, which has been looking to shift away from its traditional business, missed the smartphone boom in the last decade but analysts hope the company will avoid a repeat. "Investors should be pleased with the perspective that they(Intel) are getting in on this trend fairly early," according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.

The biggest beneficiaries will be the Mobileye’s shareholders, founders and senior executives, who stand to enjoy profits in excess of $3 billion from the Intel deal.

The Intel deal may be the harbinger of more Israeli auto tech companies' success. Richard Drew/AP Israel as a lab for smart transportation An exit drought, or has Israeli high-tech matured? Israeli firm invests in Intel chip to power self-driving vehicles The biggest beneficiaries from Intel’s decision to spend $15.3 billion on the Israeli driverless-technology firm Mobileye will be the company’s shareholders, founders and senior executives, who stand to enjoy profits in excess of $3 billion. But the Israeli government won’t be far behind, collecting a tax windfall that could add up to more than $1 billion. Shmuel Harlap, a founder of Colmobil (which imports Mitsubishi and Hyundai cars into Israel), is Mobileye’s principal outside shareholder: His 7 percent  stake will be worth about $1 billion under the terms of the sale. Mobileye’s cofounders – Amnon Shashua, who is also chairman and chief technology officer, and CEO Ziv Aviram – own 7.5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, and will also be getting $1 billion-plus. Unlike Harlap, who was one of the company’s first investors and says he never sold any of his shares, Aviram and Shashua have already earned big profits on their Mobileye shares: they have been selling them on the stock exchange over the last two and a half years. Based on filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Shashua had sold some $200 million worth of shares to date, including $45 million last year, while Aviram had sold $240 million worth of shares, including $80 million last year. Harlap’s business relies less on borrowing than many other Israeli tycoons, so he could afford to retain the shares even when their price peaked in 2015 and he could have sold them for $1.2 billion, industry sources said. Harlap had expected the company to reach a higher valuation than the one reflected by the Intel deal. According to Mobileye’s financial reports, the company’s managers and workers have 29 million in stock options they haven’t exercised. Of these, 19 million have already vested, but options vesting is typically accelerated during an acquisition. The options can be exercised at an average price of $21, which means an average profit of $42.50 a share because Intel will be buying Mobileye stock at $63.54 a share. All told, that adds up to a combined $1.2 billion for Mobileye’s managers and employees. Among those with the biggest payouts are Gaby Hayon, senior vice president for research and development, who is due $11.3 million; Chief Financial Officer Ofer Maharshak ($7 million); and board member Eyal Desheh ($6.3 million). According to the website Stocker, the biggest winner among Mobileye’s institutional investors will be Menora Mivtachim, whose 941,000 shares are worth $60 million. Other institutions hold smaller quantities of shares worth only a few million apiece. Shashua, Aviram and Harlap face a capital gains tax of 25 percent to 30 percent, in addition to a tax surcharge of 3 percent. As a result, they’re expected to pay over $1 billion in taxes on the $3.3 billion they receive from Intel, including options that vest within the next month. In shekel terms, that comes to about 3.7 billion shekels in taxes to the Tax Authority. To illustrate how big a windfall that will be for the treasury, the government’s recently completed tax amnesty program is expected to bring in about 2 billion shekels over the two and a half years it ran. The next three largest shareholders – Hayon, Maharshak and Desheh, with about 100,000 to 200,000 shares each – are expected to pay a total of a few tens of millions of shekels in capital gains tax. Tax rules allow employees exercising stock options to classify the profits earnings not as wages but as capital gains. Even in cases where the two-year period required for reporting the sale as capital gains has not yet ended, they can leave the money with a trustee until the period ends and pay only the 25 percent capital gains tax rate – a major saving.

Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately US$15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in “autonomous driving” that could provide the technology at a lower cost. “The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” it said. “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to US$70 billion by 2030.” Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for “highly and fully automated driving” to be commercially available by 2021. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. ‘Data centres on wheels’ Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localisation. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that “together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry.” “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” he said in the statement. “It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers.” The companies said the transaction, approved by the boards of both Intel and Mobileye, is expected to close within the next nine months. “As cars progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels,” the statement said. “Intel expects that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day, which plays to Intel’s strengths in high-performance computing and network connectivity.” Israeli officials were also touting the deal as a sign of confidence in the country’s high-tech sector — an industry that has given it the nickname the “start-up nation”. “What’s important now is that the production remains in Israel, where some 300 international companies are located,” Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen told army radio. Intel has long had operations in Israel, opening its first development centre in 1974. In 2014, the firm announced it was to invest close to US$6 billion in upgrading its Israeli production facilities. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Horizon Zero Dawn’ passes 2.6 million sales, sets specific record Want to protect your smartphone?

U.S. microprocessor giant Intel said Monday that it has agreed to buy Mobileye, an Israeli developer of driverless technologies, for 15.3 billion U.S. dollars, a record sum for an Israeli high-tech firm. (Xinhua/JINI) SAN FRANCISCO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp. and Mobileye N.V. announced Monday an agreement under which the U.S. computer chipmaker would acquire the Israeli self-driving vehicle technology developer for about 15.3 billion U.S. dollars. Intel, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, said the deal will bring together Mobileye's leading computer vision expertise with Intel's high performance computing and connectivity expertise to create automated driving solutions from cloud to car. The goal of acquiring the Jerusalem-based company, as the world's largest chipmaker claimed in a press release, is to position Intel to accelerate innovation for automakers and to capture fast-growing market opportunity, estimated to be up to 70 billion dollars by 2030. Intel hailed Mobileye as a global leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The deal is expected to be the largest exit in Israel's high-tech industry to date. "This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers," said Brian Krzanich, Intel's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). "Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers." In extending Intel's strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities, Krzanich envisions combining his company's technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car's path and making real-time driving decisions with Mobileye's abilities to bring automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. "We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative. It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers," said Ziv Aviram, Mobileye Co-Founder, President and CEO. "By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centers and high-performance computing platforms." While Intel intends to fund the acquisition with cash from the balance sheet, a subsidiary of the company will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye, listed on the New York Stock Market since 2014, for 63.54 dollars per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately 15.3 billion dollars and an enterprise value of 14.7 billion dollars. Already approved by the Intel and Mobileye Boards of Directors, the transaction is expected to close within the next nine months.

Matthew Heller March 13, 2017 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Intel said Monday it would buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, betting it can become a leader in developing driverless systems for automakers as it continues to diversify away from its legacy chip business. The bet is quite an expensive one for Intel, pricing Mobileye at about 21 times expected 2017 revenue — more than six times the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average. Intel will pay $63.54-per-share, a premium of about 33% to Mobileye’s closing price on Friday. Recommended Stories: Dutch Paint Maker Rebuffs PPG’s $22B Offer Shell to Sell Alberta Oil Sand Assets for $8.5B SunEdison Sells Yieldco to Brookfield for $787M Mobileye’s cameras, sensor chips and other technologies help autonomous vehicles safely navigate streets. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. “The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business,” Reuters said. Intel had not been a significant player in the sector but the deal could put it in direct competition with such companies as Nvidia and Qualcomm. “In October, Qualcomm acquired automotive chip supplier NXP for $47 billion, further fueling Intel’s need to quickly get on board the automotive wave,” Recode noted. “That’s especially true given Intel missed the mobile wave and is attempting to make up for it through investments in virtual reality and self-driving technology.” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich estimates self-driving will be a $70 billion industry by 2030. The company had previously partnered with Mobileye and BMW to bring autonomous cars to city streets by 2021 and had acquired a 15% stake in Here, a digital mapping business. Some investment analysts raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price, but Betsy Van Hees of Loop Capital Market said the deal was “a tremendous opportunity for [Intel] to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities.” “This deal makes Intel a Tier 1 partner for the automotive industry,” Martin Birkner, an automotive analyst at Gartner, told The New York Times.

Intel announced itself as a contender with its acquisition of Mobileye, which creates software that reads inputs from cameras, radar and laser sensors. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint DETROIT – Intel will buy Israel's Mobileye in a deal valued at about $15 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The deal announced Monday combines Mobileye's market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel's hardware, data centers and software, giving automakers a one-stop shop for fully autonomous systems. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination, expected to close by year's end, will allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye's leadership position, officials from the companies said. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Nearly all use Mobileye's software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 automakers. It also controls about 70 percent of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semiautonomous cruise control systems that are in cars and trucks on the road today. Sebastian Scheiner &#x2022; Associated Press Jerusalem-based Mobileye will absorb Intel’s autonomous driving division, with the combined operations to be based in Israel. Intel's involvement and the big price tag show that autonomous cars are coming in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the internet and access to bigger data centers, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts. Automakers, Krzanich said, want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place. "If you put all of that together, you really get an end-to-end solution for autonomous driving," said Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit. In the deal, Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The deal is the latest combination as automakers and technology firms race to build autonomous cars and for leadership in auto electronics. It moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google's Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. The deal also is likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. Mobileye, with 660 employees, has been forming partnerships worldwide as its growth continued as a separate company. BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnered last year, and Mobileye teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Competitors also formed partnerships in 2016. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. Ford has invested $150 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne, and it recently announced a $1 billion purchase of budding robotics start-up Argo AI. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the Intel acquisition of Mobileye, which he said was the largest deal in the country's history. He said he's been assured that the company's operations will stay in Israel. "The purchase dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is coming true. Israel is turning into a global technology center," he said. The combined global autonomous driving company will be based in Israel, supporting both companies' existing production programs and building on relationships with automakers, Tier-1 parts suppliers and semiconductor partners, the companies said.

The deal announced Monday combines Mobileye's market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel's hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous systems. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination, expected to close by year's end, will allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye's leadership position, officials from the companies said. Automakers and technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states.

(Sebastian Scheiner/Associated Press) By TOM KRISHER, Associated Press Published: March 13, 2017, 5:05 PM A   A Partnerships at a Glance Intel Corp. said Monday that it will spend more than $15 billion to acquire Israel’s Mobileye NV, a software maker that processes the information cars see from cameras and sensors. Here’s a quick rundown of who’s working with whom: INTEL (HERE, BMW, DAIMLER, AUDI, MOBILEYE) • Intel Corp. acquired a 15-percent stake in HERE, a digital mapping service, in January. Nokia Corp. sold HERE to German automakers Daimler AG, BMW AG and Audi AG in 2015 for $3.1 billion. • BMW teamed up with Intel and Mobileye in July to build and commercialize self-driving vehicles by 2021. BMW’s iNext electric sedan will serve as the platform for the technology. BMW says that the partnership will proceed as Intel and Mobileye combine. UBER (GM, VOLVO, DAIMLER, OTTO, DIDI, TOYOTA) • Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies announced a partnership with Daimler AG in January. Daimler, which makes Mercedes-Benz vehicles, plans to supply autonomous cars to Uber’s network in the future. • General Motors Co. partnered with Uber in November. GM is renting cars to Uber drivers through the deal. • Volvo Cars signed a $300 million deal with Uber in August. Volvo is providing vehicles for research and for Uber’s semi-autonomous taxi fleet in Pittsburgh. • Uber bought Otto, a startup that has developed self-driving software for big rigs, for $680 million in August. • Uber sold its China business to Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing in August in exchange for an 18-percent stake in Didi. Didi invested $1 billion in Uber as part of the deal. • Toyota Motor Corp. bought a small stake in Uber in May. GENERAL MOTORS (LYFT, CRUISE AUTOMATION) • General Motors Co. invested $500 million in ride-hailing company Lyft Inc. in January 2016. The companies are developing autonomous electric taxis.

NISSAN (SYLPHEO, NASA) • The Renault-Nissan Alliance purchased French software company Sylpheo in September to develop ride-hailing and car-sharing services. • Nissan and NASA announced a five-year partnership in January 2015 to develop autonomous driving systems. Nissan is testing self-driving systems with remote human managers that were initially developed for the Mars rover. DETROIT — Computer chip maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than $15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year’s end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three to five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a University of Notre Dame professor who has written about the future of automation. “Major players are finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,” he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver’s seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye’s technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. “They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market.” Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still haven’t aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel’s growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday’s deal combines Mobileye’s software with Intel’s hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees. The deal moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google’s Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. It’s likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. The acquisition should have little short-term impact on competitors such as Autoliv and Continental, and Intel and Mobileye already are working with supplier Delphi and BMW to test cars, Jefferies analyst Ashik Kurian wrote in a note to investors. But in the long-term as the market moves toward more autonomous vehicles, the hookup “confirms our concern about the emergence of new large and well-capitalized competitors” threatening auto suppliers, Kurian wrote. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. That’s below Mobileye’s record high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the shares to $80. Mobileye NV’s stock closed Monday up 28 percent to $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16.

Intel revealed March 13 that it figuratively will write a check with a lot of zeroes, $15,300,000,000 ($15.3 billion, for short), to acquire autonomous vehicle-software maker Mobileye. That's putting a company's money where its risks are. The transaction immediately gives Intel a strong new position in the market for autonomous vehicle IT while at the same time connecting it in a new way with more than a dozen of the most prominent automakers in the world. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its closing price on March 10. Mobileye NV's stock closed March 13 up 28 percent at $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16. Board members of both companies still must approve the transaction. The acquisition will result in an autonomous-driving Intel division that combines Mobileye with Intel's Automated Driving Group. The team will be based in Jerusalem, Israel; it will be led by Amnon Shashua, who currently serves as Mobileye CTO and board chairman. Further reading Apple, Android Smartphones Invite Cyber-Attacks LG Stylo 3 Comes to Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile Mobileye Already Owns 70 Percent of Market for Driver-Assist Systems According to software industry analyst IHS, Mobileye currently owns about 70 percent of the world market for driver-assistance systems, including automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. The analyst firm said it expects to see as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles on the nation's roads by 2035. That's the market in which Intel is on the road to become a vital supplier. Intel, Mobileye and BMW partnered last year with the five-year goal of developing fully autonomous driving as a platform for other automakers to license and use by 2021. Automotive industry analysts have projected automated vehicles to begin carrying passengers as a commonplace occurance within the next three to five years. Google, which now calls its program Waymo, has been testing its own driverless autos for nearly eight years, and Uber has been doing the same for about three years. Mobileye Entrenched as a Key Auto Industry Supplier Intel is buying a well-established company. Mobileye's intellectual property, which includes vision chips and software that interprets data from a camera to anticipate possible collisions with cars, people, animals, and other objects, is already used by 27 automakers, including Audi, BMW, General Motors and Ford. Mobileye specializes in software that processes information detected from cameras and other sensors in order to decide where a car should steer or to use emergency braking. The combination of its IP with Intel's adds hardware, software expertise and several data centers to the companies' goal of making driverless car transportation a normal experience. "Intel's acquisition of Mobileye underscores the potential for autonomous driving and magnitude of investment required to realize it," Paul Asel of Nokia Growth Partners told eWEEK in a media advisory.  "The acquisition furthers two trends:  semiconductor industry consolidation and the entry of tech majors into the auto sector through acquisition (Samsung/Harmon). The acquisition bolsters Intel's effort to enter the automotive sector and broadens its automotive offering. Highlighting that the acquisition is immediately accretive, Intel is signaling its view that pricing is reasonable, which is reinforced by recent comparable acquisitions.    "From Mobile Eye's perspective, the sale may be timely, as there are numerous new entrants in the space that will put pricing pressure on its products," Asel said. Companies Will Co-Develop New Systems Intel and Mobileye want to co-develop a set of sensors and camera systems that are expected to bring in annual revenue in the $10 billion range by 2022, according to IHS. "Mobileye brings the industry's best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said. "Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers."

WIRED tested the watch in Switzerland By Matt Burgess 1 day ago By Matt Burgess Wednesday 15 March 2017 WIRED TAG Heuer's first attempt at a smartwatch, in 2015, sold 56,000 units and was deemed a success by the Swiss manufacturer. For its new version, the company's CEO has set a more ambitious target. Almost everything on TAG Heuer's £1,400 Modular 45 can be swapped out and customised Almost everything on TAG Heuer's £1,400 Modular 45 can be swapped out and customised Tag Heuer 4 hours ago ADVERTISEMENT "We will work to sell 150,000 pieces," Jean-Claude Biver, the firm's boss, said at the launch of the TAG Heuer Modular Connected 45 in Switzerland. "It's my objective at least. We have to own your wrists". TAG's latest device, Biver says, is made with Swiss tradition in mind. It carries the Swiss Made label and had most of its parts made in the country despite partnerships with Silicon Valley giants Google and Intel. READ NEXT Almost everything on TAG Heuer's £1,400 Modular 45 can be swapped out and customised Almost everything on TAG Heuer's £1,400 Modular 45 can be swapped out and customised By Matt Burgess WIRED However, the firm has attempted to make the watch stand-out from an increasingly congested high-end smartwatch market. To do this it has turned to a modular design where almost every part of the watch can be replaced and customised - the touchscreen watch head can even be replaced by a classic mechanical watch. Across the TAG Heuer Modular Connected 45 there are up to 4,000 different variations of watch that can be created, the firm says. Although most of the varieties involve customisable screen displays there are physical straps, lugs, buckles, and, importantly, the ability to switch between a digital and mechanical module. WIRED tested out the modular concept at the watch's launch. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Montblanc launches its first smartwatch, the €890 Montblanc Summit Montblanc launches its first smartwatch, the €890 Montblanc Summit By Victoria Woollaston As would be expected, it is incredibly simple to switch between different watch elements. All of the individual modular parts are easy to fit together and undo from each other. Buttons on the lugs and main module unclip when they are pressed and replacing them with another part is as simple as clicking the pieces together. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT The best watches for men and women The best watches for men and women By WIRED 27 items "Every customer wants to have an individual watch," Biver said. This is something that is achievable with his new creation. Across the different watch parts there are rose gold, titanium, rubber, steel and more variations to chose from. It's possible to pair a diamond studded connected watch-face with a rubber strap and rose gold lugs. To wear, in a limited test, WIRED found the watch to be comfortable and unobtrusive. For some it may be slightly too thick but this is down to personal preference. The Modular Connected's 45mm diameter, like many smartwatches, is large on the wrist and those with slight wrists may struggle with its size. WIRED While operating the watch – which has an Intel processor inside and 4GB of RAM – it is smooth to move between screens and it responds quickly to touch. Unlike the first TAG smartwatch the new model has an entirely metal casing; the initial offering came with a plastic backing. To include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and NFC for payments, within a metal casing, Intel says it was forced to redesign its antennae so the signals could pass through the device. What is missing, when compared to other watches in the field, is a heart rate monitor. The inclusion of the Android Wear 2.0 operating system means the watch is one of the first models to run Google's OS and allows for software to be customised. The new operating system also means it is possible to use the watch's features when it is not connected to a phone – runners, for example, can track their movements via GPS without having to carry their device. ADVERTISEMENT As a standalone product, the TAG has many of the features to compete with the likes of Apple's Watch but also the Swiss history and pedigree. Its price (£1,400) is similar to the first generation of TAG watches. Several times during his presentation of the watch Biver's emphasised him firm's desire to continue to create a quality product. WIRED The gamble for TAG is whether a modular watch will appeal to its customers. Creating modular products is not a new phenomena; both modular mobile phones and houses are produced. Biver's later speculation that: "one day all the watches will be modular" is something that will be put to the test in the watch's sales figures.

Video Nvidia's mighty GeForce GTX 1080 Ti cranks PC gaming to 11 Wind River, an IoT software division of Intel, wants to help industrial users bring their legacy machine-to-machine systems into the age of open source and cloud computing. On Tuesday, it introduced software to virtualize industrial applications at the edge of the network, letting enterprises gradually migrate from older M2M technology to modern systems that give them more flexibility. The platform, called Wind River Titanium Control, runs on commodity Xeon hardware and uses widely adopted cloud platforms such as OpenStack and KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). The company has validated hardware systems from major manufacturers to run Titanium Control and pre-validated virtual network applications through its Titanium Cloud Ecosystem, begun in 2014. Titanium Control is targeted at industries like manufacturing, energy and health care. Machines have been talking to other machines for decades, but before IoT, they used closed systems that couldn't take advantage of the internet or open-source development. IoT is designed to replace those vertical solutions with horizontal layers of technology available from multiple vendors. Virtualized cloud infrastructure could help companies make that transition. Some legacy M2M users are under pressure to do so because the older systems are starting to reach the end of their lives and demand difficult and expensive maintenance, Wind River says. Titanium Control is designed for on-premises cloud infrastructure that can operate alongside legacy industrial systems so enterprises can migrate old applications and services over time. In addition to OpenStack and KVM, it works with Linux and the Ceph distributed storage system. It also includes management tools for things like upgrading software and patching components without shutting down service, Wind River says. The platform can scale from two to more than 100 compute nodes. It can be used in architectures like fog computing that place processing at the edge of a network to minimize delays and network traffic, Wind River says. That serves one of Intel's other big goals in IoT, where it wants to sell chips into the potentially huge market of edge computing.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 Smartwatch officially announced By Rei Padla - March 14, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter After more than a year, luxury watch maker TAG Heuer has come up with a new smartwatch. We were waiting for this announcement since the other day when we learned that the brand will be releasing a next-gen wearable device. The company made the special announcement together with Intel, showing off the latest luxury connected watch that will not only impress you because “It’s a TAG Heuer” but this one will also wow the tech industry for being modular. The design that OEM’s have been pushing on the smartphone is now a special element of the new smartwatch. The idea of a modular smartwatch is nothing new but not many companies can come up with one that really works. This is a bit tricky though because the price of each TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 will cost you a lot of money. It’s not just any ordinary wearable you can easily modify unless you are really rich. From the TAG Heuer Connected to this new Connected Modular 45, TAG Heuer seems to be serious with advancing the Swiss watchmaking tradition and extending it to the tech world. Not that it needs to prove something but we’re guessing it’s simply going with the times. That’s innovation for you and believe it or not, there is a market. We don’t have the exact numbers but the company said they sold a lot. The Android Wear and Intel-powered smartwatch was in demand especially last year that they had to stop sales for a while. Production was then amped up and TAG Heuer soon exceeded sales expectations. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is an all-metal smartwatch that features Near Field Communication, GPS, Bluetooth, Wifi, health sensors, Android Pay support, and Google Voice control. The device comes equipped with a 1.39-inch AMOLED touchscreen display, 5 sapphire cover glass, durable titanium case, 12-hour day battery, 4GB memory, and water resistance. It’s modular so it’s obviously customizable. Feel free to personalize your new TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. Choose from the 11 standard models you will see in-store. If you can’t choose one, you may request for more because there will be 45 more models waiting. You can also select the watch dial, buckle, bracelet, horns, and other modules. You can also choose from either the Heuer 02T Tourbillon Chronograph or a mechanical watch for the main module. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and runs Android Wear 2.0 already. This means the smartwatch apps can work on their own without the need for a compatible smartphone. Product comes with a premium price tag that reads $1,600 and is now up for purchase at tagheuer.com, specialty watch stores, major retailers, and TAG Heuer stores.

Friday, March 17, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Archive thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Intel’s US$15 billion purchase of Mobileye shakes up driverless car sector March 15, 2017, Wednesday JERUSALEM/DETROIT: Intel Corp agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for US$15.3 billion in a deal that could thrust the US chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc to develop driverless systems for global automakers. The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about US$3 billion in 2015 to US$96 billion in 2025 and US$290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. “This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical… The price seems fair,” she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move “very far outside its core business franchise.” The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the “very expensive transaction” improved Intel’s position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP. The US$63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 per cent to Mobileye’s closing price of US$47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of US$64.14 in August 2015. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

(Investor's Business Daily) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) will acquire Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY) for $15.3 billion or $63.54 per share, representing a premium of 34 percent to Mobileye’s closing price on March 10. Summit Redstone’s Jagadish Iyer mentioned that Intel intends to fund the transaction in cash from the offshore cash on its balance sheet. Intel also emphasized it would achieve $175 million in cost synergies by 2019 by getting rid of duplicated R&D functions, as well as cutting SG&A expenses, apart from the tax benefits from the merger. “The deal which has been approved by both boards is subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions and will likely close over the next 9 months,” Iyer stated. Related Link: Intel's Shaky M&A Track Record Benefits for Intel The analyst believes the acquisition could add $0.06-$0.10 to Intel’s earnings in 2018, noting that Mobileye generates free cash flow at 45 percent of its revenues, which is almost double that of Intel. “While MBLY sales is quite small when compared to Intel, we believe it clearly has a positive impact on both earnings and free cash flow generation given the high margin profile of the company,” Iyer explained. Large TAM In addition, the acquisition would open up a large total addressable market for Intel in the growing automotive arena over the next decade. “Intel's game plan is to offer a reference design to car makers that they can subsequently customize depending on their own needs. The key goal for Intel is to have a rising content/vehicle which when combined with a growing unit increase should help the autos segment to be a key LT revenue driver for the company,” the analyst said. With the integration of Mobileye, Intel will be able to provide both compute vision as well as the compute function, which is key to autonomous driving.

Ronen Zvulun/Reuters | Caption Loading... J Walker Glascock Contributor March 14, 2017 —Intel Corporation, a major US manufacturer of semiconductor chips, looks to seize a share of the self-driving car industry with their recent purchase of Mobileye, an Israeli maker of collision avoidance systems for cars. Entering the stage as one of the largest acquisitions in one of the most rapidly developing sectors of the tech industry, Intel joins other Silicon Valley behemoths such as Google, Uber, and Tesla, which have led the charge in developing autonomous vehicles. Previously, both Google and Uber had partnered with Fiat Chrysler and Volvo respectively under the expressed intention of utilizing such a collaboration to more rapidly produce safe and effective self-driving cars. So far Google’s self-driving prototypes have covered more than 1.5 million miles nationwide while Uber has been testing a fleet of autonomous Volvos on the streets of several cities, including Pittsburgh, since October. Meanwhile, General Motors announced early in 2016 they were making a $500-million investment in self-driving vehicles via a partnership with rideshare company Lyft. And Ford announced last September that they would have an affordable, driverless vehicle road-ready by 2025. How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Intel now aims to step into the forefront of the increasingly competitive field through their high-valued purchase of Mobileye – already a major manufacturer of the sensors and collision avoidance systems used by Tesla, BMW, General Motors, and Volvo. The deal which comes in at just over $15 billion, or $63.54 per share, stands as one of the largest investments yet made by the chipmaker, however Intel sees this as a move that will leapfrog them into a top spot in the burgeoning industry.  Intel expects the acquisition to “accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” according to a press release.  The release continued on to say that, “this acquisition will combine the best-in-class technologies from both companies, spanning connectivity, computer vision, data center, sensor fusion, high-performance computing, localization and mapping, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Together with partners and customers, Intel and Mobileye expect to deliver driving solutions that will transform the automotive industry.” In January, BMW, Intel, and Mobileye announced a combined effort to put 40 autonomous BMW vehicles on the road in the United States and Europe as a test trial. BMW says it plans to sell fully autonomous cars by 2021. Intel isn’t alone in seeing the potential of this purchase. According to a research note written by Akhilesh Kona, an analyst with IHS Markit, Intel will “be a one-stop-shop, offering hardware and software solutions for infotainment and automated driving applications,” according to CBS News. Acquiring Mobileye “represents a major change for the automotive supply chain and will put Intel in a prevailing position for the autonomous car market.”  But other analysts are more circumspect in their expectations, noting that Intel has lately established a history of spending a considerable amount of money without seeing much of a return on investment. "We can recall few cases where so much has been spent (habitually) to buy so little," said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, according to Reuters, noting that over the past few years Intel has spent more than $30 billion while only adding $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue. But CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino tells Reuters that “investors should be pleased with the perspective that they (Intel) are getting in on this trend fairly early,” referring to the autonomous vehicle market, after mentioning that Intel missed the explosive growth of the mobile industry in the past decade.

Sign Up × With the Mobileye acquisition, Intel is “paying a huge premium in order to catch up, to get into the front of the line, rather than attempt to build from scratch,” Mike Ramsey, an analyst with technology researcher Gartner told Bloomberg News. Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich explained the decision to Bloomberg by saying, “we are looking beyond just the revenue it’s going to grow into. If you look at where autonomous vehicles are going, you have to make a deal in order to be there in 2021 when models hit the road.” Give us your feedback, please. Give us your feedback, please.

The awards ceremony took place in Washington, D.C., on March 14, 2017. Photo Credit: Lloyd Wolf advertisement | advertise on newsday WASHINGTON — Jericho High School senior Archana Verma won fifth place Tuesday night in one of the nation’s most prestigious science and math competitions for her work that could lead to efficient solar energy windows. Verma was one of three Long Island seniors among the nation’s top young scientific minds chosen as finalists from 1,749 entries in the Regeneron Science Talent Search.

The two others were Nathaniel Lee, also of Jericho High, who worked on improving laser technology to help detect diseases or even bombs and Emily Peterson of Smithtown High School East in St. James, whose work focused on healing burn victims. All are 17. The 40 finalists were honored at a gala at the National Building Museum for the competition, a program of the nonprofit Society for Science & the Public that previously was sponsored by Westinghouse and then Intel. The contest has 12 Nobel Prize winners who are alumni. The top prize — and $250,000 — went to Indrani Das, 17, of the Academy for Medical Science Technology in Oradell, New Jersey. She did an in vitro study of treatment for brain injury. Long IslandMeet the 58 LI student winners Verma was awarded $90,000 for fifth place and Lee and Peterson won $25,000 each. advertisement | advertise on newsday Verma’s mouth opened wide as her high school was announced, replaced by a huge smile. As the winners absorbed the news on stage minutes after the announcement, Serena McCalla, science research coordinator at Jericho, blew a kiss to Verma. “She’s so stoic about it — scream!” she instructed her student with a smile. “I will soon,” Verma promised. “I am completely in shock.” Verma’s parents, Alka, a homemaker, and Rakesh, who works in finance, watched from the audience. “When they said Jericho, my heart stopped,” her mother said. “Everyone is a winner but being top 10 is special.” EducationMeet LI's 2016 Intel finalists, semifinalists Verma studied dyes to look for more efficient types that can be used in windows that generate solar energy. Current dyes convert only 15 percent of sunlight into energy, and Verma said she liked the idea of drawing attention to new ways of looking at the problem to find more efficiency. She also plays badminton, dances Bollywood style and leads Science Bowl and Quiz Bowl teams at her school. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff McCalla said Verma’s depth of understanding likely impressed the judges. “Perseverance, dedication, motivation: She has the trifecta,” McCalla said. “She doesn’t accept not knowing something.” Peterson’s work focused on a particular protein’s effect on skin cancers and burns. Her father, Kevin, is a St. James firefighter and Suffolk County fire marshal. When she was 8 or 9, she was so affected by hearing him talk about burn victims that she founded a charity that gives teddy bears to young burn victims at Stony Brook Hospital. Long Island2015 Intel finalists and semifinalists on LI “I’ve gotten to see people affected by large-scale wounds and I know how devastating they can be,” she said of her visits to the burn unit, just as a contest judge stopped by her poster to tell her she has a bright future. advertisement | advertise on newsday Peterson also competes on the math and badminton teams at Smithtown East. Maria Zeitlin, science research coordinator at Smithtown, said Peterson already thinks like a scientist. “She asks great questions,” Zeitlin said. “She’s not as interested in the results as where the results will steer her for the right questions.” Lee was inspired by his grandfather’s illness, which went undetected after a regular checkup. He studied a way to improve optical parametric oscillators, which someday may be used for early detection of diseases or on military vehicles to scan for explosives or poison gases. Long IslandLong Island's 2014 Intel finalists and semifinalists OPOs, as they are known, are laserlike devices that use crystals that are expensive, hard-to-make and toxic. Lee worked on a low-cost ceramic replacement for the crystals that now is in clinical trials. advertisement | advertise on newsday Lee’s grandfather now is in his 90s and Lee hopes his research means others will have diseases detected earlier. “We might be able to detect diseases pre-emptively instead of waiting for symptoms to show,” said Lee, wearing a tuxedo, his finalist blue ribbon and a big smile. He also is an Eagle Scout, cross country runner and president of the Student Council at Jericho High School. The finalists spent nearly a week in Washington and explained their work to public visitors at the National Geographic Society, answered questions from judges and met with leaders in science and politics. Lee said he enjoyed answering questions from everyone from college professors to students who wanted his email to ask for advice on science projects. All three students are waiting to hear from colleges. Verma wants to study chemical engineering, Peterson wants to study biochemistry to prepare for medical school and Lee plans to study computer science. Verma’s father said the experience in the Regeneron competition has been amazing for his daughter. “This will go a long way in character development: the amount of hard work she did, the exposure she got, the unbelievable network of great people,” he said. “It’s a lifetime experience.” Rep. Thomas Suozzi (D-Glen Cove), whose district includes Jericho, gave Lee and Verma certificates of recognition and flags that had flown over the Capitol. “I’ve seen Long Island produce these amazing people with big ideas,” he said. “We need to encourage that and celebrate that.” This is the first year that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a Westchester County firm, sponsored the contest, which began in 1942. The company committed to a 10-year, $100 million investment and increased the prize money for winners. Get the Newsday Now newsletter!

Virtual machines, governed by a hypervisor, enforce data isolation in hardware; containers, while less secure, can be launched and deployed faster and offer flexibility in terms of portability across machines, shared repositories, and maintenance. Clear Containers, now at version 2.1.1, represents Intel's attempt to have the best of both worlds, to combine the security advantages of virtual machines with the deployment advantages of containers. The software is compatible withthe Open Container Initiative (OCI) and so can integrate with Docker 1.12 (and its Swarm toolkit) via the OCI runtime method. It relies on a kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) QEMU hypervisor, in conjunction with systemd and kernel optimizations, to minimize memory consumption while maximizing performance, at least in theory. A version bump last month to 2.1.0 added a slew of other improvements. These include: Improved host-guest communication. Support for Docker exec and Docker run. Additional workload isolation via namespaces. Better TTY handling. Support for Kubernetes pod semantics, to start Clear Containers via the Container Runtime Interface. There's still further work to do, however. As Intel's Damien Lespiau points out in one of many GitHub issues posts, installation on Redhat Enterprise Linux requires 71 commands. DevOps is not for the faint of heart. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Intel touts bug bounties to hardware hackers Website and Intel Security (McAfee) products excluded from 'Wild West' payouts scheme Intel reveals Optane will need a 7th-gen core and a PC-centric launch You're going to need a whole lot of Intel Inside to make this work 16 Comments Regular or premium?

(Seeking Alpha) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) caught the world off-guard when it announced a $15.3 billion buyout of Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY). For Intel investors attempting to determine how good of a deal the company got on its acquisition, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry has some bad news. “We think INTC’s CEO is completely clueless and probably is about to set the world record of burning $15 billion of shareholders money in microseconds,” Chowdhry explained bluntly. Related Link: Intel's Shaky M&A Track Record He believes the future of autonomous driving hinges on 3D sensor fusion and machine learning. Chowry sees Mobileye’s camera-focused technology as expendable and when it comes to advancing autonomous driving. “Basically, INTC has now inherited MBLY’s problems, and we don’t think INTC has the capability to fix MBLY issues,” he adds. Chowdhry points out that the Mobileye acquisition isn't the first time Intel has made a questionable buyout in recent years. He mentions Windriver Systems (2009), McAfee (2010) and Basis (2014) as three recent Intel takeovers that flopped. Chowdhry believes the Mobileye buyout adds zero value to Intel’s business and simply foots shareholders with a $15 billion bill. On the other hand, he argues the buyout could also set the stage for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) multiple expansion in coming months.

(Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) (Reuters/Hamodia) - Intel Corp.’s purchase of Israeli autonomous-vehicle-technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion on Monday is a deal that could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. to develop driverless systems for global automakers. The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. “This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical… The price seems fair,” she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move “very far outside its core business franchise.” The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the “very expensive transaction” improved Intel’s position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye’s shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel’s shares were down 2.1 percent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc. Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC, which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the “eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Meanwhile, in apparent fallout from the Mobileye deal, the shekel gained against the dollar by 0.45 percent over Monday’s exchange rate, pegged at NIS 3.6612/$ as of Tuesday afternoon. FXCM Israel said in its daily review: “The dollar-shekel pair retreated Monday, dipping below NIS 3.66/$, despite the U.S. dollar’s stability on world markets in advance of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday. It is possible that the relative strength of the shekel is a manifestation of the ‘Mobileye effect,’ which elevated the mood on the local market.” Filed under: Israel, Mergers & Acquisitions, Technology Print Email Gmail Related Intel Buys Big Into Israel’s Mobileye Self-Driving Future $15B Mobileye Deal a Windfall for the State and for Taxpayers Mobileye Signs With Volkswagen for Self-Driving Cars Delphi, Mobileye Join Forces on Autonomous-Car Platform Mobileye Shares Tumble in Row with Tesla More in Business Asian Share Markets Gain, U.S. Dollar Weaker After Fed Hike Business Briefs – March 15, 2017 Stocks Climb, Led by Energy Companies and Dividend Payers Fed Hikes Key Rate for Second Time in 3 Months Ahead of Fed Announcement, Stocks Climb, Led By Gains in Energy Companies OP-ED The Intelligence Committee’s Hearing On Russia Won’t Satisfy Democrats A Head Start on Discrimination Antidote to Amalek More Can Be Done for Missing IDF Soldiers Mitzvos and “Making It” More Than a Buzz Cellphone Withdrawal Down the Conspiracy Rabbit Hole Laziness isn’t why People are Poor, iPhones Aren’t why they Lack Health Care.

The announcement came a day after a historic buyout of Israeli car-sensor technology giant Mobileye by Intel. “Every car that’s imported into Israel will have to have smart systems, life-saving systems, installed as a condition for receiving a license in Israel,” Katz said at a joint press conference with the heads of Mobileye. Intel announced Monday that it had agreed to buy the Jerusalem-based developer of advanced vision and autonomous driving systems, for $15.3 billion, in the biggest high-tech deal in Israeli history. Ziv Aviram, Mobileye’s director-general, hailed the move. “You’ve now declared that you’re going to pull out all the stops to fight traffic accidents. We’ll set an example to the world,” he said, according to the Ynet news site. The “Mobileye” mounted on a car windshield, May 27, 2015. (Shai/FLASH90) Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon (Kulanu) meanwhile promised Tuesday that the tax revenue from the sale would be returned to the public in the form of lowered taxes or public services, adding that there would be an emphasis on assisting young couples. Aviram told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had called to congratulate him, that Mobileye would establish a world development center in Israel and would take responsibility internationally, on behalf of Intel, for the creation of a driverless car, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said.

It’s just not a good investment,” Pelosi said Tuesday. “Of course you have savings if you cut off millions of people from access to care.” Schumer said Democrats are ready to work with Republicans to fix those parts of ObamaCare that even supporters acknowledge are failing — but not under the current blueprint. “Until you take repeal off the table, we can’t support this, because it does so much damage,” he said. Schumer said not even Republican leaders want their name attached to the legislation. “Trump wants to call it RyanCare; [Speaker Paul] Ryan [R-Wis.] wants to call it TrumpCare — it’s classic Abbot and Costello,” Schumer charged. “If it’s so good, why don’t they want their names on it?” Tags Charles Schumer   View the discussion thread.

You can choose a mechanical or electronic watch face, alongside 46 other options for customization. By Jake Smith for iGeneration | March 14, 2017 -- 15:39 GMT (08:39 PDT) | Topic: Mobility (Image: Intel) Tag Heuer on Tuesday announced the latest Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch, dubbed the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. what's hot on zdnet Windows 10 tip: Master advanced window-snapping techniques How ethics migrate to the cloud Oracle CTO Ellison fixated on AWS, infrastructure as a service but why? AMD's Ryzen 5 threatens Intel's grip on the mainstream PC market The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,650, and with the help of Intel inside, features a modular design that allows customers to pick different colors, bracelets, buckles, and whether you want to use an electronic watch or a mechanical watch. Tag Heuer claims there are 46 different choices for customization, leading to over 400 different options. In Tag Heuer fashion, the Modular 45 is "Swiss made" and the price can jump to $17,000 depending on what is chosen during the design process. The Modular 45 is powered by an Intel Z34XX processor, and it has a 1.39-inch AMOLED display, GPS, and 4GB of RAM. Past the typical NFC and Wi-Fi, the Modular 45 claims 24 hours of active battery life. Intel hinted to The Verge the company is working on its own intelligent assistant for the Modular 45, and it could eventually appear on other smartwatches. The assistant is said to feature the ability to follow-up with questions in context to what the user originally asked. The Modular 45 is now available through Tag Heuer and could be a compelling option for those seeking a high-end Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch. Android Wear 2.0 Preview on a Huawei Watch:...

(VRX) VRX stock seems to be undergoing a slow liquidation. Retail investors like us get the short straw.

(DG) Stock Is an All-Weather Buy View All Posts Final chords are sounding for Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE:VRX). Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management has finally admitted defeat, taking a $2.8 billion loss and liquidating its position in VRX stock. Source: Wikimedia (Modified) Ackman reportedly got a minimum of $11.10 per share for the stake, with the stock closing on March 13 at $12.11 and preparing to open for trade March 14 at $10.86. Diamond Hill Capital Management has also dumped its Valeant stake, preferring to bet on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Some hedge funds are still active in the company, which appears to be undergoing a slow liquidation. The latest assets to be sold were the skin care line, which drew $1.3 billion from L’Oreal SA (ADR) (OTCMKTS:LRLCY), and Dendreon, a one-time high-flier in prostate cancer, which got $820 million from a Chinese company. Take What You Can Get The problem for Valeant is the debt it took on during its asset-buying binge early this decade, which was predicated on its ability to raise prices on generic products and book the profits in Canada. That long-term debt burden stood at nearly $30 billion at the end of last year, and the $2.1 billion earned through the latest sales will barely make a dent in it. This means some analysts still think VRX stock a good short, even at $10 per share, believing the company will soon be worthless as interest rates rise and it starts to violate profit covenants on the debt. The hedge funds remaining in the stock take solace from a March 10 statement from the company, to the effect that it had won consent for refinancing and an amendment of its credit agreements. In the deal, Valeant is taking out new loans maturing after 2022 to repay loans that come due before 2022, rolling over the debt and giving the company more time to raise cash. VRX recently offered to cash out $1.6 billion of debt paying 6.75% at close to its face value — an offer which expires on April 3. Valeant’s main leverage with creditors is now that it may default entirely on its debts and leave them with nothing, if it is pushed to the wall. The creditors are taking the threat seriously. What Is Left of Valeant? The best asset left on the board is what’s left of Bausch + Lomb, the eye care company bought for $8.7 billion in 2013. CEO Joseph Papa had said as recently as September that dermatology and eye care were “core assets” the company would never sell.

(VRX) Recent Posts: Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) Stock Is in a Gold-Plated Doghouse An Uber IPO Will Be a Down Round Dollar General Corp. (DG) Stock Is an All-Weather Buy View All Posts Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stunned the technology world on Monday by agreeing to buy Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) for $15.3 billion. The price — $63.54 per share of MBLY stock — represents a 50% premium over the Israeli company’s March 10 close and puts INTC in pole position to power the self-driving cars now approaching the market. Source: U.S. Embassy Tel Aviv via Flickr Intel originally said it would spend $250 million on self-driving cars, but in his announcement on the deal, CEO Brian Krzanich wrote that the company sees self-driving cars as a $70 billion technology opportunity by 2030. INTC had sales of about $59 billion last year. In the press release, Intel said the two companies can provide car companies with a “cloud to car” solution at lower costs, with INTC providing the brains of the car and MBLY the vision. Despite the happy talk, Intel stock was down 1.5% on Monday. MBLY stock, naturally, was up some 30%. Too Early? This is the second big autonomous car deal of the year, following completion of Samsung Electronics’ (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) $8 billion purchase of Harman International Industries. It also comes just six months after Mobileye had a very public breakup with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which accused it of trying to block its own efforts to create an autonomous driving system. But despite these big-money moves, self-driving cars are not yet a thing. Consumers are still very wary of them, and despite some great hockey stick graphs showing exponential growth, most car companies don’t expect to even offer them for several years. It is also very unclear which industry will reap the benefits of self-driving cars. Will it be service companies like Uber? Will it be tech companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which has more self-driving experience than any other company? Or could it be the auto industry itself, with Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) both positioning themselves to offer cars as a service and to dominate self-driving manufacture. Unlike the situation with the PC industry, in other words, where Intel achieved early dominance through partnerships with International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), this is no slam dunk for Intel, and the path forward is far from clear. Why Intel Got In That may be precisely why Intel has jumped into the party.

(Photo: Reuters) Intel Corp has had a tough time squeezing value out of recent mega-deals, putting some pressure on the success of its proposed $15 billion acquisition of Israeli car-technology firm Mobileye NV. Self-driving cars are widely seen as the future of transportation and a growth area, but the Intel deal depends on more than technology as it looks to expand revenue in an increasingly competitive nascent sector. The company's largest-ever deal, the $16.7 billion acquisition of programmable chipmaker Altera, has so far failed to meet its objective of helping to offset the continued decline in Intel's larger PC business. Intel also spun out its cybersecurity division, formerly known as McAfee, last year in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, about five years after having bought the antivirus software maker for $7.7 billion. "We can recall few cases where so much has been spent(habitually) to buy so little," said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Rasgon, who rates the stock "underperform", notes Intel has spent over $30 billion in the last few years, while only adding about $2 to $3 billion in revenue. Perhaps learning from those missteps, Intel's Mobileye deal is uniquely structured. The Santa Clara-based company's Automated Driving Group (ADG) will combine with Mobileye and will be led by Mobileye Chief Executive Amnon Shashua. Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said that Intel has previously attempted to fold acquisitions into its structure but they have not always been the right fit. Intel's deals for embedded systems software maker Wind River Systems and McAfee exemplified that strategy. "One of the things Intel has tried to do in the past is that they've taken a square peg, and they have taken a round hole and tried to put it in a square peg," said Van Hees, who rates Intel a "buy". Intel, which is the largest private employer in Israel, hopes to bank on its experience to maintain Mobileye's startup culture, bringing Mobileye's "quick moving, fast acting culture" into Intel's autonomous driving division, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call with analysts. Intel, which has been looking to shift away from its traditional business, missed the smartphone boom in the last decade but analysts hope the company will avoid a repeat. "Investors should be pleased with the perspective that they (Intel) are getting in on this trend fairly early," according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. acquisition deal Intel mobileye First Published: March 14, 2017, 7:16 PM IST Read full article Next Story Recommended For You Honda WR-V Launched at Rs 7.75 Lakh, A Jazzier Mini-SUV Anushka Sharma's Style Is Effortlessly Cool, Says Celebrity Stylist Allia Al Rufai Beauty and The Beast: Emma Watson's Film is a Progressive Step in The Disney Universe Game of Thrones: Sansa Stark to Die in Season 7?

Name: Subject: Message: TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45: Your Swiss-Made luxury smartwatch is here Newsby Bogdan Petrovan2 days ago 3 363 30 The first Swiss-Made connected watch has arrived. Following up on last year’s TAG Heuer Connected – which had sales of over 56,000 units! – the Swiss watchmaker is back with a new and highly-customizable model: the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. The Connected Modular 45 runs the recently launched Android Wear 2, and like its predecessor, it’s based on an Intel chip. Unlike the original Connected though, just about every part of the Modular 45 can be swapped, from the straps, to the buckles, and lugs, and even the watch module itself. That’s right, you can change the electronic module with a mechanical watch module, which not only gives you extra customization options, but it ensures that your expensive watch won’t become obsolete in just a few years. Thanks to the mechanical module that’s included in the package, the Connected Modular 45 qualifies for the Swiss Made label, which denotes that it’s made in Switzerland with predominantly Swiss components. That wasn’t the case with last year’s Tag Heuer Connected. It might not sound important to you, but watch aficionados – and the Swiss watchmaking industry – take the distinction very seriously. You can choose from a multitude of straps, finishes, materials and colors, across 11 base designs and 45 additional options that are available on special order, including premium materials like rose gold and diamonds. In total, there are 500 different design combinations, enough to satisfy the pickiest buyer. If you decide you want to switch between the digital and mechanical modules, you can do it yourself, thanks to a clever mechanism that doesn’t require using any special tools. The 45-mm watch module features a 1.39-inch AMOLED display covered in 2.5-millimeter-thick sapphire glass. The watch is made of sturdy titanium, and if you’re so inclined, you can dive down to 50 meters without fear of damage. Specifications are on par with recent Android Wear 2 devices, with the major difference being the processor. It’s an Intel Atom Z34XX, as opposed to the Snapdragon chips used on most other smartwatches. You get 4GB of RAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and the battery is good for 24 to 30 hours on a single charge. There’s no heart rate sensor, but the presence of an NFC antenna means you will be able to use the Connected Modular 45 to make Android Pay payments, smartphone-free. Google Assistant will be baked in, as with any Android Wear 2 device, but Intel will equip the Connected Modular 45 with its own brand of AI. It’s not clear for now what features this AI software will enable, though Intel promised it would stand on its own compared to Google’s Assistant. The AI will be added to the watch’s firmware via OTA at a later point. See also: Best smartwatches (March 2017) 4 days ago You didn’t expect the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 to be cheap, did you? The smartwatch will cost $1,650 in the United States, slightly more than the 2015 Connected. That’s the base version, adding fancier elements will make the price closer to $10,000. It will also go on sale in the UK, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore.

The win catapulted the St. Petersburg, Florida-based investment bank to the No. 20 ranking in 2017 among M&A bankers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Through Sunday, the company was at No. 79, similar to its standing in prior years. The investment bank traces its roots to a mutual fund brokerage and is known for advising wealthy individuals. Those businesses helped generate steady returns for Raymond James, which posted more than 100 straight profitable quarters, with the stock climbing more than fourfold since the end of 2008. The company has been expanding more recently in M&A advice by hiring from Wall Street rivals and taking over smaller firms. Raymond James’s relationship with Mobileye goes back to the tech firm’s 2014 initial public offering, when shares sold for $25 apiece. The Israeli company has since appeared at the broker’s signature annual conference, presenting to institutional investors in Orlando, Florida. The Intel transaction, with the buyer agreeing to pay $63.54 per share, highlights the benefits of the relationship. It also increases the brokerage’s prestige, said Ann Dai, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

The smartwatch’s buckle, bezel, straps, lugs and even the watch itself is modular, allowing users to swap the 1.39-inch AMOLED screen for a standard mechanical watch. The intention is that the customer won’t lose their investment in the device should the tech become outdated, or if they want to go for another style. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a genuine Swiss luxury watch engineered in collaboration with Intel https://t.co/ebn28PFBIG pic.twitter.com/dTYIfJiHKA — TAG Heuer (@TAGHeuer) March 14, 2017 Speaking of style, the watch is exceedingly versatile. The base Connected Modular 45 range comprises 11 designs. The watch module itself is available in silver or black and the straps come in various different colours in rubber, leather, titanium or ceramic materials. There are also 45 additional options, including more premium choices like leather and diamonds. In total, there are 56 designs and 500 design combinations. Of course, any of these upgrades will cause the cost to increase from the base $1,650 price tag. The device is powered by Intel’s Atom Z34XX processor (the smartwatch was created in close collaboration with Intel and Google) and runs Android Wear 2.0, which brings with it Google Assistant, mobile payments and a dedicated watch app store. It has a built-in GPS, Wi-Fi support, 4GB of storage, 512 MB of memory and is water resistant up to 50 meters — though customers who shell out the cash to purchase a Connected 45 may be hesitant to test the latter feature. The smartwatch lacks, however, standalone LTE and a heart rate sensor. The device is compatible with smartphones running Android 4.3 or higher, or iPhone 5 or later running iOS 9 or higher. It is currently unclear whether or not the Connected Modular 45 will make its way up north, though the prospects look good due to the original Tag Heuer Connected’s 2015 debut in Canada. MobileSyrup has reached out to confirm availability with Tag Heuer.

It had better make my morning coffee too! Holy mackerel! Rimtu Kahn Thanks for a “modular” watch Tag but this just cannot be the last word on a modular watch. I hope Lenovo comes up with a modular concept for a smartwatch that is as simple as it is for their smartphone motor z. “The smartwatch’s buckle, bezel, straps, lugs and even the watch itself is modular, allowing users to swap the 1.39-inch AMOLED screen for a standard mechanical watch. The intention is that the customer won’t lose their investment in the device should the tech become outdated, or if they want to go for another style.” This sounds to me like Tag wants to sell me a $200+13% tax for buckle, bezel, straps and lugs, since that’s what i will be left with when after a year by which time it is guaranteed that the smartwatch itself will be badly outdated. Raj Singh If you can’t part with $2,000 to have this on your wrist for a year or two, then it’s not meant for you. The original watch sold more units than they expected to so clearly there is a market for this. TheCuddlyKoala They want so badly to be Apple. The real Chug that Haterade Why?

REUTERS/Paul Hanna/File Photo prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A JERUSALEM: Israel's government will receive about 4 billion shekels (US$1.1 billion) after Intel's planned US$15.3 billion purchase of self-driving car tech firm Mobileye, helping the government cut more taxes, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon said on Tuesday. Kahlon said that the extra revenue was small compared with the total annual tax take of almost 300 billion shekels but that it would help the government cut other taxes. The funds from the Mobileye deal will come from capital gains taxes of as much as 30 percent that top shareholders will pay when they sell their stakes in the company. Kahlon said even without the Mobileye deal, the largest technology takeover in Israel's history, he was planning tax cuts. "I am in favour of lowering taxes. I have lowered taxes in the past. It's my policy," Kahlon said on Army Radio. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and Kahlon had agreed to formulate a plan to reduce taxes to further stimulate economic activity. The Bank of Israel opposes tax cuts, believing excess revenue should go towards debt reduction. Opposition leader Isaac Herzog said funds from the Mobileye deal should be diverted to bolstering the public health system. Israel's economy grew 4 percent in 2016 but growth is expected to slow to around 3.5 percent this year. In January, Kahlon said he would consider more tax cuts this year if tax revenue kept exceeding expectations. He lowered corporate tax by one point to 24 percent at the start of 2017, and the rate will drop to 23 percent at the start of 2018. Income taxes were also reduced. Kahlon declined to detail what taxes would be lowered in the next round but local media said value-added tax would fall from the current 17 percent while corporate taxes would be cut again. A spokesman for Kahlon was not available to comment. In the first two months of 2017, Israel collected 51.8 billion shekels in tax revenue, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
