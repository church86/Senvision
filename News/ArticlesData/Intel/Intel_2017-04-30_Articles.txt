The 2-in-1 tablet has been its number one selling product in 2015 and all the way to 2016. However, in recent months, tablet sales, especially that of Microsoft has fallen dramatically. Nonetheless, there are no new updates on the upcoming Surface Pro 5 from the software giant. This is why many consumers and fans alike are wondering when the much awaited tablet will be released. When Microsoft released the current Surface Pro back in 2015, the tablet introduced the new hardware of the time. However, since it has been years after the last update, the current models are somewhat lacking in terms of performance. Surface Pro 5 and Intel Kaby Lake Right now, the consensus is that Microsoft will go for the new Intel Kaby Lake series to power its next generation pro tablets. Of course, it is just plain common sense not to use an older hardware for a new device. While this may not be a surprise at all, perhaps the next question is, “will there be anything new on the Surface Pro 5?” New upgrades Since 2016, many market watchers and pundits have been speculating on what the Surface Pro 5 will be. Apart from the supposed Kaby Lake upgrade, many have given their pieces on what the display of the tablet will be. Surface Pro 4 (via microsoftstore.com) Some argued that the next-generation Surface Pro will retain is 2K resolution. Meanwhile some market watchers suggest that Microsoft might upgrade to a 4K display. Unfortunately, at the moment, there are not a lot of merits into using a 4K display on a tablet. For one,  the human eye will not be able to distinguish the difference in pixel density. This is mainly because the display is minuscule compared to a standard living room television. However, the 4K resolution may, in some cases, improve on the dynamic range of the display. This may result in better colour reproduction and improved contrast and saturation. Another thing worth considering is, 4K displays, due to increased pixel density, will require more power to operate. This will inevitably influence the design of the device, especially on the battery. At the moment, the Surface Pro 4 already has poor battery life with its 2736×1824 display resolution. Having a bigger display resolution will be quite taxing to the tablet’s already small battery. Surface Pro 5 and Snapdragon 835 By now, many will know that Microsoft and Qualcomm are working together to produce the first Snapdragon-powered tablet. Back in 2016, the two companies actually demoed a tablet running on full Windows 10 operating system just like the Surface Pro. In the said demo, the tablet in question is running the Windows 10 OS on a Snapdragon 821 SoC. Immediately after the demo video was released, Microsoft and Qualcomm announced that they are currently working on bringing the said OS onto the Snapdragon 835. MacBook showing Thunderbolt 3 port (via apple.com) While the prospect of having a Snapdragon-powered Windows 10 tablet is nice, it would seem that this product is, first of all, a mobile computer. It should not, however, be confused with a tablet or a laptop which is already mobile. Instead, this piece of device will have its connectivity focused on mobile networks just like a mobile phone. Based on the presentation given during last year’s Windows Hardware Engineering Conference in China, the Snapdragon-powered device will have an e-SIM built in. And since the connectivity is more on mobile networks, users will be able to monitor their data usage. For now, it is still uncertain if this supposed tablet will be a Surface Pro 5. However, there is a chance that Microsoft might introduce this variant in lieu of the M Series Intel-based model. Same old design Due to lack of updates, there are speculations that the Surface Pro 5 will not include massive design changes apart from the new Kaby Lake chips. Even the Surface port, which is a proprietary hardware from Microsoft, will be retained on the new design. Many hopefuls have been asking for the Thunderbolt 3.0 port. Fortunately, the new Kaby Lake series has native support for the interface so a Thunderbolt 3.0 on a Surface Pro 5 is highly likely. Surface Pen (via microsoftstore.com) On the other hand, there are rumors that Microsoft will introduce a new stylus for the Surface Pro. Based on the latest patent rounds filed by the company, it would seem that there will be some minor updates on the stylus including a built-in rechargeable battery. The said battery will be charged wirelessly when it is attached to the side of the tablet. However, as this is still a patent, there is a very slim chance that the feature will turn up on the upcoming iteration of the tablet. Nevertheless, this will, once and for all, answer all the complaints that Surface Pro users have on the Surface Pen. Surface Pro 5 release date There are a number of rumors surrounding the supposed release of the Surface Pro 5. Some say that it might happen sometime in the next couple of months. However, there are some who speculate that the release could be around October this year. This rumor is in line with reports that the tablet will be launched together with the Windows 10 Redstone 3 update. Nevertheless, many are expecting Microsoft to pull one out of the hat during an event in New York on May 2. Unfortunately, the said event, which is called #MicrosoftEDU is focused on delivering the new Windows 10 Cloud operating system. This new OS is Microsoft’s answer to the threat given by Google’s Chrome OS. As with the price, it is highly likely that Microsoft will not introduce a pricing hike on the next generation Surface Pros. This is due to the fact that most of its buyers are non-professionals who use the tablet as a daily driver. This is why the current generation Surface Book’s sales performance is quite stale.

Related Items Microsoft Surface Studio goes on sale in Australia Kids addicted to their mobiles? How to shut them down Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ 'evolutions' unveiled Local Real Estate Subscribe Now IT'S saying something that both the computer using public and AMD both have something to be happy about right now. It's been a long time since processor maker has brought something to market that truly created some competition with the industry heavyweight, Intel. But now they have. This is important for many reasons, not least of all being the pressure it puts on Intel to stop charging so much for processors, finally. It's also important because it creates competition in terms of things like features and compatibility. AMD released its new line of Ryzen processors in March to a lot of hope from those of us who are looking to build or upgrade our computers soon. Mainly this came from seeing Intel-competitive performance at price points so far below what we were used to it has made a huge change to the market. These new processors are based on the much-awaited new Zen architecture and come with new multitasking features and self-diagnostic sensors to make overclocking easier. From its top-of-the-line offering, the 1800X to its entry-level model, the 1400, the Ryzen processors are considered almost as good as their Intel counterparts but much better in terms of value for money. The Ryzen 7 line, the 1800x, 1700x, and 1700, is aimed squarely at intel's i7 series processors, while the Ryzen 5 line is, as you may have guessed, aimed at the Intel i5 series. The Ryzen 5 series, the 1600X, 1600, 1500X, and the 1400 represents the more affordable end of the processor offering from AMD. The 1600X is configured similarly to Intel's Core i7-6800k and has 6 cores running 12 threads. More cores and more threads let heavy-duty software such as image editing, video editing, and gaming run faster and more smoothly. The 1600 also shares the 6-core, 12-thread architecture while the 1500X and 1400 have four cores with eight threads. Even four cores is a solid architecture for anyone who isn't stretching their computer to some kind of limit. All the 5-series processors come with a default clock speed and a boost speed, with the processor running faster when it's better cooled. The 1600x is obviously the fastest out of the box but all processors are unlocked so that enthusiasts can overclock the chip for higher speeds. The suspicion here is that the 1600 will wind up being a better buy than the 1600x despite being 400mhz slower purely because the latter can be overclocked to, hopefully, similar performance to its faster cousin. Like anything to do with overclocking, however, it's not something you do unless you both completely understand how to do it and aren't afraid to risk shortening the lifespan of your processor if you do it badly. The Ryzen 5 processors are for most people. The 1400 being a perfect pick for a home theatre PC. The 1500X is hard to go past for a home computer. The 1600X and 1600 for gamers and people who edit some form of media who need a reliably fast card but can't or don't need to fork out for the Ryzen 7 models. When buying or building a new computer, keep an eye out for the Ryzen chips as they may just save you a lot of money for the performance they put out. amd Read More Login to follow games and gadgets Read More Login to follow intel Read More Login to follow ryzen Read More Login to follow zen architecture Read More Login to follow Topics:  amd games and gadgets intel ryzen zen architecture 0 PRINT Just In REVEALED: Bowen basin gas pipeline get green light Drunk driver, 10 beers down was 'soberest person at party' JonBenet murder ‘will remain unsolved’ Couple dish out real-world advice after 60 years together Group calls on 'bored' Ipswich youth to join them House destroyed by fire Top Stories Couple dish out real-world advice after 60 years together Ipswich's Ron and Noela are under no illusions about marriage and the fact that it can be tough News 1st May 2017 4:00 PM Comment Group calls on 'bored' Ipswich youth to join them House destroyed by fire Fire crews working to save neighbouring homes Neighbourhood evacuated following explosion threats Police allege man threatened to blow up house VIDEO: Sporting legend visits Ipswich school FORMER Wallaby skipper Andrew Slack visited the region Local Partners Community Your Story Local History More Community What's On PICTURES: Exhibition shows innocence caught up in war ABC cameraman and former QT snapper's images displayed in Ipswich History has a new home at Harrisville Relics saved by new funding Labour Day race meeting loved by families Thousands of bees relocated from Goodna water meter INFERNO: Dalby school shut as investigations continue THEN AND NOW: Anzac Day in Goodna 65 years apart DAWN SERVICE: Navy man reflects on Anzac Cove landing Group calls on 'bored' Ipswich youth to join them A NEW community group has opened in the region VIDEO: How this Ipswich teen launched her own album A FUTURE in music industry is bright for this self-funded artist WE’RE OPEN: Ipswich businesses open on Labour Day SEE what's open in Ipswich Entertainment CELEBRITY TV MOVIES MUSIC JonBenet murder ‘will remain unsolved’ THE Australian director of the documentary Casting JonBenet says the murder of the six-year-old beauty queen will remain unsolved.

Twitter Facebook Intel projects decline in chip prices, and AMD's Ryzen is one reason AMD's lower priced Ryzen chips are putting pressure on Intel's premium chips IDG Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 28 April, 2017 10:13 - - - - print email Comments Intel is forecasting a "slight decline" in its premium chip prices for the remainder of the year, and AMD's Ryzen chips could have played a part in that. Prices of Intel's chips in both desktops and laptops went up in the first quarter. That helped drive up the quarterly revenue for Client Computing Group -- which deals in PC chips -- to $8 billion, which was up 6 percent compared to the same quarter last year. But Intel's PC chips now face serious competition from AMD's new Ryzen chip, which was released last month. Ryzen chips offer competitive performance, and are priced significantly lower. AMD's fastest Ryzen 7 1800X chip -- targeted at gamers -- has eight cores and is priced at $499. A comparable chip like Intel's Core i7-6900K is priced at $1,089. Intel's fastest gaming chip is the Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition chip, which is priced at $1,723. During an earnings call on Thursday, Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich sidestepped a question on whether Ryzen had any role in the projected chip price declines. He said the market dynamics were a reason.Â For more than a decade, AMD's cheaper processors were considered inferior to Intel's chips on performance. PC makers dropped AMD from their product lineup, but are now partnering with the chip maker on Ryzen, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "AMD is offering a competitive part, and their price is significantly lower than Intel's," McGregor said. That is attractive to PC makers, who want to increase their margins on PCs. "There's always the upper echelon that will pay anything for a PC," McGregor said. "This is more about bringing gaming systems to lower prices." It's still early to predict the full impact of Ryzen on the pricing of Intel's chips. But it's already showing up in a couple of places, like in retail stores, where prices of Intel's boxed processors were adjusted after Ryzen's arrival, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. For now, the price pressure is playing out on the premium chips. Later in the year, AMD will release chips for laptops and mainstream desktops. Low-end PCs are even more price sensitive. "Competition is always good, and Intel is certainly feeling the pressure from AMD," McCarron said. Intel could counter Ryzen by offering a newer and faster chips at the similar price compared to processors in its current lineup. Intel will release 8th Generation Core processors later this year, and those chips will be more than 10 percent faster than existing 7th Generation Core chips, also called Kaby Lake. Ryzen isn't the only reason behind Intel's projection of a decline in chip prices. The mix of Intel's chips from low-end to premium chips has slowed down. The price needs to be adjusted so more PC users move from low-end chips like Pentium to Core i5 and i7. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Apr 30, 2017 at 11:49AM Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has jumped over 15% this year thanks to a strong fourth-quarter report in February that bested Wall Street's expectations. Higher graphics card sales have boosted the semiconductor specialist's performance, and investors will be looking for a repeat performance when the company reports its first-quarter results after the bell on May 1. Here's what investors can expect from AMD's upcoming earnings report. The headline numbers Wall Street expects 18% year-over-year growth in AMD's revenue, to $984 million, while its losses could go down from $0.12 per share to $0.04 per share. The expectations are in line with the company's guidance as the recently launched Ryzen CPU is expected to boost sales and margins. AMD is trying to break Intel's monopoly in desktop CPUs by offering a capable chip at cheap prices. For instance, the $400 Ryzen 7 1700X processor has a better clock speed and lower power consumption figures than Intel's Core i7 6900K chip, which costs around $1,000. Therefore, it won't be surprising if AMD managed to take away some market share from Intel and improve its top line during the first quarter. Image Source: AMD.  However, BMO Capital Markets' supply chain checks indicate weakness in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are AMD's bread-and-butter business, noting a 16% decline in GPU shipments from Q4 to Q1, outpacing the average seasonal drop of 6% seen in the last three years. AMD has already accounted for the seasonal revenue decline, forecasting an 11% sequential drop. However, the strong year-over-year growth estimate suggests confidence as it takes the GPU fight to NVIDIA. AMD controlled an estimated 29.5% of the discrete GPU market in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 22.8% in the first quarter. The market-share numbers for the latest quarter aren't out yet. New products are estimated to increase AMD's gross margin to 33%, up 1 percentage point from last year, and help the company cut its losses significantly. What about the outlook? AMD's outlook will be driven by the GPU market's growth. Research firm M Science's checks indicate that high-end GPU pricing in North America has recovered over the past quarter, pointing toward strong demand. Moreover, the GPU market should get better as the year progresses, as sales of PC gaming hardware are expected to increase 6% in 2017 thanks to robust demand for high-end systems, according to Jon Peddie Research. This is good news for AMD investors as the company's upcoming Vega GPU is aiming at the premium GPU segment. The new graphics cards are expected to go on sale sometime in May, taking on NVIDIA's latest GTX 1080 Ti GPU. AMD's VP of Radeon gaming, Scott Herkelman, said that the Vega GPU could match the GTX 1080 Ti in memory performance, which could give it a leg up over NVIDIA if it is priced at the lower end of its expected $600-$700 range. What's more, AMD is also finding traction in the server market. Google is using the graphics specialist's FirePro server GPUs to accelerate its Google Cloud Machine Learning and Google Compute Engine services. This business should get better with the launch of AMD's next-gen server CPU -- Naples. AMD claims that Naples can outperform Intel's flagship server CPU in certain workload scenarios, though investors should take the tests with a grain of salt since they are not independent. But it is evident that AMD is trying to corner more of the booming server market that will need more powerful CPUs and GPUs as data-center workloads increase due to growing data volumes and complexity. AMD investors should expect a solid outlook as the company gains traction in key end markets on the back of smart product development moves.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's Why Intel Corporation's Data-Center Margins Tanked Intel's shift in priorities is taking its toll on the operating margin of its most important growth business. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 30, 2017 at 11:30AM For quite a while, Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) data-center group (DCG) has enjoyed an extremely high operating margin, often surpassing 50% in some quarters. However, in Intel's most recent quarter, DCG's operating-margin percentage fell to just 35.1% -- a 9-percentage-point drop year over year from approximately 44% a year earlier. Absolute operating profit also dropped from $1.764 billion in the year-ago period to just $1.487 billion, even as revenue rose slightly from $4 billion to $4.23 billion. Image source: Intel. Why did Intel's DCG operating margin drop so much year over year last quarter? Will this figure improve in the coming quarters? Let's take a closer look. Explaining the bulk of the drop At Intel's February analyst day, the company talked about how it intends to transition its data-center chips to its new manufacturing technologies first. This is a notable change from how Intel previously handled manufacturing technology transitions; previously, the company's personal-computer chips would land on the new manufacturing technologies first and the data-center chips would follow. SDCG will transition to next-generation manufacturing technologies first going forward, beginning with the company's 10-nanometer++ technology, according to comments from Intel DCG chief Diane Bryant. Therefore, DCG now takes on a larger portion of the development expenses associated with said manufacturing technologies. CFO Robert Swan explained on the April 27 earnings call that 7 of the 9 lower percentage points in margin is attributable to that shift in expense allocation. What about the rest? There were two additional factors that Swan cited for the year-over-year drop in operating margin. The first was that the company saw "higher product costs" because the company's data-center processors are still transitioning away from older, more mature 22-nanometer chip manufacturing technology to the company's 14-nanometer technology. This transition has been going on for quite a while. The second factor Intel cited was "the ramp of adjacency products." In other words, a higher proportion of Intel's DCG revenue came from non-processor products (e.g., silicon photonics, Omni-Path interconnect), which Intel management has previously said carry a lower gross profit margin than its processor products. Taking a longer-term view Swan reiterated on the call Intel's long-term operating margin target range for DCG of 40%-45% and explained that for the full year of 2017, Intel expects the business to deliver an operating margin percentage "at the lower end of that range." Swan also explained that the company expects its operating-margin percentage in DCG to grow as the year progresses because of improvements in average selling prices, as well as product cost improvements, as its 14-nanometer technology continues to mature. One thing investors should keep in mind, though, is that Intel is banking on non-processor products to continue to become an increasing portion of DCG's overall revenue mix. This is by no means a terrible thing, as these products are accretive to revenue and total gross-profit dollars, but this increased product diversification is one of the reasons Intel's DCG operating margin target range is now 40%-45% rather than the 45%-50% the company aimed for previously.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Page 1 of 3. 8 Comments Our latest Windows 10 Creator Update versus Linux benchmarking is taking a quick look at the Intel HD Graphics 630 Kabylake performance with Windows 10 on the latest Intel driver compared to Ubuntu 17.04 and Clear Linux. Due to the capabilities of the HD Graphics 630, this comparison isn't as plentiful as the NVIDIA and AMD Radeon results published this week. Check out those interesting Windows vs. Linux gaming comparisons if you haven't done so already. With this article are a few OpenGL test cases that run fine and fully-automated across both Windows and Linux using the Phoronix Test Suite. The same Intel Core i7 7700K system with HD Graphics 630 was used for the entire benchmarking process. The Intel Windows 10 driver in use was v21.20.16.4627. Intel's Clear Linux as of testing was using the Linux 4.10 kernel with Mesa 17.1-dev. Ubuntu 17.04 ships with Linux 4.10 and Mesa 17.0.3. An additional Ubuntu 17.04 run was carried out when upgrading to Linux 4.11 Git and Mesa 17.2-dev via the Padoka PPA.

The ASUS Maximus IX Apex is one of the most exciting motherboards we’ve seen in a long time. The Apex draws on many of the signature ROG elements with a heavy focus on overclocking, cooling, modding and innovative features, some of which are truly eye catching. The most obvious thing that jumps out is the PCB shape, which somewhat resembles a X, but it doesn’t stop there with a very unusual DIMM slot designed to accept M.2 drives on an add-in card. Then there’s the twin DDR4 memory slots which differs from most motherboards which have four. Check out the massive array of headers, switches and buttons which is typical of a high end ROG board, but this is on another level. The Apex is geared as ‘one board to rule them all’  Obviously extreme overclockers will be right at home here with the fully featured BIOS and ln2 centric features, but there’s also plenty of options for water coolers with no less than 10(!) fan headers including dedicated pump headers and full speed options.  Modders are also catered to with a full RGB lighting setup, customizable face plate and a neutral color scheme designed to fit a wide range of themed systems.  All these markets and we didn’t even mention the gaming market. This is a ROG motherboard so gaming is a part of its DNA too. A quick Z270 & Kaby Lake overview Firstly, lets take a look at an overview of the Z270 platform. There are really only two improvements found with Z270 over Z170. The first of which is an extra 4 PCIe 3.0 lanes coming from the chipset itself. Z170 motherboards often had quite messy scenarios where if you used x M.2 slot, then y SATA port would become unavailable, or z PCIe slot would not function. The extra 4 lanes go a long way to alleviating these issues, allowing more devices to function without compromise. There are limits however, with some motherboards equipped with up to 3x M.2 slots or U.2 ports all requiring PCIe lanes, so careful attention will need to be paid to the individual motherboards’ specification and lane allocation to ensure it fits your desired needs, especially with multi GPU setups. The other significant new feature is support for Intel’s Optane technology. The ultimate market implementations of Optane are still to be made known at this point, with unexciting small cache type devices being the the first to market. The technology does have potential, especially if the outrageous performance gains seen in the public teasers hold true. Overall, there really is no need to select a Z170 board over a Z270 board if you are buying new, but on the flip side there is little need to upgrade to Z270 from Z170 unless you require an updated storage feature set. Z270 brings the latest motherboard options right up to date, with M.2, U.2 and some things like updated Realtek ALC 1220 audio. While were talking platform comparisons, lets talk a little about Skylake vs Kaby Lake. The most notable improvement for Kaby Lake over Skylake lies with the improved 14nm+ FinFET process. This has allowed Intel to obtain higher clock frequencies without increasing power. Compared to the 6700K, the 7700K brings a gain of 200MHz on the base clock and an impressive 300MHz max turbo frequency whilst keeping the TDP at the same 91W. It’s clear that the 14nm+ process is a very good thing. For Intel to deliver the clock speed improvements with the 7700K whilst maintaining the 91w TDP is significant given the gradual TDP increases we’ve seen from previous generations. These benefits don’t just apply to the top chip. Kaby Lake replacement CPUs bring a clock speed bumps across the range whilst keeping the power usage at the same level. With a clock speed improvement getting most of the attention, there is a significant architectural change found in Kaby Lake; The addition of a new media engine that includes fixed function HEVC 10bit and VP9 decoding. In this era of 4K and the increasing prevalence of H.265 encoded media, along with Google’s choice of VP9 for YouTube, this is significant for something like a small form factor HTPC, lowering CPU usage and improving power efficiency. Notebooks too will see battery life benefits from this.   Unboxing & Overview Back to the main event, The ASUS Maximus IX Apex! The list of specifications is extensive. Far too many to reproduce here. The box is a very solid with a great design. The board itself is kept secure in its own chamber, with the accessories in another. The attention to detail of the box is notable. We like how ROG’s branding tends to maintain a bit of subtlety over some brands’ tendency to go a bit over the top with their branding.   As you’d expect, the rear of the box shows off the boards’ features and key specs so the consumer knows what they are getting before they buy.   We have quite a significant bundle. Usually we can fit this into one picture, but the bundle with the Apex needs two pictures! Firstly we see a large sheet of ROG stickers, the users manual, driver and utility disk, a nicely made drink coaster, a cable mod discount card and finally some cable labels.   Moving onto the accessories, we have the standard four SATA cables, I/O plate, M.2 screws and a Q connector for easy connection of the case connectors. Then we have some of the cooler things. including a High Bandwidth SLI bridge which is worth more than a few pennies on its own. Theres a CPU insertion tool for the butterfingers among us, RGB extension cable, a customizable plate which can be placed over one of the RBG lights for a unique touch and finally the DIMM.2 daughter-board which is used for adding M.2 drives to the unique memory slot.     Perhaps you might have noticed the additional ‘memory slot’ next to the two main slots? ASUS calls this the DIMM.2 slot. It is actually a DDR3 slot, but with a difference. It is designed to accept a riser board (seen below). You can install one M.2 SSD on each side M.2 SSD. At first you may think this concept is slightly gimmicky, and maybe it is, but the truth is some of today’s high speed M.2 drives can get very hot, especially if they are sandwiched under hot graphics cards where they can get very little airflow. This can lead to throttling, lower performance and possible reduced lifetime. We’ve seen MSI introduce a cooling shield to address this problem, but ASUS have gone a couple of steps further and put a major engineering effort to place M.2 drives adjacent to any CPU or memory cooling, keep them away from hot components and have them running on a very fast interface. Innovative indeed! Now we move onto the board itself. We mentioned several of the key standout features in the introduction, including the ‘X’ shaped PCB, dual memory slots and massive numbers of headers and switches. The board uses the Extended ATX Form Factor at 12 inch x 10.7 inch ( 30.5 cm x 27.2 cm ). This means it will not fit in many compact cases. Do note this. The PCB really does look cool. There’s nothing like it on the market really. The heatsink design looks great, ASUS mentions they used a military plane as the inspiration for the design. The gun metal grey heatsinks look subtle and neutral, as we’d expect to see on a fully RGB featured motherboard. We’re glad that motherboard manufacturers are slowly moving to neutral color schemes for choosing your own RGB themes. ASUS includes a set of customizable plates that can be placed on the board instead of the ROG one, so you can add your own personal touch to the motherboard. There are a total of 10(!) fan headers. Seven of these are PWM controllable and another 3 are full speed options. If you want to get rid of ln2 vapor, these are what you would use. There’s also dedicated water pump headers providing extra power. Perdect for everything from a small all in one to a full custom loop. (which would look pretty sexy on this board!)   Where do we start with this section of the board?! In addition to a top quality 8+2 phase VRM configuration, the Apex has the kitchen sink, plus more OC features, buttons, headers and bells and whistles than you thought possible. Firstly, there are the obvious ones, like get the power and reset buttons, voltage read points, and POST display. Then we get to some of the cool ones. There are switches for disabling the each of the PCI-E slots and RAM slots, then there are switches for LN2 mode, cold boot bug, and a pause switch, which is really cool and does exactly that, pauses the whole system. There’s also a ReTry button which tries previously good CMOS settings, and a safe boot button, which defaults to a known good profile for a safe and sure boot. There’s also a RGB header, condensation detection LED’s and a basic POST set of LED’s.. whew!     The PCIe layout is pretty standard for a high end multi GPU capable board. There is no bridge chip, so you’re looking at 8x/8x for dual GPU. Like most of the decent Z270 motherboards, audio has been upgraded to the Realtek ALC1220 codec. While onboard audio will never match DACs costing hundreds of $$ or more, it has come a long way. We now have a 120dB SNR output, which is a lot better than some of the low end stuff that’s been around for years. Since this is an OC focused board, the implementation isn’t as crazy as you’ll see on some boards. ASUS has added Nichicon Gold capacitors and PCB isolation to improve audio quality.   On this part of the board, we see only four SATA6Gb/s ports, a single USB 3.0 internal header, and a MOLEX plug that is designed to provide additional power to the PCIe slots when using multiple GPU’s. Why only four SATA? if we had to nitpick, we’d like to see 6, but don’t forget there are options for two M.2 drives. If you must have more SATA you’ll need to look elsewhere.   Lastly, lets take a look at the rear I/O of the board. On the left we have BIOS Flashback and clear CMOS buttons, PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, DisplayPort & HDMI ports, then six USB 3.0 ports, USB 3.1 type-A & USB 3.1 type-C, Intel LAN and finally the analogue audio ports and S/PDIF optical output. Why two PS/2 ports on a 2017 motherboard? Actually, overclockers prefer these ports as they use less CPU overhead compared to USB, which polls the CPU. With PS/2, overclockers can disable the USB entirely, improving benchmark efficiency that tiny little bit.. every bit counts. The single network controller is a Intel i219V. They have added what appears to be an additional ESD protection controller of some sort. Good to know if you live in an area with frequent storms.   UEFI Overview Upon entering the Maximus IX Apex UEFI for the first time, we go straight to the default ‘EZ Mode’ which shows the most commonly accessed settings and basic information. We have XMP profiles, boot device selection and fan speed controls.   Pressing F7 takes the user to the default page of the main BIOS, called ‘My Favorites’. Here you can add the settings you frequently access rather than have to navigate to them in the different sub menu’s all the time. A memory tweaker might add the DRAM timings menu here for example.   Moving over to the next menu brings us the ‘Main’ page Here is where you can see basic system information.   Here we have the ‘Extreme Tweaker’ menu. There are a massive amount of overclocking settings to be found here. Pretty much every feasible OC setting relating to the CPU, memory, voltages, features. It’s all found here.   There is a sub menu called ‘Tweaker’s Paradise’ where you can find further esoteric settings.   Asus’ ROG motherboards have always been overclockers favorites, and several overclockers have provided profiles that the end user can try out. There’s also profiles for various DRAM speeds and types. For example, the 4000Mhz memory setting results in 15-15-15-36 at 1.5V which we’re happy to to say, our memory was able to do.   Further memory presets are available for different common memory IC’s. Hynix, Samsung & Micron all have presets to try. The Apex is full of memory subtiming settings. To get an idea, have a look at the scale represented by the page slider towards the right. There are dozens and dozens of timings available, something that overclockers will love.   Moving away from the Extreme Tweaker page, we come to the ‘Advanced’ page. Most of these settings relate to the onboard devices and peripherals. including the USB, storage, networking and a whole lot more.   The ‘Monitor’ tab is where you will find real time reporting of voltages, temperatures and fan speeds. Quite a lot of these can be configured, for example, a warning when a temperature goes above a desired level, The boards’ extensive watercooling options can be set here along with the QFan control which sets your fan speed and temperature targets.   The ‘Boot’ tab is fairly self explanatory. The boot order, overrides and startup settings are found here.   Next up is the ‘Tools’ tab.  Here you can set OC profiles and update the UEFI. Note that the graphics card information selection only shows the information of ASUS graphics cards.   Finally there is the ‘Exit’ menu.   Overall, ASUS continues to provide an intuitive and well laid out UEFI that will appeal to the average user all the way to ln2 overclockers. ASUS hasn’t really changed their layout for a few generations, so users of ASUS boards will feel right at home. Software ASUS’ software, and in particular the ROG software is one of the strong additions to the overall product. There is a vast range of software available with many apps dedicated to overclocking, monitoring, utilities and extras. The core utility is the Asus AI suite. Here you can control just about every UEFI setting that is possible to control from within Windows. As we see here, the TPU settings allow for CPU and cache OC and voltage control   There’s total fan control with presets available or temperature hysteresis.   Next up is the AURA software that controls the RGB lighting of the motherboard. It seems every high end motherboard has RGB lighting these days, and so the control software is of vital importance. For the most part the software works well, but we did have the odd strange experience where applying a color didn’t work the way it should, but trying again made it work. Perhaps there are a few niggles to work out. With the Aura software, you can control other company’s RGB solutions, such as cases, RGB strips and even keyboards and mice. One of the things we really liked was the option to link the RGB lighting to the motherboards temperatures. Green for cool and red for hot. Simple, but effective!     The apps are really just scratching the surface. ASUS also offers apps for cloud storage, a ROG skinned CPUZ, ROG Connect for controlling settings via a laptop, a RAMdisk app, a drive clone utility, fast charge app and even a windows system cleaning app.   Test Setup & Benchmarks Our test setup configuration can be seen below. Comparing different CPU’s and platforms can get a bit tricky. Our method is to apply the highest turbo modes, set them to all cores and disable SpeedStep to keep frequencies constant. In this case the 7700K is at a flat 4.5Ghz, the i7 6700K at 4.2Ghz and the i7 5960x at 3.5Ghz. All compatible parts are identical between systems, except the X99/5960X system which is running 4x8Gb of DDR4 at 2666Mhz 15-15-15-35 2T.           We expect every benchmark run with a 7700K to be within a fraction of each other and this is what we see across our tests. The 7700K is king in single threaded performance, with the 6700K behind only due to its lower clock speed. There are no architectural reasons. the 5960x rules multithreaded benchmarks with its eight cores despite its clock disadvantage.  Note that the MSI board clocks itself a few Mhz higher via a tiny bclk increase, which is a little cheeky. Despite this few Mhz clock disadvantage, the Apex shows itself to be very capable and is bang on leading the Z70 motherboards, or very close to it. Oh yeah, how does the DIMM.2 design work? The Samsung 960 Pro M.2 drive is the fastest SSD you can buy and it shows. Overclocking ROG motherboards are especially known for their overclocking prowess. The Apex, as a very much OC themed motherboard sits at the top of the stack, so obviously our expectations were very high. We were not disappointed. The Maximus IX Apex, with its dual slot design, is aimed at providing the simplest and cleanest signalling possible. By keeping the memory slots as close as possible to the socket, the trace lengths are minimized, and of course there are only half as many traces compared to a four slot board. This means the Apex, similar to what we’ve seen with other dual slot boards such as the ITX Maximus Impact series, should have best in class memory overclocking capability. Special thanks to G.Skill for providing one of their amazing high speed kits. Prior to testing the Maximus IX Apex, we were not able to hit DDR4-4000 on any motherboard, but with the Apex, the kit of G.Skill Trident X 3866-18-19-19 was able to truly fly. DDR4-4000 12-12-12-28 1T. Thank you very much! Let’s just say this is probably the best memory overclocking motherboard we’ve ever tested. Memory OC abilities are a true separator of the wheat from the chaff. Of course this is not a setting you’d run 24/7. It’s strictly benchmarking only. Due to the many built n memory OC profiles, you don’t need to be an elite overclocker to hit these kinds of numbers.   Benchmarking above 5Ghz is certainly possible if your CPU is good enough and thermals allow it. As always, your mileage will vary depending on your CPU core quality, memory controller quality and ambient temperatures. If you have a good sample, we are positive the Apex will run it to its maximum on air and water cooling. You will run into thermal limitations long before the board even breaks a sweat. Our CPU hits a bit of a voltage wall at 5.2Ghz under a triple fan AiO watercooler. Beyond this, diminishing returns set in and it is difficult to run multithreaded benchmarks without temps really spiking. 5.2Ghz with DDR4-4000 is pretty cool though! If your CPU is capable, The Maximus IX Apex will deliver 5Ghz+ 24/7 and be a walk in the park if your cooling is good enough.   Conclusion The ASUS Maximus IX Apex is one of the few truly innovative motherboards we’ve seen in some time. It is the current motherboard of choice for overclocking Kaby Lake CPU’s and pushing DDR4 memory to the limits. It’s not exactly cheap, and its missing some otherwise typical high end features, but this board is anything but typical. If you want the best performing Z270 motherboard, here it is. We love it. At around $559 SGD it isn’t cheap, but we think its acceptable and there are boards that are quite a bit more. That doesn’t mean its limited to extreme overclockers. The array of watercooling headers and features will appeal to all types of overclockers. If we had to nitpick, we’d say its lacking some of the ‘regular’ features that a high end motherboard might otherwise have, The audio could be beefed up a bit, we could use some extra SATA ports, but that’s what the other ROG boards are for, so we don’t view this as a negative. OC has always been a part of ROG DNA, and we’re thrilled to see ASUS has not abandoned this part of the market in favor of top to bottom ‘gaming’ boards. Some folks may complain at the limitation of dual slots, however, those who understand how high end memory works will be thankful for this. As DDR4 memory speeds get ever higher, it becomes apparent that quad slot motherboards are simply not able to match their dual slot brethren. The best DDR4 memory OC motherboards (and those you see the most on QVL lists of high end memory kits) are dual slot boards. Think ASRock Z170M OC Formula, Asus Maximus XIII Impact and now the Maximus IX Apex. If you are thinking of buying some very fast DDR4-4000+ memory, you’ll likely need a dual slot board. It seems like RGB and more RGB has become a meme among the PC enthusiast crowd, and while the Apex is not immune to this trend, it does offer some very attractive features for the modders. Consider the X shaped PCB or the subtle but stylish heatsinks, dual RGB LED headers, the customizable nameplates, and the surround glow of the RGB’s around the back of the PCB. Chuck in the class leading water cooling features and how awesome the Apex looks on display and its clear we have a board that modders should have a lot of affection for. The bottom line: We’ve found our new Z270 reference motherboard.       Pros: Probably the best DDR4 overclocking motherboard available BIOS refinement OC ability with wide range of functional presets RGB setup looks cool. One for the modders DIMM.2 works well Tons of fan headers and watercooling options Top shelf build quality – designed to be punished Customization options   Cons: Consider the Maximus IX Formula if you want more SATA, memory or super audio etc   James Seaton Post navigation Previous Article Asus ROG Swift PG258Q Launched in Singapore at S$1,099 Next Article Wireless@SG Showcases Automatic Login Capabilities at Tech Saturday Related Articles MotherboardsNews ECS Motherboards now equipped with Solid Capacitors TeamVR July 19, 2011 Reviews COMPUTEX 2010: Pre-Show International Press Conference TeamVR March 30, 2010 MotherboardsNews BIOSTAR announces Racing H170GT3 flagship gaming series motherboard Babu Mohan January 29, 2016 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?).

I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:50 Tigris says: Well from a computer game journalist one would expect to have a better laptop though, since playing games is kind of his job. I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop. Also a side note: I had “supporter” written in red on the top oif my screen below the “Howdy Tigris” this kinda seemed like a bug.

With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 06:37 jtdiddy says: Whats the best settings i can get away with playing dow3 on a i7 SP4?

April 30, 2017 April 30, 2017 Some members of Gambia’s intelligence community are increasingly concern about the mediocre approach taken by the Barrow administration to politicize intelligence collection, and gathering for national security purposes, the Freedom Newspaper can reveal. The appointment of Assistant Superintendent of police (ASP) Muhammed Kanteh, a Nephew of Foreign Minister Ousainou Darboe, to head the State House Intelligence Division, has been faulted in some quarters within the intelligence community. Mr. Kanteh, used to work at the police License Office, and has no intelligence background, sources said. Mr. Barrow is now occupying the former office of Gambia’s co president General Saul Badjie at the State House. He has some “Intel agents” working under him. Mr. Kinteh, has been referred to as one of the most powerful security officials in the Gambia today—given his family relationship with opposition leader and Foreign Minister Ousainou Darboe. “These people are playing with the lives of Gambians. How can they entrust the State House Intel gathering and national security to an intelligence novice in the person of ASP Kanteh. Kanteh used to work at the police Licensing office. He has no intelligence training or background. He has been offered the job because he is Ousainou Darboe’s  Nephew.  This is absurd to say the least. This administration is politicizing intelligence,” said our source. Mr. Kanteh is said to be a gentleman of the highest order, but source intimated that he should have been assigned somewhere outside intelligence collection and processing. Mr. Kanteh is a lawyer by profession.  “Kanteh should have turned down the job offer. This is not his domain of expertise. There are more competent people, who can man that job. What the Barrow government is doing in essence is to compromise their own safety and that of Gambians. Kanteh is not intelligence material. He is clueless when it comes to intelligence. Appointments are not given based on merit in Barrow’s government. You have Turo Jawaneh, there commanding the State Guards. He is aging. Turo is a virtual spent force.  He has outlived his productivity as an officer,” said another security source. It has come to our attention that the likes of Commissioner Abdoulie Sanyang, are worshipping ASP Kanteh, so that Barrow can consider him for the position Inspector General of police. “Abdoulie Sanyang is working very hard to undermine IGP Sonko. Do not be surprised if you hear that he has been appointed IGP. He is always on the phone with Kanteh. IGP Sonko himself is aware of the situation. He is just waiting for his marching orders. The very day Sanyang was reinstated, he started feeling the evil machinations staged to have him replaced by his sworn enemy in the person of Abdoulie Sanyang,” our source said. ASP Kanteh could not be reached for comment.

In a press release about heatsink support for the new socket, Noctua says that most of its current coolers support "the new LGA 2066 socket of Intel's 'Basin Falls' X299 platform for Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs out of the box," and that it will provide updated mounting hardware for older heatsinks at no additional charge. This isn't exactly a surprise to anyone who's been keeping an eye out for rumors, but it's nice to have an official source. It's also great to see Noctua keeping up its strong post-sale support. Noctua even says the heatsink mounting mechanism on LGA 2066 is "identical" to that of LGA 2011. Going by that statement, even other companies' LGA 2011-compatible heatsinks are likely to fit LGA 2066, and the socket dimensions are likely very similar, too. If you need updated mounting hardware, just contact Noctua with your proof of purchase. Tags: Cooling Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature VGA res and 20 FPS - but it's fine! Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?).

I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post.

I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop. Also a side note: I had “supporter” written in red on the top oif my screen below the “Howdy Tigris” this kinda seemed like a bug. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 22:11 haldolium says: Do you use streaming? My laptop had the same issues, clocking down and getting too hot and also way too loud, so I tried streaming instead. With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 04:57 Frankie The Patrician[PF] says: The graphics remind me of the Myth RTS series, which is not bad! For 90s, anyway. Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 06:37 jtdiddy says: Whats the best settings i can get away with playing dow3 on a i7 SP4?

Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 06:37 jtdiddy says: Whats the best settings i can get away with playing dow3 on a i7 SP4?

The machine packs a quad-core processor by Intel, a GeForce GTX 10 series graphics processor as well as 16GB of RAM. Since the company has tried to strike a balance between specs and weight here, the laptop weighs 2.6 kilograms. The Acer Predator Triton 700 packs a 15.6 inch Full HD display and is powered by an Intel Core i5-7300HQ or Core i7-7700HQ processor, depending on the model chosen. It also features 16GB of DDR4-2400 RAM and can be configured with up to two 512GB SSDs. The laptop features a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 series GPU with G-Sync support, Rivet Killer Wireless-AC 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, 2 USB 3.0, 1 USB 2.0, and 1 USB Type-C port, DisplayPort, HDMI as well as a mechanical backlit keyboard with programmable keys. Measuring in at 393 x 263 x 18.9 mm, the laptop weighs 2.6 kilograms. Acer’s new gaming laptop tackles heat with five heatpipes and two thin AeroBlade 3D fans that have curved metal blades to increase airflow. The cooling system is covered with a large Gorilla Glass plate that acts like a touchpad. Despite confirming almost all specifications of this laptop, Acer hasn’t confirmed precisely which graphics processor the Predator Triton 700 is going to have. It has only confirmed that the GPU will be from the GeForce GTX 10 series. Acer is going to release the Predator Triton 700 in North America this August with prices starting at $2,999.

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:20 Andy_Panthro says: Not sure I could face playing through modern games like that… I’ve got Dishonored 2 installed at the moment but I’m struggling with it because my laptop isn’t good enough to run it on any decent settings. Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?). Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 19:54 Styxie says: Nice, but can it run The Witcher 3 at 4 FPS, like my i7 4790k’s integrated graphics? This new GPU can’t get here quick enough. I’ve been surviving on nothing but Battle Brothers, Crusader Kings 2 and Spelunky for three months now.

Sadly my poor pc won’t run it whatever, so don’t even get to try. Boo! Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post.

I mean he could most likely even get a laptop for free if he put a review up here about it. Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop. Also a side note: I had “supporter” written in red on the top oif my screen below the “Howdy Tigris” this kinda seemed like a bug.

In today’s tutorial, I’ll step through the entire install process in full unabridged detail. While it might seem a bit daunting to go through the Hackintosh setup process for the first time, once you understand the basics, it’s not so difficult. Have a look at our hands-on video for more details.

Be sure to read that post and watch the video for an explainer as to why I selected the hardware I did. Keep in mind that you don’t have to use the same hardware, but this step-by-step guide was made using these particular hardware components. Although we have included a written walkthrough as a compliment to the video, I highly recommend watching the entire 16-minute install video if this is your first Hackintosh build. In this video I walk through the entire process, including UEFI BIOS steps, all recorded using direct-feed methods. That makes for a high quality tutorial from start to finish. Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos Step 1: Download macOS Sierra (10.12) from the Mac App Store The macOS Sierra Installer can be had free of charge from the Mac App Store, but you will need a Mac to download it. Once the download is completed, close the installer window that appears. Step 2: Connect and format the USB flash drive Warning: Be sure that the flash drive is free of any files that you need. Connect your flash drive to a USB port on your Mac, and launch Disk Utility. Select your USB flash drive. Be careful to select the correct drive before proceeding, or else you risk formatting the wrong disk. Select your USB flash drive and click the Erase button at the top of the Disk Utility interface. Use the following parameters: Name: Installer Format: Mac OS Extended (Journaled) Scheme: GUID Partition Map Click the Erase button to proceed. Once the drive is formatted, click Done and close Disk Utility. Step 3: Create the macOS Sierra USB install drive Launch Terminal, and use the following Terminal command to create the macOS Sierra Installer drive: sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Installer --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app --nointeraction Keep in mind that if you choose another name for the USB flash drive when performing the erase procedure in Step 2, you’ll need to modify the Terminal command to reflect those changes. Here is what the Terminal window should look like It will take some time for the macOS Installer process to finish. Be patient and let the command run to completion. Step 4: Download additional files Download the following items to your Desktop, and place them into a newly created folder called ‘Hackintosh Files’ for safe keeping: Clover EFI bootloader FakeSMC.kext AppleIntelE1000e.kext VoodooHDA Nvidia Web Driver Step 5: Install Clover EFI bootloader Extract the Clover EFI bootloader installer package and right click on the .pkg file and select Open. Click Continue. Click Continue. Click Change Install Location. Select the Install macOS Sierra flash drive and click Continue. Click Customize. Ensure the following options are checked, and click Install. You’ll next be asked to enter your Mac’s password. After doing so, click Install Software. The install process is extremely brief. Once the install is completed, you should see the Installation Complete! screen. Click Close to exit the Clover EFI bootloader tool. Once the Clover EFI bootloader is successfully installed, the EFI partition should be mounted and available to browse in Finder. If, for some reason, the EFI partition isn’t mounted, or you need to remount the partition, you can do so using Step 13 below. Step 6: Copy FakeSMC.kext and AppleIntelE1000e.kext In order to install macOS on your Hackintosh hardware successfully, you must add the FakeSMC.kext kernel extension to the EFI partition that is created and mounted upon completing the install of the Clover EFI bootloader in Step 5. You should also copy AppleIntelE1000e.kext for Ethernet support. Move both FakeSMC.kext and AppleIntelE1000e.kext (downloaded in Step 4) to /EFI/CLOVER/kexts/10.12/ Step 8: Save ‘Hackintosh Files’ folder to the Install macOS Sierra partition This is not a required step, but I recommend saving the ‘Hackintosh Files’ folder (created in Step 4) to the Install macOS Sierra partition on the USB drive. By doing so, you keep the files in an easy-to-access place for future usage. Step 8: Eject the USB drive from your Mac and connect it to your Hackintosh All of the required files are now on the USB drive. Eject the drive from your Mac, and place the drive into one of the USB ports on your Hackintosh machine. Step 7: Prepare UEFI BIOS on your Hackintosh Now that your USB drive is prepared with the macOS Installer, Clover bootloader, and supporting kexts, it’s time to install macOS on your Hackintosh machine. This is assuming that you’ve already built your Hackintosh and it has a drive, preferably an SSD, waiting to be used. But before we get to the installation, the first thing that you’ll need to do is to prepare the UEFI BIOS. This can usually be done by powering on the machine, and pressing the Delete key on a connected keyboard prior to boot. (You should see an on screen prompt asking you to do so.) Once inside, you can go through the UEFI BIOS configuration process to prepare for your Hackintosh installation. In this example, I’m going to use the GA-Z170X-Gaming 7 Motherboard that I used for my Hackintosh build. The first step is to navigate to the Save & Exit section, and select Load Optimized Defaults. Next, go to the Peripherals section, and enable XHCI handoff. Next, go to BIOS Features, and enable the UEFI USB drive as the first boot option. Lastly, go to Save & Exit, and save your changes and exit setup. Step 8: Install macOS The Clover Boot Manager will load next. Select the Boot OS X Install from Install macOS Sierra option and press the space bar to select boot options. Select the Verbose option using the space bar, and choose Boot macOS with selected options. You will see a lot of text appear on the screen since we selected Verbose mode. This allows us to see and troubleshoot any errors, if any, during the boot process. After selecting your language, the macOS Utilities window will appear. Select Disk Utility, and Erase the SSD or Hard Drive installed inside your Hackintosh. Give it a name like ‘Hackintosh HD’ for easy identification. Exit Disk Utility and select Install macOS and click Continue. Proceed through the initial macOS Sierra installer prompts. Select Hackintosh HD, or whatever you named your disk, and click Install. The Install process will take a while, so be patient. Eventually your machine will reboot. When the Clover Boot Manager appears again, select Boot macOS Install from Hackintosh HD, and press the space bar to select the Verbose boot option, and boot with the selected options. The macOS Sierra install process will continue, and after some time, your machine will reboot. Once the Clover Boot Manager appears, select Boot macOS from Hackintosh HD, and again, select Verbose mode and boot with the selected options. Work your way through the initial macOS setup process, which involves choosing your location, connecting to Wi-Fi, etc. Once you complete the setup, the macOS desktop will appear. Step 9: Install the Clover EFI bootloader on the internal drive So we don’t have to rely on the USB drive to boot into macOS, we’re going to install the Clover EFI bootloader on the internal ‘Hackintosh HD’ drive. Open the Install macOS Sierra USB drive via Finder, and navigate to the Hackintosh Files folder that you created in Step 4. Launch the Clover EFI bootloader again, and go through the same install process that we covered in Step 5. This time around, however, change the Install Location to the Hackintosh HD internal drive. Don’t forget to customize the install, and make sure the options you select match the screenshot below. Once the install is completed, the EFI partition on your internal Hackintosh HD drive should automatically be mounted. Navigate to/EFI/CLOVER/kexts/10.12 and move FakeSMC.kext and AppleIntelE1000e.kext (found in the Hackintosh Files folder) to that location. Step 10: Install the VoodooHDA audio drivers and the Nvidia Web Driver The install process for both the VoodooHDA audio drivers and the Nvidia Web Driver are extremely straightforward. Just open the packages, and proceed through the install of each. Once both are installed, reboot your machine. Step 11: Change the boot option in UEFI BIOS to the internal Hackintosh drive Press the delete key after rebooting to load the UEFI BIOS. Navigate to BIOS Features, and change the first boot option to the UEFI OS internal drive instead of the USB drive. This will force the system to invoke the bootloader stored on the internal drive so that it can work independently of the USB drive. Save the changes and exit the UEFI BIOS. Step 12: Configure Clover options Select the Options button in the Clover Boot Manager and navigate to SMBIOS. Change the Product Name and Board Version to iMac 14,2 Return to the main Clover screen, select Boot macOS from Hackintosh HD, and press the space bar to choose boot options. For boot options, select both Verbose and Use Nvidia WEB drivers (nvda_drv=1). Once these are selected, choose Boot macOS with selected options. If everything is configured correctly, macOS Sierra should load with both sound and Nvidia graphics working properly. Step 13: Manually mount the EFI partition So that you don’t have to manually change boot options upon each reboot, we’re going to modify the Clover configuration to keep those options persistent upon each reboot. To do this, we will need to mount the EFI partition manually. This can be accomplished via Terminal. To find out where the EFI partition for the internal drive resides, we can use the Terminal command: diskutil list This command will provide a list of all of the drives on your system. Thereafter, you can easily identify the device and slice (partition) of the location you wish to mount and make it available to Finder. In this example, disk0 is where the EFI partition resides on the Hackintosh internal drive. The EFI partition is located on slice 1, so the name to target is disk0s1. Before mounting this drive location, you’ll need to set a mount point. You can do so by utilizing the following Terminal command: sudo mkdir /Volumes/efi Next, it’s just a matter of mounting the EFI partition. In my case, the command will be: sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/efi Keep in mind that your disk and slice location for the EFI partition may differ. Be sure to utilize the diskutil list command to pinpoint its accurate location. Step 14: Edit Clover’s Config.plist file Once the EFI partition is mounted successfully, you should see it in Finder. Open the EFI folder followed by the Clover folder. Open the Config.plist file with TextEdit, and search for the word boot. Add the key and string values highlighted in yellow. Search for BoardVersion and uncomment the BoardVersion key. Replace the string with iMac14,2 Search for ProductName and uncomment the ProductName key. Replace the string with iMac14,2 Save the Config.plist file, and exit out of the file. If you see a message about the lack of permanent version storage, just click OK. Step 15: Restart your Hackintosh! Since the Clover bootloader is installed on the internal drive, and the required configuration values were changed, you should no longer have to select boot options to boot correctly into macOS. If everything worked, macOS will boot normally when choosing Hackintosh HD from the Clover Boot Manager. For the most part, everything should work. Sound, Wi-Fi, AirDrop, App Store, GPU, Bluetooth, etc. As mentioned, it’s a Hackintosh, so not everything will work perfectly, but I find that this machine works well enough to be largely usable. Not just that, but it’s more powerful, quieter, and more expandable than many of Apple’s very own product solutions. How did you enjoy this guide?

The biggest threat is to the Israeli high-tech sector where the lure of a super-low 15 percent tax rate that Trump proposed last Wednesday could prove irresistible to many startups, said Sharon Schulman, a managing partner in the tax practice at Ernst & Young Israel. “At a rate of 15 percent, we would definitely see a return of the phenomenon of ‘Israeli’ technology companies whose major market is the United States incorporating when they are first formed as American companies — something that without a doubt is a clear risk to the Israeli economy in the long run,” he said. Yaniv Erlich, who heads the tax department at the Tel Aviv law firm Gross, Kleinhendler, Hodak, Halevy, Greenberg & Company, said for existing companies – tech and non-tech – enjoying the benefits of Trump’s proposed taxes would involve sacrifices because it would mean moving management and control of the company to the United States, including relocating the CEO. Many Israeli startups, in fact, do that but the trend would grow and expand to companies that have no other reason to relocate to the U.S. except for the tax advantages. Moreover, Israeli startup entrepreneurs are likely to face pressure from their American investors to relocate. Executives of Intel, Mobileye and BMW examine a BMWi vehicle. Deals like Intel's recent acquisition of Mobileye may become far less attractive under Trump's new tax breaks.

Close “American investors have an interest in the company being American and that the entrepreneur behind it be nearby,” said Monte Silver, an attorney with Eitan, Mehulal & Sadot in Herzliya. “Now it will be easier for them to insist on it.” The Trump tax cut, if it happens, could also deter U.S. companies from buying Israeli tech companies, like Intel’s $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye last month. One of the reasons the White House wants to lower taxes is to coax U.S. companies to repatriate some $2.6 trillion in profits they’ve kept overseas to avoid paying the steep U.S. tax rate, which is today 35 percent — and, adding in state and other taxes, can run as high as 40 percent. In a lot of cases, U.S. multinationals have used those trapped profits to buy Israeli startups, which enables them to use the money productively without it ever returning to the U.S. “If the [Trump] reform is approved it will mean fewer financial resources outside the U.S. That in turn will mean less interest is buying Israeli companies and greater interest in buying American companies,” explained Eldar Ben-Ruby, an attorney at Meitar Liquornik Geva Leshem Tal in Ramat Gan. The Trump plan, of which only the barest outlines have been released, would turn the U.S. corporate tax rate from among the highest in countries belonging to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to among the lowest. Although the tax cut is controversial — not the least because it comes hand in hand with other changes that have been widely faulted for benefitting the wealthiest — the president says the corporate tax cut will encourage companies to invest in the U.S. and create more jobs. With those same considerations in mind, Kahlon has also been working on a plan to reduce Israel’s corporate tax rate for high-tech companies, including foreign multinationals. The baseline Israeli rate has been going down, with the latest reduction from 25 to 24 percent this year and 23 percent in 2018. The Law for Encouraging Capital Investment entitles high-tech companies to pay reduced tax rates of 16 percent if they are based in the center of the country and only 9 percent if they are in the periphery. Low Israeli corporate rates have encouraged Israeli companies with operations in the U.S. to book as much income as possible in Israel rather than the U.S. but Trump threatens to change that calculation. “Now, Israeli companies will need to examine their entire tax strategy and Israel will have to think about its tax law as well,” warned Amir Chenchinski, a tax expert at Ernst & Young Israel. In an effort to lure more high-tech companies to Israel and keep those already here, Kahlon is aiming to lower Israel’s rate for tech companies to between 6 and 12 percent, with the lowest rate for big companies developing intellectual property in Israel and registering it here. But, E&Y’s Schulman said Trump now creates a dilemma for the finance minister. “Trump’s tax reforms put Israel in a trap,” he said. “On the one hand, he [Kahlon] can’t leave the corporate tax rate at 24 percent if the U.S. rate is going down to 15 percent. Also, rates for tech companies will have to go below 12 percent is he is going to preserve Israel’s competitiveness. On the other hand, that creates a risk of debt repayments and bigger budget deficits.” Efrat Neuman Haaretz Contributor Efrat Neuman Send me email alerts for new articles by Efrat Neuman Send Close Email * Please enter your email Efrat Neuman For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

Supplier TI Computers www.ticomputers.com.au Price $2195 AUD > Pricing info Specs AMD Ryzen 7 1700X @3.75GHz • Asus Geforce GTX 1070 • Asus Prime B350-Plus • Cooler Master Hyper 212 Turbo cooler • 16GB 2400MHz DDR4 Kingston HyperX RAM • 256GB Intel 600P SSD • 2TB Seagate HDD • Cooler Master MasterBox5 case • Fractal Design Integra M 650W PSU • 22x Asus DVDRW burner Tweet Email this Print this Feedback For when gaming and work are equal priorities. This PC comes from TI Computers and like its system from last month, also comes pre-overclocked out of the box. The system is housed in a Cooler Master MasterBox5 chassis which has plenty of room inside for everything, even a 240mm radiator up front if desired. Two thirds of the front grill lifts off easily for cleaning as it acts as a filter for the included 120mm fan. The front IO panel has everything you’d expect including dual USB 3.0 ports. Up top it has a large vent suitable for up to a 140mm fan. Underneath there’s the removable dust filter for the PSU, and around the back the 120mm exhaust fan accompanies 2x USB 2.0 ports, 4x USB 3.0 ports, 2x USB 3.1 gen2 ports, a PS/2 port, DVI-D, VGA, HDMI (for future Ryzen APU support) and three audio jacks all on the motherboard. With the graphics card providing a further 2x Display Ports, 2x HDMI ports and another DVI-D port. Looking inside the see-through side panel while it’s on you won’t see any RGB LEDs here, however the fans attached to the heatsink do have red LEDs at each corner providing some illumination. The 2TB hard drive sits in a cage at the lower front of the case, an optical drive up top and a modular 650W PSU in the lower rear. All the cabling is well-routed behind the motherboard tray with no excess cabling visible - very well put together. The speedy Intel 600P series 256GB NVME SSD drive is slotted in between the HSF and the stock clocked GTX 1070. Looking closer, the HSF is in a push-pull configuration with the exhaust aimed straight up out the top 170mm vent. With the 120mm fan exhausting out the rear you could almost argue there’s three fans cooling this CPU. Speaking of which, this Ryzen 7 1700X’s base clock is normally 3.4GHz with a boost clock of 3.8GHz. This system came pre-overclocked at 3.75GHz @ 1.35v, slower than the CPU’s own boost speed. This got us wondering, what if we ran a test with the CPU at stock clocks, where boost and even XFR can kick in by themselves, and compare it to TI Computers’ OC at a fixed 3.75GHz. When running PCMark8’s Home Conventional test with AMD defaults we saw core frequencies spike to 3.9GHz (thanks XFR!) so we’re confident that the default clocks would win out. Scoring 4201 we then retested with TI Computers overclock. Despite the lower max speed the pre-made overclock won out scoring 4367. Obviously the CPU is downclocking more often than it is boosting, so the shop OC -  despite initial appearances - is better than stock. Attempting to tune the overclock further ourselves, we managed to only raise it a little higher stably to 3.95GHz @ 1.4125v. For fun, we even disabled six of the eight cores and managed to go all the way to 4.25GHz with a silly 1.55v. With the CPU reporting near 110°C at just 3.95GHz (which is likely 90°C -- see this issue’s Chip News section) with all cores enabled and anything higher causing an immediate crash we suspect the HSF cooler is inadequate for what this chip is actually capable of. For those who like to tinker, an all-in-one liquid cooler would’ve been preferred. Benchmark results for 3DMark were quite good. Time Spy (DX12) gave us 6219 and Cloud Gate (DX11) reported 38894. When we tried them again with the CPU at our custom 3.95GHz speed and with the GPU at maximum overclock (which allowed it to go above 2GHz core speeds) Time Spy gave us 6413, Cloud Gate 40394 and PCMark8 4391, just a 4% increase. It appears TI Computers has wrung just about all it sensibly can from this system which is good to see. Putting this into perspective, the 7700K system we reviewed last month (which is basically the same in every way expect CPU) came pre-overclocked at a massive 4.8GHz, giving Time Spy, Cloud Gate and PCMark8 scores of 6169, 37068 and 4825 respectively. With PCMark8 favouring single threaded performance this Ryzen system falls behind, but in the 3DMark tests - where a bit of multi-threading is included - Ryzen pulls ahead. And we didn’t even get around to testing things that would properly stress an eight core CPU. And that’s the rub. This system doesn’t and never will have the fastest CPU for single or lightly threaded programs and games, but as soon as you want to throw some multi-threaded tasks like Twitch streaming, video editing or file compression at it, this system suddenly becomes a no brainer. Your workload simply needs to be able to make good use of it. A great PC for people who both work and game on the same system.

Reuters/Brian Snyder It’s high time for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to be released. The predecessor, Surface Pro 4 was introduced in October 2015. Surface sales have been down for some time. Microsoft has blamed lower Surface Pro sales for this. Thus, it is evident that the company desperately needs a Surface Pro. Microsoft has revealed a 26 percent drop in Surface revenue for the quarter ending March 31. There could be various reasons for the drop. The company’s new Surface Book with Surface Studio and Performance Base, and its latest devices in its family of computers are very expensive and cost a couple of thousand dollars. The devices have been designed primarily for hardcore professionals and those who are willing to spend a lot for a computer. They are definitely not for the everyday user. Fans and consumers were very eager to lay their hands on the Surface Pro hybrid, as they found it really appealing. However, price became an issue and many couldn’t afford it. Microsoft has blamed slower Surface sales on lower than expected Surface Pro unit volume. Moreover, the last update was in October 2015. Those who are interested in it are now choosing products from rival companies such as Samsung, Dell and HP. These companies are selling lighter and thinner tablets with more upgraded hardware. Intel’s seventh generation processor is yet to find a place in any of the Surface Pro devices. On the other hand, most top manufacturers are already using the chip. The Redmond tech giant needs to update the Surface Pro with the latest generation Intel chipset, writes CNBC. The company is hosting an event on May 2, where it will talk hardware. However, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 has not been mentioned, and may even give the event a miss. Meanwhile, the company is sure to unveil the Windows 10 Cloud platform and a cheaper Surface variant to rival Google’s Chromebooks. Experts believe, Microsoft should have unveiled the Surface Pro 5 too, so as to win back consumers’ attention on the line. But one thing is also clear; Microsoft is looking to increase the adoption of its cloud services via the use of low-cost hardware. The new Surface CloudBook that the company is about to unveil has also garnered quite a lot of attention. It will be interesting to see how this new device fares against the Google Chromebooks. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Surface Pro 5 and other such devices.

With Apple executives Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, and John Ternus directly stating that the most recent incarnation of the iMac would be released in the near future, speculations and leaks about the upcoming machine have started to gain steam. If these rumors are any indication, it seems that the iMac 2017 would be Apple’s best all-in-one desktop yet. One thing that has caught the attention of numerous Apple fans is the executives’ statement that a powerful iMac “Pro” would be released this year. Federighi even elaborated further, stating that the Cupertino-based tech giant has “put a lot of energy behind” the upcoming server-grade all-in-one desktop, according to a MacWorld report. With these statements in mind, numerous speculations have emerged stating that the iMac Pro 2017, the most powerful variant of the all-in-one desktop, would be released sometime around July to October 2017. Rumors about the device’s launch are many, with some stating that the machine would be launched sometime in Q4 and others predicting that it would launch during WWDC 2017 instead. Overqulified or thorougly upgraded? That's the question!..https://t.co/PlPrTXWZz7#iMac2017 #Apple #rumors pic.twitter.com/9kumVstU2F — iGotOffer (@iGotOffer) April 24, 2017 Considering Apple’s release history, both timelines are possible. The Mac Pro, one of Apple’s most formidable desktops in recent years, was released in WWDC 2013, while the MacBook Pro 2016, the latest line of laptops from the Cupertino-based tech giant, were launched in October. Since the iMac Pro is all but confirmed for a 2017 launch, it appears safe to expect the device to enter the market sometime during the second half of the year. While the release date of the iMac Pro 2017 is all but certain, the features that the upcoming desktop will be equipped with are an entirely different matter. Since its existence was confirmed by Apple, various rumors about the iMac Pro 2017 have emerged, focusing on the device’s processors, memory, and unique features. Needless to say, these recent rumors paint a picture of a formidable computer that appears designed to breeze through any task, regardless of how intensive it might be. The processor of the iMac Pro 2017 has been a focus of rumors over the past few months. While an Intel Kaby Lake chip is all but confirmed for the all-in-one desktop, only a handful of speculations have emerged about the actual processor that the all-in-one would be equipped with. According to a MacRumors report, however, rumors have recently emerged stating that the iMac Pro 2017 would be fitted with a Kaby Lake E3-1200 v6 Xeon processor, a formidable chip that is yet to be shipped by Intel. iZenica is tracing the journey of innovation and the #iMacEvolution! Witness the iMac Retina 5K Display. Visit https://t.co/HZg67X2wIx pic.twitter.com/2WJGf1D3Oc — iZenica (@iZenica) April 30, 2017 Xeon processors are pretty new to the iMac line, considering that only the Mac Pro has used a variant of the chip. Nevertheless, if these rumors prove true, the iMac Pro 2017 would most definitely be a powerhouse. Coupled with a rumored 64GB ECC RAM and up to 2TB of flash storage, the upcoming all-in-one definitely appears to be the machine’s most powerful iteration to date. Another rumored feature of the iMac Pro 2017 that has attracted the attention of numerous Apple fans is its keyboard. The current iMac line uses Apple’s Magic Keyboard 2, which is a capable enough keyboard on its own. For the upcoming iMac Pro 2017, however, rumors have emerged stating that the device would most likely feature a keyboard “with adaptive input.” The actual nature of this particular keyboard remains unknown, though the patent for the accessory suggests a design that is remarkably similar to the MacBook Pro 2016’s Touch Bar. The iMac Pro 2017 is steadily building up to be one of Apple’s most formidable desktop computers. With a renewed sense of purpose in the professional content creation market, the Cupertino-based tech giant definitely appears to be sparing no expense when it comes to the development of one of its most iconic products.

Tonight’s Madam Secretary Recap begins now – Refresh Page often to get the most current updates! The president meets with his council and they make a plan on how to deal with Georgie and the arms dealing. They will attempt peaceful ways but will take him out if they have to. Elizabeth and Jay meet and review the Intel they have on Georgia. Jay heads to France to gather more information on the arms dealer. Henry offers his theory to the CIA and they focus their resources in Jerusalem. Jay is kidnapped in France. Elizabeth and Nadine prepare for a speech and Jay calls to let her know he has been taken by Dido. She has until the end of the business day to unfreeze his accounts if he wants to see Jay again. Elizabeth meets with her team to come up with a plan and then goes to meet with the president. The United States will not negotiate with terrorists. Henry asks Jason’s math teacher about the $127 calculator he needs. She says he must have read the notice wrong. It only costs $27. Elizabeth asks around about Dito and finds out her can’t be trusted. Elizabeth’s team refuses to leave the white house. They all want to do whatever they can to help Jay. Henry calls Elizabeth and they discuss the calculator. Jason is lying to get $100 from them. Elizabeth encourages Henry to get the goods on Jason. She asks Henry if the Jay situation is her fault. She has to get him home safe. Henry confronts Jason about the calculator and he admits there is a boy in his class who is a prince and is trying to romance his girlfriend. He wanted to use the money to impress her. Nadine offers Jay’s wife Abby comfort and promises they will get Jay home safely. The military surrounded the house where Jay is being held but Elizabeth asks for my time before they go in. She doesn’t think he is the arms dealer. The president gives her 48 hours. Dito calls Elizabeth and the president gives her permission to offer him his freedom and they will return his money if he releases Jay. They have no evidence he is involved in arms dealing. Dito releases Jay unharmed. Henry encourages Jason to reach out to his girlfriend. The team starts over in trying to figure out who is behind the arms dealing. Abby and Jay reunite and she is so happy that he is OK. Someone breaks into Dito’s hotel and opens fire. He is killed but the US had nothing to do with it. Elizabeth meets with Darryl and tells him her team has been tracking stolen American arms and have found that Paul Crane is somehow involved.

Women in Banking Tackling income volatility; New CMO at Citi Why there's a gold rush for bank tech in Europe Bank-fee-killing service rolled out by fintech firm search goes here JPMorgan defection underscores tough blockchain choices By Penny Crosman Published April 28 2017, 1:58pm EDT More in Blockchain Distributed ledger technology Bank technology JPMorgan Chase R3 Print Email Reprints Share Share on The news that JPMorgan Chase left the R3 blockchain consortium speaks to the challenges ahead for any group that aims to get thousands of financial institutions to agree on a shared set of technologies and principles. “This just shows the experimental stage blockchain and distributed ledger technology is at right now,” observed Chris Skinner, chairman of the Financial Services Club, a networking group for senior executives in Europe. “There may well be multiple distributed ledger systems in financial services over the next decade. Then we will be working on interoperability and standards between ledgers. It reminds me of the old discussions of standards. ‘Sure, we got standards. Which one do you want?’” The original blockchain was created to track the movement of bitcoin, a digital currency, without the need to trust a centralized third party. The basic concept – a set of shared data that multiple connected parties agree on as valid – has been enthusiastically embraced by the financial services industry. Many bankers and technologists say it will help them handle things like securities trades, payments and contracts in a faster, simpler, more efficient and cheaper way than they do today. But agreement as to exactly what that distributed ledger should look like does not yet exist. Need to know A diagram of Quorum, the smart contract platform JPMorgan is building. According to the white paper, the design aims to "prevent all except those party to the transaction from seeing sensitive data." Github Several models have attracted adherents: the IBM-led Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project, which is building a blockchain built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric, has 122 members, including Wells Fargo, BBVA, JPMorgan Chase, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and American Express. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which is building a blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, has more than 30 financial services and technology members including JPMorgan Chase and Intel. R3, which is creating a “blockchain-inspired” distributed ledger called Corda, has 84 members, including Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street, and UBS. JPMorgan’s departure from R3 follows on the heels of defections last year by Goldman Sachs, Banco Santander, Morgan Stanley and National Australian Bank. The banks’ reasons for leaving varied. While still a member of the Hyperledger and Ethereum consortia, JPMorgan is also going it alone with a distributed ledger it’s building in-house called Quorum. Quorum is based on the Go Ethereum client, a software program that supports the Ethereum network. In a white paper, the bank outlines how its blockchain will handle data and contract privacy and consensus mechanisms (the process by which different computers agree on the order and legitimacy of transactions on the network). The bank’s decision to use Ethereum was at odds with R3’s decision not to use that system. “Ethereum was a platform we looked at and decided was not fit for purpose,” said Charley Cooper, managing director of R3. Objections among the membership included issues around privacy controls, scalability, immutability of transactions, and consensus mechanisms for validating transactions, Cooper said. R3 originally hoped to use an existing blockchain model like Ethereum, he explained. “When we first launched the company, we were in an ‘adapt or build’ mentality,” Cooper said. “Our thinking was, it would be easier if there was solution fit for purpose, if something out there was close we could adapt it to our needs, but meanwhile we’re going to build something in parallel, a platform fit for purpose for financial services. Ethereum was not deemed by R3’s experts and our members to be appropriate for the financial services industry.” By press time, JPMorgan had not responded to a request for an interview. Other banks have left R3 because they balked at the money it wanted them to pay to help fund the development of Corda, industry sources said. Last May, the group reportedly sought to raise $200 million from members (it later was said to cut the target to $150 million). “That was not the direction expected when these firms were already paying substantial amounts just to be a member of the consortia,” Skinner said. (Dues are in the six figures, according to market sources and published reports.) “It was this, in my view, that caused some of the founders to question where R3 were going.” Yet R3 is still in a strong position, he noted, with many banks still involved in Corda.

By: Sudhir Chowdhary | Published: May 1, 2017 4:25 AM Bhaskar Ghosh discusses Accenture’s Technology Vision 2017 report and some of the tech trends and innovations essential to business success in the digital economy. Technology changes are all around us, and coming faster than ever. Today, every business is a digital business, and people are engaging with and relying on technology more than before. “While technology has long been developed to serve specific business needs, we are now in an era where people are central to the design and development of technologies,” says Bhaskar Ghosh, group chief executive, Accenture Technology Services. In an interview with Sudhir Chowdhary, he discusses Accenture’s Technology Vision 2017 report and some of the tech trends and innovations essential to business success in the digital economy. Excerpts: Accenture’s Tech Vision for 2017 stresses on ‘technology for people’ as the core theme. What is driving this finding? It’s an exciting and unprecedented time in technology. If we look around, we notice the enormous impact that technology innovations have on people, business and society; and the possibilities get re-defined with each technology innovation. Today, every business is a digital business, and people are engaging and relying on technology more than before. While technology has long been developed to serve specific business needs, we are now in an era where people are central to the design and development of technologies. When technology is designed for people and by people, experiences become hyper-personalised and get transformed. When businesses develop technology with a human-centric approach, they are transforming their relationship with the customer from being a provider to a partner, significantly changing the business dynamics and re-setting customer expectations. This is the reason why people have the power and influence to shape technology, and that can have a profound impact in creating positive change and transforming society and business. What factors are key for AI to being seen as the user interface, as your report suggests? The growth we are seeing in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain today is not by chance. Several key progresses in the technology world over a number of years have made this happen—advances in machine learning and natural language processing, for example, are making technology more intuitive to use. Many of the core technologies are available for free, and open source AI tools like Google’s TensorFlow and Intel’s Trusted Analytics Platform are proliferating. This combination of factors—intuitive and natural interactions and the easy availability of open source tools—has enabled more research and development of AI and paved the way for disruptive changes. With more maturity in AI, many problems that hindered its adoption in the past are disappearing quickly. AI is growing pervasively and is consistently used to add a frictionless intelligence and experience to people’s interaction with technology. The outcome is that AI is poised to enable enterprises to improve the customer’s experience in every key interaction with the business, playing a variety of roles throughout the user experience. What degree of adoption of AI is Accenture seeing in the enterprise landscape? Advancements in the AI domain are creating new opportunities to make any interface simple and smart, thereby driving a faster pace of adoption and generating better outcomes for enterprises and people. AI is playing a variety of roles today in user experience alone. A simple example here is that of music apps or news aggregators which curate content for people based on browsing and usage history. Then we have virtual chatbots or assistants, which are now seen in customer-facing verticals like banking, insurance, online retail and travel. In more significant roles, AI applies machine learning to guide actions towards achieving better outcomes and driving smart experiences for customers; we are seeing this in verticals like smart agriculture, auto insurance, and oil and gas to name a few. In our global Accenture Technology Vision 2017 Survey of more than 5,400 IT and business executives, 79% agree that AI will help accelerate technology adoption throughout their organisations. As AI matures with more people-technology collaboration, it will become a key factor of distinction and competition for enterprises. In future, AI will act as the face of a company’s digital brand and become a key differentiator and core competency, demanding greater C-level investment and strategy. How are advances in technologies such as AI, Internet of Things, or Big Data analytics impacting the role of technology for enterprises in future? We need to first recognise that technology has moved to the front-end of driving and enabling a business from the earlier role it used to play in supporting the business. On top of that, technologies like AI, automation, robotics, IoT, and Big Data analytics are driving a new transition wave in the industry. These technologies have upended not only established businesses but entire industries. Armed with some or all of these disruptive technologies, and lean and nimble business models, new entrants are posing serious challenges to traditional companies. When these technologies play out in tandem, we will see an innovation wave resulting in huge transitions and new capabilities in various industries. To what extent are impacting customer expectations and businesses? Digital has disrupted the linear purchase journey and customer expectations today are evolving more rapidly than the industry ever imagined. Not only are the service expectations increasing, but they are also becoming more complex at every stage of the engagement and purchase journey. Customers are looking for faster and more personalised services, delivered anytime and anywhere. This outcome of the digital revolution is a perfect storm of opportunities and threats for all industries. It’s an opportunity for companies that can ride the wave and transform their offerings and business models. But slow movers will find themselves left behind by nimble footed competitors. In the digital age, it’s the speed that matters, much more than size or value. As clients turn to their IT partners for solutions to quickly transform into digital organisations, the opportunity is huge as well as immediate. You might also want to see this: What is Accenture’s key counsel to clients to navigate this complex and disruptive technology era successfully? We see three key takeaways from our Technology Vision 2017 report: We are currently in an unprecedented time in technology, fueled by rapid advances that raise important societal challenges that require leaders to be responsive and act responsibly. Accenture believes that the impact of these innovations will be positive—driving the biggest transformation since the Information Age – because the power lies with people. We are in control and we can shape technology so that it adapts to us. ‘Technology for People’ shows the way to an exciting future where technology is designed by humans, for humans to create positive change, improve lives, and transform business and society. This human-centered technology approach pays off for businesses, as leading companies will transform relationships with customer and employees by moving from provider to partner. No Comments.

Amazon profits climbed more than 40 percent, to $724 million. It was its eighth quarter in a row of profit. Microsoft also had a strong quarter, with profits up nearly 28 percent, while chipmaker Intel’s profits rose 45 percent. Amazon said its growth was propelled by sales for web services and retail subscriptions, such as Amazon Prime. The firm highlighted its international activity, noting expansion in India, Mexico and the UK. But executives told investors that more spending on content, products and warehouses for distribution lies ahead. “Although Amazon’s sales advanced by a respectable 23 percent over the quarter, the pace of growth at the online behemoth remains much slower than it was over most of the prior fiscal year,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “Some of this is the result of a less favourable exchange rate diluting contributions from the international business. However, some is also down to a more challenging demand environment in North America, which has limited spending uplifts on products within Amazon’s core territory.” Microsoft was lifted by its cloud computing products, such as Azure, which were $4.8 billion, up 28 percent compared with the previous year. “Our results this quarter reflect the trust customers are placing in the Microsoft Cloud,” said Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella. “From large multinationals to small and medium businesses to non-profits all over the world, organisations are using Microsoft’s cloud platforms to power their digital transformation.” Microsoft also received a boost from social network LinkedIn, which it bought for $26 billion in June last year. It contributed $975 million in revenue in the quarter, $25 million more than analysts had predicted. Chipmaker Intel’s profits rose 45 percent to $2.9 billion, with revenue up 8 percent. The growth was driven by its memory division, which recently launched a new technology, with revenue up 55 percent.   Urowayino Warami View all posts by Urowayino Warami → Previous Post We must get back to the era of National Development Plan — Presidency Economic Adviser Next Post Zenith, GTB supremacy battle continues Disclaimer Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

Netflix and NVIDIA have worked together to allow access to Netflix’s 4K content library. Previously, only systems running a Microsoft Edge Browser with an Intel Kaby Lake processor, a supported monitor and integrated graphics could stream the 4K content. Now, support for 4K streamed content has been expanded to allow select NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 series graphics cards to work. The issue that has prevented Netflix 4K streaming to a PC has been the tight DRM requirements imposed by Netflix and the content owners. NVIDIA quietly let customers know about the ability to preview Netflix UDH content on NVIDIA GPUs on the NVIDIA Support website NVIDIA Support website. When it comes to hardware requirements you must use an NVIDIA Pascal based GPU graphics card (GeForce GTX 1050 or greater) and have an HDCP 2.2 capable monitor. On the software side you must use GeForce 381.74 video card drivers that are only available with the Microsoft Windows Insider Program. NVIDIA didn’t talk about operating system requirements, but it sounds like this will only work on Windows 10 due to the WIP requirement for the driver. To enable Netflix UHD playback, the following is required: NVIDIA Driver version exclusively provided via Microsoft Windows Insider Program (currently 381.74). No other GeForce driver will support this functionality at this time If you are not currently registered for WIP, follow this link for instructions to join: https://insider.windows.com/ NVIDIA Pascal based GPU, GeForce GTX 1050 or greater with minimum 3GB memory HDCP 2.2 capable monitor(s). Please see the additional section below if you are using multiple monitors and/or multiple GPUs. Microsoft Edge browser or Netflix app from the Windows Store Approximately 25Mbps (or faster) internet connection. NVIDIA SLI multi-GPU configurations are not supports and if you are running multiple-displays all must be HDCP2.2 compliant or you’ll get Full HD (1080P) content only. Hopefully this ‘preview’ goes well and Netflix 4K UHD playback support will be added to all GeForce drivers! If you happen to have a Netflix Premium account and try this out on our NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10-Series PC let us know how it works out!

Now, support for such content has been expanded, albeit in preview, to include NVIDIA's latest GeForce GTX 10 series graphics cards. According to a post by NVIDIA, PC users with a GeForce GTX 1050 or higher graphics card, and an HDCP 2.2 compatible monitor, can enjoy 4K Netflix content on Microsoft Edge or the official Netflix Windows 10 app. Apart from these, one basic requirement includes a 25 Mbit internet connection for a smooth experience. In case of a dual-monitor setup, if one of the monitors is not HDCP 2.2 compliant, then the quality will be downgraded to Full HD. It must be noted that SLI/LDA configurations are not yet supported, but users can enjoy 4K if the graphics cards are not not linked together in SLI/LDA mode. Although, the version of Windows 10 hasn't been mentioned in the post, AnandTech has speculated that the Creators Update may be required for 4K streaming with the NVIDIA graphics cards and HDCP 2.2 monitors. If you happen to have the supported PC configuration and a Netflix subscription, do let us know if you are able to view 4K content on your rig.

Freedman April 29, 2017 Pros / Great keyboard; Little bloatware; Solid performance; Thin and light Cons / Below-average battery life; Poor screens on lower-end models Verdict / The Lenovo ThinkPad T470s is a thin computer with strong performance and a wonderful keyboard, but competitors offer lower weight or longer battery life. Lenovo ThinkPad T470s from $1124.00 Visit Site from Lenovo Light, slim and packed with ports, Lenovo's ThinkPad T470s ($1,124 to start; models tested range up to $2,102.99) offers the strong performance, great keyboard and overall versatility of Lenovo's popular ThinkPad T470, but it weighs a much lighter 2.9 pounds. Unlike its big brother, the T470s is available with a 2K screen and a choice of a silver or black chassis. This $1,124 laptop ($1,571 as tested) is pleasant to carry and work on, but below-average battery life and dull displays (on the 1080p models) hold it back. Design While all ThinkPads have a similar design, I'm still wowed by just how small the T470s is. The carbon-fiber chassis is black (or silver, if you like change), with the ThinkPad logo in the top-left-hand corner of the lid. When you lift the lid, you'll be greeted by a 14-inch display, an island-style keyboard, a red pointing stick and another ThinkPad logo -- this time, in the bottom-right corner of the black deck. At 13 x 8.9 x 0.7 inches and 2.9 pounds, the T470s cuts a sleek profile that doesn't take up too much room on a desk or in a bag. It's significantly lighter and smaller than the regular T470 (3.5 pounds, 0.8 inches thick). Although the ThinkPad X1 Carbon weighs a mere 2.49 pounds and is only 0.6 inches thick, it costs $200 to $300 more than the T470s, depending on the configuration. The Dell Latitude 5480 is much heavier (4 pounds, 0.9 inches thick), while Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro is 3 pounds and a sleeker 11.97 x 8.4 x 0.6 inches. Despite its slender frame, the ThinkPad T470s has enough ports for peripherals and monitors. The left side features the power jack, a USB 3.0 port, a headphone jack and an SD card slot. On the right are an optional smart-card reader, a Thunderbolt 3 port, a pair of USB 3.0 ports, HDMI output, an Ethernet jack, a SIM card slot (for the optional 4G modem) and a space for a Kensington lock. Lenovo ThinkPad T470s from $1124.00 Visit Site from Lenovo The ThinkPad T470s also has Lenovo's proprietary docking port on the bottom -- something the X1 Carbon lacks. Specs Durability and Security The ThinkPad T470s is built to protect your data and take a few knocks. Lenovo put a touchpad on the palm rest, which easily lets you log in to your computer with a single tap thanks to Windows Hello. That biometric data is protected by a TPM chip, and every configuration with a compatible CPU (Core i5-7300U or Core i7-7600U) also offers vPro for remote maintenance. The laptop is MIL-STD-810G tested, meaning it should survive extreme temperatures, humidity, vibrations and shocks. Display Lenovo offers three different 14-inch screens on the ThinkPad T470s, and they differ wildly. Our favorite is the high-end 2560 x 1440 display, which is far more vivid than the alternative 1080p touch-screen and non-touch-screen options. When I watched a 1080p trailer for "The Circle," the bright reds on the company's computer software popped off of actress Emma Watson's screen, and it was sharp enough to see all of her freckles. The grass on the company's campus was verdant and vibrant. On the 1080p display, the trailer looked slightly brighter, but the colors were a bit off. The 1080p touch display, by comparison, was extremely dark. The WQHD (2560 x 1440) version of the ThinkPad T470s covers 118 percent of the sRGB color gamut (68.1 percent for the 1080p version and 76.9 percent for the touch-screen 1080p version). That's above the ultraportable category average (96 percent), and it tops the MacBook Pro (113 percent), the X1 Carbon (104 percent), the ThinkPad T470 (73 percent) and the Latitude 5480 (71 percent). The T470s with a 2560 x 1440 display scored 2.2on the Delta-E test for color accuracy. (Zero is ideal.) With a Delta-E score of 2, the 1080p version was less accurate, as was the full-HD touch-screen version, which had a Delta-E of 0.9) were both lower. The average is 2.5, and the ThinkPad T470 (2.1), the Latitude 5840 (1.6) and the MacBook Pro (1) were all lower. MORE: Best Lenovo Laptops All of the T470s' displays are dimmer than the average ultraportable average of 294 nits. The WQHD panel measured 253 nits, the 1080p non-touch-screen version reached 245 nits and the touch-screen version registered a dismal 216 nits. The original T470 (234 nits) and the Latitude 5840 (a poor 202 nits) also were dimmer. The X1 Carbon (275 nits) and the MacBook Pro (with its 495-nit display) were more luminous. Keyboard, Touchpad and TrackPoint It's always a pleasure to type on a ThinkPad keyboard, and the T470s continues that tradition. With 1.7 millimeters of travel and 70 grams of force required to actuate, the keys on the T470s are clicky and responsive. I reached 108 words per minute on the 10fastfingers.com typing test, barely beating my usual 107 wpm while maintaining my standard 2 percent error rate. The 2.2 x 3.9-inch touchpad is smoother than some ThinkPads of late, and I appreciate the new feeling (there's far less friction). It's certified as a Windows Precision Touchpad and is very receptive to gestures. If you like the accuracy and convenience of a pointing stick, you'll appreciate that Lenovo's TrackPoint provides extremely precise navigation without making you lift your hands off the home row. Audio The speakers on the T470s produce balanced audio; I just wish it were a little louder. When I listened to Lorde's "Green Light," the sound barely filled our lab. I could easily distinguish the vocals, keys, drums and synth beats, but I couldn't get the volume to a point where my toes started tapping along. There are some sound settings in the Lenovo Settings app, but I found the default options were best. Performance We reviewed one ThinkPad T470s with a 2.8-GHz Intel Core i7-7600U CPU, 12GB of RAM and a 512GB PCIe NVMe solid-state drive. Two other models we reviewed had an 2.6-GHz Intel Core i5-7300U CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB PCIe NVME SSD (but different screens). All three could handle 35 tabs in Chrome, including one streaming a 1080p episode of "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver." Lenovo ThinkPad T470s from $1124.00 Visit Site from Lenovo The T470s with Core i7 notched a score of 6,214, and the Core i5 model hit 5,807. The average is 5,879, and the regular T470 (6,699; Core i5-7200U), X1 Carbon (8,571; Core i7-7600U) and Latitude 5480 (8,530; Core i7-7600U) outperformed it. It took 13 seconds for the T470s with Core i7 to copy 4.97GB of mixed media files,for a rate of 391.5 MBps, and the Core i5 model took 17 seconds, for a rate of 299.4 MBps. Both are faster than the average (190.1 MBps) as well as the X1 Carbon (242 MBps) and the Latitude 5840 (137.6 MBps). The ThinkPad T470 reached 267.8 Mbps, and the MacBook Pro had a blazing rate of 508.9 MBps. The Core i7 T470s paired 20,000 names and addresses in our OpenOffice spreadsheet test in 3 minutes and 59 seconds, while the Core i5 version was slightly behind, at 4:04. The average is 5:47, the MacBook Pro took 4:39, the original T470 finished in 4:01, the X1 Carbon completed the test in 3:22 and the Latitude was done in 3:12. It's unsurprising that these ultraportable business laptops aren't ready for gaming. With integrated Intel HD Graphics 620, the i7 and i5 models of the T470s hit 51,955 and 47,856, respectively, on the 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test. The average is 54,383, and the original T470 with the same GPU earned a score of 62,912. Battery Life While some of the ThinkPad T470s models we tested lasted longer than others, they all had significantly shorter battery life than competitors. The configuration with a Core i7 CPU and a 2560 x 1440 display lasted the longest, at 8 hours and 1 minute on the Laptop Mag Battery Test (continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi), while the Core i5 version with a 1080p display lasted 6:43. On the touch-screen model, that time dropped to 6:17. MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life In contrast, the ThinkPad T470 lasted a whopping 17:25 with its six-cell battery, and 8:39 with its three-cell unit on board. The X1 Carbon conked out after 12 hours and 21 minutes. The average for ultraportables is a longer 8 hours and 18 minutes, while the MacBook Pro endured for 9:50, and the Latitude survived for 11:37. Webcam The T470s' 720p webcam takes usable photos, but the colors are a tad off. In a picture I took at my desk, I could make out individual hairs on my head and the silhouette of my colleague's Spider-Man figure on a monitor behind me. But everything appeared a bit pale, with washed-out navy-blue headphones and a dull-brown sweater. All of the lights behind me were completely blown out. Heat The ThinkPad T470s stayed cool during our heat test. After we streamed HD video from YouTube for 15 minutes, the laptop measured 82 degrees Fahrenheit on the touchpad, 86 degrees on the center of the keyboard and 94 degrees on the bottom of the laptop. All of those temperatures fall below our 95-degree comfort threshold. Software and Warranty Lenovo continues its trend of offering just a few useful utilities on the ThinkPad T470s. It comes with the Companion app, which makes it easy to run system updates and check warranty status, and Lenovo Settings for controlling various aspects of the system, including the sound, webcam and battery. Although the company didn't add its own bloatware, the ThinkPad T470s still comes with all of the junk that's built into Windows 10, like Candy Crush Soda Saga, Drawboard PDF, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, Facebook, Twitter and Sling. Lenovo sells the ThinkPad 470s with a one-year warranty by default, with various options up to three years at an extra cost. See how Lenovo performed on our Best and Worst Brands ranking and Tech Support Showdown. Configurations Lenovo sells several different configurations of the ThinkPad T470s at third-party retailers, and allows you to configure the laptop to order at Lenovo.com. The base model goes for $1,124 and features a Core i5-7200U CPU; 4GB of RAM; a 128GB SSD; and a nontouch, 1080p screen. MORE: The Best Laptops for Every Need We tested three configurations of the ThinkPad T470s. The most powerful model costs $2,102.99 and boasts a 2.8-GHz Intel Core i7-7600U CPU, 12GB of RAM, a 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD and a 2560 x 1440 display. Lenovo ThinkPad T470s from $1124.00 Visit Site from Lenovo The $1,571.99 base model comes with a 2.6-GHz Intel Core i5-7300U CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and a 1920 x 1080 screen. For $1,619, you can get a configuration that's nearly identical to the base model but adds a touch-screen display. Bottom Line The Lenovo ThinkPad T470s is an ultraportable business notebook that delivers solid performance and a comfortable, responsive keyboard. There's very little bloatware on the machine. However, its battery life is below average, and the only screen we can recommend is the high-end QWHD panel. If you can spend around $200 more and don't need the proprietary docking port or a built-in SD card reader, consider Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon, which is lighter and lasts much longer. Or, if you're looking for long battery life and don't mind carrying a noticeably heavier laptop, another option is the regular ThinkPad T470, which costs less and lasts more than twice as long as the T470s on a charge. However, if you can live with its trade-offs, the ThinkPad T470s will offer you a strong combination of performance, usability and portability.

View Latest Posts >>> ‘Butcher of Kabul’ calls for peace in 1st public appearance in 20 years By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on April 30, 2017 … from Russia Today,  Moscow Hekmatyar with CIA Deputy Director Richard Kerr [ Editor’s Note: Oh my, what a surprise here – a blast from the past. While the story mentions Hekmatyar being a CIA asset during the Soviet-Afghan War and a close friend of Osama bin Laden, it left out that Osama was a full CIA case officer, Tim Osman, who even used his medical benefits when he was on the terror lists. Our Pakistani ISI Intel friends had filled us in on all this long ago. General Hamid Gul, former ISI chief, now deceased, was a long-time VT editorial board member, and is in our In Memoriam section now. The best satire line I have read in some time is the one below where the US had designated Hekmatyar as a “global terrorist”. I would have to ask, “compared to who, what country or countries”, and how much carnage did he create, compared to the real global terrorists? Hekmatyar’s coming out of the closet now has been well-received by the current Afghan government, but we have no public comment yet from the US State Department or the Taliban. Continuing the current Afghan war is keeping the ten big heroin processing plants running smoothly, cranking out a $100 billion a year that is making a lot of powerful people happy. They would hate to say bye-bye to that conveyor belt of cash. Sure, there is a lot of potential raw material wealth in Afghanistan, but earning that is real work; it takes real capital, a long time, and has far lower profit margins. I could see the heroin kings going along with a peace deal with the understanding that their drug operations would be left alone. That runs contrary to the Taliban’s long time position on drugs, but the mega dealers have found that friendship and understand can usually be purchased when you have huge amounts of money to buy it with… Jim W. Dean ] Jim’s Editor’s Notes are solely crowdfunded via PayPal – [email protected] This includes research, needed field trips, Heritage TV Legacy archiving, and more – Thanks for helping out * A younger Hekmatyar – First published  …  April 30,  2017  – Infamous Afghan warlord and CIA-funded mujahideen, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who “worked closely” with Osama bin Laden and rose to become prime minister in a bloody civil war after the USSR’s collapse, has urged the Taliban to lay down their weapons and join “the peace caravan.” Hekmatyar, who earned the title the “Butcher of Kabul” for his leading role in the bloody civil war of the 1990s, returned to public life Saturday, and for the first time in 20 years spoke at a small gathering in the Laghman province. The leader of the Islamist organization Hezb-i-Islami told his members in a televised appearance: “Let’s join hands to end war and bring peace in Afghanistan.” “I invite you to join the peace caravan and stop the pointless, meaningless and unholy war,” he said, urging all insurgent groups to end the war and join the peace process in Afghanistan. Hekmatyar, a former close friend of Osama Bin Laden, added that only Afghans can bring peace and stability to the country, not foreigners. Hekmatyar was a prominent Mujahideen commander and a CIA asset during the Soviet-Afghan war in the 1980s. He was later accused of killing thousands of people when his fighters fired on civilian areas of Kabul during the 1992-96 civil war. The warlord was designated a “global terrorist” by the United States in 2003, standing accused of participating in and supporting attacks by al-Qaeda and the Taliban. He was blacklisted at Washington’s request by the UN the same year. In a 2006 interview, Hekmatyar claimed his fighters had helped Osama Bin Laden escape from Tora Bora. He agreed a peace deal via video link with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani last September – the first peace treaty since the war with the Taliban began in 2001. Following on from this, the United Nations Security Council agreed to drop sanctions against him in February, clearing the way for him to return openly to Afghanistan. While the exiled warlord’s hideout over the years was unknown, it was believed he lived in the eastern Kunar province, making occasional trips into Pakistan. The country’s chief executive officer, Abdullah Abdullah, praised Hekmatyar’s embrace of peace during a ceremony marking the 25th Mujahideen Victory Day on Saturday. Hekmatyar today is “in his own country and on his own soil, proudly among his own people and the Afghan people have welcomed him, too,” Abdullah Abdullah said.“We hope that this would be an example for others.” * Related Posts: Afghanistan: Change the United States war strategy to a “sincere” negotiations strategy for peace.

Thanks Jim. This is huge. Log in to Reply Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  April 30, 2017 at 1:12 pm CIA asset Hekmatyar also knows that his best chance to facilitate return the opium-to-heroin processing plants of from Turkey to Afghanistan would be with the elimination of the Taliban — with “peace.” Trump ex-NSA was in charge of U.S. intel in Afghanistan when the opium-to-heroin processing plants of Afghanistan were moved to Turkey — so “Flynn Knew” and didn’t do anything about it (at best). Erdogan’s Turks also paid Trump ex-NSA Michael Flynn $500,000+ to lobby for Erdogan & Turkey. See, e.g., “Our Ally Turkey Is in Crisis and Needs Our Support” by Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn (R), Contributor on 8 November 2016 at http://TheHill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/foreign-policy/305021-our-ally-turkey-is-in-crisis-and-needs-our-support. Trump & Co. knew that Flynn was a paid lobbyist for Erdogan’s Turks (unlike what Sean Spicer says and implies), but “The Hill” and those giving classified briefings to Flynn & Trump did not — since Flynn did not register as a “Foreign Agent” or get the legally required permission from U.S. DoD before Flynn became a paid “Foreign Agent” for Turkey. Ex-DIA Director Flynn’s DIA ex-Deputy-Director went “apoplectic” when he found out about Flynn’s possibly treasonous “Foreign Agent” acts & omissions. If “Trump Knew,” what about Trump? ;-).

This is not the first time that the company is attempting this, with the only difference being that the software giant will not have to make a variant operating system like it did with the Windows RT. Now according to sources close to the matter, Microsoft is not going to be the only one preparing ARM-powered notebooks because Lenovo too is looking to get into this market of portable machines. Upstream Suppliers Believe That Microsoft and Lenovo Will Be the First Companies to Announce ARM-Powered Portable Computing Machines – Windows 10 Will Be Running Through a Layer of Emulation Intel is definitely going to be facing strong competition and with AMD’s Ryzen lineup in full swing, ARM too has partnered with Microsoft to bring Windows 10 support to mobile processors. According to upstream suppliers (via DigiTimes), Microsoft has a new Surface device getting prepped, along with Lenovo’s 2-in-1 that could be running ARM-based processors. Related OnePlus 5 Leaked Image Shows a Vertically-Mounted Dual-Camera – Another Affordable Snapdragon 835-Powered Phone in Tow? Being more energy efficient and cheaper, these future machines will be a lot slower than their desktop counterparts, but offer extended battery life, huge portability factor thanks to using mobile chipsets and feature cellular connectivity right off the bat. Advertisement Microsoft’s executive earlier stated that a Snapdragon 835 would be the bare minimum required to run Windows 10 through emulation. Even though there is a demo showing that a Snapdragon 820 was more than capable of running a taxing application like the desktop version of Photoshop, it looks like the 10nm FinFET SoC has been chosen as the minimum hardware prerequisite. Related Is Microsoft About to Target Chromebooks? Leaked Spec Sheet Shows That It Certainly Is On the other hand, notebooks running ARM chipsets could also be running the Cloud version of Windows 10, so it is not really confirmed what sort of product we will be seeing in the future.

In France everything will be on hold until Sunday, with the second round of the presidential election, though the outcome seems clear. In the US the focus may shift away from Donald Trump and towards the Federal Reserve, which meets on Thursday. It is most unlikely that the Fed will have another rate rise, given the slow growth of the US economy during the first quarter, but the thing to look for will be signals about the pace of tightening later in the year. Wage growth is starting to take off in the US, suggesting that at last the labour market is tightening, and that will be the key indicator that the Fed will look at. I shall also be interested to see how markets respond to those GDP numbers now that they have had a weekend to think about them. Last week saw strong results from several of the US high-tech giants, including Amazon and Facebook. There are some more to report next week (e.g. Intel) so a lot of the mood of US equity markets will also be worth watching. How long can the share-price boom, especially of high-tech companies, continue? General Election 2017: What you need to know Quite a lot of the answer to that will depend on how secure the world’s economic growth appears to be. The main forward-looking indicators giving a feel for that will be the purchasing manager indices (PMI) for April. We get a clutch of those from the main economies, including the UK. From a British perspective the question will be whether the dip in growth in the first quarter is the start of a trend, or a one-off blip – or indeed whether those figures are right anyway, for they are almost invariably revised. It is another 10 days until the Bank of England meets and publishes the May edition of the Inflation Report, but the question there will naturally be whether the Bank sticks to its forecast of 2 per cent growth this year. Anyway, the April PMI should confirm that globally growth is picking up, and give us the first real feeling for the second quarter of the year. Parliament is dissolved and the UK election campaigns get under way in earnest. The fascinating thing about the debate so far is the growing awareness of both major parties that they cannot credibly promise significant tax cuts for the next five years and that, if anything, people should prepare for tax increases. Watch for the reaction to that.  UK General Election 2017 22 show all UK General Election 2017 1/22 18 April 2017 Media gather in Downing Street, London, ahead of a statement by Prime Minister Theresa May PA wire 2/22 18 April 2017 Theresa May exits 10 Downing Street to announce snap election EPA 3/22 18 April 2017 British Prime Minister Theresa May has called for an early general election Getty Images 4/22 18 April 2017 Prime Minister Theresa May walks back into 10 Downing Street after making a statement to the nation Getty Images 5/22 18 April 2017 Broadcast journalists set up on the green outside the Houses of Parliament after the prime minister announced that she will seek an early general election Getty 6/22 18 April 2017 A newspaper stand shows a copy of today's Evening Standard, with the front page story relating to British Prime Minister Theresa May's call for a snap general election on June 8 Getty Images 7/22 18 April 2017 Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn talks to carers during a visit to Birmingham Carers Hub to launch Labour's proposed Carer's Allowance increase Getty Images 8/22 19 April 2017 Prime Minister Theresa May delivers a speech in Walmsley Parish Hall, Bolton, as she asked voters for the mandate to lead post-Brexit Britain ahead of the looming election campaign PA wire 9/22 19 April 2017 Scotland's First Minister and Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon walks with deputy leader and member of parliament Angus Robertson during a media facility outside the Houses of Parliament Getty Images 10/22 19 April 2017 Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May delivers a speech to Conservative Party members to launch their election campaign in Walmsley Parish Hall in Bolton, England Getty Images 11/22 20 April 2017 Prime Minister Theresa May during a visit to radar manufacturer Kelvin Hughes Limited in Enfield, north Londo PA wire 12/22 21 April 2017 Prime Minster Theresa May gives a short speech and at GSK in Maidenhead, England Getty Images 13/22 21 April 2017 Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn reads with children as he visits Brentry Children Centre in Bristol, during Labour's election campaign PA 14/22 24 April 2017 A tactical voting website in support of Labour.

How do markets perform during general election campaigns? I have been looking at some work by Schroders on what has happened in the past. Out of the last seven elections the FT100 index rose during the six weeks before polling in three. In each case this was when the outcome was fairly certain: the Labour wins in 1997 and 2001, and the Conservative victory in 1987. If elections look close, however, markets tend to fall – the FT100 index fell by more than 8 per cent in the run-up to the 2010 election, and nearly 5 per cent ahead of John Major’s win in 1992. So I suppose that means they are likely to rise in the next six weeks. Investors don’t care who wins, or at least not much. What they want is certainty.  More about: Economics General Election 2017 Amazon Facebook Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

And with that, the 2017 Culture Shifting Awards Brunch was underway. Last weekend, on a cool Sunday morning at one of the nicest hotels in Silicon Valley overlooking the Santa Cruz mountains, black CEOs, entrepreneurs, engineers, and investors had gathered to network and to celebrate a handful of leaders who had broken down barriers and proven that skin color does not determine to which degree a person can succeed in Silicon Valley. This was the third annual Culture Shifting Awards Brunch, organized by Hoffman, the CEO of Culture Shift Labs. Hoffman has been at the forefront of the push for diversity and inclusion for nearly 20 years, and has built a network of black executives and entrepreneurs paralleled by few. Back in 2015, I attended the inaugural event, which saw about 200 attendees and included a think tank the day before the brunch, with another 300 people on the waiting list. Two years later, Culture Shifting Weekend has added a third day, moved to a bigger venue, and had over 300 black leaders attending the brunch, with 800 people on the waiting list. Hoffman told me she had two main goals when she created Culture Shifting Weekend back in 2015. “To raise the profile of the vast number of leaders and pioneers of color so that others have a more accurate perspective of what's out there,” Hoffman said. “I think corporations, nonprofits, and their peers lack this perspective. Even the media lacks this perspective.” She also wants to encourage and enable networking and collaboration between people who care about diversity and inclusion by creating an event where the most influential black executives can come and network. “It would not have been possible if it wasn't for the connection that was made at this very event last year.” Deals getting made off the connections built at Culture Shifting Weekends isn’t a new phenomenon either. Laura Weidman Powers, the co-founder and CEO of Code2040, met Alphabet executive David Drummond at the first event two years ago, which ultimately led to a $3 million grant from Google for the nonprofit. “It would not have been possible if it wasn't for the connection that was made at this very event last year,” Powers said on stage last year. According to Hoffman, deals were struck and funding was also secured by entrepreneurs from this year’s event, including commitments made to companies that presented during the Saturday think tank. Nearly every major tech company in Silicon Valley was represented, including Apple, Google, Intel, IBM, SAP, and HP, just to name a few. Even Hollywood was represented, with a Friday discussion about how Black Hollywood and black leaders in the tech industry could work better together that included Cheo Coker, the showrunner for Luke Cage. Future black leaders of Silicon Valley and politics, including Maci Peterson, CEO of Second Thought — only the 14th black woman to raise over $1 million in funding in the Valley — and Michael Blake, the 35-year-old former Obama aide, New York Assemblyman, and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, were introduced to a room full of potential partners that could help them for years to come.

But as the world has gotten bleaker over the past year in the midst of a Trump administration, the conversation, justly, shifted to even more serious topics at times throughout the weekend. With the rise of nationalism sweeping the US, Europe, and even Africa, as we learned during the weekend, talks weren’t limited to affecting change in Silicon Valley as they once were, but also about affecting change globally. There was an intimate dinner on Saturday night to discuss tech developments in Nigeria with lawyer, investor, and philanthropist Gbenga Oyebode and his wife, philanthropist and human rights activist Aisha Oyebode, one of the most prominent couples in Nigeria. Executives and partners from Apple, Intel, and Ernst & Young were in attendance. Aisha Oyebode, a co-convener of the #BringBackOurGirls movement, spoke about the ongoing struggle to find and return the 276 girls that were kidnapped from a school in Northern Nigeria by Boko Haram back in 2014 (57 girls have escaped so far). Mr. Oyebode spoke about the numerous startups and business opportunities in Nigeria — which will surpass the US to become the third largest country in the world by 2050 — and explained how the wave of nationalism that has swept the US and Europe is also rearing its head in Africa. Photo: Culture Shift Labs The actor and activist Hill Harper, who hosted the brunch, told a story about sitting next to the Oyebodes and striking his own potential deal. Harper learned that Nigeria can produce the oil he uses in his skin care line, turning that conversation into a potential partnership that could bring jobs to the people directly affected by Boko Haram’s kidnappings. “We need you to allow your genius to shine.” “We started talking about northern Nigeria and the fact that there’re Baobab trees in northern Nigeria. And then we started talking more about the fact that Aisha is doing great work in northern Nigeria, with women in particular, and we also know [about] Boko Haram and the 276 girls that were kidnapped in northern Nigeria,” Hill continued. “And then she said that most of the women in northern Nigeria are the folks working in agriculture, and we talked about the idea of cultivating Baobab trees for my products out of Africa. So one, we can provide jobs; two, we can hit populations that are extremely vulnerable; three, we can figure out a way to connect an American business here — my business — to something going on there, and we have like a triple, quadruple net victory out of a simple conversation at a dinner. “We’re going to create that type of action. We want more of that and we need that, because we need you to allow your genius to shine.” While the problems of the world will make it tougher to create diverse workplaces in the short term, the enthusiasm shown for creating more opportunities and a better working environment for people of color was not diminished in the least from what I saw at the inaugural event. Two years ago, the problems discussed seemed surmountable with time and effort from all parties involved. Now, the issues are more complex, involving far more than unmotivated companies resisting change, but at least for the 300 attendees, their resolve hasn’t changed.

The event could see the firm reveal new hardware and software solutions aimed specifically at students. In terms of hardware, the tech world is still waiting for Microsoft to present its new generation tablet, the Surface Pro 5. The Redmond-based firm could use its education-themed event to do that — so long as the device has something specific to offer students. In any case, rumours are heating up on specialist websites, suggesting that the tablet could feature the latest-generation Intel processors (Kaby Lake), boosting performance and battery life. However, Microsoft is unlikely to unveil the eagerly awaited new range of Surface Phone smartphones or a Surface Book 2 PC at the May 2 event. Above all, Microsoft could present a Surface 4 — a low-cost device tailored to users on tight budgets. This new tablet could also be the first device to run Windows 10 Cloud, a pared-down and partially cloud-based version of Microsoft’s famous operating system. The concept is similar to Chrome OS, used in Google’s low-cost Chromebook PCs popular with students. The Cloud OS aims to provide a lightweight operating system for the least powerful computers on the market. As the name suggests, the system is focused on cloud computing, which is useful for PCs that don’t have much storage space. Users can, for example, use Microsoft programs already available in the cloud, such as MS Office, rather than installing them directly on their computer. Microsoft has more than the May 2 event in store this spring, as the Microsoft Build developers’ conference opens a few days later, running May 10 to 12 in Seattle.

Son believes the singularity will be coming soon in which the intelligence of robots overtakes that of people, triggering runaway technological growth. / Yonhap By Park Hyong-ki Sean LeeHumanity's future with robots is often portrayed and projected as the apocalyptic end of humankind. In science fiction movies and novels such as "The Matrix" and "Robopocalypse," super-intelligent computers or artificial intelligence (AI) become rulers of the earth, and humans become enslaved by them. Even in reality, many scholars and experts predict some sort of doomsday amid the rise of the machine. Forecasts include the loss of human jobs and people's expertise in certain areas such as finance and middle management soon becoming irrelevant. Calls to adopt measures or rules such as scientist Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics or robot taxes are growing to safeguard the future of the human race. However, optimists say robots will further enhance human lives. Robotic technology can help the development of medicines that can ease pain and even cheat death, or help people become superhuman. Whatever the future of humankind holds with robots, SoftBank Group Chairman Masayoshi Son believes the age of robots is at hand. Like the internet and other innovative technologies before it, AI can also improve lives, which is in line with SoftBank's vision ― bringing happiness to people through innovation in information, communication and technology (ICT). Sean Lee, a partner and managing director of SoftBank Ventures Korea, said AI is keeping Chairman Son up at nights, imagining and drawing the future in his head about the age of the "singularity" ― the pivotal point when the intelligence of robots will exceed that of humans. The chairman, known as Son Jeong-ui here, believes it will begin in 2018, and by 2041, one processor will be able to exceed the intelligence of all humankind. "SoftBank is looking mainly at two things for the future ― AI and the internet of things (IoT). We all know AI led the chairman to postpone his retirement," Lee said in a recent interview at his office in Gangnam, southern Seoul. "The acquisitions of ARM Holdings, a chip design company, and a telecom company, Sprint, are all part of Son's preparations for the singularity." SoftBank Ventures Korea, a venture capital fund of the Japan-based telecommunication group, is also seeking investment opportunities in the startup world, aligned with Son's vision, Lee said. Eyeing AI, media When the internet was introduced in the market and became mainstream, SoftBank Ventures sought out startups that had the potential to win by both using and benefiting from the technology. Then, it invested in Nexon, which became the country's biggest online gaming firm. With the introduction of smartphones and mobile technology, the venture capital fund also used the same strategy as before and invested in startups such as SundayToz and Devsisters. The former is known for its successful puzzle game "Anipang," and the latter created the hit game "Cookie Run." "We are seeking startups that can use the potential of AI and come out as a winner. There are some things traditional players can do, and there are some areas within AI where startups can excel. We are trying to find those startups," Lee said. Last year, SoftBank Ventures Korea and Naver, the country's largest search engine, set up a fund to invest in startups in AI and media in the United States. "The U.S. currently has the world's most aggressive AI developers. It is kind of scary to see how fast AI is growing there. Naver sees itself as a small company in AI when compared to U.S. tech companies," he said. He added that the two are also interested in new media in the U.S. for investment. "Along with AI, we are looking to invest in media startups like Snapchat and Line. In the new age, we can no longer see one technology alone. We should see its potential to converge with other technology. AI can be converged with media, and vice versa," Lee said. In Korea, SoftBank Ventures has separate funds that not only seek to invest in AI startups but also those in other ICT areas. Unlike other in-house corporate venture funds such as those of Samsung Electronics, Intel and Qualcomm, SoftBank makes investments with partners including the National Pension Service, KB Insurance and Nexon, which provided capital to SoftBank's venture capital funds. "But lately, we have become more worried about the future because IoT will make national borders meaningless. Can Korean startups survive the competition in a borderless world? We need to begin seeing this world differently," Lee said. New world AI, IoT and other innovative technologies will further connect the world and make borders obsolete. The days are gone when Korean companies felt safe and gained an edge here without having to worry about competing with foreign players. "But things are different. Look at Google, YouTube, Facebook. Google is No.1 everywhere except in four countries ― Korea, Japan, China and Russia. In Japan, Google is rapidly catching up with Yahoo," Lee said. "Startups and entrepreneurs have to think differently and create services that can appeal globally through risk-taking and innovation. Otherwise, their future looks dim with a lot less chance of becoming a unicorn." In Korea, startups that had the potential to become a unicorn, or a company valued at billions of dollars, consisted of team members in their mid-30s. Those who had some experience in managing people and decision-making had a higher chance of running a successful startup here. Lee said startups need tenacity to change fast in accordance with consumers' needs everywhere in the world, not just in their homeland. "The risk-taking culture has to change as well. I think the Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis in 2008 made young Koreans take less risks and seek more stability after seeing their parents lose their businesses and suffer," Lee said. On the other hand, the U.S. and China refocused their energy away from financial places like Wall Street to innovation hubs such as Silicon Valley, further encouraging innovation through risk-taking even after failures. "This culture creates a lot of differences because at the end, it will create more success," Lee said. "SoftBank Ventures Korea has invested in more than 200 startups since it was established here in 2000. Most of them failed. But one successful startup has always made up for the other nine failed startups we invested in. It has never seen success without investment, even including failed ones," he said. hyongki@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter N.

It's a big release for storage, shared memory, CPU speed boosts and touchy-feely types 1 May 2017 at 03:50, Simon Sharwood Linus Torvalds has given the world version 4.11 of the Linux kernel. “So after that extra week with an rc8, things were pretty calm,” Torvalds posted to the Linux Kernel Mailing List, adding “I'm much happier releasing a final 4.11 now. So what do we get this time around? Among other things, Linux is now better at hot-swapping solid state disks and can now do journaling on RAID 4/5/6 volumes. While we're talking storage, there's also support for the OPAL self-encrypting disk drive standard. The kernel has also gained support for the Shared Memory Communications over RDMA (SMC-R) (SMC-R) spec, an IBM invention that allows virtual machines to share memory and therefore speeds up communications between the machines, helps with load balancing and doesn't hurt when clustering Linux boxen. Enterprise users and gamers will both be happy that the kernel adds improved support for Intel's Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, technology that lets a CPU figure out which of its cores is fastest and then increase its clock speed in response to a critical workload's needs. Among the more interesting smaller changes, the kernel's Infiniband implementation has plenty of added nuances, Wacom tablets are now supported and the Realtek ALC299/ALC1220 codecs get overdue support, meaning some Kaby Lake motherboards can now make noise when running Linux. Kernel Newbies has a comprehensive list of new features and tweaks. The release of version 4.11 of course means that the merge window is open for the next version of the Linux Kernel. As ever, would-be-contributors have a little over a week to offer their ideas and code before Linus Torvalds sets the next version of Linux down the assembly line. ® Tips and corrections 3 Comments MORE Linux Linus Torvalds More from The Register You're taking the p...

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) WASHINGTON (AP) — Investigations intensified into President Donald Trump's ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn, on Thursday as the Pentagon watchdog joined lawmakers in probing payments he accepted from foreign sources including a Russian state-sponsored TV network. At the same time, documents released by the top Democrat on a House oversight committee showed Flynn was warned by authorities after he retired from the military in 2014 not to take foreign government-sourced money without "advance approval" from the Pentagon. Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general and Defense Intelligence Agency chief, later accepted tens of thousands of dollars for his work on behalf of foreign interests, including RT, the state-supported Russian television network, and a Turkish-owned company linked to Turkey's government. The Pentagon's acting inspector general's office confirmed Thursday he has launched an inquiry into whether those payments qualify as coming from foreign governments and whether Flynn properly informed military authorities about them. The White House defended its hiring of Flynn and attempted to shift blame for any problems with his vetting onto the Obama administration, which handled the reissuance of his security clearance in January 2016. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who released the documents, said during a news conference that Flynn had been clearly informed he needed to get permission to receive foreign payments and there's no evidence he did so. "The Pentagon's warning to General Flynn was bold, italicized and could not have been clearer," Cummings said. In a key 2014 document, Flynn was told by a Defense Intelligence Agency official that the U.S. Constitution's emoluments provision prohibits any monetary payments or gifts "from a foreign government unless congressional consent is first obtained." The Oct. 8, 2014, letter — which was sent to Flynn at his request — explained that such "advance approval" would need to come "from the relevant service secretary." Earlier this week, Cummings and Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House committee, said that they had found no evidence Flynn asked the Army for permission to receive foreign payments or informed the military he had accepted them. Army spokeswoman Cynthia O. Smith said the Army had no records that Flynn requested that permission. One episode in question involves a trip he took to Moscow in 2015 for RT's anniversary celebration. He was paid at least $33,750 to attend the gala at which he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "General Flynn's attorney says he discussed his trip to Moscow with DIA, but we have no evidence, not a shred, that he disclosed his payments," Cummings said Thursday. In a statement, Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner said the Defense Department "was fully aware of the trip," citing his previous statements that his client briefed DIA officials before and after the RT trip. Kelner also pointed to a letter, released in redacted form by Cummings, that notes that Flynn provided a thumb drive to the agency containing documents detailing the RT event, including that Leading Authorities, a speakers bureau that handled Flynn's paid speeches, was handling the event for him. Kelner's statement did not address other payments Flynn received from foreign sources. Flynn has previously disclosed he got between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his personal stake in $530,000 that his company, Flynn Intel Group, received for consulting work last year for a Turkish businessman. Last month Flynn's firm filed as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for its consulting work and acknowledged the work may have benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn's client, Inovo BV, is owned by a businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In comments to the AP, Utah Republican Chaffetz, chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said that Flynn "had an obligation to seek approval to take money from a foreign government. We found no evidence that he did that." Chaffetz's office released a letter he sent on Thursday to the Army, asking the service's acting secretary to make a final determination as to whether Flynn violated federal law by accepting the payments, and if so, to start the process of recovering that money. Chaffetz also asked the Army to say why it hasn't yet made a determination as to the legality of Flynn's payments from RT given that they have been widely reported for at least two years. He also wants the Army to disclose any other investigations it's launched since 2010 into similar legal violations. The committee's inquiry is one of several congressional investigations into Flynn's contacts with foreign officials. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to inform senior administration officials about his contacts with Russian officials — contacts that are being examined as part of the wider inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Thursday, 18 House Democrats on the oversight committee signed a letter calling on Chaffetz to do more to pressure the White House to release documents regarding Flynn. "There is obviously a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow," the Democrats wrote in the letter. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer rebuffed criticism from Cummings that the White House was covering up. Asked about Trump administration vetting, Spicer appeared to shift blame onto the Obama administration, which had fired Flynn as head of the DIA. "Why would you re-run a background check on someone who is the head of the Department of Defense Intelligence Agency that had and did maintain a high-level security clearance?" Spicer asked. He noted that Flynn's security clearance was renewed during the Obama administration "with all of the information that's being discussed that occurred in 2015." The White House recently told the committee that documents the lawmakers sought would not be turned over because they contained classified information or were not relevant to the committee's investigation. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

His latest event was London Business School Africa Business Summit where he spoke on Saturday, 22 April, 2017 about entrepreneurship, and creating opportunities and solutions that meet Africa’s most pressing needs. The summit attracted speakers including Bob Collymore – CEO of Safaricom, the largest telecom operator and mobile money bank in Kenya; Dr. Oba Otudeko – Chairman of Honeywell Group; Segun Agbaje – CEO of Guaranty Trust Bank Plc.; and Jay Ireland – President & CEO of GE Africa. Before this, Williams had spoken at the Said Business School, Oxford on 11 April; Harvard University, Boston on 1 April; and delivered Keynote Addresses at the Face Africa Wash Gala, New York on 25 March and Columbia University, New York on 1 April. “Critical tensions are best,” he said at Harvard. “They present the best opportunities. Ideas born to solve problems have higher chances to succeed. And that’s the model we’ve always adopted for all our work. So when we came up with The Future Awards Africa, it was at a time when Nigeria’s youth mirrored a discontent across the continent that led to loss of hope and identity. The awards created a massive pop culture platform that revived the hope of Africa’s citizens and built an inspiring new narrative of young leaders. “There are too many problems in countries in Africa for anyone to be waiting for someone to describe the opportunities that exist at home. The country you are in was built by people who reached into their soul, responded to the call of necessity and invented the future.” His tour continues this week. He is a guest at Yale University’s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs on Wednesday, 26 April where he will be speaking about nation-building and Africa’s electoral future. “A political communications company that has worked on 3 ground breaking presidential campaigns as a communications strategist including President Buhari’s 2015 campaign in Nigeria and President Akufo-Addo in Ghana, which successfully defeated heavily favoured incumbent presidents,” the Institute notes. “Adebola is behind numerous African presidents’ successful election campaigns. He is revolutionizing campaigning in Africa and he will share a wealth of knowledge with us over what promises to be an informative and entertaining evening. Eddie Mandhry, who leads Yale’s Africa Initiative, will moderate the discussion. Students will have an opportunity to engage with Adebola throughout and learn from his vast experience.” Williams will end this phase of his tour with a panel at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business’ Emerging Markets Summit on 29 April, 2017.

Last month Flynn's firm filed as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for its consulting work and acknowledged the work may have benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn's client, Inovo BV, is owned by a businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In comments to the AP, Utah Republican Chaffetz, chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said that Flynn "had an obligation to seek approval to take money from a foreign government. We found no evidence that he did that." Chaffetz's office released a letter he sent on Thursday to the Army, asking the service's acting secretary to make a final determination as to whether Flynn violated federal law by accepting the payments, and if so, to start the process of recovering that money. Chaffetz also asked the Army to say why it hasn't yet made a determination as to the legality of Flynn's payments from RT given that they have been widely reported for at least two years. He also wants the Army to disclose any other investigations it's launched since 2010 into similar legal violations. The committee's inquiry is one of several congressional investigations into Flynn's contacts with foreign officials. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to inform senior administration officials about his contacts with Russian officials - contacts that are being examined as part of the wider inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Thursday, 18 House Democrats on the oversight committee signed a letter calling on Chaffetz to do more to pressure the White House to release documents regarding Flynn. "There is obviously a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow," the Democrats wrote in the letter. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer rebuffed criticism from Cummings that the White House was covering up. Asked about Trump administration vetting, Spicer appeared to shift blame onto the Obama administration, which had fired Flynn as head of the DIA. "Why would you re-run a background check on someone who is the head of the Department of Defense Intelligence Agency that had and did maintain a high-level security clearance?" Spicer asked. He noted that Flynn's security clearance was renewed during the Obama administration "with all of the information that's being discussed that occurred in 2015." The White House recently told the committee that documents the lawmakers sought would not be turned over because they contained classified information or were not relevant to the committee's investigation. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

Our Early Verdict The Dell Latitude 12 7202 might have an old processor, but a deep discount scheme combined with a plethora of accessories and parts mean that this rugged tablet is well and truly a bargain. For Very solidly built Great value for money Against Old processor Small SSD Warms up more than expected under load The Dell Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet is not your standard slate – the device is targeted at those who usually slave away on an oil exploration project or work in the Amazonian tropical rainforest (as a biologist maybe). It is designed to be dropped, bashed about, and generally undergo all sorts of treatment that would pretty much be guaranteed to destroy any consumer-grade tablet. As such, this is no ordinary slate and shouldn’t carry the same expectations as your average model. That’s also probably why Dell has yet to release a new version – this one has been around for nearly two years and is still being sold despite having a Broadwell-based processor. Longer product cycles ensure that platforms mature slowly, especially as the capital investments involved are often an order of magnitude bigger compared to the consumer market. To say that this is a solid tablet would be a massive understatement; it has been designed and manufactured to withstand extreme conditions. It has IP65, MIL-STD-810G and IP-810G certifications (rather than merely meeting the standards in laboratory tests), and these prove that the Latitude 12 7202 has a thick skin and should give other rugged tablets like the Xplore R12 (iX125 R1) or the Getac RX10 a run for their money. At 312 x 203 x 24mm, it is fairly large for a tablet with an 11.6-inch display, while its weight – 1.79kg with two 2-cell 26Whr hot-swappable batteries – puts it in the ‘mildly-transportable’ category (as opposed to easily portable). You can only operate this device at arm’s length for only a short time before experiencing muscular discomfort (although your mileage may well vary). The Latitude 12 is built mostly to withstand harsh environments, not win design contests, which explains a lot of pragmatic/functional decisions made by Dell. There are massive rubber bumpers on the corners and the rubber enclosure itself is a couple of centimetres thick in order to protect the screen, arguably the most fragile component. The latter is also protected by the use of Gorilla Glass 3 technology in its construction. Look around the tablet and you will find that most ports are covered with rubber flaps to prevent damage. Opening and closing them will be an issue if you wear gloves and it is worth noting that they can’t be locked. Dell also used a patented HZO liquid protection technology to stop water from killing your tech. Default ports include USB 3.0, micro-serial port, mini-HDMI, microSD card reader, an audio combo connector and the power connector, which can be used with other compatible 45W Dell laptop power adaptors (like the one on the 2015 edition of Dell’s XPS 13). Given the varied markets the Latitude 12 is expected to operate in, the tablet has an extensive range of connectors as well, including POGO-pin ports for a docking keyboard and a modular expansion pack. A FIPS 201-certified smart card reader (with a nifty unit conversion cheat card), a fingerprint reader with TPM (v1.2), Bluetooth 4.0, Dual RF pass-through (Wi-Fi and mobile broadband), NFC, a 4G/LTE modem and 802.11ac Wi-Fi complete the list of connectivity options. Note also the presence of air vents to cool the device. Even if that sounds counterintuitive given the rugged nature of this tablet, these slits doesn’t prevent it from being reasonably water-resistant. Dell uses a proprietary fan-based thermal management system that combines both passive and active cooling to keep the slate cool. During our hands-on time with the device, the fan did work for reasonably long spells and we noticed that the tablet warmed up significantly, especially under load. As expected, all the physical buttons (power, Windows, volume up/down, three programmable buttons and auto-rotate) require far more pressure to register than traditional tablets out there. Not only does that prevent accidental inputs, it also makes them easier to work with gloves. We further appreciated the fact that pressing the buttons causes the device to buzz and vibrate, so you know they’ve been pressed. The tethered stylus slots nicely in the body of the tablet. It’s not as stylish as the active models, but at least you don’t have to charge it regularly and the pen will work regardless of the immediate environment. At the heart of the Dell Latitude 12 7202 is the Broadwell-based Intel Core M-5Y71 CPU, a dual-core processor with a tiny 4.5W TDP and a base clock speed of 1.2GHz. It can overclock to 2.5GHz and down-clock to 800Mhz. The graphics subsystem is Intel’s HD Graphics 5300. Our sample came with 8GB of dual-channel LPDDR3 1600MHz memory and a 128GB SSD (an M.2 2280 model from Lite-On) which was half full. There are two cameras with the front one sporting an interesting flap that allows the user to physically obstruct the lens. The display, a glove-capable 11.6-inch 10-point multi-touch resistive screen, has a 1366 x 768 pixel resolution which is low, but this can be explained by the fact that, in the markets targeted by the Latitude 12, accuracy and battery life are far more important than the need to cram in as many pixels as possible. The screen is not as bright as one would expect, although it does a decent job outside thanks to its matte finish. The tablet runs Windows 10 Pro and carries Dell’s solid three-year ProSupport and Next Business Day On-Site Service as default. Oddly, while Dell included a full array of its own applications (Data Protection, Backup and Recovery, Rugged Control Center etc), there were also a couple of surprising additions like Deezer and Candy Crush Soda Saga; hardly enterprise-grade applications. In use, the older Broadwell processor posted a decent score in our benchmark testing, although one can only wonder what a Kaby Lake upgrade might bring to the tablet (for a hint, check out the Xplore R12 which boasts a far faster Core i7-7500U Kaby Lake CPU). The storage could also use an upgrade from a 128GB SSD. The limited capacity and lack of free space could explain why the Lite-On drive performs poorly on CrystalDiskMark and Atto in write tests (as opposed to read). As for the battery life, the Latitude 12 7202 managed 4 hours 26 minutes with 27% battery left on our standard test (streaming a YouTube count-up video with brightness set to 50%). Extrapolating that number, one can expect the tablet to last just over six hours. Early verdict Dell sells the Latitude 12 7202 with two batteries for £1,599 (around $2,040, AU$2,700) excluding VAT and delivery. Options worth mentioning include a self-encrypted drive, a desktop dock, kickstand, keyboard cover with a kickstand, an extended IO module and a scanner module. Compared to the competition, this is almost a bargain although we suspect that Dell is currently doing a bit of a clear-out – the device carries an official SRP of £2,284 (around $2,920, AU$3,860). There are some issues here, as we’ve discussed – like a small SSD and an older-generation CPU – but these flaws can’t distract from the value proposition represented by this tablet at the current price.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Technology Data storage: Solid state drives can now compete with hard disk drives Data storage: Solid state drives can now compete with hard disk drives Most enterprise devices—new generation laptops have started migrating—still use HDDs, despite faster and efficient solid-state drives (SSD) in existence for close to two decades now. Published: May 1, 2017 4:03 AM Most enterprise devices—new generation laptops have started migrating—still use HDDs, despite faster and efficient solid-state drives (SSD) in existence for close to two decades now. Ishaan Gupta One of the important nodes of computing has been storage. Through the transition in the modes of computing from DOS to Pentiums and Kabylake processors over the years, the storage device has remained static or held fort. IBM introduced the hard disc drive—HDD—in the year 1956 at just 3.75MB at that point of time. Although the technology encapsulating HDDs has changed a lot since then, the drives have been the first choice for both home users and enterprise customers. In fact, most enterprise devices—new generation laptops have started migrating—still use HDDs, despite faster and efficient solid-state drives (SSD) in existence for close to two decades now. Teradata, a data management and solutions provider, is all set to upend the HDD business. The Dayton-based company last month announced the launch of an all-SSD enterprise server, Intelliflex 2. It claims that with the cost of SSDs now matching that of HDDs, it is possible to create more efficient and quieter solutions for users . The server, no doubt faster than the HDD counterpart, had 3.5 times the storage and 7.5 times the performance for computer analytics. More important, it could do all this with a reduced carbon footprint. “We specifically designed IntelliFlex to meet these demands inexhaustibly. By transitioning to all-SSDs, we now provide an all-memory appliance capable of delivering up to seven times the compute power per cabinet of our previous product, plus rapid performance elasticity that is simply unmatched in our market,” said Oliver Ratzesberger, executive vice president and chief product officer at Teradata. Does that mean the death knell for HDDs as we know them? Hard or solid-state Not many wonder or care where the data comes from, but there is a lot of difference, besides the price, between HDD and SSD . In the simplest terms, if you hear a screechy noise coming from your system, those are hard-drives for you. HDDs record data on one or more rotating disks using a magnetic arm. The drive can store and retrieve data in any order—this is what creates a problem when the drive is overloaded. On the other hand, SSDs are faster as they have no mechanical components and store data using integrated circuits, which makes them quieter and less prone to damage. The SSD has a storage advantage over HDD as the capacity of HDD is 12TB whereas the SSD has a capacity of 60TB. But , despite SSDs being faster, smaller and efficient—they have been losing out to HDD due to the price tag. Teradata feels even that advantage is waning. The company says that SSDs have reached a crossover point in terms of protected data, ie, the amount (in US dollars) one shells out per protected terabyte of data is about the same for both drives. But for consumers, there is still a lot of difference, with SSDs being the expensive option. Writing off HDDs SSDs are looking at ungodly innovations in the coming years. Intel seems to have made a new breakthrough in non-volatile memory—used for secondary or persistent storage—which can incorporate more data at a faster speed than current HDDs. More important, it allows overwriting, but that again is an expensive proposition and would take some time before it hits the market. Notwithstanding the differences, HDDs may not be easy to write off as there is some innovation happening within the HDD space as well, aimed at increasing the longevity of these drives and maintaining their cost advantage. Marriage of convenience But even if SSDs do beat HDDs on price, there is yet another category which is often ignored. SSHD—an amalgamation of both technologies—is also gaining ground given the fact that it provides the best of both worlds. Although SSDs are faster, where they lose out is the life cycle, which gets shorter as more calculations are done by the system. In that sense, SSHDs offer an alternative where a little compromise on computing power can offer better lifecycle coverage and at a better price point. In the technological world, it is not prudent to write off anything too soon. Microsoft and others had announced the death of SSDs five years ago, but the technology has taken off since then. It would be a grave mistake to do the same for HDDs at this juncture. As Sunil Jose, MD, Teradata India, says: “This latest innovative update in our flagship IntelliFlex platform will provide a massive boost in compute performance, data capacity and energy efficiency helping businesses gain maximum output with a significant increase in their existing data processing capabilities.” Well, while Teradata, may find takers for its faster server, whether that would be the start of a revolution is something that time shall decide. However, I do agree with Jose on one point: Data is growing faster than ever before and with this exponential growth, businesses across industry verticals have recognised the need for high-end performance solutions. The writer was in Nice at the invitation of Teradata. No Comments.

Choose the best individual tool for every purpose. Call it the Swiss Army knife fallacy. A Swiss Army knife modestly serves many basic functions. However, you wouldn't use its best blade for preparing a full meal, open a bottle of wine if a better corkscrew was at hand or use those tiny scissors to cut a dress pattern. Apple runs a series of impressive advertisements of glorious photos shot with one of its phones. With some expertise, you can capture a beautiful scene with the camera built into your phone. For most people that camera serves splendidly for kids and pets or even a fleeting memory of the Grand Canyon. It rarely permits the perfection of a dedicated semi-professional camera or the latitude of lighting conditions and depths of field provided by even an automated semi-pro camera. Pixels alone don't tell the whole story. Similarly, in my radio work, musicians send me recordings made on their phones that are rarely broadcast quality. The analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters built into a phone usually are the least expensive available. When was the last time you saw audio quality specifications listed for a phone? Furthermore, the phone microphones are like phone lenses. They are a compromise. You can purchase a $200 digital recording device with circuitry and microphones far superior to any phone. Once again, your phone may serve to capture your child's or grandchild's eighth-grade orchestra recital, but if you're serious about music, the sound quality will eventually disappoint or possibly annoy you. Admittedly, we live in world of YouTube videos without boundaries, where any and everything is acceptable. Who really cares if that cat video is properly focused? Sadly, wise specialty shops, whether old-fashioned camera stores or audio specialty shops, especially ones that feature quality recording gear, are few and far between. Most people buy gear on the internet. Then if you are serious about using a high-quality camera, seek out local experts, such as emeritus News-Gazette photo editor Darrell Hoemann to teach you how to make the most of it. Parkland College offered a music recording class in 2015, but its website fails to indicate whether that course continues. In the best of all possible worlds, smartphone manufacturers would put less effort into cameras and more effort into better telephones. The cellphone providers finally are improving call transmission quality, but the new standards must be built into every phone before you'll hear a difference. Similarly, manufacturers care more about styling and appearance than the effectiveness of the antennas built into phones. After all, a smartphone is nothing but an expensive, specialized radio. Many critics berate manufacturers for designing phones with glass backs, which are more breakable than metal. Yet, a glass back allows a better antenna design since glass does not block radio signals. Complicating matters further, antennas in your phone must serve different radio frequencies for cellular, WiFi and Bluetooth. Here is a final thought about constantly improving technology. Once upon a time, I craved the latest, fastest, most advanced PC. Every two years, I upgraded my multiple desktop computers. About three years ago, I realized that technology plateaued for the work I do. That generation of Intel CPUs and the random access memory (RAM) chips accompanying them accomplished every task as rapidly as I desired. Intel and AMD keep churning out new "improved" CPUs mated to ever faster RAM. Yet, unless you calculate massive spreadsheets, professionally use Photoshop or perform video editing and special effects, there is little to gain from the latest generation of chips. Manufacturers lament the plummeting sales of desktop computers, but it's akin to owning a Ferrari. While it's nice to know you can accelerate from 0-60 in 2.9 seconds and reach a top speed of about 220 mph, where in the real world can you benefit from and enjoy it?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Trees are Nature’s Technology THE PLAINS, Va., Apr. 27 /CSRwire/ – Trees and the health of the Earth are intricately bound.  There is no better time than the week between Earth Day and Arbor Day to highlight both the significance and potential of that connection.  Forests are the technology that can heal the Earth. They can reverse the current course and achieve the scale necessary. This is the mission of GreenTrees. GreenTrees is the largest private carbon „reforestation project in the United States. In 2003, the company laid its ambitious goal of reforesting one million acres in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV) — America’s Amazon. The company was born from passion and commitment by the founding partners to achieving restoration on a scale and in a way that will create landscape change in sequestering carbon, purifying water and creating biodiversity habitat. According to the IPCC, one-third of all carbon emissions since 1750 have come from land use change, primarily deforestation in favor agriculture and urban development.  Reforestation unleashed in a programmatic and concentrated fashion is a technology that can scale and help to bend the climate curve. Today, GreenTrees and its 450+ landowner partners have reforested 120,000 acres of marginal farmland in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. By reforesting land, verifying and selling high quality carbon credits, and cycling carbon revenue through its landowner equity model, GreenTrees is harnessing the power of the capital economy to fuel conservation on scale. GreenTrees takes a river system approach to restoration and conservation.  Water, and rivers are at the center of natural and human civilization and health.  $100 billion in commerce moves along the Mississippi River each year.  It is the flyway for sixty percent of all birds in North America.  Forty-one percent of the US drains into the Mississippi River.  Planting forests along the Mississippi River amplifies the positive impact the trees have and supports  critical global infrastructure. GreenTrees partners with landowners to reforest lands. The faster the trees grow, the faster landowners earn a Climate Dividend. Utilizing our cottonwood hardwood interplanting, the landowner can grow a bottomland hardwood forest much faster. You see, when we developed our planting approach, we looked to nature as our guide. What we did was mimic what nature would do on her own over many years by compressing time and space. Our reforestation design has processing power. Think of our design as the Intel Chip for Reforestation of Bottomland Hardwoods. We can grow a hardwood forest 8 times faster than any other design. And the benefits are amazing. The cottonwoods act as a nurse tree that helps to shade the grown of weed competition and provide the dappled sunlight that hardwoods prefer. This in turn, helps to speed up the growth of the hardwoods. Over time, the cottonwoods are thinned out to release the hardwoods as the reach towards the new found sunlight. In this design, we are also architecting and optimizing multiple layers of income for the landowner  — carbon, water, timber, wetland and wildlife. We are following Nature’s genius.  In fact, the National Academy of Science studied all the technologies in labs or commercial development and deemed tree planting as the most scalable, lowest risk solution to combating climate change. Yes Trees are a technology! You see there is a genius to nature. Nature is not something to be tamed or thwarted as in the past. Nature is a source of wonder, inspiration for the marketplace and solution to our pressing problems of today. The point is Nature can be our guide. Two years ago, we commissioned SCS Global Services to do find out if reforestation and forestry was done on scale what impact would it deliver. The answer was stunning. Reforestation and forestry on scale can would sequester 5.5 gigatons per year and would lower the Global Mean Temperature by 0.2 degrees Celsius. What that means is reforestation is a scalable technology than can meet a scaled problem. Jim Rogers, former Chairman and CEO of Duke Energy, an investor in GreenTrees, once told Chandler Van Voorhis, co-founder of GreenTrees, —- there are two forms of IP —- 1) technological IP and 2) how you bring it to scale. Most technologies fail because they do not know how to bring something to scale. Reforestation is a technology that can be deployed on scale now and around the world. By planting forests we are building equity in tomorrow’s world.  Utilizing our landowner equity model, planting design and river system approach, GreenTrees aims to not only reforest 1 million acres in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley but also to take this approach to other river systems in both the US and around the world.   It is through partners like Natural Capital that we are working to “put a dent in the universe.” As the old Chinese Proverb says, “the best time to plant a tree was 20 years, the second best time is now.” CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Corporate Volunteering Grows as Key Driver of Workplace Culture Next PostNext 2017 Green Transition Scoreboard® Tracks Private Green Investments At $8.1 Trillion Search Recent Posts 京畿道、DMZ(非武装地帯)半々写真コンテスト開催 京畿道、DMZ(非武装地帯)半々写真コンテスト開催 GOLFZON的VISION高尔夫模拟器被选为美权威高尔夫杂志《高尔夫大师》Editors’ Choice ゴルフゾンのゴルフシミュレーター『GOLFZON VISION』、米誌ゴルフダイジェスト「エディターズ・チョイス」に選定 NZ dollar near 10-month low Proudly powered by WordPress

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR HTC Vive will get a $220 plug-and-play eye-tracking aGlass device in May Joe Durbin, UploadVR@UploadVR April 30, 2017 3:34 AM Image Credit: HTC Eye tracking is one feature that could could benefit the performance and affordability of high-end virtual reality headsets. The HTC Vive should become the first mainstream headset to put that theory to the test. A Chinese startup known as 7invensun (pronounced seven-in-ven-sun) is announcing it will be releasing  a new eye tracking module for the Vive next month. The module is called the aGlass and it will be available for “limited pre-order sales” next month, according to HTC. The company is referring to this first roll-out as a developer kit, but preorders are open to anyone. According to HTC, the system will cost about $220 and will release first in China next month before rolling out towards Q3 in the west. Unlike other eye tracking solutions that require hardware to be installed at the manufacturer level, the 7invensun devices are modular in nature. The thin plastic overlays can be placed manually inside the Vive headset by the average VR user, according to the company. The eye trackers are designed to be wired directly to the headset over USB. Two separate USB chords are connected to each of the aGlass devices. The two chords are then joined by a USB combiner and fed into the Vive’s single port. The aGlass consists of two separate trackers built specifically to fit alongside the lenses of the Vive. Each tracker has a halo of IR lights combined with sensors that can track the movements of each of your eyes and eyelids. It is said to support customized lenses depending on the specific vision concerns of the individual customer. This type of tech can have a variety of use cases but the most immediate is foveated rendering. Foveated rendering is a process that combines eye tracking and software to adjust the way a VR experience is rendered in real time. With foveated rendering, the PC running your Vive only has to render the greatest detail in the small area on which your eyes are directly focused. This dramatically lowers the cost of the hardware required to successfully show a convincing VR experience. According to 7invensun spokespeople, this tech could allow Vive to run on older generation graphics hardware. Currently, VR demands graphics cards and CPUs that are among the most powerful that the various manufacturers can provide. With foveated rendering, however, users can lower the workload demanded by their Vives and run VR on older, cheaper hardware from NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, etc. The aGlass comes with custom software allowing you to manually apply foveated rendering to any HTC Vive experience and the amount of the effect being applied. In a demonstration, we saw the device running with NVIDIA’s VR Funhouse experience with a performance jump from 45 frames-per-second to 90 with the foveated rendering applied. This functionality will only be available with NVIDIA graphics cards at first, according to the company. According to a spokesperson for Vive, the release of aGlass ties into the team’s stated goal for 2017 which is to “expand the ecosystem” for the headset by providing cutting edge peripherals like this, the TPCast wireless VR system and the Vive Tracker. To that end, Vive is officially referring to the aGlass system as an “upgrade kit” for the Vive. 7invensun is a member of the Vive X accelerator’s second class. This is Vive’s in-house startup incubator that previously gave rise to TPCast and other VR-specific startups. The aGlass will only work with the Vive upon release. HTC emphasizes that they are not making that a requirement for 7invensun, which has full freedom to develop this hardware for other headsets in the future.

Krishnan April 30, 2017 15:00 IST Updated: April 29, 2017 14:40 IST Share Article PRINT A A A Barry O’Driscoll   Madhuvanti S. Krishnan April 30, 2017 15:00 IST Updated: April 29, 2017 14:40 IST more-in With its stay-back visa option, Ireland offers a conducive environment for higher study Following the 2016 referendum vote to pull out of the European Union (EU), the U.K. government started the withdrawal process in March, this year. This spells a sea change in Ireland’s education scenario and the opportunities available for students. Barry O’Driscoll, senior education advisor, Education in Ireland, admits how, since the Brexit referendum, higher education institutions in Ireland have witnessed a notable increase in enquiries and applications from international students, outside the European Union. “They know that there is certainty with Ireland,” explained Barry. “Our membership of the EU has played an integral role in building Ireland’s reputation as a location for world-class research and as a centre of excellence in higher education. All of Ireland’s universities are ranked in the top 5% globally, and in many fields of research, rank in the top one per cent, globally. Ireland’s place in the EU will ensure that Irish higher education institutions continue to access valuable EU funding so that Ireland remains at the forefront of research and innovation,” he affirmed. Many of Ireland’s higher education institutions offer merit-based scholarships. In this regard, Barry said that many of the national educational fairs gave parents and students a chance to discuss this further with admissions staff. “In terms of post-study work opportunities, over a thousand technology companies, half of the world’s financial institutions, nine out of 10 global pharmaceutical corporations and 17 out of the top 25 medical device companies are based in Ireland,” he added. Work opportunities The primary focus of most students who go abroad to purse higher education is an employment offer post-graduation, in the foreign land, in order to gain exposure and experience. The 24-month stay-back visa option plays an instrumental role in facilitating this for students who have been studying in Ireland. “This allows graduates at the master’s and Ph.D level the chance to remain in Ireland for 24 months after their studies to seek employment. Currently, Ireland has skill shortage in particular areas such as software engineering, mechanical engineering, biomedical sciences, data analytics, fintech and international finance. Highly skilled international graduates are well-placed to take advantage of opportunities in areas such as these,” elaborated Barry. “At Education in Ireland, we say that Ireland offers the ‘warmest of welcomes’ to international students. We believe that while other countries are becoming more restrictive to international students, our recently announced extension to our stay-back option amply demonstrates that we are an open and welcoming society,” elucidated Barry. “Given Ireland’s location as an English-speaking island in Western Europe, we could be described as a gateway between Europe and the United States. Many of the programmes offered by our higher education institutions offer internships. That many Indian students have gone on to secure positions with leading companies such as Intel, Ernst and Young, IBM, Hewlett Packard and Procter and Gamble, bears ample testimony to our welcoming culture.” Prominence Souvik Roy from Kolkata, who is pursuing his master’s in electronic engineering from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM), concurred. He explained how, much like his peers from around the globe who were applying to universities abroad, he too was confused as finding the right college and course, especially abroad, could be arduous. “There is also the stereotype that a degree abroad means the U.S., the U.K. or Germany!” he said. “While all these countries must have great education systems, colleges in Ireland have some of the best programmes. The environment is perfectly conducive for studies,” he added. He admitted that Brexit did bring a lot more prominence to Ireland as, other than the U.K, Ireland is the only country that speaks English in Europe, which is a great deal for companies, more so because Ireland is with EU. “I have seen a lot of freshers struggling to find a job here, but experienced professionals like me who take a career break and come here to study have a greater chance of grabbing jobs.” In the light of the rise in hate crimes in the U.S, students are increasingly wary about safety concerns involved in studying abroad. Ireland receives approval in this area as well. “As an international student, one of the primary concerns is safety and security in a foreign land. Ireland is a peaceful country with almost zero hate crimes,” said Roy. Kiran Varman Srinivasan, who is pursuing his B.Sc Aircraft Maintenance and Airworthiness Engineering at University of Limerick (UL), echoed this view. “I chose to study in Ireland as it is one of the friendliest and safest countries in the world. What’s more, it is investing a lot in its education system and offers many internationally-recognised qualifications.” Post a Comment More In Education study abroad education Related Articles << Previous Story Strains of revolt Next Story >> Please Wait while comments are loading...

Having proposed a huge reform agenda, some have been left disappointed by Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office. Nevertheless, recent polling data suggests that a majority of Americans believe Trump is making good on his words. Here are Donald Trump’s successes since he took office in January: Supreme Court Nominee Donald Trump kept his promise to nominate a conservative judge to the supreme court, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year. Despite opposition from Democrats, on April 7th Neil Gorsuch was confirmed as the 113th justice of the U.S Supreme Court, which could help cement a conservative majority on the SCOTUS for decades. Congratulations to Justice Neil Gorsuch on his elevation to the United States Supreme Court. A great day for America! #SCOTUS pic.twitter.com/8KGFSk8BFj — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 10, 2017 Immigration Trump’s executive order guiding immigration enforcement agencies to apprehend illegal aliens as well as hire thousands of new staff has undoubtedly helped stem the tide of illegal immigration from Mexico into the United States. In the months of January and February alone, illegal border crossings dropped by 40 percent. Furthermore, the Trump administration is cracking down on sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrants. Attorney General Jeff Sessions this week sent a letter to 10 cities failing to comply with federal immigration law, warning that they risk losing federal funding if they continue to do so. As part of the crackdown, the Department of Homeland Security is also publishing a weekly list of localities refusing to cooperate, as well as the crimes committed by illegal aliens within them. However, significant progress on Trump’s key promise to build a wall on the southern border has yet to be made. National Security Due to federal courts blocking Trump’s executive orders suspending Obama’s refugee program and introducing a temporary travel ban from a number of terror-prone countries, making progress on securing America’s borders from potential terror threats has been difficult.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 However, Trump appears to be making good on his promise to “destroy ISIS,” with a significant increase in the number of airstrikes targeting terrorists in the Middle East, North Africa, and Afghanistan. This has been made easier by Trump expanding commanders’ targeting authorities and rolling back restrictions on military strikes put into place by the Obama administration. The Trump administration has also signaled that it is ready to take action against the impending threat of North Korea. As tensions between both countries rise, Trump has positioned “an armada” in the Korean peninsula, while this week military officials began the installment of controversial Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, designed to protect South Korea from incoming missiles. North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2017 Trump also appears to have secured greater support from China in tackling the North Korean problem. Last week, China positioned 150,000 troops along their the North Korean border, as well as sending a fleet of fully-loaded cargo ships destined for North Korea back home. This week, China warned North Korea not to “cross the point of no return” by conducting another nuclear test.

Having met with a range of business leaders, he has received assurances from companies such as Ford and Carrier Corporations to cancel their overseas plans and instead invest in America. Leading technology firms such as Apple, Amazon, Samsung, and Intel have also pledged to create thousands of new jobs in America over the coming years. JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! pic.twitter.com/wAkQMKdPXA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2017 Furthermore, recent economic indicators have been overwhelmingly positive. The economy added nearly 300,000 private sector jobs in the first full month of Trump’s presidency, with the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.5 percent. In March, the Dow Jones industrial average also rose above 21,000 points for the first time in its history. Energy and climate change Trump has taken steps to roll back environmental regulations and revitalize the coal industry. In late March, Trump signed an executive order ending some of Barack Obama’s regulations, declaring that his administration was “putting an end to the war on coal,” a promise made to Americans reliant on the coal industry in rustbelt states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017 In his first White House budget, Trump proposes cutting the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by 31 percent, as well as approving the Keystone XL pipeline previously blocked by Barack Obama. The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, also confirmed that America should “exit” the Paris Climate Agreement signed by Barack Obama last November, although no decisive action has yet been taken. Draining the swamp Trump has made steady inroads in his attempt to “drain the Washington swamp,” introducing a number of policies making it increasingly difficult for lobbyists and bureaucrats to leech off their proximity to power. Some of those policies include Trump signing an executive order cutting two regulations for every new regulation proposed, as well as introducing regulatory watchdogs that dissolve federal agencies’ power as rule makers. Furthermore, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney has warned federal agencies to prepare for massive cuts as part of Trump’s effort to streamline government. They include a 31 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency, a 28 percent cut to the State Department, and a 17.9 percent cut to the Department of Health and Human Services.

War on the media Since assuming the presidency, Trump has escalated his already hostile relationship with the mainstream media. Regularly referring to them as the “fake news media,” he has targeted networks such as ABC, NBC, and CNN for biased reporting, even describing them as the “enemy of the American people.” The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 These assertions are backed up by data. A recent analysis found that 88 percent of mainstream media coverage is anti-Trump. Amid the rising tensions, Trump has confirmed he will not be attending this year’s White House Correspondents Dinner, becoming the first president to do so in 30 years. Diplomacy While in the Oval Office, Trump has held successful meetings with a range of foreign leaders, all of which appear to have been successful. British Prime Minister Theresa May — The pair discussed forging a potential trade deal as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — Trump said that although U.S and Canada’s strong trading relationship would continue, both countries need to “tweak” the current trade settlement. Japenese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — Abe promised that future trade relations between American and Asia must be both “free and fair.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — Trump scrapped decades of U.S. policy urging a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while Netanyahu argued there is “no greater supporter of the Jewish people” than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel — Despite Trump previously describing Merkel’s migrant policy as “catastrophic,” the German Chancellor said that both leaders would “work together hand in hand” to solve global crises. Trump also reminded Merkel that “Nato allies [must] pay their fair share for the cost of defense.” Chinese President Xi Jinping — Trump claimed the pair made “tremendous progress” in improving the relationship between the two countries, adding that he had received assurances China would do more to solve the issue of North Korea. Abortion and Planned Parenthood On the whole, Donald Trump has kept his promise to govern as a pro-life president. Within days of his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the Mexico City Policy, a rule that bans non-governmental organizations (NGOs) receiving U.S. funds – including International Planned Parenthood – from providing or promoting abortions overseas. Trump’s nomination of a pro-life justice to the Supreme Court, as well as tweeting his support for the March for Life, are also positive signs for those protecting the lives of the unborn. The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching — you have my full support! — Donald J.

(Reuters/Brendan McDermid) NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks edged lower on Wall Street on Friday after data showing the U.S. economy grew at its weakest pace in three years in the first quarter gave traders a reason to cash recent gains. Major indexes closed up for April, however, with the Nasdaq up for six consecutive months, the longest streak in nearly four years. Gross domestic product grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate, below the 1.2 percent rise estimated by economists, as consumer spending barely increased and businesses invested less in inventories. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter. “GDP was a little bit light and that may be the cause of some weakness today,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. Citi Research’s gauge on U.S. economic data surprises turned negative for the first time since November. The soft growth data is bad news for the Trump administration after campaign promises to significantly boost growth and adds to concerns among some in the market that lower taxes, deregulation and increased government spending – the main reasons for a post-election rally – will be, at the least, delayed. “We saw the rally fade quite a bit into the last part of the first quarter,” said Bradshaw. “I think you’re going to have to see some [legislation] within the next couple of months, otherwise the market will become disenchanted. So far it’s been all talk, no show.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40.82 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 20,940.51, the S&P 500 lost 4.57 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,384.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.33 points, or 0.02 percent, to 6,047.61. For the week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent, the S&P gained 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq rose 2.3 percent. During April, the Dow gained 1.3 percent, the S&P rose 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent. The Nasdaq was buoyed Friday by gains in Amazon and Google’s parent Alphabet. Amazon rose as much as 3.4 percent to a life high of $949.59, and ended up 0.7 percent at $924.99, while Alphabet gained as much as 5 percent to a record of $935.90 and closed up 3.7 percent at $924.52 after their quarterly results beat estimates. Combined earnings reports and expectations for S&P 500 companies show profits are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While strong earnings have kept the market at or near record levels, persistent geopolitical tensions have weighed on investors’ minds. Intel fell 3.4 percent to $36.15 after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Baidu ended down 4.1 percent at $180.23 after the Chinese internet company forecast second-quarter revenue largely below estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 103 new highs and 44 new lows. About 6.94 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges on Friday, above the 6.55 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

This. I have no problems playing BF4 on 1440@96fps with HIGH settings. And that's on GTX970. Even then sometimes CPU causing slight fps drop while hitting 100% utilization, and not GPU. Can't do much with CPU hitting a performance cap. And yet some tards crying they can't get smooth 1080@60fps on ULTRA settings with 1080GTX.

If game just can bring any video card to knees with ULTRA settings, it doesn't mean gamer have to play on it. Game engine just might not be optimized in first place. Consumers like you spend money every year buying a new GPU, cause game forcing you to buy one to keep frames on modern games with ULTRA settings.

QUOTE] Not sure where you are getting ANY of your information from .... the 1080 TI pushes 60-70 FPS in 4k at Ultra on the Witcher III with one card. W3 is not supported by SLI however. Also the Witcher and Wildlands are by far the most demanding games and neither support SLI. But then look at games like Far cry Primal, Tomb Raider and GTA V and its TI's in SLI are pushing out 90-110FPS. It does suck SLI is not being supported as much but , I think if Volta flagship is 25-30% better than a 1080 TI you will be pushing 90fps-144hz in a litter over 1 year from now. I do try and crank up the settings to all my games, but the Witcher 3 at 4k on medium settings runs at above 100fps. There is nothing saying you have to run every game on ultra at 4k if you buy this monitor .....and furthermore if you are playing Single Player RPGs with Gsync on there really is not much different between 70Hz and 144hz in regards to twitch reflexes which is typically why someone wants a high refresh rate monitor. To argue against this would be like saying since PS4 pro and Xbox Scorpio will do 4k on a TV which at best gets 60Hz is completely worthless to everyone ( PS4 Pro sales number would argue against you).

On the other hand if we are talking about 2016 and onwards games that can barely get past 60FPS at 4k even in SLI this Monitor is completely useless for now because for those games people won't be able to achieve 144 at 4k for now. GTA5 for example barely gets close to 100 with 1080 Ti SLI, Witcher 3 is even worse. So yeah imo for now these 4k 144 monitors are useless because it's hard to achieve 144 @ 4k unless its CSGO, LoL, Dota 2 and the likes. Some of the settings are really taxing for minimal to non existant eye candy to the point you have to print sceen an put both pictures next to eah other to spot it. Anyway that aside 144 hz is not useless a monitor like this if i could aford it .. most likely i would aim to keep it for long long time... plus with gsync even if you game at 50-100 fps in average you have a lot of room for upwards spikes and lower spikes on your fps with out stutters     Venix View Public Profile Find all posts by Venix Page 2 of 2 < 1 2 « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Unity 8 Abandonment, Windows 10 vs. Linux Tests Dominated April Written by Michael Larabel in Phoronix on 30 April 2017 at 04:25 PM EDT. Add A Comment It was another busy month on Phoronix with publishing 31 featured articles/reviews and 285 news items. Here's a look back at what readers found most interesting for April. This month there was the news of Canonical's shift of focus and their abandoning of Unity 8 / convergence / mobile goals. I also ran a number of interesting Linux hardware benchmarks and also provided continued coverage of Linux 4.11 development and early talk about Linux 4.12.

Here were the most-viewed featured articles on Phoronix for April 2017: Windows 10 Creators Update vs. Ubuntu 17.04 Linux Radeon Gaming Performance Given Microsoft's Windows 10 Creators Update earlier this month and the never-ending advancements to the open-source Linux graphics driver stack along with the recent release of Ubuntu 17.04, here are some fresh benchmarks of Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu Linux when running a wide variety of cross-platform games with an AMD Radeon RX 580 and R9 Fury graphics cards. Ubuntu 17.04 Gaming Performance: Budgie vs. GNOME vs. KDE Plasma vs. MATE vs. Unity vs. Xfce One of the immediate requests that usually comes in with each new Ubuntu release is a comparison of the Linux gaming performance when trying out the different desktop options. From yesterday's Ubuntu 17.04 release, here are Steam Linux gaming tests with Budgie, GNOME Shell, KDE Plasma 5, MATE, Unity 7, and Xfce4 when using an AMD Polaris graphics card on the RadeonSI driver stack. AMD Radeon RX 580 Linux OpenGL/Vulkan Benchmarks For those curious if the Radeon RX 580 "Polaris Evolved" graphics card is worthwhile as a Linux gamer, here are the initial Phoronix figures for the RX 580 8GB graphics card that launched yesterday. These initial tests were done with AMDGPU+RadeonSI/RADV under a variety of OpenGL and Vulkan workloads. A Look Back At The Desktop & X.Org/Wayland/Mir Milestones Of Ubuntu With Unity 8 (and Mir) being years behind schedule, Mark Shuttleworth today made the surprise announcement of abandoning Unity 8 and shifting back to GNOME while also stopping their Ubuntu Phone efforts. This was the biggest Ubuntu shock in years and as such I've thrown together today a bit of a tribute or look back at the various desktop milestones of Ubuntu since its first release covered by Phoronix back in 2004. Check it out if you are a relatively new Linux user or just wish to relive the old screenshots of GNOME2, Ubuntu Netbook Remix, Ubuntu TV, the early Unity days, the ambitious Mir plans, and more. Ubuntu 16.10 vs. 17.04 Radeon Graphics Performance If you read enough Phoronix, you know that Mesa and the Linux kernel's DRM graphics drivers continue advancing at a remarkable pace, especially in recent times. Thus if you were an Ubuntu 16.10 user but planning to upgrade to Ubuntu 17.04, here are some benchmark results showing the performance improvements you can expect with the Radeon/AMDGPU DRM and RadeonSI Gallium3D driver. Plus there are also some results when using the Oibaf PPA on Ubuntu 17.04 to show what more performance can be tapped by switching to Mesa 17.1-dev. Unigine Superposition Is A Beautiful Way To Stress Your GPU In 2017, 17-Way Graphics Card Comparison It's already been seven years since Unigine Corp rolled out the Unigine Heaven tech demo and four years since Unigine Valley while in that time while we have seen thousands of Linux game ports emerge, but few can match the visual intensity of these tech demos. In looking to set a new standard for jaw-dropping graphics and preparing to torture current Pascal and Polaris graphics cards as well as future Volta and Vega hardware, Unigine Corp today is releasing Unigine Superposition 1.0. Unigine Superposition is one godly GPU benchmark and is a beauty to watch. AMDGPU-PRO 17.10 vs. Mesa 17.1 RADV/RadeonSI Performance Released at the end of last week was a long-awaited update to the Radeon hybrid Linux driver, AMDGPU-PRO. The AMDGPU-PRO 17.10 update brings support for newer kernel releases so this driver finally deploys nicely on Ubuntu 16.04.2 / 16.10 and also has a number of fixes. Here are some benchmark results of this latest AMDGPU-PRO release compared to the latest open-source Radeon Linux driver stack in the form of the Linux 4.11 kernel and Mesa 17.1-dev with OpenGL and Vulkan benchmarks. AMDGPU vs. Radeon DRM With GCN 1.0/1.1 GPUs On Linux 4.11, Mesa 17.1-dev With the upcoming Linux 4.11 kernel release as well as for the next cycle (Linux 4.12), the Radeon DRM driver remains the default for AMD GCN 1.0/1.1 GPUs while the newer AMDGPU DRM driver continues offering "experimental" support for these earlier generations of GCN GPUs. As it's been a while since our last Radeon vs. AMDGPU GCN 1.0/1.1 benchmarks, here are some fresh tests today with Linux 4.11 Git. NVIDIA 381 Linux Beta vs. Linux 4.11 / Mesa 17.1 Radeon Comparison For those wondering how the bleeding-edge open-source Radeon driver stack is comparing to the latest NVIDIA closed-source binary blob, here are some fresh benchmarks on many different cards. Tested is the new NVIDIA 381.09 binary driver with different Maxwell/Pascal GPUs alongside various AMD GCN card tests using the Linux 4.11 Git kernel and Mesa 17.1-dev Git. Linux 4.11 File-System Tests: EXT4, F2FS, XFS & Btrfs With the Linux 4.11 kernel potentially being released as soon as today, here are some fresh benchmarks of Btrfs / EXT4 / F2FS / XFS on a solid-state drive and comparing the performance of 4.11 Git back to Linux 4.9 and 4.10. And the most-viewed news items: Ubuntu To Abandon Unity 8, Switch Back To GNOME Canonical has announced via Mark Shuttleworth they are ending their development of the Unity 8 desktop environment and will be switching back to GNOME desktop by Ubuntu 18.04. NVIDIA's "Open-Source Guy" Has Left The Company One of the main public-facing figures to NVIDIA's open-source driver efforts has left the company to pursue a new opportunity. Debian 9.0 "Stretch" Might Not Have UEFI Secure Boot Support Debian 9.0 "Stretch" has seen UEFI Secure Boot support no longer being considered a release blocker but is now just a stretch goal for this upcoming release. Mark Shuttleworth Makes More Comments On Ubuntu GNOME, Mir, Convergence By now you have probably read Mark Shutttleworth's Google+ comments from Friday concerning Ubuntu GNOME, including the continuing of Snaps, UBports looking to take over Unity 8, and the desire to move quickly in supporting Ubuntu GNOME. He has now provided more follow-up comments. Qt 5.10 Release Planned For The End Of November, No Qt 5.8.1 Planned Qt 5.9 is moving closer to release so the release schedule planning around Qt 5.10 is now happening. Linux 4.12 Should Be Another Exciting, Featureful Cycle If all goes according to plan, the Linux 4.11 kernel will be officially released this weekend and therefore the Linux 4.12 merge window will immediately open for two weeks. There is a lot on our radar for Linux 4.12. Google Kahlee: The First AMD-Powered Chromebook After years of many Intel and ARM Chromebooks, the first AMD-powered Chromebook appears to be gearing up for release. Debian Issues Statement Over Arrested Russian Developer Debian developer Dmitry Bogatov was arrested by Russian authorities for running a Tor exit node and accused of supporting terrorism. Former Compiz Developer: Free Software Desktop Might Enter A Dark Age With the big shake-up this week at Canonical resulting in abandoning Unity and switching back to GNOME, former Compiz developer and Canonical employee Sam Spilsbury has shared a retrospective on his years of working on Compiz and Unity for Ubuntu. Mark Shuttleworth Reportedly Returning To Role As Canonical CEO There's a big meeting going on today at Canonical regarding changes being made at the company. This follows the dramatic news this week of Ubuntu dropping Unity 8 and switching back to GNOME Shell. There's now information obtained that Mark is planning to reprise the role of CEO.

In the past 100 days, I have kept that promise - and more. Issue by issue, department by department, we are giving the people their country back. After decades of a shrinking middle class, open borders and the mass offshoring of American jobs and wealth, this government is working for the citizens of our country and no one else. Read more Trump on if he may start war with North Korea: 'I don't know' Trump corrected by security adviser on who will protect South Korea Cher accidentally summed up 100 days of Trump in two tweets The same establishment media that concealed these problems - and profited from them - is obviously not going to tell this story. That is why we are taking our message directly to America. We have opened the White House doors to listen, engage and act. We've invited in labor leaders, factory owners, police officers, farmers, veterans and Democrats, Republicans and independents. The change began with the termination of the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a 12-nation pact that would have shipped millions more jobs to other countries. But leaving the TPP was only the beginning. We have also launched an investigation into foreign trading abuses and taken steps to protect the production of American steel and aluminum. After years of federal contracts going to foreign bidders, we are ensuring that government agencies enforce "Buy American" rules and give preference to American companies - and that American companies hire American workers. Crucially, to bring back our jobs, we are going to pursue a complete renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement: We've lost nearly a third of our manufacturing jobs in the 23 years since that terrible deal was approved. Photo: US President Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a "Make America Great Again Rally" in Pennsylvania/ (Alex Wong/Getty Images) At the center of our economic agenda, we've undertaken the most far-reaching effort in history to remove job-killing regulations. I've ordered that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. We've signed a record 13 Congressional Review Act resolutions to scrap job- crushing regulations, and I've signed 29 pieces of legislation in total - a mark not surpassed in the first 100 days since Harry S. Truman. Those newly enacted laws include Veterans' Choice legislation - which became law while at the same time we've increased by 42 percent the number of veterans approved to see the doctor of their choosing. And we've provided transparency by publishing all wait times at the Veterans Affairs health system online, backed up by a new Veterans Affairs Office of Accountability. On energy, the change has been profound. We've canceled restrictions on the production of oil, natural gas and clean coal. What we've accomplished on immigration and criminal enforcement is nothing short of historic. After decades of unending illegal immigration and mass uncontrolled entry, we've turned the tide as never before - illegal border-crossings are down 73 percent. Visa processes are being reformed to substantially improve vetting and screening, and we've launched prototypes and bidding for the border wall to stop the scourge of drugs, human trafficking and illegal immigrants from coming into our country. Federal law enforcement has begun a crackdown on sanctuary cities that harbor criminal aliens - because we know the first duty of government is to protect American citizens. The Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and State, and the director of national intelligence, have formed an inter-agency group for the express purpose of dismantling transnational criminal cartels. The handcuffs have been removed from our prosecutors, and they're targeting the drug dealers and gang members who prey on our citizens - and they're working to eradicate the violent cartel MS-13. President Donald Trump turns to the audience behind him as he finishes speaking at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex and Expo Center in Harrisburg, Pa (AP) The change on defense has been profound as well. The Defense Department has begun to rebuild and restore our military readiness. We've reasserted American leadership by holding the Bashar Assad regime in Syria accountable for its monstrous use of banned chemical weapons against helpless, innocent civilians. Our successful missile strike enforced the red line that the previous administration drew but ignored, thus restoring our credibility with our friends and our deterrence with our foes. Finally, NATO countries are starting to pay billions of dollars more since I have made clear that the United States expects all of its allies to pay their fair share. I delivered on one of my biggest promises, appointing and confirming a new justice to the Supreme Court who will be faithful to the U.S. Constitution. This is the first time a new justice has been confirmed in the first 100 days in 136 years. As we've made these changes - on the border, on our economy, on our security - confidence has soared. And a survey of manufacturing reveals record-breaking optimism in the future. Consumer confidence hit a 16-year high. Thousands of new jobs are being re-shored back to America - including jobs at Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Sprint, Intel and so many more. We are proving that Buy and Hire American isn't just a slogan - it's now the policy of the U.S. government. It, along with the many other things we are doing, will Make America Great Again. No longer will we listen to the same failed voices of the past who brought us nothing but war overseas, poverty at home and the loss of companies, jobs and our wealth to countries that have taken total advantage of the United States. The White House is once again the People's House. And I will do everything in my power to be the People's President - to faithfully, loyally and proudly champion the incredible citizens who love this nation and who call this God-blessed land their home. - - - Trump is the president of the United States.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft may not be the first with a Snapdragon 835 Windows 10 laptop 1 by Surur  @mspoweruser Apr 30, 2017 at 12:00 GMT19 hours ago The first Windows 10 on ARM PCs are expected to hit the market this holiday season, powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor. It is widely expected that Microsoft will be leading the market with their own Surface-branded laptop first before other OEMs weigh in, but according to Digitimes another company may get there first. They report that some upstream suppliers believe the new product would either be from Microsoft or a Lenovo-branded 2 in 1. Lenovo already produces ARM-powered Chromebooks, such as the Lenovo Flex 11, which is a 2-in-1 convertible notebook powered by a 2.1 GHz quad-core ARM processor with a 11.6-inch IPS multi-touch HD display, water-resistant keyboard, USB 3.0, USB Type-C, HDMI, a mic/audio jack, and an SD card slot, delivering up to 10-hour battery life and starting at $279. Because the ARM tablets are expected to run the Cloud version of Windows 10 and would be tied to the Windows Store the PCs are expected to be on the cheaper end of the spectrum such as the Flex 11 above. Digitimes notes that the move would increase pressure on Intel, which has not been able to successfully branch out of the x86 PC and server market, which should mean better prices and increased innovation for Intel users, even if we do not buy into Microsoft’s new ARM-powered ecosystem.

He made the remark while addressing citizens of American, exposing his achievements since he took over from his predecessor, Barack Obama. See his speech bellow: One hundred days ago, I took the oath of office and made a pledge: We are not merely going to transfer political power from one party to another, but instead are going to transfer that power from Washington, D.C., and give it back to the people. In the past 100 days, I have kept that promise — and more. Issue by issue, department by department, we are giving the people their country back. After decades of a shrinking middle class, open borders and the mass offshoring of American jobs and wealth, this government is working for the citizens of our country and no one else. The same establishment media that concealed these problems — and profited from them — is obviously not going to tell this story. That is why we are taking our message directly to America. We have opened the White House doors to listen, engage and act. We’ve invited in labor leaders, factory owners, police officers, farmers, veterans and Democrats, Republicans and independents. The change began with the termination of the Trans- Pacific Partnership— a 12-nation pact that would have shipped millions more jobs to other countries. But leaving the TPP was only the beginning. We have also launched an investigation into foreign trading abuses and taken steps to protect the production of American steel and aluminum. After years of federal contracts going to foreign bidders, we are ensuring that government agencies enforce “Buy American” rules and give preference to American companies — and that American companies hire American workers. Crucially, to bring back our jobs, we are going to pursue a complete renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement: We’ve lost nearly a third of our manufacturing jobs in the 23 years since that terrible deal was approved. At the center of our economic agenda, we’ve undertaken the most far-reaching effort in history to remove job-killing regulations.I ‘ve ordered that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. We’ve signed a record 13 Congressional Review Act resolutions to scrap job-crushing regulations, and I’ve signed 29 pieces of legislation in total — a mark not surpassed in the first 100 days since Harry S. Truman. Those newly enacted laws include Veterans’ Choice legislation — which became law while at the same time we’ve increased by 42 percent the number of veterans approved to see the doctor of their choosing. And we’ve provided transparency by publishing all wait times at the Veterans Affairs health system online, backed up by a new Veterans Affairs Office of Accountability. On energy, the change has been profound. We’ve canceled restrictions on the production of oil, natural gas and clean coal. What we’ve accomplished on immigration and criminal enforcement is nothing short of historic. After decades of unending illegal immigration and mass uncontrolled entry, we’ve turned the tide as never before — illegal border-crossings are down 73 percent. Visa processes are being reformed to substantially improve vetting and screening, and we’ve launched prototypes and bidding for the border wall to stop the scourge of drugs, human trafficking and illegal immigrants from coming into our country. Federal law enforcement has begun a crackdown on sanctuary cities that harbor criminal aliens — because we know the first duty of government is to protect American citizens. The Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and State, and the director of national intelligence, have formed an inter-agency group for the express purpose of dismantling transnational criminal cartels. The handcuffs have been removed from our prosecutors, and they’re targeting the drug dealers and gang members who prey on our citizens — and they’re working to eradicate the violent cartel MS-13. The change on defense has been profound as well. The Defense Department has begun to rebuild and restore our military readiness. We’ve reasserted American leadership by holding the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria accountable for its monstrous use of banned chemical weapons against helpless, innocent civilians. Our successful missile strike enforced the red line that the previous administration drew but ignored, thus restoring our credibility with our friends and our deterrence with our foes. Finally, NATO countries are starting to pay billions of dollars more since I have made clear that the United States expects all of its allies to pay their fair share. I delivered on one of my biggest promises, appointing and confirming a new justice to the Supreme Court who will be faithful to the U.S. Constitution. This is the first time a new justice has been confirmed in the first 100 days in 136 years. As we’ve made these changes — on the border, on our economy, on our security — confidence has soared. And a survey of manufacturing reveals record-breaking optimism in the future. Consumer confidence hit a 16-year high . Thousands of new jobs are being re-shored back to America — including jobs at Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Sprint, Intel and so many more. We are proving that Buy and Hire American isn’t just a slogan — it’s now the policy of the U.S. government. It, along with the many other things we are doing, will Make America Great Again. No longer will we listen to the same failed voices of the past who brought us nothing but war overseas, poverty at home and the loss of companies, jobs and our wealth to countries that have taken total advantage of the United States. The White House is once again the People’s House. And I will do everything in my power to be the People’s President — to faithfully, loyally and proudly champion the incredible citizens who love this nation and who call this God-blessed land their home.
