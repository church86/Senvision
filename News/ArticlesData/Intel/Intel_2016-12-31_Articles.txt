Jon C. Ogg, 24/7 Wall St. 6:33 p.m. EST December 31, 2016 The New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) With 2016 behind us, some investors are looking backward to see what worked and what did not. With a 14% rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) this year, the more important issue to consider is what investors should expect for 2017. The Dow has been within 1% of 20,000 for several days now. What if the Dow actually manages to hit 22,000 in 2017? It may be far more possible than most investors might imagine. 24/7 Wall St. has evaluated many of the preliminary views for key companies and industries ahead. Regardless of which candidate voters favored, it is now very hard to find investors who do not view the markets more favorably and more pro-business with higher growth environment. After all, the 8.5% rally in the Dow since the Nov. 8 election is almost unprecedented and is too large to merely assign as a coincidence or as a relief rally. Investors have bought every major market pullback for about six years now, and the bull market is rapidly approaching eight years old. Investors are looking for value and overlooked growth, and they are even looking for upside in popular names that simply have more upside to run. It turns out that many of the 30 DJIA stocks have a consensus analyst price target from Thomson Reuters that calls for substantial upside in the next 12 months. And then investors get to add in the dividends as well. The pro-growth strategies laid out ahead have been a boom for infrastructure companies tied to all sides of major engineering projects and those that process or mine materials. Then there is a lower-regulation and higher-rate environment driving financials and cyclicals. And of course those companies ready to repatriate over $1 trillion in overseas cash are expected to face a much more reasonable corporate tax environment versus other countries. Before just assuming that Dow 20,000 will come and turn into 22,000, it is important to reflect on some real issues. Rallies of this magnitude are rarely, if ever, followed by a straight line higher. Many investors put off traditional year-end profit taking due to expecting lower capital gain taxes in 2017. Many Dow and S&P stocks are now also valued above or very close to their consensus analyst target prices. Many of the Trump-beneficiary stocks also have rallied to the point that much or all of the good news for 2017 already may have taken place. What if the Federal Reserve raises rates more than expected? Will the political infighting of the past decade continue ahead? Also, and sadly, analysts can simply end up being wrong. And we almost never hear about geopolitical risks right now. All of these are risks to the rally not facing a pullback. 24/7 Wall St. showed a preliminary bull-bear case for the Dow in 2016 at 19,700. The Dow was valued just above 19,200 on Dec. 6 when we first looked at a Dow 20,000+, and the Dow has now hit a high of 19,987 as of Dec. 29. Here are some of the key driving forces that could help the Dow Jones Industrial Average get closer to 22,000 in 2017. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs Group (GS) already has risen to above $240.00 in 2016, and the shares are up 32% just since Nov. 8. Its stock price has passed its $229.00 consensus analyst price target. One reason the Dow has outperformed the S&P 500 since the election is that the Dow’s price-weighted valuation (rather than market cap-weighted for other indexes) is dominated by Goldman Sachs’ 8.3% index weighting, almost three-times the average Dow stock’s weighting. It has accounted for close to one-fourth of the Dow’s post-election gain. 24/7 WALL ST. The Best CEOs of 2016 Some analysts see even more bright skies ahead for Goldman Sachs. Outside of the company landing two top positions in the upcoming administration, HSBC is calling for a $250 target and Deutsche Bank now has a $255 target. If lower regulation allows for more trading, Goldman Sachs’ profit history could dictate even better earnings and far more upside than its paltry 1% dividend yield. Apple Apple Inc. (AAPL) was last seen trading at close to $116, and its 52-week high is just $118.69. Apple’s consensus price target is now up at $132.00 and has climbed slowly higher for months. Apple’s 2% dividend yield could rise handily if the company repatriates its massive overseas cash sum of close to $200 billion, and Apple is valued at only about 11 times next year’s earnings estimate. Credit Suisse just on December 6 reiterated its Outperform rating and $150 price target for Apple with hopes of iPhone 8 super-cycle. Recent reports of the big product being an iPhone 7s in 2017 could jeopardize that, but Apple has the largest cash trove of all companies (by far) and it buys back large amounts of stock. Apple’s 52-week trading range is $89.47 to $118.69, its market cap is $622 billion and its weighting of 4.03% in the Dow is ranked just 10th out of 30 index components. Cisco Systems Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) has recovered to $30.22, and its consensus analyst target is $33.11. It also has close to a 3.4% dividend yield, and the company is a monster when it comes to buying back shares. Cisco shares are valued at 12 times forward earnings. They are still about 10% shy of its 2007 high, and the share price is still less than half of its all-time back in the tech bubble peak in 2000. 24/7 WALL ST. The Best (and Worst) Investments of 2016 The 52-week range here is $22.46 to $31.95, and the market cap is $153 billion. RBC just named it among the top tech picks for 2017 and the firm is calling for a $35 share price for Cisco. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Co. (KO) has been a sleeper, but what if 2017 is the breakout year for the sugar-water giant? Its $41.46 share price is well shy of the consensus price target of $45.75, and the 3.4% dividend yield would imply north of 15% upside. The stock is valued at 20 times expected earnings per share. Despite being more dependent on sugary beverages than rival Pepsi, the reality is that Coca-Cola has been diversifying away from its name brand for years. The stock has been a sleeper for so long, and it mostly has been in a $39 to $44 trading band for the past three years. Coca-Cola still has global expansion opportunities and cost containment opportunities ahead, and it is possible that value investors will begin to focus on what may be a defensive stock with limited downside. Coca-Cola also has raised its dividend for more than 50 years and has a market value of close to $180 billion. Home Depot Home Depot Inc. (HD) has recovered to $134.08 as of December's end, and its consensus price target now has risen to $147. That and its 2% dividend yield would generate upside of over 10%. The stock is valued at 18 times expected earnings for next year. Home Depot ran into some issues after peaking in the summer. But weak consumer and a slowing in housing have now been replaced by a euphoric consumer and expectations for a strong housing market to continue. It seems hard for Home Depot to not participate in this retail and housing upside. Home Depot has a 52-week range of $109.62 to $139.00 and a market cap of $164 billion. Intel Shares of Intel Corp. (INTC) were last seen trading at $36.30, and its consensus price target is now almost $40. Intel’s dividend yield is also close to 3%, and it is valued at less than 13 times 2017 earnings. 24/7 WALL ST. America's 25 Thriving Industries What has occurred is that the personal computer market finally has come back due to gaming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Intel also has expanded well beyond desktops; it is deep in servers and the Internet of Things, and it is even a growing partner for many chip companies now. Intel’s market cap is $174 billion, and it has traded in 52-week range of $27.68 to $38.36. Nike Nike Inc. (NKE) was the worst stock of 2016, down 17% for the year. With shares last seen at nearly $51, the consensus price target is $62, and that implies 20% upside — with lots of room for its mere 1% dividend yield to grow, on top of share buybacks. Nike is the leader in the athletic apparel market and there have been concerns that “athleisure” has peaked. Brands like Under Armour, Adidas and Reebok also want their piece of Nike’s market. What is amazing about all the negativity here is that analysts expect Nike to grow sales to $41 billion in 2019 from about $32 billion in 2016, with earnings growth expected to be about 40% over the same period. What if everyone has been too negative here? Nike’s 52-week trading range is $49.01 to $68.19, and it has a market cap of $85 billion. Pfizer Pfizer Inc. (PFE) was trading at $32.35, and its consensus price target of $37.65 implies upside of 16.4%, even before considering a dividend yield of almost 4%. Pfizer shares are valued at only about 12 times forward earnings. 2016 has been a dud for Pfizer, with a gain of just 4%, versus a 16% gain so far for rival Merck. Pfizer had been torn in long-term efforts, like whether to move or acquire overseas, deciding if the restructuring would lead to a break-up, and deciding whether to sell some assets. There was also the overhang of political pricing pressure on drug prices. While cheap underperforming stocks are that way for a reason, what if Pfizer has become too cheap versus Merck, or what if it releases some unexpected news or makes a great acquisition in 2017? Pfizer’s market cap is $196 billion, and its shares have a 52-week range of $28.25 to $37.39. Procter & Gamble Last seen trading near $84, Procter & Gamble (PG) has a consensus analyst upside of $91.00. This is still almost 10% in implied upside, without even considering its 3% dividend yield. The consumer products giant has restructured and pared down its brands, but it is still valued at 19.5 times forward earnings. Procter & Gamble has raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years now. One issue is that it has faced is harder overseas sales comps due to that strong dollar, and it seems hard to imagine that the company can shrink its brands back into a growth company. Still, this is a company that remains quite friendly to shareholders. Perhaps its endless list of brands should just speak for itself. The 52-week range is $74.46 to $90.33, and its market cap is $225 billion, making the company larger than its top three consumer products peers in the United States combined. UnitedHealth UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) was trading at $160.04, and the consensus price target has lifted to $179 now. This implies upside of 11%, before considering its 1.5% dividend yield. What is amazing about the expected upside is that UnitedHealth shares have risen almost 40% in 2016, and 13% of those gains have come since the election. The largest insurer of them all is valued at about 17 times expected 2017 earnings. Being a health insurer under Obamacare turned out to be fine for UnitedHealth, and now it seems that analysts have little fears around a Trump effort to replace Obamacare. It has vacated most exchange operations and is focused on the group market and other value-added opportunities. How the health insurer ultimately will be treated under a regime in which Obamacare gets dismantled remains to be seen. Still, even the lowest analyst price target would imply a 5% drop and the highest analyst target is $200. UnitedHealth has a market cap of over $150 billion, and its weighting is 5.5% of the Dow’s 30 components. Visa Visa Inc. (V) was last seen at $78.02, and it has a consensus price target of $94.20, for an implied upside of 20%. Its dividend yield of less than 1% could have exponential upside, as it is less than one-fourth of earnings. Visa could be a huge winner from repatriation efforts, and a strong consumer spending environment should allow it to ring the register as it wins each time there are credit card transactions. Visa shares are well off of prior highs, but it is still valued at almost 20 times forward earnings. Many investors think of Visa a financial powerhouse now that it is a newer Dow component, but Visa is actually a platform provider with massive room to boost its weak dividend. Still, every company under the sun seems to want a piece of payment technology, and that has weighed at least some on Visa’s dominance. If analysts are right, then Visa shares have pulled back too far from its 52-week high of $83.96. Its shares are actually down since the election, and they have risen less than 2% so far in 2016. Again, there are many circumstances that have to occur for this recent enthusiasm to last. It would only be prudent to expect that some of the typical year-end profit-taking being delayed into next year might bring some selling early on. And it is possible that the strength of the post-election rally has already borrowed from the 2017 upside. Many analysts are certain to update and issue more formal 2017 targets after the start of the year. The formal bull-bear case for 2017 has to be followed by policy and structural changes in Washington, D.C., and a return to more rapid economic growth. The Dow has risen about 8.5% since November 8 alone, and the year-to-date gains in 2016 have been just over 14%. For a relative value between these Dow stocks and the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 500 was last seen valued at 17.3 times expected 2017 earnings per share and at 18.7 times its 2016 estimated earnings per share. 24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Skylake Iris Pro Graphics: Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Antergos, Clear Linux Benchmarks Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 31 December 2016 at 09:30 AM EST. 4 Comments For those craving some more end-of-year Linux distribution benchmarks, this morning I finished carrying out a fresh Linux distro comparison focusing upon the Intel OpenGL performance when making use of "Skylake" Iris Pro hardware. For this New Year's Eve benchmarking fun was Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Antergos, and Clear Linux. The tested operating system releases were Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 16.10, openSUSE Tumbleweed 20161226, Fedora 25, Antergos Linux 16.11, and Clear Linux 12360. With the Ubuntu 16.10 testing I tested it out-of-the-box with Linux 4.8 and Mesa 12.0 and then again with Linux 4.10 Git and Mesa 13.1 Git for a bleeding-edge development experience. All of the tests were done from the same Intel NUC6i7KYK "Skull Canyon" NUC with a Core i7 6770HQ processor sporting Iris Pro Graphics 580. The same hardware was used throughout, any reported differences in the system table just come down to the OS default and how they are reporting different components. A range of Linux OpenGL games / benchmarks were used for testing, outside of Steam due to the Intel graphics not being the fastest for heavy Steam games among other reasons. With the open-source ET Legacy project remaking Enemy Territory Wolfenstein, at least it's playable with the Iris Pro Graphics 580. The fastest was openSUSE Tumbleweed for this hardware followed by Ubuntu 16.10 with the manual graphics upgrades and then Clear Linux 12360. Barely any difference with OpenArena's frame times. Clear Linux managed a narrow victory with Unigine Heaven. The upgraded Ubuntu 16.10 stack yielded a victory meanwhile for Valley and then Clear Linux was in second. Clear Linux did manage a big victory with Xonotic. Fedora 25 was consistently among the slowest Linux distributions tested in this comparison due to the overhead of XWayland.

Sat 1:00 PM 11,012 Views 70 Comments Share4 Tweet Email The driverless car called Snuber is test driven during a demonstration at the Seoul National University's campus in Seoul. Image: Ahn Young-joon JUST LIKE CREDIT cards, smartphones or search engines, autonomous cars will carry a trove of information about their owners as they make driving more comfortable, raising new concerns about privacy. Automakers are engaged in a fierce race to develop the first driverless car, which experts say should hit the road by 2020. Apart from legal obstacles facing the industry as the technology evolves — such as who is responsible in the event of an accident — a digital battle is being waged over the huge amount of technical data that will be stored in such vehicles. “Data is the new oil,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said last month during a speech at the Los Angeles auto show, AutoMobility LA. “If you have rich data, your car will be able to deal with complex route situations,” Krzanich said. “If not, the car will stop.” Sensors, radars and cameras on autonomous vehicles will be able to exchange data with other cars but also, perhaps, with “intelligent” roadways that can help set speed limits depending on weather and traffic conditions. The passenger behind the wheel, meanwhile, can send emails and text messages, listen to music, stream movies, hold a conference call or make a restaurant reservation. Even homes will be connected to vehicles. Alexa Source: Gene J. Puskar South Korean automaker Hyundai revealed at the auto show a partnership with Amazon’s Alexa voice service to allow customers to start their car, charge their battery or turn on the air conditioner via a quick voice request. Experts say the data stored in these vehicles represents a gold mine for companies. “Where are you, where you stop, how often, what’s in there can be used to provide you a rich user experience,” Krzanich said. “What music you like, craft choices… that’s an opportunity as well.” He said Intel was investing €250 million into self-driving technology over the next two years. Karl Brauer, senior director of industry insights at Kelley Blue Book, said all the data collected will be used by car makers and other companies to maximize profit. “If they know you like to go to Starbucks (they will say) ‘Oh, he always stops at Starbucks,” Brauer said. Krzanich acknowledged that the technology posed great challenges in terms of privacy protection and secure sharing. CJ Frost, an Alexa executive, told a panel that consumers were heading into a world where applications will allow users, for example, to track down friends coming to dinner to ask them to stop on the way and buy a bottle of wine. Security concerns One question on many people’s mind is whether, in a world that could be edging closer to the Big Brother oversight of George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984,” it will be possible to disconnect at some point. “Consumer privacy is an open question,” said Jeremy Carlston, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive. “A smartphone holds a lot of info about the owner but when we provide that info to a service provider, we’re getting value in return,” he added. “It’s the same trade-off with an autonomous car.” Cyber-security was also the topic at a panel discussion during which speakers raised the issue of privacy. “Connected cars have added firewalls against hacking,” Egil Juliussen, director of research at IHS Automotive, told AFP. “Criminals could make the car inoperative and ask money to make it operate again.” In mid-2015, two American online-security researchers demonstrated how easily they could hack into a Jeep Cherokee, remotely taking control of the car’s functions, including its braking system. Krzanich said such challenges “will require the industry coming together and collaborating.” © – AFP 2016 Read: The new driverless Mercedes is mouth-watering, but is it the end of sports cars?

AVC VDENC Video Encoding Enabled For Intel Broxton & Kabylake Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 31 December 2016 at 07:34 AM EST. Add A Comment For those that don't recall, VDENC is a low-power, high-performance video encode engine added originally to Intel Skylake hardware. That aforelinked article covers the big benefits of using VDENC and the patches published earlier this year for enabling this Intel video encode engine on Linux. Patches have now hit VA-API for enabling VDENC on the newer Broxton and Kabylake hardware for supporting MPEG AVC videos. These latest patches are now in the intel-driver VA-API Git code if you are running Kabylake or Broxton hardware and looking for improved AVC video encode performance. It's also dependent upon some updated GuC/HuC patches.

The Best of CES 2016: Where Are They Now? By Eric Griffith December 30, 2016 10 Comments Each year at the Consumer Electronics Show we recognize the top products. Some of them go on to be the best of the year, while others never even make it to market. Here's how last year's winners fared. For 49 years, the Consumer Electronics Show has served to set the technology landscape of the year. Every January, our team of analysts scour 2.4 million square feet in the Las Vegas Convention Center, poking into every corner to determine the products that make it into our annual The Best of CES story. But making it into that story doesn't always mean that the products within make it. Sometimes, the "best" is just a proof of concept. Other times, it just doesn't get the backing needed to go all the way. And occasionally even if it gets out the door, it doesn't live up to that initial hype. But when a product does live up to it, it can be a game changer. Our analysts narrowed the thousands of options at CES down to just 18 top picks last year. Let's check in with all those winners and see just where they stand 12 months later, as we stare down the barrel of the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas next week. Check Out the Best Photos From CES 2016! Best Gaming Laptop Razer Blade Stealth We first fell in love with the Blade Stealth at CES for its top-notch build quality, sharp touch screen with QHD graphics, and stellar keyboard with individually backlit keys. In our review a couple of months after the show, we gave it 4 stars and an Editors' Choice award. That might have been enough for some companies, but Razer whipped out a brand-new Blade Stealth model in October, one upping the first review to get 4.5 stars. The new version has almost exactly the same body and specs, but now features chips from the latest Intel processor family ("Kaby Lake") and even better battery life (adding 2 hours to get to 9 hours, 20 minutes, in our tests). Best Business Laptop HP EliteBook Folio G1 (4K UHD) It would be impossible to look at the svelte HP EliteBook Folio G1 and not think of the Apple MacBook , but with all the attributes a business user needs. The G1 is only 2.36 pounds, has a 4K UHD display, an incredibly thin metal body, and USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 connectors. Plus, it has work-focused features like TPM and Intel vPro. However, what we liked at CES didn't hold up quite as well in testing. In our review, we appreciated those attributes, but also found the G1 wanting when it came to battery life (thanks to that high-end screen) and requiring too many dongles to use its ports. Still a good system, but only worth 3.5 stars. Best Convertible Hybrid Laptop Lenovo Yoga 900S At CES we found the Yoga 900S to be that special kind of hybrid that doesn't feel compromised when you flip it into tablet mode. Marketed as the thinnest convertible at 12.8mm thick with a weight of around 2 pounds, it was love at first sight, even if it lacked some of the power of the Yoga 900. Both use the watchband-inspired hinge (shown above) that allows you to lay the whole unit flat or flip the screen around back for Tablet mode. In our June review, however, we found it was a little too underpowered, with only 4GB or memory, and a little pricey for what it brings. It earned 4 stars, but no Editors' Choice award. Best Tablet Samsung Galaxy TabPro S At CES we were convinced the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S was the perfect answer for those who like the look of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 , but don't want to pay for it. After all, it packs a beautiful 12-inch 2,160-by-1,440 Super AMOLED screen with a Core m3 processor ready to run Windows 10. It even has a USB-C port and fingerprint sign-in. Our follow-up review in March showed that while it is indeed light, slim, and polished, and has a best-in-class battery life and a vivid screen, not all was perfect. The tablet lacks Thunderbolt compatibility on that USB-C port; you'll find no USB-C adapter, no other slots, and no stylus; and the Core m3 prevents the TabPro S from keeping up with other tablets that run on Core m7 and even Core i5 processors. It received a 3.5-star rating. Best Phone Huawei Honor 5X A $199.99 all-metal Android phone with a 5.5-inch screen and a fingerprint sensor on the back? At CES 2016, we pegged this intriguing phone to have such an incredible value it might force American carriers to open up wide to the world of unlocked smartphones on the cheap. It remains the best-looking unlocked phone you can get on a budget. In our review that same month, however, we experienced some performance issues. The result was a solid but unspectacular 3.5-star score. Best Fitness Wearable Fitbit Blaze Fitbit's Blaze was the only fitness tracker among a slew of them that really stood out at CES. Thinner than an Apple Watch or even the Fitbit Surge, the Blaze has a vibrant color touch screen, something seldom seen on fitness trackers today. But in what you may notice is a bit of a pattern, our eventual review couldn't muster more than a 3.5-star rating, since the Blaze isn't waterproof, lacks GPS, and just has an overall awkward design that needs tweaks. It's a solid choice if you're new to tracking, but it's no smartwatch. Best Health Wearable Mio Slice More than just a fitness tracker, the Mio Slice looks after your overall health, focusing on your PAI (Personal Activity Intelligence) score, an algorithm that links your cardiovascular health and heart rate. As long as the PAI on your device is over 100, you could live a good long time—and the Slice is the only Mio device that displays it up front (though other Mio devices like the Fuse and the Link will also support PAI, but only by looking it up in the smartphone app). That said: The Slice never shipped this year as planned in the US. It will reportedly start selling in January 2017 in Japan for 18,400 yen (approximately $157 USD). Best Smart Appliance Samsung Family Hub Refrigerator Samsung sells lots of refrigerator models, and has even sold some unimpressive smart fridges in the past, but at CES our analysts loved the look and the potential of the 22.1-cubic-foot-capacity Family Hub. One of the doors has an integrated 21.5-inch 1080p touch screen that not only can be a family message area, but also provides a unique interface into the contents of the appliance. Whenever the door closes, the Family Hub takes pictures of what's inside for you to annotate on the big screen (above), or access while at the store. Or you can use the screen to do your grocery shopping online. The fridge went on sale last July and prices are dropping from the proposed $6,000 start to well below $3,500 when you shop around at big-box stores. Best Television LG Signature OLED TV No screen wows the eyes more than one with organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, and that's exactly what LG has brought to living rooms in the new Signature television line. At CES we were wowed by the 77-inch 77G6P. A sheet of glass that attaches to a speaker base and small electronic back, the TV measures only 3mm thick. We didn't test the 77-inch Signature, but we did get the 65-inch version 65G6P in April. And it earned one of the few perfect 5-star ratings we handed out in 2016. So imagine that perfection, but bigger, and that's the 77-inch version; it just happens to have a starting price of $19,999, or about 3 times that of the 65-inch. Best Home Theater Gear Dish Network Hopper 3 An unheard-of 16 tuners. That's what you get with the Hopper 3 , Dish Network's first 4K DVR. Not only can you record 16 shows at one time, in Sports Bar mode, you can view up to 4 HD channels simultaneously. We liked the Hopper 3 so much when we tested it in April, we named it our Editors' Choice for DVRs and gave it a perfect 5-star rating. Considering it's available as a free upgrade for qualifying Dish subscribers when coupled with a $15 monthly whole-home DVR fee (the same as the previous Hopper), it's a no-brainer upgrade for future-proofing your Dish service. Best Gaming Gear Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch It took years for the Oculus Rift to get a consumer release, but 2016 was that year. At CES, the Rift, coupled with the Touch motion controllers, were the best looking and most powerful virtual reality headset/controller combo we'd seen. We found that they provided an impressive VR experience when we tested them alongside the HTC Vive, but neither was quite on par with the Sony PlayStation VR. Still, the Rift received a strong 4-star rating and the Touch controllers earned a 4.5-star score. Best Drone Yuneec Typhoon H During CES we pegged the Typhoon H as the (somewhat) affordable alternative to other high-end drones. With the Typhoon H you get six rotors, a rotating 4K video camera, retractable landing gear, and obstacle avoidance provided by Intel RealSense tech. The problem we found in our October review is that the obstacle avoidance (which costs $600 extra) was a hindrance to the typical 30mph speed. In addition, the controller is unwieldy due to its size, and flight time is limited to 19 minutes on a full charge. We gave the Typhoon H 3.5 stars and continue to recommend less-expensive drones like the DJI Phantom 4 . Best Action Camera Nikon KeyMission 360 CES 2016 was full of GoPro clones, but none had the specs of Nikon's entry. The KeyMission 360 has dual lenses to capture all its surroundings in 4K—even if the surroundings are underwater (down to 100 feet). Sadly, our first real chance to test it in December showed that while it wields some other impressive specs (the ability to snap 29-megapixel stills, a Wi-Fi remote control, desktop software for Mac and Windows), it's not really a double for a traditional action camera. Battery life is short, file sizes are enormous, and the 4K is only 24 frames per second (fps). And you can't use it with a GoPro mount. The KeyMission 360 ended up with 3.5 stars. Best Digital Camera Nikon D500 The Nikon D500 debuted among many other cameras at CES 2016, many with higher prices and more features. But the D500 had the edge, sharing features with the higher-end D5 (such as a 153-point autofocus system, but with a smaller sensor that can take full advantage of the focus points—excellent for telephoto shots), rugged build quality, 4K video capability, 10fps focus and fire shots, and integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It's always nice to see that initial feeling validated, as the D500 delivered in spades with a 4.5-star, Editors' Choice award-winning review in May. The D500 is serious competition for the Canon EOS 7D Mark II , which it replaced as Editors' Choice. Best 3D Printer Mcor ARKe At CES, we liked the Mcor ARKe for its aim of making low-cost, professional-class, photorealistic color 3D printing possible. The printer's Selective Deposition Lamination (SDL) technology actually binds together sheets of paper with adhesive to make long-lasting 3D models in full color. We haven't been sent a review unit to test, but you can find the ARKe for sale online. Best Car Faraday Future FFZERO1 The FFZERO1 is a concept car from Faraday Future, so you can't get one. But we can't apologize for picking it as the best car of CES 2016, as it made such a huge splash in Vegas that the ripples continue even now. The 1,000-horsepower, fully autonomous vehicle that's controlled by your smartphone continues to be pitted against other self-driving cars like the Tesla Model S P100D. You can get a closer look by downloading the Faraday Future Concept app for iOS or Android—it's probably as close as you'll ever actually get to one. Coming soon to CES 2017—Faraday Future's first actual production car! If the company can get to Vegas before running into insurmountable legal and financial problems. Best Concept LG Rollable OLED Display Nothing looks quite as futuristic as a bendable screen. And LG's flexible 18-inch OLED display is the best we've seen to date. Since it's 100 percent concept, you never had a chance of seeing it as a real product this year. However, LG claimed at CES that it would be able to make rollable Ultra HD OLED displays in 60-inch versions by 2017. Fingers crossed! Best Prototype Seven Dreamers' Laundroid The Laundroid is real: a refrigerator-sized cabinet that folds all the clothes you dump inside it. It's far too early to get one now, but the company has a deal with Panasonic to build the technology into washers and dryers by 2018. It might want to hurry—competition like FoldiMate is coming.

As we head into 2017, the technology ecosystem is going to see wholesale changes again. Most of the things that we knew will already be outdated. We have a completely new set of trends to look forward to and a bunch of new gadgets that will redefine user experiences as well as productivity. And while this is happening, the brains behind some of the well-known brands and some new kids on the block will be making their presence felt. GADGETS Apple’s next iPhone There is great expectation that next iPhone (logically, it might be called the iPhone 8) will be a big generational change to mark the iPhone’s 10th anniversary. The home button could be gone, we might even get a curved screen and of course, a new operating system (OS) in tow. Samsung’s new Galaxy The question really is whether it can successfully erase the volatile memories of the Galaxy Note 7. It is expected to run the latest specs, a high resolution curved display and even improved camera. But the question remains—can it stay cool enough to not explode? Windows 10 creators update Sometime in early 2017, Microsoft will enhance Windows 10’s focus on new creativity and gaming experiences. This will include 2D->3D object creation, game broadcasting and 4K gaming. The Forza Horizon 3 game in 4K would be a good enough reason to splurge on a new PC! Microsoft Surface Pro 5 The next Surface evolution will likely run the Intel “Kaby Lake” processor, and improved graphics. It’ll continue to be the benchmark for Windows convertibles and also an alternative to the Apple MacBook, and that ties in with the push towards making it even more enticing for enterprises. Google Pixel laptop It is believed that Google is working on a PC that will run its upcoming hybrid OS, which combines the goodness of Android and Chrome OS. Likely to be called the Pixel 3, it will have a 12.9-inch display, and the flexibility of a laptop and a tablet. TRENDS AND EVENTS Mobile World Congress 2017 In March in Barcelona, we could see the return of Nokia phones; it is confirmed that HMD Global will be making the phones under licence. Huawei usually has a strong line-up of phones to show, and with the P10, it’ll continue down that path. HTC also has a lot at stake. AI will be more relevant Mark Zuckerberg’s Jarvis artificial intelligence (AI) assistant isn’t a hobby project. AI is a part of our lives, more than we have noticed. It is gaining contextual intelligence: Facebook can recognize your friends in photos, Google’s Allo is proactively communicative and Netflix knows which TV series you should watch. Consumer Internet of Things is here to stay After many false dawns, smart home gadgets that you can control with your smartphone may become real now. Tech is becoming more affordable, and there may finally be some agreement on standards that allow interoperability. Google’s Android Things platform also indicates the next horizon of geeky excitement. Cord cutting will take off Netflix is here, and now Amazon Prime Video has joined the party. India is finally coming to terms with a world beyond cable and direct-to-home (DTH) television—always available, on your phones and televisions. In reality, 2017 could finally be the year when India adopts video streaming over conventional television. Push for hybrid car tech With the state of the environment becoming a serious concern, carmakers in India are expected to focus on hybrid technologies—mild hybrid and full hybrids. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s smart hybrid vehicle system (SHVS) and Toyota’s full hybrid technology is forcing rivals to consider similar tech for new car launches. Cleaner cars will go mainstream. PEOPLE TO WATCH Elon Elon Musk.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Intel’s i7-7700k overclocked to a ridiculous 7GHz thanks to liquid nitrogen Mike Wehner BGR NewsJanuary 1, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Intel’s much-anticipated high-performance Kaby Lake processors are almost here, which means anyone with a PC built for gaming or other heavy lifting tasks will have to decide whether or not it’s time for an upgrade. The i7-7700k chip, which will likely succeed the 6700k as being the go-to for overclockers and enthusiasts, will definitely be in high demand, but just how much room is there for tweaking? Well, if you happen to have a bit of liquid nitrogen sitting around, the answer is a whole lot. Don't Miss: Airline pilot arrested after trying to fly drunk OCLab reports that noted overclock guru Allen “Splave” Golibersuch managed to snag one of the processors early and took the opportunity to really push the 7700k to its absolute limits. Not satisfied with the chip’s stock clock speed of 4.2GHz, he hooked it up to a cooling system that any PC builder would envy: liquid nitrogen. With the super-cooled setup working to suck as much heat from the chip as possible, Splave managed to overclock the 7700k to a stable 7GHz. However, that impressive feat does come with a pretty significant drawback; overclocking to such an insane degree requires that all but two of the cores of the chip be shut down. Still, that’s a mighty fast processor. Now, unless you’re planning on buy stock in a liquid nitrogen corporation, there’s a good chance you won’t get anywhere close to a 7GHz overclock out of the 7700k, but with that much headroom it’s likely possible to push most chips past 5.5GHz with some decent water cooling. As with all overclocks, each chip will behave differently and even if you buy two 7700ks on the same day in the same store, they’ll each likely perform slightly differently when overclocking. Still, a 7GHz overclock is a great sign, so prepare your wallet for when the chip lands at your local PC shop in the coming weeks.

The Open-Source / Linux Letdowns Of 2016 Written by Michael Larabel in Free Software on 1 January 2017 at 09:00 AM EST. 11 Comments Last year I had written about the The Open-Source Linux Letdowns of 2015 and then Other Letdowns For Linux / Open-Source Users From 2015, which ended up being among the most viewed articles of 2016. So I figured I'd once again share a list of what personally was disappointing not to see happen in 2016 within the Linux/open-source space. Among what I'd classify as big letdowns for 2016 include: Ubuntu Convergence - This was on my 2015 letdown list and sadly it's back up for 2016... The whole Ubuntu convergence story has yet to be fully realized with Unity 8 + Mir still needing a lot of work and their goal now pushed back to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS but for that would really need to have it worthy by Ubuntu 17.10. There's also been the matter of no new/recent device announcements concerning Ubuntu on phones or tablets. Many are concerned by the lack of clear communication and announcements over the future of the convergence strategy and market viability of Ubuntu phones. AMD's Open-Source Vulkan Driver - While RADV sprouted up as an unofficial Radeon Vulkan driver that's open-source and surprisingly working out well, we still haven't seen any of the open-source official AMD Vulkan driver code that was talked about happening since even before the Vulkan 1.0 launch. We've heard AMD is working on getting the code cleaned up to release, they may try first working to open-source code that would help fill in the missing pieces for RADV, etc, but long story short Vulkan 1.0 is almost one year old and we still haven't seen the code expected from AMD... Hopefully it won't be too much longer to avoid overlap or fragmentation with the RADV efforts. AMDGPU DAL / DC Not Ready - The other big disappointment is the DAL/DC display code for the AMDGPU DRM driver not yet being ready for the mainline Linux kernel... This is holding back HDMI/DP audio from working out-of-the-box with newer AMD graphics cards on Linux, FreeSync support isn't yet part of the open driver until DAL/DC is merged, and it's blocking other features like HDMI 2.0, atomic mode-setting, DP MST, and more. AMD developers are working on currently cleaning up the code to get it acceptable to upstream developers, but it looks like it could still be a few months. The Steam Linux Marketshare Remains Around ~1% - As a letdown to optimistic Linux enthusiasts/gamers and to game studios weighing the viability of porting their games to Linux, the marketshare remains quite small. You can argue about the accuracy of the Steam Survey, but as of November it still pegged it at 0.88%. Even if doubling that over concerns over the accuracy of the survey or SteamOS Big Picture users not being counted, that's still less than 2%. macOS meanwhile is still maintaining 3.5~4%. Related to this, there has been barely anything to talk about with Linux-powered Steam Machines in 2016. NVIDIA Firmware & Nouveau Re-Clocking - This is another item that was on my 2015 list and while it's shifted a bit, it still is a big problem. In 2016 we finally saw NVIDIA provide their signed firmware blobs for Maxwell GPUs, but now we are in a similar waiting game for Pascal firmware for the GTX 1000 series consumer GPUs. No word when that Pascal GTX 1050/1060/1070/1080 firmware might be cleared for release. The lack of PMU firmware on the GTX 900 series still is also causing complications for re-clocking on this generation-old hardware. But in 2016 Nouveau developers did make some improvements by merging the "boost" patches for Linux 4.10 among other re-clocking advancements. Open-Source OpenCL - Another one from the 2015 list... The state of the open-source OpenCL driver support is still rather sad. Just this week was a positive milestone of Intel's Beignet being able to expose OpenCL 2.0 for Skylake+ but in 2016 there's been no real activity in the Nouveau space, the AMD Clover-based OpenCL driver is basically dead, and no other real open-source hardware driver efforts. AMD is working on a new Linux OpenCL stack via ROCm, but that isn't fully open yet but does make us optimistic for better adopted and supported AMD open-source OpenCL for later in 2017. Where Are The Vulkan Games? - While Vulkan was only released in February and it takes a while to adapt a new game engine to a new graphics API and longer for the renderer to make full-use of new APIs like DX12/Vulkan, it was a bit of a letdown only seeing two commercial games this year using Vulkan on Linux: Dota 2 and The Talos Principle. Plus there's the vkQuake open-source game if wanting to count that as well as if running the Windows-only DOOM game on Wine with Vulkan wine-staging patches. But hopefully in 2017 we'll see many more game studios release Vulkan titles. We already know that Feral Interactive will begin with some game ports using Vulkan. May 2017 be a bright year for Vulkan gaming! xf86-video-intel 3.0 - The 3.0 Intel DDX driver has been "in development" for several years now while there hasn't even been a new development snapshot in two years. Intel appears to not even really be maintaining this driver anymore but what's sad has been the lack of official communication concerning the future of this xf86-video-intel driver... Meanwhile, distributions like Ubuntu/Debian are switching to using xf86-video-modesetting by default in place of xf86-video-intel. These were the items that came to my mind this New Year's morning off the top of my head. At least there was a lot to be thankful for in the Linux/open-source space for 2016, as covered in the past few weeks in various recaps and "most viewed" articles on Phoronix.

Ain’t no prime minister got time for that Netanyahu’s inability to find time for the police makes front pages, though one paper sees the probe against him as just another media plot; and 2017 is welcomed with something less than hope By Joshua Davidovich January 1, 2017, 12:33 pm Tweet Email Print Share Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a ceremony at Intel's Kiryat Gat plant on November 14, 2016.

While front pages are emblazoned with pictures of fireworks and wishes for a great 2017, the news offerings give a picture of a more melancholy and bizarro state of play – and that’s without the deadly Istanbul attack, which unfolded too late to make the morning papers. Chief among the items giving a view of a new year that’s much like the old are papers tackling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s apparent avoidance of dealing with legal challenges he is facing, with one paper – Israel Hayom, natch — joining in on the eschewal effort. Both Yedioth and Haaretz lead off with reports that Netanyahu has failed to find the time to meet with police to answer questions about the various suspicions against him, after Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit informed him that he was under investigation on December 12. The papers mention that Netanyahu begged off, saying he would meet with investigators after his trip to Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan that week, but hasn’t found the time since. Unmentioned is the stuff Netanyahu has found the time for, like making a silly New year’s video, reportedly declaring war on New Zealand, and spending three hours with reporters and editors from The Times of Israel, among other things. “The main challenge now for investigators is to find a significant window of time in the prime minister’s schedule for an initial probe, which will include confronting him with allegations of receiving benefits. The police don’t want the investigation to be spread out over several days, and it’s important that they get Netanyahu’s side as succinctly as possible. For this they are planning on the possibility of questioning him during abnormal hours and taking into account that it will take place on Netanyahu’s home court – at the Prime Minister’s Residence in Jerusalem and not in the interrogation room. Police are hoping it will happen this week,” Yedioth reports, adding that police also want to keep Netanyahu from speaking to his son Yair, who will also be questioned, but can’t because, well, he’s the prime minister. Mandelblit has refused to announce the specifics of the suspicions against Netanyahu and Haaretz reports that police are refusing to confirm reports that businessman Ron Lauder was one of some 50 people who have testified in the case. But the broadsheet writes that Lauder testified he gave Netanyahu a suit and his son a place to stay abroad. “According to Lauder, the gifts were between friends, part of the years-long ties he’s had with Netanyahu. However, police think that the value of the gifts is more than Lauder claimed, and that they were given as ‘casting thy bread,’” the paper reports, using a biblical term that’s used to denote payola in modern Hebrew. Things might look bad for Netanyahu and his legal woes, but savvy readers of Israel Hayom know that journalists reporting on a police investigation into the elected head of government for the State of Israel are all just part of a pathetic “obsessive” campaign against the prime minister. So says the front page of the tabloid, quoting no less a personage than American lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who has also defended O.J. Simpson, Steve Bannon and Claus Von Bulow. The paper quotes Dershowitz going on attack against the media, and though the paper declines to report on Netanyahu not having time to talk to the police and casts as much doubt as possible in what little reporting it does have on the legal case, the Harvard lawyer defends Netanyahu as someone who is so busy “he needs to work 25 hours a day, 8 days a week.” As a cherry on top, Dershowitz says the police and Mandelblit should back off Netanyahu altogether, at least for now. “I’m confident that if there is a need for an investigation, it should be done only after an elected official, a president or prime minister for instance, finishes his term. The fact that now the prime minister may have to deal with being questioned under caution on what seem to be trivial matters, investigations created by the media – harms democracy, and disturbs senior elected officials’ ability to fulfill their roles,” Dershowitz is quoted saying (in a translation of Israel Hayom’s Hebrew translation back into English.) Israel Hayom also breaks ranks by being the only paper to look back wistfully at 2016 and view the coming of 2017 with something less than trepidation. Under a headline of “new start” and with a picture of several liberal world leaders forced out or on the way out – Matteo Renzi, David Cameron, Francois Hollande, Angela Merkel and Barack Obama – the paper’s Boaz Bismuth looks forward to a world ruled by the nativists and populists ushered in over the last 12 months – first and foremost US President-elect Donald Trump. “2017 will be the year that populism continues to raise its head against the center that took the place of the left,” he writes. “It will also be the year that, 150 years after the publication of Karl Marx’s ‘Das Kapital,’ many will continue to dream of revolution. But 2016 [Trump and Brexit] proved that the voting booth can be much more stable than the street.” Bismuth doesn’t raise many hackles about Trump’s friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a sign that Netanyahu doesn’t either, but in Haaretz Chemi Shalev writes that the prime minister would be smart to view TrumPutin with a more wary eye. “If Putin is indeed calling the shots, he might very well have enough ambition to try and impose a Pax-Russiana on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Trump’s role to deliver Israel. And lest Netanyahu find comfort in the deep support that Israel currently enjoys among Republicans, he should have a look at the latest polls conducted this month among Trump voters. They were once diehard anti-Russian hawks and are now enamored with Putin no less than their president,” he writes. While Shalev’s evenhanded approach leaves him only looking at the possibility of disastrous times ahead, Yedioth’s Smadar Peri predicts with a certainty only afforded Israeli prognosticators that 2017 will be even worse than 2016 was, especially in the Middle East, where chaos reigns supreme. If that’s still too cheery, she ends on an even more macabre note, taking stock of the other prophets of doom around the region. “It’s interesting to note another assessment, made by all the experts: At least one leader in our neighborhood will be killed in 2017,” she writes. “Who will it be? Every expert has his guesses, every analyst has his scenarios.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Hebrew media review,  Benjamin Netanyahu,  Alan Dershowitz,  Avichai Mandelblit,  new year's greeting,  Donald Trump,  Vladimir Putin More in Israel & the Region Minimum number of vacation days rises to 12 in 2017 Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments The Times of Israel Current top stories Philosopher Bernard Henri-Levy revisits Jewish roots in new book By Cnaan Liphshiz   AG formally confirms Netanyahu is under investigation, details cases already closed By Raoul Wootliff   IS makes unusual claim of responsibility for Istanbul attack By Lori Hinnant and DUSAN STOJANOVIC   4 sisters allegedly killed by mother in suspected murder-suicide buried in Jerusalem By Times of Israel staff   Schools to open late Tuesday as teachers call warning strike By Times of Israel staff   The Times of Israel Daily Edition Free to Your Inbox The email is either missing or invalid Almost finished...

The memory chip producer seems to be heading for another market-beating year. Exactly how far can Micron run in 2017? Let's find out. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Dec 31, 2016 at 12:00PM Image source: Getty Images. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares have gained a market-stomping 57% in 2016. Can the memory chip specialist build on this success with another fantastic performance in 2017? First, I have already taken a look at the potential downside for us Micron investors. In short, the risks involved in owning Micron next year are significant but also limited. We won't see any record-breaking drops next year, even in the worst-case scenario of another full-blown price war in the memory industry. On the upside, both DRAM and NAND memory prices have stabilized dramatically in recent months. Both Micron's management and independent market analysts agree that chip prices should remain firm over the next several months. Since Micron (and all other chip manufacturers) always works on pushing down the cost of making each chip, stable prices lead to wider margins over time. That's what the memory business looks like right now, in a rare and welcome break from the sector's history of raging price wars. As long as these conditions hold true, Micron's profits and cash flows will continue to rise. In a perfect world, that inevitably leads to higher share prices. The valuation angle So how much room is there for more gains on top of that tremendous 2016 showing? Quite a bit, actually. From a historical point of view, Micron traded at more than $36 per share just two years ago. Climbing back to that level would work out to at least a 60% gain, starting at today's prices. If you think that can't be done, you could look back at the much faster rise in 2013 and 2014 for some velocity guidance. The price swings in this crazy industry may not be very predictable, but they sure know how to bring the heat in both directions. So Micron could very well jump back to $36 in a single year, if recent history is any indication. How about traditional valuation metrics? Let me compare Micron to some other veterans in the chip industry: Ratio Micron Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Forward P/E 9.1 13.8 14.1 Price to Sales (ttm) 1.8 3.1 4.2 Enterprise Value to Free Cash Flow (ttm) 9.8 17.4 13.2 Data source: YCharts. I'm not necessarily saying that Micron deserves to trade at the same multiples as Intel or Qualcomm, of course. Both of these sector peers are much larger than Micron in terms of annual sales, various types of profit, and market caps. Intel dominates the market for central processors, and Qualcomm holds a similar position in the field of wireless communications, while Micron is only the third-largest player in a highly volatile sector. So yeah, Micron probably deserves a risk-related discount. But the company is on an upward trend right now, and that crazy memory market has settled down significantly in recent years. Several brutal rounds of cyclical shakeouts have led to the largest memory providers swallowing up all the minnows, and Micron is one of the rival-eating survivors. Frankly, I'd be shocked to see another price war in the next couple of years. Based on the table above, you could give Micron a 60% price boost right now and the stock would still look reasonably cheap in the context of large sector peers. Watch Micron get to work on earning back that rebate, and stock prices could surge in a hurry. The key issue here is memory chip pricing, based on the balance between supply and demand in that market. Supply is tighter than demand right now and should remain so for at least a good chunk of 2017 as well. What's next? So yeah, I think that this stock will climb even higher next year. Will it be the best year ever? Probably not -- Micron set a high bar by tripling in 2013 -- but still a very healthy performance indeed. I'll certainly keep a close eye on Micron next year. A 60% gain would place the stock close to what I'd consider fair value in a best-case memory market scenario. At that point, it just might be time to sign off and move my Micron capital to another stock with a longer runway for growth ahead of it. But right now, I'm a happy shareholder.

They show little interest in the old philanthropic model - attending galas and endowing their alma mater. Today, relatively young technology billionaires are creating a new paradigm of philanthropy, one that arguably sets a new standard of ethical practice in the non-profit sector. Their purpose is to use their influence to push the boundaries of science and technology for the creation of social benefit. In a growing trend, in 2014, more than US$5 billion was donated by wealthy technologists for this purpose. A cynic might say it is about lining their own pockets, yet there is ample evidence to suggest they are motivated by a kind of win-win altruism. These are men and women who think global and want to leave a legacy. Who are we talking about? It is a long list indeed, with names like Gordon Moore (Intel), Bill Gates (Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg & Priscilla Chan, Sean Parker (Facebook), Paul Allen (Microsoft) and Michael Dell, to mention a few. Shortfalls in government funding One factor in the rise of the new philanthropy is that government spending on science in the US has been dropping in recent times. Research institutes are closing, projects being put on hold or abandoned for want of funding. Increasingly, science philanthropy is stepping up to address the shortfall. It is not surprising that wealthy technologists would want to invest in pushing the boundaries of science. Technology is, after all, applied science. Without the research, technological progress slows to a crawl. As a result, we are seeing the priorities of science being influenced less by government policy and academia, and more by the priorities of the philanthropic giver. After all, who pays the piper calls the tune. It is a trend giving rise to some disquiet in the science establishment. With pressure on government budgets from other priorities, the trend towards the outsourcing of science funding is likely to continue. The Gates Foundation Even the wealthiest of governments would be hard pressed to match the funding of some of the larger new “venture philanthropists”. With assets of around US$44 billion, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a prime example of the new philanthropy. To date it has spent roughly US$10 billion on a range of programs in developing countries to improve health care, provide education and reduce poverty. It has funded efforts to control infectious diseases, malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. It also funds family planning, basic health care, nutrition and sanitation. It would be difficult to criticise such efforts, though it will not stop some from claiming they are only giving back what they had no right to take in the first place. Being a philanthropist today can be a thankless business. Is there a dark side? Silicon Valley billionaire and philanthropist Peter Thiel incurred the wrath of his peers by strongly supporting Donald Trump, donating money and making speeches for his election. Thiel has since been named a member of the President-elect’s transition team, indicating that he is not just a supporter but a trusted friend. What does Thiel expect in return? Time will tell, but it is likely he will be most valuable serving as a mediator between a Trump White House and the largely left-wing Silicon Valley establishment to implement a new policy agenda. Not an easy job. The new philanthropy is diversifying It is a measure of the hyper-partisan nature of politics today that would call participation in the political process a bad thing. It’s actually a good thing. We need more intelligent, capable people with technology skills to enter a field that has been brought into disrepute in recent times.

Their purpose is to use their influence to push the boundaries of science and technology for the creation of social benefit. In a growing trend, in 2014, more than US$5 billion was donated by wealthy technologists for this purpose. A cynic might say it is about lining their own pockets, yet there is ample evidence to suggest they are motivated by a kind of win-win altruism. These are men and women who think global and want to leave a legacy. Who are we talking about? It is a long list indeed, with names like Gordon Moore (Intel), Bill Gates (Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg & Priscilla Chan, Sean Parker (Facebook), Paul Allen (Microsoft) and Michael Dell, to mention a few. Shortfalls in government funding One factor in the rise of the new philanthropy is that government spending on science in the US has been dropping in recent times. Research institutes are closing, projects being put on hold or abandoned for want of funding. Increasingly, science philanthropy is stepping up to address the shortfall. It is not surprising that wealthy technologists would want to invest in pushing the boundaries of science. Technology is, after all, applied science. Without the research, technological progress slows to a crawl. As a result, we are seeing the priorities of science being influenced less by government policy and academia, and more by the priorities of the philanthropic giver. After all, who pays the piper calls the tune. It is a trend giving rise to some disquiet in the science establishment. With pressure on government budgets from other priorities, the trend towards the outsourcing of science funding is likely to continue. The Gates Foundation Even the wealthiest of governments would be hard pressed to match the funding of some of the larger new “venture philanthropists”. With assets of around US$44 billion, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a prime example of the new philanthropy. To date it has spent roughly US$10 billion on a range of programs in developing countries to improve health care, provide education and reduce poverty. It has funded efforts to control infectious diseases, malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. It also funds family planning, basic health care, nutrition and sanitation. It would be difficult to criticise such efforts, though it will not stop some from claiming they are only giving back what they had no right to take in the first place. Being a philanthropist today can be a thankless business. Is there a dark side? Silicon Valley billionaire and philanthropist Peter Thiel incurred the wrath of his peers by strongly supporting Donald Trump, donating money and making speeches for his election. Thiel has since been named a member of the President-elect’s transition team, indicating that he is not just a supporter but a trusted friend. What does Thiel expect in return? Time will tell, but it is likely he will be most valuable serving as a mediator between a Trump White House and the largely left-wing Silicon Valley establishment to implement a new policy agenda. Not an easy job. The new philanthropy is diversifying It is a measure of the hyper-partisan nature of politics today that would call participation in the political process a bad thing. It’s actually a good thing. We need more intelligent, capable people with technology skills to enter a field that has been brought into disrepute in recent times. Have you noticed how few politicians really understand technology?   The article was published on The Conversation. You can read it here.

View Latest Posts >>> ‘Russian hackers’ penetrate US power grid with ‘outdated Ukrainian malware’ By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on December 31, 2016 … from Russia Today,  Moscow Government, Security and the Media [ Editor’s Note:  This Russian hacking story is turning into a Three Stoogies movie rerun. Experienced Intel people, even those who are not intimate code people know that setting up blinds, dead ends and pasties as diversions for hacks is a operational staple. When VT was running down our own hack attack, tracing the packets back, the trail was running through major university and some defense contractor servers where endless fingers could be in the pie. But with more digging the trail ended at a US military base where “training” was done for doing this very thing. Something thought it would be fun to screw VT over, but they underestimated that our friends tracked it right to the a very building on the base. It was handled quietly but semi-publicly at a wedding on the base where the commander was confronted for doing something so stupid, and illegal which would make our military look bad if it were made public. He stormed out of the wedding and we were never hacked from that location again. The real hoax part of the story, which indicts all of Congress and corporate media, is that the US, Israelis and the Brits are major major hackers, and have been for a long time. Those who are being painted as threats, were of course major targets themselves, so would have a perfect right of retaliation, a kind of cyber war mutual destruction dance. But here, where we live in a supposedly free country, with a free press and representative government, this very important framing is given to the public as it would make them less manipulable. And lastly, as with Wikileaks and its massive data dumps, Israel continuous to miraculously escape any and all embarrassing disclosures. We are led to believe with the zero number of reported Israeli hacking cases against the US that they are not doing it, which is kind of funny. Our own people are “Truth Hacking” the American public. I don’t remember that specifically being in the oaths of office that our people take, “and I refuse to hide from the public the massive hacking that the US government engages in for whatever reasons it deems necessary”. When a government is an aggressive hacker, it knows it will be retaliated against, and thus must paint the retaliator as the aggressor to its public. We have no duty to swallow the lie, but the problem is how so many also don’t feel any duty to do anything about it, so we have only ourselves to blame for that… Jim W. Dean ] ___________ – First published … December 31,  2016 – A Vermont utility sounded the alarm after finding malware code on a laptop that the FBI and DHS had touted as associated with Russian hackers. However, cybersecurity specialists say the code came from an outdated Ukrainian hacking tool. – On Thursday, the FBI and DHS released a joint report on a hacking operation they called ‘Grizzly Steppe’. They claimed the operation was linked to the Russian government, alleging that it had targeted “US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.” Along with the report, the US security agencies released a sample of the malware code allegedly used in the Grizzly Steppe operation to compromise US computer networks. The code was also shared with executives from 16 industries around the nation, including the financial, utility, and transportation sectors, according to a Washington Post report. On Friday, Burlington Electric, a Vermont-based power company, released a statement saying that the malware code had been detected during a scan of a single company laptop that was not connected to the grid. “We took immediate action to isolate the laptop and alerted federal officials of this finding. Our team is working with federal officials to trace this malware and prevent any other attempts to infiltrate utility systems. We have briefed state officials and will support the investigation fully,” the statement said. The US media reported the incident as if Russian hackers had penetrated America’s electric grids, prompting some officials to call on the federal government to protect Americans from Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Vermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world’s leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality-of-life, economy, health, and safety,” Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin said in a statement. “This episode should highlight the urgent need for our federal government to vigorously pursue and put an end to this sort of Russian meddling,” he said. Meanwhile, a number of IT specialists that have analyzed the code and other evidence published by the US government are questioning whether it really proves a Russian connection, let alone a connection to the Russian government. Wordfence, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in protecting websites running WordPress, a PHP-based platform, published a report on the issue on Friday. Wordfence said they had traced the malware code to a tool available online, which is apparently funded by donations, called P.A.S. that claims to be “made in Ukraine.” The version tested by the FBI/DHS report is 3.1.7, while the most current version available on the tool’s website is 4.1.1b. “One might reasonably expect Russian intelligence operatives to develop their own tools or at least use current malicious tools from outside sources,” the report says. The second part of the analysis deals with the list of IP addresses provided by the US agencies. The report says they “don’t appear to provide any association with Russia” and “are probably used by a wide range of other malicious actors.” This week, the Obama administration accused the Russian government of hacking US computer networks in order to influence the presidential to justify imposing some of the toughest sanctions on Russia yet, including the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and blocking access to two leisure compounds used by Russian Foreign Ministry personnel and their visitors. Russia chose to ignore the punitive measures, calling their imposition a clear provocation, while saying that Moscow will build its relations with the US based on the policies of the next administration under President-elect Donald Trump, not President Barack Obama’s parting shots. In October, Putin ridiculed the idea that Russia could influence the US presidential election, saying that America was not “a banana republic.” ____________ Related Posts: FBI backs CIA claim that Russian hackers meddled in US election Russian FSB foils terrorist attacks plotted by Ukrainian intel agents in Crimea Ukrainian admiral appointed to command Russian Baltic Sea Fleet Breaking: US Sabotages Syrian Power Grid PTSD and the Toxic World Around Us The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Edward Longshanks  January 1, 2017 at 2:52 am This clip is really a nice one. Despite usual US movie productions, this movie shows the reality, if we assume the “just married couple” are the Russians, evil Germans or demonic Japanese. The usual Rambo story with the picture of a single hero never fitted into any reality. Thanks for posting it, Mr. Buckley. Edward Longshanks  December 31, 2016 at 2:17 pm Hacking helps to steal patents as the US did it with windcraft plants in Germany. It is war, you what happens with horse thieves. But on the other hand it is a kind of voyeurism. If our life is hacked the whole day, hacking becomes the main content, a self purpose, means a constructed meaning of life. And if we use so much energy to steal instead of innovate something, we will come soon to an end.

Log in to Reply Khalid Talaat  December 31, 2016 at 11:22 am A banana republic is a country that produces only one crop. The US is far from being a banana republic. But US politicians are banana republic politicians, they only produce one crop, BS. In the 60s-80s we used to make fun of the Soviet politician’s propaganda BS. Now the Russians along with the rest of the world are laughing at the US politician’s BS, especially the “war on Terror.” The danger will surround us when US politicians totally believe their own BS. Folks, we are getting there. Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  January 1, 2017 at 2:34 am Mr. Talaat, the Banana Republic is a historical term, mainly taken from Latin-America (the Germans say Mittel-Amerika). Of course those states as Costa-Rica or Panama lived from Banana-production, but their major aspect was the rule of US fruit corps as United Fruit etc., who pressed the last cent out of those countries. Those corps did not only control the agricultural market, they controlled the infrastructure, too, as the postal service, which was in a way necessary. Those corps promoted independence from former colonial powers to avoid the jurisdiction from former colonial powers and to implement a more comfortable one. This means the abolition of slavery was a false flag by the Union. In reality they prolongated it to the current days. During the last decades the US extended the global concentration camp watchtower policy on the entire planet with 750 overseas bases. So political oppositions call even Germany or Britain a Banana Republic which fits into the historical definition of the political structure. JohnZ  December 31, 2016 at 9:53 am As per editor’s note, always look for something such as this to originate within our own borders. Someone is definitely trying to push America into a war with Russia and it smells of zionism. Jim, Your note about being hacked by the U.S. military would make a great article, maybe even a book or a Youtube video. Entitled, ” How the U.S Government and Military Wages War On the American People.” My attitude towards the U.S. military just took another negative leap. Log in to Reply JohnZ  December 31, 2016 at 9:54 am P/S The picture at the top most accurately describes Washington. Nyuk, nyuk,nyuk. Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  December 31, 2016 at 5:55 pm Gordon published some of this, parts of it. a while back. We outlined it but did not name names. Our archives are filled with past battles. Of the 35,000+ archived articles Gordon must have done 3000. I am up to 1200. Just to go back and just skim over them is quite a trip down memory road. Trakkath  December 31, 2016 at 9:21 am This is the reason why I asked lately on which Russians he pointed at, Benjamin Mileikowsky and his gang or Waltzman and his gang or another kind of Russians.There are so many Russian outside Russia who can be meant. Log in to Reply Amelius  December 31, 2016 at 7:53 am I know it’s just a movie, but in Snowden, he says that the NSA installed bugs into the power grids of nations. He specifically mentions Japan and later in the movie, Syria’s grid goes out and people start going nuts. Why does the USG continue to embarrass itself, pointing the finger at Russia without providing any evidence? Log in to Reply JohnZ  December 31, 2016 at 9:56 am It’s all a matter of who is running America. The owners. The same ones who control the CIA, NSA, FBI etc. The American people have no control. Donald Moore  December 31, 2016 at 7:24 am Trump need to hire some independent hackers to study those so called hacks. I believe if that is done it will show that all those so called hacks were done by the US Intelligence Services to keep the Cold War alive. The US Intelligence Services has some of the best in the world, ask Merkel. If the Russians swayed the election for Trump they did a lousy job of it since Killery won the popular vote. And do tell me how they arranged the swing states to give Trump with the victory with so close of the vote. It seems to me if you are going to do it you would give your side a bigger lead and not have it so close. I’m not saying Russia doesn’t hack, they do but the US hacks more than anybody in the world with UK and Israel at the top. It’s a known fact Israel spy’s on the US and hacking is one way of spying, they don’t trust Obama, rightfully so. So every country spy’s, hacks more some then others so calling the kettle black when you are doing it won’t get my sympathy. Log in to Reply Trakkath  December 31, 2016 at 10:57 am Independend hackers ? And then what, sue those responsible at an independend court and by and independend judge and jury ? If you find them send me a note. Go dream on. Donald Moore  December 31, 2016 at 3:49 pm No there is no way in the US to sue the Government, what I mean to put the nail in the coffin of Obama and the Secret Services that they were behind the so call Russian hackers. And again what I mean of independent hackers is hire real hackers to do the work that is not affiliated with the government. It is more to show McCain and Lindsey and their Neocons that Trump is three steps ahead of them and their Bushido.

First spotted by Windows Central, Dell's website has a page up that simply says "XPS 13 2-in-1" with an image. It's only been a few months since the company unveiled all-new models of the laptop. Along with a new color option, the main new feature was Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors. Still, the XPS 13 never had 2-in-1 functionality that allows the user to fold the display back and turn the laptop into a tablet, and that looks to be the main new feature in the upcoming model. Everything else would appear to be the same. Clearly, it will still use dual-core Kaby Lake chips, and it's the same Infinity Edge display. As reported, there's no reason that the storage configurations would be any different either. CES kicks off on January 5, and Dell's press conference is schedules for 10 am Pacific Time that day. Of course, we'll find out more then.

The winning computer program, created by researchers at Google DeepMind in London, used an artificial neural network that took advantage of what’s known as deep learning, a strategy by which neural networks involving many layers of processing are configured in an automated fashion to solve the problem at hand. Unknown to the public at the time was that Google had an ace up its sleeve. You see, the computers Google used to defeat Sedol contained special-purpose hardware—a computer card Google calls its Tensor Processing Unit. Norm Jouppi, a hardware engineer at Google, announced the existence of the Tensor Processing Unit two months after the Go match, explaining in a blog post that Google had been outfitting its data centers with these new accelerator cards for more than a year. Google has not shared exactly what is on these boards, but it’s clear that it represents an increasingly popular strategy to speed up deep-learning calculations: using an application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC. Deep-Learning Software Revenues (US $, Billions) Revenues from deep-learning software should soon exceed $1 billion. Source: Tractica Another tactic being pursued (primarily by Microsoft) is to use field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which provide the benefit of being reconfigurable if the computing requirements change. The more common approach, though, has been to use graphics processing units, or GPUs, which can perform many mathematical operations in parallel. The foremost proponent of this approach is GPU maker Nvidia. Indeed, advances in GPUs kick-started artificial neural networks back in 2009, when researchers at Stanford showed that such hardware made it possible to train deep neural networks in reasonable amounts of time [PDF]. “Everybody is doing deep learning today,” says William Dally, who leads the Concurrent VLSI Architecture group at Stanford and is also chief scientist for Nvidia. And for that, he says, perhaps not surprisingly given his position, “GPUs are close to being as good as you can get.” Dally explains that there are three separate realms to consider. The first is what he calls “training in the data center.” He’s referring to the first step for any deep-learning system: adjusting perhaps many millions of connections between neurons so that the network can carry out its assigned task. In building hardware for that, a company called Nervana Systems, which was recently acquired by Intel, has been leading the charge. According to Scott Leishman, a computer scientist at Nervana, the Nervana Engine, an ASIC deep-learning accelerator, will go into production in early to mid-2017. Leishman notes that another computationally intensive task—bitcoin mining—went from being run on CPUs to GPUs to FPGAs and, finally, on ASICs because of the gains in power efficiency from such customization. “I see the same thing happening for deep learning,” he says. A second and quite distinct job for deep-learning hardware, explains Dally, is “inference at the data center.” The word inference here refers to the ongoing operation of cloud-based artificial neural networks that have previously been trained to carry out some job. Every day, Google’s neural networks are making an astronomical number of such inference calculations to categorize images, translate between languages, and recognize spoken words, for example. Although it’s hard to say for sure, Google’s Tensor Processing Unit is presumably tailored for performing such computations. Photo: Google Pedal to Metal: Google’s Tensor Processing Unit accelerates deep-learning calculations on the company’s servers. Training and inference often take very different skill sets. Typically for training, the computer must be able to calculate with relatively high precision, often using 32-bit floating-point operations. For inference, precision can be sacrificed in favor of greater speed or less power consumption. “This is an active area of research,” says Leishman. “How low can you go?” Although Dally declines to divulge Nvidia’s specific plans, he points out that the company’s GPUs have been evolving. Nvidia’s earlier Maxwell architecture could perform double- (64-bit) and single- (32-bit) precision operations, whereas its current Pascal architecture adds the capability to do 16-bit operations at twice the throughput and efficiency of its single-precision calculations. So it’s easy to imagine that Nvidia will eventually be releasing GPUs able to perform 8-bit operations, which could be ideal for inference calculations done in the cloud, where power efficiency is critical to keeping costs down. Dally adds that “the final leg of the tripod for deep learning is inference in embedded devices,” such as smartphones, cameras, and tablets. For those applications, the key will be low-power ASICs. Over the coming year, deep-learning software will increasingly find its way into applications for smartphones, where it is already used, for example, to detect malware or translate text in images. And the drone manufacturer DJI is already using something akin to a deep-learning ASIC in its Phantom 4 drone, which uses a special visual-processing chip made by California-based Movidius to recognize obstructions. (Movidius is yet another neural-network company recently acquired by Intel.) Qualcomm, meanwhile, built special circuitry into its Snapdragon 820 processors to help carry out deep-learning calculations. Although there is plenty of incentive these days to design hardware to accelerate the operation of deep neural networks, there’s also a huge risk: If the state of the art shifts far enough, chips designed to run yesterday’s neural nets will be outdated by the time they are manufactured. “The algorithms are changing at an enormous rate,” says Dally. “Everybody who is building these things is trying to cover their bets.” This article appears in the January 2017 print issue as “Deeper and Cheaper Machine Learning.” Advertisement Recommended For You 2017: The Year of Self-Driving Cars and Trucks Autonomous Air Taxis Will Take Off in 2017, but Won’t Go Far Intel Finds Moore’s Law’s Next Step at 10 Nanometers Fold-Up Smartphone Screens Could Finally Make Their Big Debut Commercial Spaceflight Hits a Milestone Verizon and AT&T Prepare to Bring 5G to Market Learn More ASIC AlphaGo Artificial Neural Networks Deep Learning FPGA GPU Movidius Nervana Systems Comments Comment Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> Comments powered by Disqus Topics Aerospace At Work Biomedical Computing Energy Gadgets Geek Life Green Tech Robotics Semiconductors Telecom Transportation Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ RSS IEEE Spectrum Contact Us About Newsletters Reprints & Permissions IEEE Partners Advertising & Media Center IEEE Job Site Buyer’s Guide The Magazine Subscribe Now Digital Download © Copyright 2017 IEEE Spectrum Terms & Conditions | Privacy & Opting Out of Cookies | Accessibility | Nondiscrimination Policy Join IEEE About IEEE Conferences & Events Education & Careers Membership & Services Publications and Standards Societies & Communities © Copyright 2016 IEEE — All rights reserved.

The site continues: "The chassis can accommodate any double wide graphics card with a maximum size of 280 mm in length and 41 mm in depth, but nothing too custom with regards heat pipes and backplates because the space is constrained".     GIGABYTE powers the GTX 1080-based Gaming GT system with a 400W PSU, and of course - RGB LEDs on top of it. They can be controlled with GIGABYTE's Ambient LED software.   As for pricing and availability, we know nothing on that yet - but we're sure GIGABYTE will have some big announcements next week at CES.

The memory chip producer seems to be heading for another market-beating year. Exactly how far can Micron run in 2017? Let's find out. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Dec 31, 2016 at 12:00PM Image source: Getty Images. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares have gained a market-stomping 57% in 2016. Can the memory chip specialist build on this success with another fantastic performance in 2017? First, I have already taken a look at the potential downside for us Micron investors. In short, the risks involved in owning Micron next year are significant but also limited. We won't see any record-breaking drops next year, even in the worst-case scenario of another full-blown price war in the memory industry. On the upside, both DRAM and NAND memory prices have stabilized dramatically in recent months. Both Micron's management and independent market analysts agree that chip prices should remain firm over the next several months. Since Micron (and all other chip manufacturers) always works on pushing down the cost of making each chip, stable prices lead to wider margins over time. That's what the memory business looks like right now, in a rare and welcome break from the sector's history of raging price wars. As long as these conditions hold true, Micron's profits and cash flows will continue to rise. In a perfect world, that inevitably leads to higher share prices. The valuation angle So how much room is there for more gains on top of that tremendous 2016 showing? Quite a bit, actually. From a historical point of view, Micron traded at more than $36 per share just two years ago. Climbing back to that level would work out to at least a 60% gain, starting at today's prices. If you think that can't be done, you could look back at the much faster rise in 2013 and 2014 for some velocity guidance. The price swings in this crazy industry may not be very predictable, but they sure know how to bring the heat in both directions. So Micron could very well jump back to $36 in a single year, if recent history is any indication. How about traditional valuation metrics? Let me compare Micron to some other veterans in the chip industry: Ratio Micron Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Forward P/E 9.1 13.8 14.1 Price to Sales (ttm) 1.8 3.1 4.2 Enterprise Value to Free Cash Flow (ttm) 9.8 17.4 13.2 Data source: YCharts. I'm not necessarily saying that Micron deserves to trade at the same multiples as Intel or Qualcomm, of course. Both of these sector peers are much larger than Micron in terms of annual sales, various types of profit, and market caps. Intel dominates the market for central processors, and Qualcomm holds a similar position in the field of wireless communications, while Micron is only the third-largest player in a highly volatile sector. So yeah, Micron probably deserves a risk-related discount. But the company is on an upward trend right now, and that crazy memory market has settled down significantly in recent years. Several brutal rounds of cyclical shakeouts have led to the largest memory providers swallowing up all the minnows, and Micron is one of the rival-eating survivors. Frankly, I'd be shocked to see another price war in the next couple of years. Based on the table above, you could give Micron a 60% price boost right now and the stock would still look reasonably cheap in the context of large sector peers. Watch Micron get to work on earning back that rebate, and stock prices could surge in a hurry. The key issue here is memory chip pricing, based on the balance between supply and demand in that market. Supply is tighter than demand right now and should remain so for at least a good chunk of 2017 as well. What's next? So yeah, I think that this stock will climb even higher next year. Will it be the best year ever? Probably not -- Micron set a high bar by tripling in 2013 -- but still a very healthy performance indeed. I'll certainly keep a close eye on Micron next year. A 60% gain would place the stock close to what I'd consider fair value in a best-case memory market scenario. At that point, it just might be time to sign off and move my Micron capital to another stock with a longer runway for growth ahead of it. But right now, I'm a happy shareholder.

(Greg Sorber/Albuquerque Journal .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........The city of Rio Rancho and Sandoval County experienced some highs and lows in 2016. Here are 10 of the year’s top stories as selected by the Observer staff: 1. Romero convicted and sentenced in Benner slaying The convicted killer of Rio Rancho Police officer Gregg Benner was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 20 years, on Sept. 30, 16 months after the shooting. “You will die in prison,” said 13th Judicial District Judge George Eichwald as he sentenced Andrew Romero for the Memorial Day 2015 slaying that stunned the City of Vision. The courtroom was filled with police officers and Benner’s supporters. Advertisement Continue reading A week earlier, a jury of nine women and three men found Romero guilty of first-degree murder of a police officer and other lesser offenses for shooting and killing Benner during a traffic stop on Pinetree Road. According to testimony during the two-week trial, moved to Valencia County because of the intense publicity the case received in Sandoval County, Romero shot Benner after the officer pulled over Romero and Tabitha Littles, Romero’s former girlfriend. They were on a two-month drug binge they funded by robbing about 10 business, mainly fast-food restaurants. Romero and Littles were on their way to rob a Twisters when Benner stopped them. Littles was also sentenced on Sept. 30. Eichwald sentenced her to 16 years and she will be able to cut that sentence in half if she behaves well while in prison. “Every night since May 25 has been cold and lonely,” said Julie Benner, the officer’s widow. In November, Eichwald added 40 years to Romero’s sentence under a state law that allows judges to enhance a three-time habitual offender’s sentence. Records show Romero had previously been convicted of crimes including involuntary manslaughter, drug trafficking and aggravated assault. Eichwald added eight years for each of Romero’s five felony convictions in the Benner case. 2 . Hospital mill levy extension defeated at polls Advertisement Continue reading County voters in November rejected the proposed eight-year extension of a 4.25 mill levy to support the two medical centers in Sandoval County. The levy, which has supported operations at Presbyterian Rust Medical Center and UNM Sandoval Regional Medical Center, was defeated by a 51.4 percent to 48.5 percent margin. It was passed initially in 2008 with a 53 percent to 47 percent advantage. Sandoval County voters in November rejected the proposed eight-year extension of a 4. 25 mill levy to support the Presbyterian Rust Medical Center and UNM Sandoval Regional Medical Center. (Greg Sorber/Albuquerque Journal) Generating about $13.5 million annually, the tax has cost the owner of a home with an assessed value of $200,000 about $282 a year. Overall, it has generated about $110 million, which has been almost evenly apportioned between the two hospitals. Advocates for renewing the levy – among them, county commissioners, the Rio Rancho Regional Chamber of Commerce, the mayors of several county communities and the Rio Rancho YES group – argued the hospitals have provided high-quality, close-to-home medical care for county residents, as well as hundreds of new jobs and spin-off economic development. Opponents of the levy, which included the Rio Rancho TEA Party, argued that, by now, the hospitals should have been positioned to pay their own way. “We are disappointed that the mill levy did not pass because without these county funds we may not be able to maintain all the services we provide today and the expanded services we had hoped to provide,” RMC Administrator Angela Ward said after the vote. Club Rio Rancho was reportedly closing its doors, after plans to sell the North Nine golf course for residential development fell through – and the club’s unpaid city water bill topped $300,000. (Rio Rancho Observer) 3. Club Rio Rancho reportedly shuts out the lights Club Rio Rancho was reportedly closing its doors after today, following a year in which plans to sell the North Nine golf course for residential development fell through – and the club ran up a tab of more than $300,000 in unpaid city water bills. Advertisement Continue reading The club and golf course have been a community mainstay for 46-plus years. In April, a Pulte Homes representative presented development plans for the dormant North Nine, proposing a $3.2 million, 145-home development. Amid opposition by a neighborhood group, the North Nine Association, that development would impinge on views and devalue their property, Pulte reduced the number of homes and separated the development into three separate parcels. At the time, club owner Jhett Browne maintained the North Nine sale was critical to keep the golf course open, saying the sale would help pay off $3 million in loans and the money he owed the city for unpaid recycled water bills. The North Nine Association wouldn’t accept Pulte’s plan, indicating it would go to court to stop the needed city zone change for the development. Application for a zone change was never made. The club closed the remaining 18 holes of the course at the beginning of December, according to sources at the country club and former club shareholder Bob Gallagher. Gallagher said Browne stopped watering and maintaining the west nine holes for cost savings in September. The remaining nine holes stopped receiving water on Dec. 1. City spokeswoman Annemarie Garcia said the club owes the city $357,532.53 in water services and penalties. On Dec. 22, Browne alerted club members and employees that the site would cease all operations and shut down on Jan. 1, according to sources at the club and Gallagher. Advertisement Continue reading 4. SandRidge backs away from exploratory drill Oklahoma-based SandRidge Energy in February withdrew its controversial application for a zone change to allow for an oil exploration and production well west of Rio Rancho. Following two months of public meetings and a decision by the Sandoval County Commission to remand SandRidge’s application to the county’s planning and zoning commission for further questioning, the energy company sent a letter to the county administration stating its decision to remove their application. David Kimmel, SandRidge director of communications, said the company planned “to focus its time, energy and resources on its proven MidContinent and Colorado assets.” SandRidge filed the zone change request in November 2015. The company anticipated drilling to a depth of 10,500 feet on two privately owned acres in the Rio Rancho Estates area. The application touched off a major public backlash – large crowds attended meetings at the Sandoval County administrative office in January and February with opponents, concerned about impacts on nearby communities and the environment without sufficient regulations in place – lashing out at the proposed drill. Despite SandRidge’s withdrawal, Sandoval County and City of Rio Rancho officials are both working to create oil and gas ordinances. 5. Economic ups and downs Advertisement Continue reading It was an up-and-down year on the economic development front, with jitter-causing layoff announcements, store closings and the opening of new businesses. In April, Intel Corp. announced plans to lay off about 12,000 employees from its global operations, or about 11 percent of the company’s total workforce, triggering weeks of local anxiety about how the Rio Rancho plant would be affected. The plant had about 1,900 employees at the time, a number that has steadily declined over the past several years. In May, it sent layoff notices to some Rio Rancho employees, but has remained mum about how many workers would be affected. One worker’s notice read that the worker’s employment would be terminated “due to site closures or consolidation” and went on to say “the expected date for the site closure or consolidation is Dec. 31.” The company has continued to decline to discuss workforce or plant changes at any company sites. In June, the Albertsons supermarket on Southern Boulevard closed, a company representative saying, “It was determined it would be best for us to close that location to strengthen our operational efficiencies.” Many of the store’s 80 employees were assigned to other store locations. In July, Hastings announced it was closing and liquidating all locations by the end of October, including its long-time location in Hilltop Plaza. There was brighter news. Advertisement Continue reading Retail development continued in the Unser corridor as well as the Plaza at Enchanted Hills. In June, PCM, California-based technology solutions company, announced plans to move into a portion of the HP building in City Center and bring 224 jobs for a call and sales center. Later that month, Safelite AutoGlass, a nationwide provider of vehicle glass repair and replacement services, announced plans to open a customer contact center in the former Sprint building, creating more than 900 jobs. PCM and Safelite are expected to bring a $34.5 million annual payroll to the city, combined. 6. Parade of elections 2016 featured a seemingly endless parade of political campaigns and elections, with a municipal election and runoff in the spring, primaries in June and a general election in November. Voters also went to the polls to decide an $84 million bond issue for CNM in February and a Rio Rancho Public Schools $60 million bond issue in August. Both measures passed. In the Rio Rancho municipal election in March, city voters approved 10 of 11 proposed charter amendments, rejecting the measure that would have substantially increased the pay for mayors and councilors elected in 2018 and after. Advertisement Continue reading They also approved a $9 million road bond. The election, though, produced only one outright winner in the races for three council seats, with former Councilor Marlene Feuer easily winning in District 4. Former Mayor Jim Owen emerged as the winner for the District 1 council seat in an April runoff against political newcomer Joshua Hernandez. Neither gained more than 50 percent of the vote in their district to win outright in the regular election. Incumbent Lonnie Clayton lost his seat in a runoff with former Councilor David Bency in a bitterly contested race. Highlighting the campaign was a claim Bency made with Rio Rancho police that Clayton had damaged one of his campaign signs. Clayton filed a complaint against Bency for making a false report after police could not substantiate Bency’s claim. Just before the runoff, police filed a misdemeanor false report complaint against Bency. A six-person magistrate court jury found Bency guilty. He was sentenced to one year unsupervised probation and ordered to pay $120 in court costs. There was a non-election change on the governing body as well. Shelby Smith stepped down from his District 5 seat in July. Jennifer Flor was appointed to serve the remaining two years in his term. In November, voters elected three new Sandoval County commissioner: Jay Block of Rio Rancho beat incumbent Nora Scherzinger in District 2; Dave Heil of Rio Rancho topped Alexis Jimenez in District 4; and F. Kenneth Eichwald of Cuba was unopposed in District 5. Two incumbents, Sandoval County Treasurer Laura Montoya and County Clerk Eileen Garbagni, retained their seats. County voters also rejected the proposed extension of a 4.25 mill levy to support Presbyterian Rust Medical Center and UNM Sandoval Regional Medical Center, but approved a $21 million flood control bond. Advertisement Continue reading 7. Improvements made to road system Residents saw their city address the deteriorating conditions on some of its most heavily traveled roads as well as rebuild or construct new projects in 2016. A $7.5 million reconstruction of Idalia Road between Iris Road and NM 528 was completed in the fall. The project created a two-lane divided road with storm drain system, bike lanes, sidewalks and curbs and gutters and installation of traffic signal at Idalia and Camino Encantadas. Construction began in November 2015. Shortly after the Idalia reopening, city officials clipped the ribbon marking completion of a $3.25 million segement of Broadmoor Boulevard between Northern Boulevard and Paseo del Volcan. The two-lane extension provides alternative access to Rio Rancho’s City Center and Sandoval Regional Medical Center and officials are hopeful it sparks new development along the Broadmoor corridor. Residents saw the fruits of the road bond issue passed in March when the city completed a $934,188 rehab of Sara Road in December. The project, begun in early October, involved milling three inches of the asphalt, sealing of existing cracks and the laying down of new asphalt. Curb ramps were constructed at intersections to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In late November, work began on the $5 million High Resort Boulevard reconstruction project between Broadmoor and NM 528. About $4 million of the fund derives from the road bond passed in March. The project, which is replacing deteriorating pavement with new pavement, providing new sidewalks and a multi-use path as well as new water lines and updated curb ramps, is scheduled to be finished in May. 8. Pay raises for future elected officials Advertisement Continue reading The Rio Rancho Governing Body adopted an ordinance in August that will raise the pay of city officials elected in 2018 and after. The ordinance sets the mayor’s salary at the most current median household income level for Rio Rancho in 2018 as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. Based on 2014 census information, the mayor’s salary will increase from its current $30,402 a year to $59,243. City councilors’ annual salaries will be set at 28 percent of the median household income in 2018, increasing to $16,588. Councilors elected in 2014 (districts 2, 3 and 5) currently earn $15,201 annually while those elected in 2016 (districts 1, 4 and 6) earn $16,127. The council action followed a decision by voters in March rejecting a proposed charter amendment to raise pay for the mayor and city council. The amendment would have raised the mayor’s annual salary to the city’s mean household income of $74,099 and city council members to 35 percent of the mean household income, at $25,934.65. Not long after the pay raise ordinance was approved, the council adopted a resolution moved by Councilor Jim Owen to create a charter review committee to look at the pay question again. Owen said he was concerned about how adoption of the pay raise ordinance might be confusing to voters after the charter amendment was turned down in March. The committee subsequently recommended no changes in the salaries set by ordinance, but proposed putting them in the charter, which would require a public vote before they could be changed. The council did not accept the recommendation and sent the matter back to the committee. Advertisement Continue reading The committee returned to the council without new recommendations and was disbanded in December. 9. A Park (soars) Above the others Rio Rancho’s unique A Park Above, designed to be accessible to children of all abilities, opened ahead of schedule in February. Bryan Stewart helps his 2-year-old daughter, Alexis, enjoy the playground equipment at A Park Above. City officials, community members and dignitaries held a ribbon-cutting ceremony in May to formally celebrate the opening of the Rio Rancho park, New Mexico’s first fully-inclusive and accessible playground. (Adolphe Pierre-Louis/Albuquerque Journal) The park sits on six acres off Westside Boulevard, across from Rust Medical Center, and features equipment designed to be therapeutic and offer children an opportunity to relax or practice motor skills. The park is complete with special playground equipment, such as swings that are wheelchair-accessible (rather than a seat, they have a platform large enough to hold a wheelchair), as well as a few rules to promote the safety of all children – for example, the only wheels allowed in the park are strollers and wheelchairs, because bicycles and skateboards could potentially frighten those with special needs or cause a collision. Also included are a water splash pad open during the summer, exercise equipment and a dog park, which was built on the same principle of inclusiveness — this time, for canines. A Park Above is the first of its kind in New Mexico, and to celebrate the milestone, Gov. Susanna Martinez was on hand for the official opening in May. The project was headed up by Jennie Schulte Riedl, community chairwoman for the Rio Rancho Rotary Club, after she visited a similar park in Lakeland, Fla., and dreamed of an all-inclusive playground in the City of Vision. In October 2013, the city broke ground for A Park Above and construction began three months later in January 2014. Advertisement Continue reading A Park Above made Albuquerque the Magazine’s 2016 “Best of the City Parks” top-five, as well as the magazine’s list of “Fun Things to Do in Albuquerque.” 10. City settles lawsuit with Curb The Rio Rancho Governing Body in February approved a $280,000 settlement agreement with Curb North Inc., ending a lawsuit filed by the company over the two-year impact moratorium imposed by the city in 2012. Curb North, the developer of the Cabezon subdivision, filed a lawsuit against the city in September 2012, shortly after the governing body approved a 24-month moratorium on residential impact fees and all of commercial impact fees in an attempt to stimulate economic growth. Curb originally sought $5.6 million in damages, arguing that the moratorium rendered accumulated impact fee credits worthless and caused the developer financial harm. Impact fees are charges developers pay to the city to cover the cost of major system-level improvements to handle the growth their developments will bring. Developers can sell impact fee credits to other developers to recover some of their expenses. Although a state district judge dismissed three of four claims against the city in March 2014, the judge held that the moratorium constituted a “government taking” in violation of state law. The court ruled, though, a final judgment would not be issued until it determined the amount of damages, which was to be decided at a trial that has been scheduled in February.

Salone Monitor.com Online Reviews By Salone Monitor Search Main menu Skip to primary content Home Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Post navigation ← Previous Next → Name Brand Computer Systems -vs- Clone Computers Posted on January 1, 2017 by admin It seems to be a popular topic online these days that when buying a computer as to whether you should go with name brand computer (i.e. Dell) or a clone system (i.e build it yourself). I have been building and repairing PC’s for a good 10 years now or so, and have built over 4000 systems worldwide from the basic home user to large law firms. Each of these types of people were faced with the same question as stated above. There are pros and cons to both and without putting you to sleep with techno-babble, I will try and be brief but succinct with my response. Name Brand – Pro’s – -Package deals – i.e. full system with all the bells and whistles for one set price. Done deal! Ready to go! -Warranty – You break it, burn it, shoot it, lose it to a flood whatever you can get coverage for a price (usually about $350 for a three-year is standard) -Support – You can call on a 24/7/365 support team that will help you after you accidentally deleted that all important windows file and just deep-sixed your operating system. Cons – -A lot of the name brand systems are proprietary — meaning that just about everything that can be integrated to the motherboard, is. This is great until you burn up a video card or lose your audio or whatever. Of course if you purchased a warranty then this will be covered unless it has expired. -A lot of times you end up with either more than you need or less than you wanted and either way it cost you $1000+ for that lesson. -If you want to add more things to your system (i.e. memory, hard drives, faster video card, etc.) you first need to call your support who will try and sell you “their” name brand product for considerably more (in some cases) that you could find if you look around the internet for a better deal. Then you have to figure out what will be compatible with your specific model and so on. CLONE SYSTEMS – Pro’s – -You can build a system from scratch or have a PC savvy friend do it and know EXACTLY what is in the box and hand choose each and every component personally. Total freedom over the decisions in building your eventual system. -You can actually add things that are replaceable like a video card. Maybe you want a 128MB now but in six months you want to upgrade to a 256MB for greater speed, with a clone system all you have to know is what type card (AGP, PCI-E) and just go get another card, pop it in and voila, done! -You can find really good deals on parts at various online shops, but it will take a little research on your part to find the best deal. I tend to stay away from eBay on PC stuff because there is too much junk being sold as legit items. -You NEVER pay for more than you want You put in exactly what you need, no more no less, and when you want to change something, you just go get it. Cons – No warranty except manufacturer’s warranty on parts and whatever warranty comes from where ever you bought the part. NOTE: If you buy a retail box processor (CPU)(AMD or Intel) they usually come with a 3 year warranty. Hard drives are starting to have 3-5 year warranties (Maxtor and Western Digital) and Memory has always been lifetime warranty (as long as I can remember). If you don’t have a pretty good knowledge of what you want you could end up with a $1000 worth of metal and junk. You don’t get the regular tech support, but if you have friends who are in the business, then that usually isn’t an issue. ————— Now, I have used and built clone systems for years and I would never use a name brand desktop PC (my personal opinion only) because my computer systems usually outperform the name brand systems. I also know that if my PC goes south on me I have the resources and so on to fix it and be back up and running should I have a major error. Now, with that having been said, there are plenty of people who own both types of PC’s and are very happy with what they have. I am not slamming anyone’s decision, I am just giving my two-cents about what I see in the industry. Dell makes great computers. So does Compaq and the others. It comes down to what do YOU need it to do? How much are you willing to spend for it? How much knowledge of PC’s (repair and maintenance) do you have and are capable of dealing with in times of need? Finally, in the case of laptops, I WOULD choose Compaq or Dell. Reason being, I don’t know any place offering parts to build your own and Compaq, for instance has awesome deals for laptops and at prices that are very reasonable for the mobility factor involving PC’s in the wireless age.

The Asus Chromebook Flip 2 will be the one of the first Chromebooks to boast support for Android apps via the Google Play Store. The new Chromebook Flip version appeared on Best Buy a few days after the same device - bearing model number C302CA - first showed up on Newegg. com. However, that listing was quickly taken down. Going by the indications from the product listing on Best Buy, the new Asus Chromebook Flip 2 will seemingly be a convertible laptop. The device, as per a 9to5Google report, will likely be shipped by Asus on January 5, 2017. According to the real product description stored in Google's cache, the key features of Asus Chromebook Flip 2 include a 12.5-inch full HD touchscreen; Intel Pentium 4405Y chip; Intel HD Graphics 515 integrated GPU; 4GB RAM; 32GB eMMC solid state drive (SSD); microSD card slot; high-definition webcam and microphone; backlit keyboard; Bluetooth 4.0; and two USB-C ports.

Swiss watchmakers, who once dismissed smartwatches as a fashion accessory, are racing to grab a share of a fast-growing market via technology partnerships and stepping up investments. "If it is true that Apple has sold around 20 million Apple Watches and has a market share of around 50 percent, then the potential is enormous," said Jean-Claude Biver, head of LVMH watch brands including TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith. "A luxury market arises as soon as people want to differentiate themselves from the masses. That is the case here as well. With our know-how, Swiss quality and prestige we have the best preconditions to master this segment too," he told Swiss paper SonntagsBlick. TAG Heuer, for instance, partnered with U.S. technology firms Google and Intel for its TAG Heuer Connected watch, whose first units offered at just under 1,400 Swiss francs ($1,375) apiece sold out quickly last year. The Swiss watch industry, which includes Swatch and Richemont, may overall be selling fewer timepieces as exports decline 15 months in a row but it is not facing an existential crisis as in the 1970s, Biver said.

(Source: Reuters) Microsoft is planning to launch the new Surface Pro 5 in the first quarter of 2017, says a report in DigiTimes quoting China’s Economic Daily News. The report adds the new 2-in-1 will come with an Ultra HD display, a magnetic charging stylus, and that Pegatron Technology will manufacture the device. The report doesn’t given any other hints or specifications about the upcoming device. For Microsoft, the Surface Pro 5 is not the only leak that has taken place. Photos of a purported Surface phone have also been shared on China’s Weibo, but need to be taken with a pinch of salt considering they resemble the old Lumia smartphones. The Surface smartphone is something that has long been rumoured, but we’ve not seen any major announcement from Microsoft on the mobile front for Windows 10. However, the Redmont-based technology giant has confirmed it will be bringing Windows 10 on ARM-architecture based processors as part of a new partnership with Qualcomm. Microsoft confirmed that in future Windows 10 users will be able to experience their desktop apps on future tablets, phones, etc which are running on Qualcomm processors. So the Surface phone might just end up making an appearance in 2017. Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book have emerged as successful devices. The company just updated its Surface lineup in October 2016. The new Surface Book i7, which indicates the use of Intel’s Core i7 processor also features NVIDIA’s GTX 965M GPU and has a 16 hour battery life. Microsoft Surface Book comes in 256GB, 512GB or 1TB storage options priced at $2,399, $2,799, and $3,299, respectively. The new Surface Studio desktop was also announced by the company at its big Surface event. Microsoft says its new Surface sales were the best in November 2016, and that its devices were preferred over Apple’s new MacBook Pro 2016. The Windows 10 maker also called Apple’s much-hyped new MacBook Pro a “disappointment”, especially for the professional consumers. We’ll have to wait and see how soon the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is introduced to the world, and whether there will be different processor versions of this, including perhaps a Qualcomm one. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: microsoft Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

Cherlynn Low, @cherlynnlow 12.31.16 in Wearables Comments 865 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Google; logo by L-Dopa When the first smartwatches made it to our wrists a few years ago, we were willing to overlook shortcomings because the product category was in its infancy. But the technology has had time to mature, and 2016 should have been an exciting year in this space. Instead, we saw a number of important brands pull out of the smartwatch race; meanwhile Google deferred major updates to 2017. Smaller but significant companies were swallowed by competitors, and the devices that did launch this year were unexciting at best. Smartwatch sales started to decline in the second quarter, and while the all-important holiday shopping numbers haven't been tallied yet, the future isn't looking good for the category. This year's new watches, such as the Apple Watch Series 2, the Fitbit Blaze and a slew of Android Wear watches, were mostly underwhelming, with merely incremental upgrades. Battery life continues to be unsatisfactory, the cases are usually still too thick, and companies still struggle to balance timeless design with futuristic functionality. Google, which originally planned to launch Android Wear 2.0 this year, is pushing that update to early 2017. The new version will apparently allow for apps that can run independently on smartwatches without requiring a companion phone, something that Apple's watchOS 2 has offered since fall 2015. Speaking of Apple, the Series 2 appears to be one of the few smartwatches that did well this year: It's received mostly positive reviews and appears to be selling decently well, although Apple did not respond to queries on actual sales numbers. Traditional watchmakers continued to smarten up their products this year, with one of the most notable being Tag Heuer and its fancy Connected watch. That thing costs a whopping $1,500, and it doesn't offer much more than the other Android Wear watches. Sure, it's a Tag, but when most Android Wear watches cost between $150 and $400, you realize that you're paying $1,200 more for yet another wearable that needs recharging every two days or so, with a display that's middling at best. The only established watchmakers that succeeded at producing decent devices (think Timex and Fossil) did so by avoiding going fully digital, sticking instead to more-conventional analog designs with hidden sensors for basic fitness tracking. Really, then, the watches that did well this year were the hybrids, with the one big exception being the Apple Watch Series 2. Then come the brands that have basically given up on making smartwatches altogether. A Motorola exec recently said the company is not working on a successor to last year's Moto 360, because it just doesn't "see enough pull in the market" to justify developing an updated model. That this kind of sentiment is coming from Motorola, of all companies, is telling. After all, the Moto 360 was the first Android Wear watch to have a round face and is one of the most well-received smartwatches running Google's software. Similarly, this year Microsoft discontinued its Band fitness wearable. Although it's more of an activity tracker, the Microsoft Band always toed the line, what with its color touchscreen and smartwatch-like features such as phone notifications and third-party app support. Unlike Motorola, however, Microsoft never explained its exit from the field, although it continues to support its suite of health apps that can run on other devices. One of the biggest signs that smartwatches are in trouble, though, was industry pioneer Pebble's recent acquisition by Fitbit for the modest sum of about $40 million. Back in its heyday, Pebble reportedly received bids from Citizen and Intel for $740 million and $70 million, respectively. The startup declined both suitors and went on to launch a new line of fitness-focused smartwatches this year. The Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 raised $12 million on Kickstarter, beating the $1 million funding goal. Despite the company's fundraising successes, Pebble failed to resolve its financial woes and eventually accepted Fitbit's offer. With so much consolidation in the smartwatch space, the future of the category looks gloomy. Less competition can mean less innovation, which can result in products growing stale and eventually fading altogether. Still, there have been developments in 2016 that could give the industry a boost. Startup Matrix Industries came up with a way to use body heat to power a smartwatch, which could eliminate (or at least alleviate) the problem of inadequate battery life. Plus, with Android Wear 2.0 slated to arrive early next year, the next generation of smartwatches will likely become more functional, giving users more reason to wear them. We also saw a few watches this year that let wearers control Amazon's Alexa from their wrist, although they ran obscure independent operating systems that barely had third-party app support. The Alexa integration means that these watches can access more than 2,000 so-called skills, letting you do things such as turn on your smart lights or thermostat, ask how much you've spent at specific stores, or buy many, many pairs of socks. You can't do most of that yet with Android Wear's OK Google command, but Alexa's expansion into watches could spur Google to improve its own assistant. So 2016 wasn't a great year for smartwatches. In fact, it was a disappointing 12 months that don't bode well for the future of the category. But there are enough upcoming potential enhancements that the industry could be revived. Components could also get smaller and more powerful over time, as they did with smartphones, eventually leading to sleeker frames housing more full-featured systems. But that's something to look forward to in the future. As for this year's smartwatches? Goodbye, and good riddance. Check out all of Engadget's year-in-review coverage right here.

Gadgets 4 0 0 December 31, 2016 Is Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Release Date Right Around The Corner? Daryl Deino The release of the Surface Pro 5 could be coming up very soon. BGR has the news. “A new report from Asia now says that the Surface Pro 5 is coming in the first quarter of 2017,” claims columnist Chris Smith, who adds that the new 2-in-1 tablet will feature an Ultra HD display and a stylus with magnetic charging abilities. Pegatron Technology is allegedly manufacturing the device, which has been hotly anticipated ever since the success of the Surface Pro 4. Currently, there are several Surface Pro 4 sales with as much as $300 off. The device has received fantastic reviews since its release in October of 2015. Tech Radar says is iterative in the best sense. “Has Microsoft at last crafted a tablet that can reasonably, without considerable compromise, replace your laptop? Short of going back to the drawing board on the battery, this looks as close as it’s going to get.” The Surface Pro 4 has received excellent reviews. [Image by Daryl Deino] The review especially praises the Surface Pro 4’s screen, the vastly improved Type Cover, and the improved Surface Pen. The only major criticism is the battery life, which a lot of others have complained about. Digital Trends also gave the Pro 4 a near perfect review. “The Surface Pro 4 is a microcosm of the change Microsoft is trying to spur inside its own walls. Time and time again, it missed the opportunity to leap on a new trend in consumer technology. But not with Surface. This time, Microsoft is a leader. It’s setting the trend. And unlike its new competitors, it’s had a few years to work out the kinks.” According to Trusted Reviews, the long wait for the Pro 5 will be worth it. “A new report claims that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will feature a 4K Ultra HD display, which would be a first for the series. By contrast, the Surface Pro 4 has a maximum 2,736 x 1,824 pixel resolution.” The article adds that the standard version of the Pro 5 may not have the 4K panel, but Microsoft might offer the display as a paid-for upgrade — this is what companies such as HP and Lenovo have been doing. This might not be a big deal to many consumers as the current 2,736 x 1,824 display is considered stunning. However, Trusted Reviews reveals that there will be a major upgrade on the processor for the Surface Pro 5. “It’s also claimed that the Surface Pro 5 will feature Intel’s new 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors,” claims columnist Sean Keach. The Kaby Lake processors will especially help with battery life since 4K screen eats up a lot of battery power. Still, there is a lot of excitement over the Surface Pro 5 on Twitter. Lots of rumours on surface pro 5 what I want are wireless charging for pen and device plus external graphics support and I am happy. — Arul (@arulprakash) December 7, 2016 I want a Surface Pro 5 for Christmas. #MicrosoftRewards #MicrosoftEvent #MicrosoftAzure — Maria (@acknowledgeit) December 21, 2016 The Dell XPS 13 is expected to turn into a tablet. [Image by Daryl Deino] The release of the Surface Pro 5 won’t come without any competition. There have been many Surface Pro 4 clones released over the past year that have not been threats to Microsoft. However, as PC Magazine reported, Dell will likely introduce a convertible tablet version of its highly successful Dell XPS 13. Some rumors have the upcoming Dell XPS 13 tablet being released with a digital pen. As the Inquisitr reported a couple months back, Apple’s next 12-inch MacBook could see Apple Pencil support, making it the first OS X device to do so. Judging by all the rumors, which device would you rather have — the Surface Pro 5, the Dell XPS 13 (tablet version), or the upcoming MacBook? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Tablet Microsoft to launch Surface Pro 5 in Q1 2017 Tablet Microsoft to launch Surface Pro 5 in Q1 2017 By Bindu Nair - Dec 31, 2016 Microsoft’s last Surface Pro came out in October 2015, leaving a lot of eager fans wondering when the next entry in the series would show up. A new DigiTimes report now claims that the new 2-in-1 will be launched in the first quarter of 2017. If true, the rumored Surface Pro 5 will likely make its debut before the end of March next year. The publication itself bases its Q1 2017 prediction on an Economic Daily News (EDN) story. The latter adds that the hybrid will probably feature an Ultra HD screen and ship with a magnetic charging stylus. Pegatron Technology has reportedly bagged the rights to manufacturing the Surface Pro 5. Microsoft has also supposedly considered adding Quanta Computer as a production partner but is yet to confirm this. The article also mentioned that the brand’s Surface Studio is experiencing strong sales momentum which will benefit Pegatron’s performance. Also Read: Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation, welcomes Google to .NET A March unveiling falls in line with a previous rumor which had alleged that the Microsoft device was coming out in spring 2017. The long delay supposedly came about because the company was awaiting the arrival of the latest 7th Gen Kaby Lake processors from Intel. The SoCs are apparently less demanding when it comes to power, translating to a healthier battery life. The Surface Pro 5 may additionally set people back by $899 for its basic model and go upwards to a $1599 price tag for the top-of-the-line one. We’ll keep you updated as and when more information about Microsoft’s Surface Pro 5 emerges out of the woodwork.

There are Ultrabooks on the market that are thicker than that, so the rumor that ASUS is cramming in a GeForce GTX 1080 inside has us excited.   Not only that, but we should see Intel's new Core i7-7700HQ processor, up to 24GB of DDR4 RAM, and super-fast PCIe x4-based NVMe SSD. We should expect ASUS to unveil the GTX 1080-powered gaming notebook next week at CES 2017. NEWS SOURCES:Nextpowerup.com Recommended for You Dell's new XPS 13 is a surprise 2-in-1 foldable tablet...

CES is where most new Windows devices were revealed in the past several years, and this year it probably won’t be any different. Now, it seems like Dell has mistakenly leaked its upcoming XPS device on its website ahead of CES 2017. The company has just revealed the upcoming convertible XPS 13, the XPS 13 2-in-1 (9365). As you can see in the image above, Dell’s XPS 13 2-in-1 will be a convertible device which you will be able to use in a couple of different modes. The device also seems to have Dell’s popular InfiniteEdge display which plays a substantial part in the device’s design. Apart from that, there really isn’t much details available on the XPS 13 2-in-1 just yet. It’s likely the XPS 13 2-in-1 will have everything that’s available on the recently updated XPS 13 and more, this obviously includes the Kaby Lake processors from Intel. We will have more coverage of CES 2017 starting tomorrow, so make sure to stay tuned to MSPU for the latest news and announcements from CES!

He died in April. By Joseph P. Kahn Globe Correspondent  January 01, 2017 Muhammad Ali — the transcendent heavyweight boxer known as “The Greatest” — championed human rights at home and abroad, a fight he undertook as courageously as any he faced in the ring. For Elie Wiesel, the struggles were intensely personal, born of bearing witness, a teen who survived the Nazi hatred and cruelty that destroyed his family and his community. The passing of these two men touched people around the world in 2016, a year that closed with a stunning staccato of bulletins about entertainment icons, among them Carrie Fisher and her sometimes collaborator, frequent foil, and mother, Debbie Reynolds; they died within a day of each other. Advertisement The dawn of the New Year offers a chance to recollect the lives and legacies of these and scores of other individuals who left lasting imprints on the region, nation, and world. The charisma of Ali and character of Wiesel particularly resonated with people from all walks of life. While Ali’s weapons were his fleet fists and feet and his lightning wit, Wiesel relied on the pen and lectern as his tools. Propelled by an intense intellectual curiosity and a prodigious gift for storytelling, he wrestled with how one can make sense of humanity’s vast capacity for evil.

Sign up for more newsletters here In doing so, the Boston University professor became “a “messenger to mankind whose message is not one of hate and revenge, but of brotherhood and atonement,’’ the Nobel committee said in bestowing its peace prize to him in 1986. Ali, who also served as a UN-appointed “messenger” of peace, “shook up the world,’’ President Obama said upon his death, “and the world is better for it.’’ The world was shaken by the deaths of several political leaders in 2016, none more polarizing than Fidel Castro, the revolutionary who seized power in Cuba in 1959 and turned it into an increasingly isolated outpost of communism. In doing so, he inspired both reverence and revulsion and turned the island into a Cold War nemesis of 10 US presidents. Associated Press photos Elie Wiesel and Muhammad Ali (front) were among those who passed on last year, along with (left to right, top to bottom) Gwen Ifill, Debbie Reynolds, David Bowie, John Glenn, Prince, Florence Henderson, Antonin Scalia, Arnold Palmer, Nancy Reagan, Janet Reno, Fidel Castro, and Harper Lee. Advertisement In Israel, Shimon Peres was an early figure in the formation of the Jewish state, helping design its defense industry and guide its rise as a military power. Yet later, as prime minister and president, he would become a dedicated peacemaker. So, too, was Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who steered the United Nations through perilous times as its sixth secretary general. The death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who was born in Cambridge, sent Thailand into intense, reverential mourning. In this nation, many Americans were often appalled by a divisive presidential election like none they had experienced in their lifetimes. Yet they were united in offering tributes to such countrymen and women as John Glenn — war hero, astronaut, senator, personification of the Right Stuff — and former first lady Nancy Reagan. Gone, too, were Janet Reno, the country’s first female US attorney general; Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a staunch constitutional originalist; Phyllis Schlafly, one of social conservatism’s leading lights; Melvin Laird, who as defense secretary sought to extricate the country from Vietnam; and Daniel Berrigan and Tom Hayden, antiwar activists who won admirers and enemies during the social tumult of the ’60s. Perhaps no realm was more staggered by loss than the music industry. Gone were a host of artists who erased boundaries both in their works and their lives: David Bowie, a glam, shape-shifting performer whose influence ranged broadly from music and film to art and fashion; the superstar forever known as Prince, a genre-bending artist who blended R&B, pop, and funk into his own intoxicating brew; singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, whose hauntingly poetic lyrics explored faith, love, death, and spiritual longing; and outlaw country troubadour Merle Haggard. Also, Glenn Frey, founding member of the Eagles; bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley; producer George Martin of Beatles fame; prog rockers Keith Emerson and Greg Lake; silver-maned singer-songwriter-producer Leon Russell; classical composer-conductor Pierre Boulez; jazz-blues pianist Mose Allison; opera stars Patrice Munsel and Phyllis Curtin; Boston Symphony Orchestra cellist Jules Eskin; pop crooners Julius La Rosa, Kay Starr, and Bobby Vee; and vocalist Natalie Cole, who passed away in the waning hours of 2015, her death not reported until early in the new year. In the last week of 2016, George Michael’s death stunned both fans of his early work with Wham! and those who saw the singer’s eventual embrace of his homosexuality as liberating. In the world of letters, it was a year to mark the deaths of Harper Lee, beloved author of “To Kill a Mockingbird”; playwright Edward Albee, who explored human intimacy and familial dysfunction in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and other riveting dramas; novelist, poet, essayist, and rugged adventurer Jim Harrison; Peter Shaffer, creator of “Equus,” “Amadeus,” and other award-winning plays; and novelist and memoirist Pat Conroy. In the art world, epitaphs were carved for Israeli-born architect Zaha Hadid, whose soaring creations sparkled with geometric brilliance; Color Field painter Walter Darby Bannard; urban architect Bing Thom; influential fashion designers Sonia Rykiel and James Galanos; and witty and prolific New Yorker magazine cartoonists William Hamilton, Frank Modell, and Robert Weber. A challenging year for journalists in general saw eulogies delivered for some of its finest practitioners. Among them were CBS newsman and veteran “60 Minutes” correspondent Morley Safer; PBS news anchor Gwen Ifill, a role model and mentor to countless young journalists; Ruth Gruber, pioneering writer, photojournalist, and humanitarian; Sydney Schanberg, globe-trotting reporter and author whose work inspired the film “The Killing Fields”; and colorful sports journalists Craig Sager of Turner Sports, ESPN anchor John Saunders, and Bud Collins of The Boston Globe, whose tennis knowledge and kaleidoscopic wardrobe helped popularize a sport he deeply loved. In addition to Carrie Fisher, an actress, activist, and brutally honest writer who soared to intergalactic fame in “Star Wars,” and her mother, Debbie Reynolds, who personified musical ebullience in such movies as “Singin’ in the Rain,’’ toasts were raised in show business circles for Gary Shandling, a groundbreaking writer-comedian-actor who created and starred in “The Larry Sanders Show”; Gene Wilder, a riotously funny actor who delighted film audiences in “Young Frankenstein,” “Willy Wonka,” and other comic masterpieces; Garry Marshall, whose writing, directing, and producing talents spawned many popular TV shows and hit movies; and actors George Kennedy, Abe Vigoda, and Alan Rickman, all equally deft at comedy or hard-boiled drama. Television families often become extensions of their audiences’ home lives. So it was for two sitcom stars whose parental roles made them pop-culture fixtures, and whose loss last year was felt by millions of fans: Florence Henderson, a Broadway leading lady best known as matriarch of “The Brady Bunch,” and Alan Thicke, a singer-songwriter embraced as America’s Dad on the hit series “Growing Pains.” Also bowing out were deadpan comedian Bob Elliott; broadcast executive Grant Tinker; stage and screen actresses Anne Jackson, Patty Duke, and Tammy Grimes; actors Hugh O’Brien, Ken Howard, and Robert Vaughn, three of TV’s most durable leading men; and actress-socialite Zsa Zsa Gabor, who paved the way for celebrities becoming famous largely, if not solely, for being famous. In 2016, sports fans observed a moment of silence for two all-time greats: Arnold Palmer, also known as The King, who assembled his own loyal army and stormed the golf world in the 1960s and ’70s, and Gordie Howe, a superb two-way hockey player whose NHL glory days stretched over five incredibly durable decades. Cheers echoed, too, for Pat Summitt, college basketball’s all-time winningest coach; baseball player and broadcaster Joe Garagiola; Florida Marlins flame-thrower Jose Fernandez, who perished in a boating accident; New England Patriots alums Bill Lenkaitis and Julius Adams; tennis great Gardnar Mulloy; Johan Cruyff, who brought balletic movement and a genius’s intuition to the soccer pitch; football coaches Buddy Ryan and Ted Marchibroda; and baseball immortals Monte Irvin, Ralph Branca, and Dave “Boo” Ferriss, who helped lead the Red Sox to the World Series in 1946. Losing visionaries who specialized in science, technology, or education is a reminder of how human knowledge advances through the power of individual genius. Computer scientist Marvin Minsky expanded the boundaries of artificial intelligence, while Seymour Papert played a similar role in computer-based education. Intel chief Andrew Grove revolutionized the semiconductor industry. Jerome Bruner’s work in cognitive psychology led to such landmark studies as “Actual Minds, Possible Worlds.” MIT molecular biologist Susan Lindquist won a National Medal of Science for her many contributions to medical and scientific progress. Local luminaries who passed from the scene in 2016 included mass transit superchief Robert Kiley; taxpayer advocate Barbara Anderson; Harvard historian and literary critic Daniel Aaron; acoustic-science pioneer Leo Beranek; MedFlight CEO Suzanne Wedel; physician Arthur Pappas, a Boston Red Sox co-owner; MIT computer engineer Jay Forrester; economist and public intellectual Lester Thurow; and Vincent “Buddy” Cianci, the charismatic Providence mayor who repeatedly resurrected his professional career despite personal failings and criminal convictions. The world would be a duller place without the inventors and innovators who come up with products and concepts that make life easier, richer, more fashionable, and more fun. With a smile of recognition, millions bade goodbye last year to Artur Fischer (flash photography), Raymond Tomlinson (e-mail, @ sign), Margaret Heldt (beehive hairdo), and Jim Delligatti (Big Mac sandwich). Finally, candles were lit in 2016 for the men and women in uniform and first responders who made the ultimate sacrifice for their fellow citizens. They shall not be forgotten as time and history march forward into an uncharted future. Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images/File 2000 Golf legend Arnold Palmer died in September at the age of 87. Joseph P.

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier) Click here for image slideshow Among deaths in 2016, a heavy toll in pop music William McDonald / New York Times News Service Published Dec 31, 2016 at 01:16PM Death may be the great equalizer, but it isn’t necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016 — consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports, and the back-to-back daughter-mother Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds — the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona — androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist — was as shape-shifting as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured his death would appear out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his — I hesitate to say merry — way, ever the wise, gravel-voiced troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, “Until then, here’s another song.” It was as if 2016 hadn’t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another pop-star death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people still can’t bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane; Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer; Glenn Frey of the Eagles; and Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man’s mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the locked-up outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis’ swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose recording-studio genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking self-regard and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golf’s first media star. The gentleman’s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of middle-class postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome — but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88; and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductor’s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake — his the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant — can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated women’s basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat cancer, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras: Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and NBA champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86, and his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the paint in a 14-year Hall of Fame career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the whites-only major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball’s first black executive, but when he died fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more vitally and urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy Reagan’s death evoked the 1980s White House, where old Hollywood glamour and well-heeled West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn’s had us thinking again about a long-ago burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War’s roiling homefront. Phyllis Schlafly’s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing’s ascension in U.S. politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Texas, to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Elián González, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel Castro’s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a cigar-smoking strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are truth-seekers, even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and, pre-eminently, Edward Albee — all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun make-believe for our viewing pleasure — none more lustily than Fisher, the nothing-dainty-about-her Princess Leia of the “Star Wars” tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother’s grief. Devotees of the “Harry Potter” movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snape’s younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor’s celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a kind of hilariously neurotic comedy well suited for a therapy-obsessed culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the “Godfather” movies and “Barney Miller,” actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his convention-defying meditations on life and art; Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives; Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics’ eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (“Adventures of Superman”), Alan Young (“Mister Ed”), Robert Vaughn (“The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”), William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on “The Patty Duke Show”), Dan Haggerty (“The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams”), Florence Henderson (“The Brady Bunch”) and Alan Thicke (“Growing Pains”). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with “Happy Days,” “Mork & Mindy,” “Laverne & Shirley” and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. Street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker’s jacket with a camera slung around his neck — what a picture! — had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art by recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music’s other precincts were emptier without conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and new music soprano Phyllis Curtin; jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri; rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor); and Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a culture-changing executive, Grant Tinker, who in the ‘80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a conscience-stricken gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone’s guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives. 16045121 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Concrete specifications are slim, but the forthcoming iteration could potentially sport a 4K display, and be bundled with a magnetic charging Surface Pen.  ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement At Microsoft's Surface-focused event late October, there wasn't any word on a Surface Pro refresh. However, the Surface Pro 4's successor might be unveiled in the next few months, with the next Surface Pro iteration expected to feature a 4K display and a magnetic charging stylus. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Rumors Microsoft is currently working on a new Surface Pro tablet, according to a new report, touting a Q1 2017 release for the tablet in question. The report, which comes from the Economic Daily News in China and was spotted by Digitimes, adds that Pegatron Technology will be the one to manufacture the device. Microsoft has also considered Quanta Computer as a possible manufacturer for the Surface Pro 5, but the company has yet to confirm its plans. In October, Microsoft unveiled a new version of its two-in-one Surface Book hybrid, and a new all-in-one desktop computer called the Surface Studio. The event was strategically scheduled ahead of Apple's event the following day, and many pundits have opined that Microsoft's show was far more compelling than Apple's. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 The Surface Pro 4, released in 2015, is Microsoft's latest Surface Pro iteration, and while there had been healthy speculation about a successor being teased during company's event in October, nary a hint of a new refreshed Surface Pro 4 was given by Microsoft, causing many to wonder about the future of Microsoft's high-end tablet lineup. The Chinese report is thin on other rumors apart from possible manufacturing partners, though it states that the Surface Pro 5 will sport an Ultra HD resolution, as previously mentioned. The stylus, named the Surface Pen, will also be released alongside the Surface Pro 5, and it will utilize magnetic charging, the first time a Surface Pro tablet would be able to do so, if the report is correct. A specific release date is unavailable as of this time, and Microsoft could still change its plans for the forthcoming Surface Pro 5 as it progresses through the manufacturing process. The Surface Pro 4 is billed by Microsoft as "the tablet that can replace your laptop," compact enough to be lugged anywhere, and powerful enough to be used as a full desktop workstation. It rocks a 12.3-inch PixelSense multi-touch display with a resolution of 2,736 x 1,824, at 267 dpi. Under the hood can either be a sixth-generation Intel core m3, i5, or i7 processor, up to 16 GB of RAM, partnered with an Intel HD graphics 515 for the Core m3 variant, Intel HD graphics 520 for the i5 variant, and an Intel Iris graphics for the i7 variant. There are also a number of SSD storage configurations for the tablet, with 1 TB being the maximum. What features would you like to see in the Surface Pro 5?
