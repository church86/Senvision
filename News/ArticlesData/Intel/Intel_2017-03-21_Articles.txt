Intel earlier on indicated that this platform would get 'only' 28 cores.  The results for the 165 Watt 32-core and 64-threaded processor are roughly 4000 points for a single core and 50000 points for the multi-core score. The base clock frequency per core would be 2.1 GHz, the results however indicate 2.3 GHz.     Purley is the successor to the Nehalem architecture, a platform based on motherboard chipset and thus the processor series. The processor platform will come enable six-channels DDR4, and AVX 512 instruction set and a new 100G OmniPath interconnect. Purley will support for no less than 8 processor sockets and will come with Cannonlake graphics and FPGA integration. The PCH is designed under code-name Lewisburg and it'll ship with new Ethernet controllers, these seem to be 10Gbps. The Purley platform is tied towards a Socket LGA 3647. This entails twelve DDR4 (384-bit wide) slots (no joke) considering this processor has a six channel memory controller.  Via hwi, Geekbench, Google. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ...

I know when i use Cinebench that it also gives "single" and "multi" threaded scores. And those scores scale fairly evenly with the addition of extra cores (like 125 single threaded and 790 for a 4 core 8 threaded CPU. So roughly 7-8x the single threaded score for a 8 thread CPU.). Why then with a 64 threaded CPU is the "multi thread" score only around 13x higher then the "single threaded" score on Geekbench? I admit tjis may be viewed as a "noob" like question but i don't really care. Can somone explain it to me? Thanks.

Much not only depends on compiler and code optimization, but on how *well* the benchmark code itself is written--to the point of whether what is being measured by a particular benchmark is even relevant to the user's software environment ...

The trend towards small footprint machines continues, but perhaps not as quickly as one might have expected in the age of smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks. The ECS Liva Z we’re reviewing today is a new generation ultra compact form factor PC, following in the footsteps of the original Liva and Liva X. Like its predecessors, Its design goals are size minimization and affordability whilst delivering the power needed to run common PC tasks. Almost all of the major PC manufacturers have a line of ultra compact PC’s these days. In times past, even a basic PC for Grandma and Grandpa to send email and browse the net meant the purchase of the stereotypical beige box ATX sized PC and chunky CRT monitor. Computers have come a long way since then. There’s no need for a PC to take up the entire table.  Today, you can get a powerful desktop PC the size of a paperback book. The potential uses for a PC such as this are vast. Whether you need power thrifty, silent and low powered office machines, embedded signage or kiosk use,  a media server or NAS front end, a HTPC or just something to save space, then a tiny ultra compact PC could be the answer.   Specifications Below are the major specifications of the Liva Z. Our sample came equipped with the Celeron N3350 SoC which is a dual core with a base frequency of 1.1Ghz and a boost frequency of 2.4Ghz. the TDP is 6.0 w which means there is no need for any active cooling. This CPU belongs to the Apollo Lake family with its CPU cores code named Goldmont. Intel claims the new SoC improves CPU performance by 30% and graphics performance by 45% over the previous generation Braswell family. This should go a long way to addressing the somewhat lackluster performance of prior Braswell equipped models. Our experience with Bay Trail and Braswell was they they lacked a bit of CPU grunt. This architectural improvement, plus the native support for HEVC and VP9 codecs means the Apollo Lake family is much more compelling. The Intel 500 Graphics is clocked at 200Mhz with a boost clock of 650Mhz, though GPUz has not been updated with full recognition of the unit  at this time.   The system can take up to 2x4Gb of DDR3L so-dimm memory. Our sample came equipped with a single Kingston 4Gb module and also a 32Gb eMMC embedded drive, upon which we installed the OS. Other noteworthy specs include the ability to accept a M.2 drive (though only a 2242 sized drive which are far less common than 2280 sized drives), AC WiFi and dual Gigabit LAN.   A Closer Look The Liva Z come boxed in an attractive package which is refreshingly free of snarling beasts, RGB everywhere and warriors with lasers that many gaming focused PC products and packages are adorned with these days. Sometimes we want our PC’s to be neither heard or seen 😉     The Liva Z comes with the following accessories: A power brick, a VESA mount with accompanying screws and a power lead. The power adapter is made by reputable manufacturer FSP and is rated for 19V and 3.42A (for a total of 65w) meaning it has more than enough power to drive the Liva Z and its peripherals without any problem. The Liva Z itself comes with a stylish design that reminds us of a record. It is small enough to sit unobtrusively on a bookshelf or entertainment stack. The build quality is very good. The feel is solid and the internal construction leaves us with no concerns. Here we get a true indication of the tiny size of the unit when using the USB ports as a reference. Obviously we have the power button on the left (with a subtle LED light when powered on), three USB 3.0 ports and a USB 3.0 Type-C port. This is quite a good configuration allowing for a KB/Mouse (or dongle) plus external storage and a port leftover for something like a camera. On the far right we see a combo headphone/speaker and mic jack.   Moving around to the rear of the unit, we have a Mini Display Port, HDMI 1.4, dual Gigabit LAN and the DC in port. These are the ports that will have cables attached to them, so having them at the rear is important. The HDMI 1.4 port means that connected 4K displays will be limited to 30Hz. While this won’t be a problem for video playback, it does limit the HDMI to simple playback and not PC type tasks where 60Hz is the norm. Luckily, the DP port is suitable if 4K 60Hz is desired.   After we open up the unit, we can see the internal slots. On the left are the dual so-dimm ports that support up to 8Gb of DDR3L memory. On the right we see the slots with a Dual Band WiFi card with ac support and also an empty SATA III M.2 slot for connecting a SSD. Though this slot will only accept 2242 drives as opposed to the far more common 2280 drives. Just to the right of the memory stick is a Sandisk eMMC embedded chip, This gives the Liva Z its 32Gb of internal storage. Adding a SSD will really add to the usability of the unit as 32Gb is eaten up far too quickly once you add the OS plus updates and a few common programs.   Here is the other side of the PCB with the N3350 SoC sitting in the center.   BIOS The ECS Liva Z BIOS is very basic compared to even a entry level motherboard. The advanced tab is where the onboard devices can be configured. Many of these are simple on or off choices. though the CPU tab is where you’ll find some more advanced options like the power management options, C-States etc. The MIB tab shows simple CPU and memory information. There’s no overclocking as you’d expect. The boot menu is where you’ll select.. gasp… the boot options, but also the OS choice and UEFI/Legacy mode. There’s really not much else to talk about, but generally simplicity means less bugs, and everything is working as it should.   System Testing Firstly, we wanted to look at temperatures of the unit when under full load. a peak of 74 after 20 minutes of full load is a touch higher than we’d like, but remember it is a passive system. The maximum temperature for this CPU is listed as 105c by Intel. Measuring power consumption at the same time, we saw the following: 4.98W at idle, and only 9.27w under load. With thrifty power use like this, you’ll hardly see an effect on your power bill.     We could run a heap of benchmarks, but we know its not going to be a world beater. It’s not for gaming beyond something like your Facebook games, you won’t encode video with it or do  anything productivity wise. It will run office applications perfectly well and surf the internet with media rich applications, but it is no match for a proper desktop PC. On the flipside, a desktop is no match for the Liva Z’s minuscule power consumption and foot print. They are just not comparable. A quick test of the built in eMMC card doesn’t reveal many surprises. It wold be advisable to add a M.2 drive to the Liva Z as 32Gb is just enough to put the OS on, and not much more.   Given the Liva Z’s likely usage scenario will be as a media consumption machine, we ran a couple of demanding files to see how the unit would handle them. The results were excellent. The first file is a copy of The Martian, streamed over Wifi and played back via MPC-HC. It is a x264 encoded file with DTS MA audio. The average bit rate is 57Mbps and the total file size is over 60Gb, making this a tough one to play. The Liva Z played it back with no stuttering at all. The CPU usage is quite high at around 50-60% but this is fine given the low power nature of the CPU. We don’t have a high quality HEVC encode of this nature, but given the fixed function ability of Apollo Lake SoC’s to playback HEVC content, we’re quite sure this won’t present any problem.   The second file is a high bit rate encode of Inception weighing in at around 12Gb. CPU usage is lower at around 30-40%.   Finally we ran a test of the WiFi speed. Our router is located through a wall in the next room, so your speeds may vary. 26 megabytes per second is not too bad for an average WiFi card. Conclusion Tiny PC’s like the Liva Z will never win the performance war. It cannot run Crysis and you won’t be able to render a Pixar movie with it. What it will do is perform admirably in day to day PC tasks. Simplicity is the name of the game here. Its purpose is to do the basics with no fuss with the tasks most people use a PC for. Internet surfing, email, office apps, media consumption and app style gaming. With a price in the range of $180 USD for the tested version, considering this low price along with low power use, compact size, zero noise and we think the ECS Liva Z is superb value for money. Also bear in mind that many barebones units don’t come with internal storage or memory, whereas the Liva Z comes with both installed. If you have a specific task such as digital signage, media playback, an office machine, as a NAS front end, a digital kiosk, video surveillance, or as a basic Internet machine for grandma and grandpa, then the ECS Liva Z can serve these purposes and serve them very well. We tested the Liva Z as the front end of a NAS, and in this capacity it performed basically flawlessly. High bitrate 4k video over WiFi was no problem. You’ll be able to put it in a bedroom, on a shelf in the living room, or a man cave and enjoy an unobtrusive PC that does its job.       Pros: Stutter free high bit rate 4K HEVC playback over WiFi Great value Low power usage and silence Expandability and connectivity options Solid build quality   Cons: HDMI 1.4 only 32Gb eMMC is limiting   Leave a comment SCAN THIS QR CODE WITH YOUR PHONE Close Next Post UBTech Launches Cute And Creepy Robots In Singapore Tags © 1999 - 2016 VR Zone AP Pte.

The games, viewable using the Oculus NCAA March Madness Live VR app for Samsung’s Gear VR, won’t be free. For $2.99 per game, or $7.99 for all six, fans will receive a courtside view from several virtual reality cameras, with a special audio broadcast. For $1.99 per game, fans will receive the view from one courtside VR camera, with audio from the CBS broadcast. The VR broadcasts start with Thursday’s West region semifinal games in San Jose, but don’t include games played in the three other regions. However, the networks, Intel and the NCAA have signed a multiyear partnership to use Intel’s True VR technology. Wall Street Markets take precipitous fall Stocks took their biggest loss in five months Tuesday as a health care bill backed by President Trump ran into trouble in Congress, which raised some questions about his agenda of faster economic growth spurred on by lower taxes and cuts in regulations. Banks plunged as bond yields continued to fall, which will mean lower interest rates on loans. Transportation companies including airlines, railroads and rental car companies dropped, and so did steel and chemicals makers. The dollar weakened. Small-company stocks, which stand to benefit the most from Trump’s policy proposals of lower taxes and looser regulations, fell more than the rest of the market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index tumbled 29.45 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,344.02. That was its biggest drop since Oct. 11. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 237.85 points, or 1.1 percent, to 20,668.01. The Nasdaq composite surrendered 107.70 points, or 1.8 percent, to 5,793.83. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks plunged 37.55 points, or 2.7 percent, to 1,346.55. Four-fifths of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange fell. Retail Bebe may go online only Bebe Stores, the Brisbane women’s apparel chain with locations across the country, is reportedly planning to shut its stores and seek a turnaround as an online brand. The company is trying to close the locations without filing for bankruptcy, said people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the efforts aren’t public. However, Chapter 11 may be required if enough landlords aren’t willing to negotiate, they said. The company, known for selling trendy going-out apparel to young women, has been operating about 170 boutique and outlet stores. Bebe would become the latest retailer to shed brick-and-mortar stores and hitch its fortunes to e-commerce. Kenneth Cole Productions said in November that it would close almost all of its locations, concentrating instead on its online businesses. A consumer shift to the Internet has contributed to several retail bankruptcies this year. Unlike many retailers, Bebe has no significant debt. But it has lost about $200 million over the past four years, and negotiating with landlords to get out of leases may prove difficult. The company didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Manny Mashouf, who founded the company in San Francisco in 1976, owns 57 percent of its stock. He remains chairman and CEO, but last year, Bebe sold half of its brand to Bluestar Alliance to develop a wholesale licensing business, a move that helped raise cash. The stock has fallen more than 80 percent over the past two years, though it began to rebound last month. Banking Wells ATMs to use phones Wells Fargo plans to upgrade all 13,000 of its ATMs next week to allow customers to access their funds using their cell phones instead of traditional bank cards. The announcement was made Tuesday by Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have announced similar upgrades to their ATMs, but they have not implemented the changes yet. Wells would be the first to offer the feature across the United States. To access their money, customers would get unique eight-digit codes from their Wells Fargo smartphone app, and enter the code into the ATM along with their PIN. The machines will accept debit cards as well. The codes will not work on the secure doors that many branches have for nonbusiness hours that require an ATM or debit card to gain entry. Wells Fargo said those secure doors are found at a small percentage of branches, mostly in major metropolitan areas. Earnings FedEx hurt by fuel costs Income and revenue rose during the peak holiday season at FedEx, but higher fuel costs helped keep profit below Wall Street’s forecast. Holiday-season package volume was the heaviest ever, and the big package-delivery company continues to benefit from the growth in online shopping. FedEx said Tuesday that it earned $562 million in its fiscal third quarter, up 11 percent from a year earlier, and revenue increased 19 percent. Adjusted profit, which excludes costs related to the acquisition and restructuring of TNT Express, was $2.35 per share. That was well short of the $2.63 per share forecast by analysts. Third-quarter revenue of $15 billion was slightly higher than the analysts’ prediction of $14.96 billion. General Mills sees profit dip A decline in the sales of “light” yogurts hurt the bottom line in the third fiscal quarter, General Mills said, reporting a 20 percent dip in U.S. yogurt sales. Profit fell 1 percent to $357.8 million (61 cents per share). Adjusted for restructuring costs and nonrecurring costs, the company said that earnings came to 72 cents per share, a penny more than analysts had expected.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest How AI startups and tech giants collaborate to do good deeds Mariya Yao, Topbots@thinkmariya March 21, 2017 4:10 PM Tags: ai, artificial intelligence, Clinc, Diane Bryant, farmlogs, healthcare, Intel, intel ai, intel sports group, medicine, missing children, NCMEC, Social Good, sports AI startups have discovered there’s value to partnering with tech giants like Intel, Google, and IBM. Entrepreneurs bring the domain expertise, ingenuity, and passion, while large enterprises provide the unparalleled compute and storage capabilities critical to building modern AI systems. “Ninety percent of the world’s supercomputers run on Intel technology,” Diane Bryant, who leads Intel’s Data Center Group, told me at SXSW. “And 95 percent of artificial intelligence solutions run on Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi processors.” Graphics processing units (GPUs), once popular mainly with gamers chasing visual performance, inside computers represent images as matrices. Turns out the deep neural nets that power our current AI craze also depend heavily on matrix operations, making GPUs suddenly very useful for AI research. Nvidia’s stock price shot up 224 percent in 2016, making its CEO Jen-Hsun Huang even richer. Intel’s Xeon Phi competes directly with Nvidia’s GPUs. When asked about Intel’s competitive advantage, Bryant explained the difference between a general purpose GPU, or GPGPU, and specialized computing technology: “Nervana technology is designed specifically for neural networks. There’s no overhead of pixel processing like for GPGPUs, so there’s a 2-4x improvement with specialized computing.” Everyday applications for AI Every major tech company in Silicon Valley is battling to gain ground in self-learning technologies. Artificial intelligence is now table stakes for technology enterprises — and it benefits more than just shareholders. Consistent architecture and specialized hardware make life simpler for developers building AI applications. On stage at SXSW, Bryant invited several entrepreneurs and executives building on top of Intel technology, including Jason Mars of Clinc and Luca Candela of FarmLogs, to demo their technology. Above: Jason Mars demos the financial chatbot Finie made by his company, Clinc. Image Credit: Intel Corporation. Clinc built a powerful digital assistant named Finie to allow you to converse with your bank account. If you’re the type who hates accounting, you can simply ask Finie questions like “How much did I spend on my Vegas trip last month?” and she’ll intelligently parse your request and get an answer to you right away. FarmLogs applies AI to help farmers automatically track farm activity, analyze crop health, and answer questions about optimal crop rotations. Bryant also highlighted several Intel AI projects advancing innovation in sports, health care, and humanitarian causes. An athlete seeking performance analytics normally needs to incur an expensive lab visit, where sensors are placed on his or her body for tracking. Using AI-assisted motion capture technology, athletes and their coaches can get real-time feedback on the spot with mobile devices. Above: Diane Bryant tests the AI-Assisted Motion Capture Technology made by the Intel Sports Group. Image Credit: Intel Corporation AI that can save lives “Half of men and one third of women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetimes,” said Bryant. “The average accuracy for human radiologists is 75 percent. For machines, it’s 85 percent. Intel health care technology is already commercially deployed in China and has served over 5,000 patients.” Intel also has a partnership with Penn Medicine, which uses AI to mitigate hospital re-entry due to heart failure and correctly identify 20 percent more at-risk patients. In another use of AI, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) seeks to identify underage sex trafficking victims who end up on pornography sites. NCMEC has a hotline for callers to report suspected child pornography, which received over 10 million alerts in 2016. Each alert can take over 30 days to process due to the difficulty of matching photos on porn sites to NCMEC’s huge database of missing children. With AI from collaborators Intel, Microsoft, and Google, this monthlong process is reduced to a single day, since computers do visual matching much faster at scale than humans can and can shortlist the highest potential matches for staff review. Above: Matching outdated photos of missing children to possible photos of them found on the internet is a challenge AI helps solve. Image Credit: Intel Corporation. “You need scale to achieve a meaningful AI result,” Bryant warned. While AI startups crop up every day, the enormous scale and infrastructure that tech titans like Intel, IBM, and Google have enable them to apply the requisite compute and storage capabilities to tough problems in health care and social good. Google’s DeepMind, originators of AlphaGo, the deep learning algorithm that defeated 17-time international Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016, also has a department dedicated to AI for health care research. To tackle the issue of legacy and paper-based systems in hospitals, DeepMind Health’s first product is a mobile app called Streams that promises to centralize essential patient information and serve timely alerts at the moment of care. IBM Watson is similarly prioritizing health care with AI solutions for genomics, oncology, drug discovery, personalized care, patient engagement, and clinical trials. While technology giants may be fighting a zero-sum game for AI dominance, humanity and society still benefit from their constant, rapid-pace investment in powerful new hardware and algorithms.

Life Buy/Sell CARDS BLUES MU FORUMS CHATS PREPS GOLF College Sports AP Watch March Madness on Samsung Gear VR Mar 21, 2017 (…) The men's college basketball championship—otherwise known as March Madness—will be broadcast in virtual reality again this year, this time thanks to a new partnership between Intel, TV broadcasters, and the NCAA. Similar to Microsoft's arrangement with the NFL to supply coaching staff with Surface tablets, Intel will be setting up its True VR and 360 Replay technology at March Madness games starting with the Sweet 16 round. Fans can watch via the NCAA March Madness Live VR app, downloadable in the Oculus store for the Samsung Gear VR headset. Unfortunately, while the app showed March Madness games last year for free, you'll need to pay for the privilege now that Intel is the NCAA's exclusive VR live games provider. A Gold membership costs $2.99 per game. It offers fully produced VR coverage from multiple camera angles, much like you'd expect from a traditional TV broadcast. The Silver membership, meanwhile, costs $1.99 per game, and will give you access to a 180-degree feed from a single courtside camera along with commentary from CBS's usual gaggle of announcers and reporters, including Jim Nantz. This might be the option to consider if you're prone to motion sickness in virtual reality, since you can control your position in the virtual world. To capture all of the action, Intel will use 48 cameras grouped into pods of 12 each for the Sweet 16, and 84 cameras for the Elite Eight and later rounds. There will also be 28 5K cameras devoted to capturing footage for Intel's 360 Replay technology, which affords close-ups of a game clip from every angle and requires servers capable of processing up to 1 terabyte of data per 15 to 30 second clip.

Press Release Receive press releases from Institute for Corporate Productivity (i4cp): By Email RSS Feeds: Five Organizations Recognized for Next Practices at i4cp's 2017 Conference Ford, Intel, Cigna, Ingersoll Rand, and BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee Recognized with i4cps Next Practice Awards Seattle, WA, March 21, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Five leading organizations were recipients of i4cp's 2017 Next Practice Awards in recognition of their implementation of outstanding innovations and achievement in the advancement of people practices. i4cp's Next Practice Awards celebrate and highlights leading-edge people practices and the organizations implementing them to positively impact the bottom-line. The winners were announced today at the i4cp 2017 Conference: Next Practices Now, in Scottsdale, Arizona. Ford Motor Company, Intel, Cigna, Ingersoll Rand, and BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee were selected as winners from among 11 semi-finalists for HR initiatives ranging from employee development to team analytics. Recent research by i4cp has found that effective learning and development techniques and workforce planning are two critical ways to both mitigate talent risk and have positive impact on market performance; many of the submissions by the award recipients centered on initiatives to improve the employee experience and mitigate talent risk. - Ford Motor Company – as part of the company’s commitment to creating value by extending Ford’s vision of making people’s lives better, the HR leadership team selected seven HR employees from all regions and levels across the organization to create a People Lab to take a customer-centric approach to improving the employee experience. The People Lab produced several key deliverables that are at the core of Ford’s HR transformation efforts, including a new employment value proposition. - Intel – in an effort to provide managers with research-based knowledge and tools to assess and improve the teams they manage, and to create the most effective teams possible, Intel conducted an in-depth study of both existing third-party research and internal analysis into team effectiveness. The technology firm developed a quantitative team metric that provides clear feedback and ongoing development for team leaders, as well as an assessment that has been administered to 34 teams so far. - Cigna – to strengthen its commitment to the Cigna brand promise and better meet customers’ needs, Cigna identified a variety of ways to improve its onboarding and ongoing training programs using interpersonal learning techniques to create an overall learner-driven, content-rich experience. One area of focus was the creation of an immersive soft-skills development program called Developing Emotional Connections. - Ingersoll Rand – the company created a new approach to career development called Career Progress, which combines new career management resources and a more consistent way to organize jobs across the company. Together, these components help employees better understand where their jobs fit in relation to others, and assess and plan short- and long-term development at the company. - BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee – the non-profit healthcare organization consolidated all of its existing career development events, activities, and learning opportunities together to design careers around experiences, not positions; motivate employees with employability, not title progression; build better awareness for internal opportunities; and create a talent brokerage for managers to share talent, among other programs. The discovery of next practices—human capital tactics and/or strategies that few companies are employing but that are highly correlated with market performance—is one of the Institute for Corporate Productivity’s (i4cp) primary focuses. To that end, i4cp looks to its network of member organizations to uncover world-class examples of next practices in action. The Next Practice Awards showcase the design, implementation, and measurement of innovative people practices that effectively address current business challenges. Organizations ranging from established Fortune 500 firms to those going through massive overhauls represented 2017's 11 semi-finalists and included BASF, Booz Allen Hamilton, Prudential, TIAA, Sears, and T-Mobile. The winners’ submission, as well as those of other semi-finalists, will be featured on the i4cp website starting in mid-April at http://www.i4cp.com/nextpractices (available exclusively to i4cp member organizations). About the Institute for Corporate Productivity (i4cp) i4cp is a human capital research firm that discovers the people practices that drive high performance. Ranked among the fastest-growing companies on the Inc. 500|5000 list for four consecutive years, i4cp provides its extensive member network of leading global employers and government institutions with the research, peer collaboration, tools, and data essential to developing and executing workforce strategies and practices that deliver higher market performance.

Virtual Reality streaming for the tournament is back this year, but with a price and new sponsor. Intel and the NCAA became exclusive partners and plan to offer six of the remaining tournament games in virtual reality. There are two subscription levels for those who wish to give it a try. For the Gold option, viewers can pay $2.99 per game or $7.99 for all six games. They will experience multiple courtside views, crowd noise and commentary specifically geared for them. Spero Dedes, Steve Smith and Lisa Byington will call the game exclusively for those watching with virtual reality headsets. The Gold subscribers will be shown views from the seven camera pods Intel will place around the court. Each pod contains 12 separate cameras. Silver subscribers will pay $1.99 for each game with no deal for all six games. They will see the game from one 180 degree courtside camera and receive the CBS commentary done by Jim Nantz, Grant Hill, Bill Raftery and Tracy Wolfson. Only those with the Samsung Gear VR headset are allowed to watch the games. Viewers also have to download the March Madness VR app for free in order to stream it.   The Sweet 16 begins Thursday and two of the games will be available; Gonzaga vs. West Virginia and Arizona vs. Xavier. Only one elite eight game in San Jose will be broadcasted, but both the final four games as well as the championship game will be offered. There are more virtual reality headset options beside the Samsung Gear VR, but Intel and NCAA decided to focus on the most t prevalent headset, they said. James Carwana, GM of Intel’s sports group told Yahoo  it signed a multi-year deal with the NCAA for this reason. It is focused on getting the games out to the largest demographic during the first year and can focus on providing the games to other company’s virtual reality gear in the next few. Intel provided virtual reality streams of four NFL games as well as highlights this past season and expect to expand their reach with their recent purchase of Voke. Voke showed three March Madness games in VR during last year’s tournament. Forrester Research estimates there will be 52 million virtual reality headsets in homes by 2020. While VR hasn’t exploded yet in the United States, experts believe it will gain traction the more things are specifically developed for it.

He's been writing about tech since 2009, has far too many phones, and got a Tesla because it was the biggest gadget he could find. You can follow him on Twitter at @derekakessler. Intel lost the war for mobile silicon before they even realized it had started. With their purchase of Mobileye they're fighting to not miss out on self-driving cars too. Odds are good your computer has an Intel processor inside. Intel dominated the early years of the personal computer boom and has dominated ever since, despite chief rival AMD's best efforts. But the PC is dead, or at least has one foot in the grave. Sales are falling year after year as more and more people turn to mobile devices powered by ARM-based chips made by Qualcomm and Huawei and Samsung and Apple. ARM chips are even starting to encroach on the PC business and servers, threatening to pull Intel's bottom line out from under them. Intel missed the mobile boat. Big time. Their chips were never able to match Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors or Apple's in-house A-series chips in terms of performance, efficiency, or price. There's no chance left for Intel in mobile — they tried, they failed, and they've acknowledged as much. But Intel's a big company with huge assets and many shareholders that would prefer the company continue to operate, be relevant, and turn profits. So what's Intel to do? They're turning to the next big computing revolution: autonomous cars, through their purchase of Mobileye. Autonomous driving is just starting to heat up, and it's going to be a driving force in growth for both the automotive sector and in technology for years to come. There's a reason that everybody from Apple and Google to Tesla and Ford is investing billions in autonomy: there are billions and billions more to be made. But we're in the earliest days of it right now, and that's where Intel's opportunity lies, and where they've been working relatively quietly for the past few years. No company produces the components for self-driving cars entirely in house. The cameras, radars, lidars, sensors, processors, software, and controllers are all sourced from a variety of vendors. Some manufacturers, like Tesla, have demonstrated an aptitude for pulling together these technologies in innovative and exciting ways that push the boundaries of technology, comfort, and the law. Tesla advertises their new cars as being fully equipped to handle full self-driving someday, once the software is complete. The eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and radar all feed into an NVIDIA Drive PX 2 — a computing system designed and built by NVIDIA for the express purpose of autonomous driving. Intel missed the mobile boat. Big time. They'll be damned if they miss autonomous driving too. NVIDIA has separately partnered with automotive parts supplier Bosch to build their own "AI car computer system" capable of self-driving. This system will be sold to car manufacturers; it won't quite be plug-and-play, but more capable and powerful than what the typical automotive manufacturer will be able to produce. Tesla's first generation of Autopilot hardware was simpler, with just one camera looking forward. It was capable of basic lane and distance keeping as well as slightly more advanced lane changing. That system was designed and built in conjunction with Mobileye, though the partnership fell apart on Tesla's desire for more data from the camera that Mobileye could not or would not provide. So while Tesla is going their own way and building a new Autopilot software suite and dataset from scratch, Intel is following the route of NVIDIA and Bosch to eventually offer their own comprehensive self-driving hardware system with their acquisition of Mobileye. Self-driving cars require a few things. One is full and redundant environmental awareness. Tesla's cars are equipped with multiple overlapping cameras, sensors, and radar. Google's self-driving test cars are equipped with cameras and lidar. The self-driving cars that Uber is testing are decked out with a veritable cornucopia of sensors. All of that means there's a huge amount of data flowing to the computer to the processed, and it needs to be processed accurately, smartly, and quickly. This means you need massive computing power. While power efficiency in that computer would be appreciated, in the end it's the raw processing power that's far more important, and if there's anything that Intel is good at, it's making processors that are powerful. With enormous power reserves on tap, the self-driving car plays to Intel's strengths far more than mobile ever could. The $15 billion purchase of Mobileye pulls together a company with expertise in the hardware and software of self driving and a Silicon Valley behemoth with the chips that can power it and the coffers to accelerate those efforts. Smartphones have become a $500-billion-a-year business in less than a decade. Automotive has been an enormous industry for decades and its stability is about to be rocked by the advent of autonomy. By snapping up a leader in the nascent autonomous driving tech industry, Intel is positioning themselves to take advantage of the coming changes. Intel missed out on mobile. They'll be damned if they miss out on self-driving cars too. 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

The bet is quite an expensive one for Intel, pricing Mobileye at about 21 times expected 2017 revenue — more than six times the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average. Intel will pay $63.54-per-share, a premium of about 33% to Mobileye’s closing price on Friday. Mobileye’s cameras, sensor chips and other technologies help autonomous vehicles safely navigate streets. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. “The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business,” Reuters said. Intel had not been a significant player in the sector but the deal could put it in direct competition with such companies as Nvidia and Qualcomm. “In October, Qualcomm acquired automotive chip supplier NXP for $47 billion, further fueling Intel’s need to quickly get on board the automotive wave,” Recode noted. “That’s especially true given Intel missed the mobile wave and is attempting to make up for it through investments in virtual reality and self-driving technology.” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich estimates self-driving will be a $70 billion industry by 2030. The company had previously partnered with Mobileye and BMW to bring autonomous cars to city streets by 2021 and had acquired a 15% stake in Here, a digital mapping business. Some investment analysts raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price, but Betsy Van Hees of Loop Capital Market said the deal was “a tremendous opportunity for [Intel] to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities.” “This deal makes Intel a Tier 1 partner for the automotive industry,” Martin Birkner, an automotive analyst at Gartner, told The New York Times.

Here's why Chipzilla's making this move. Motley Fool Staff Mar 21, 2017 at 11:35AM Last week, Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) announced that it was going to be acquired by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in a mammoth $15.3 billion deal. In this clip from Industry Focus, Fool analysts Sean O'Reilly and Simon Erickson explain what Intel wants from the tiny and not particularly profitable auto tech company, how this compares to Intel's previous acquisitions, and what this probably means for the chip giant's long-term growth strategy. Also, they explain a few reasons that some analysts are less than keen on the buy. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on March 16, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: Simon, earlier this week, we got big news that Mobileye had agreed to be acquired by none other than computer-processing chip juggernaut Intel. I immediately thought of you, quite frankly, when I saw this news. I was like, "Oh my gosh, Simon is going to lose his mind." It's perfect that you're at South by Southwest. Mobileye, as I understand, it has never been a premium pick for The Motley Fool, but to my knowledge, we all talk about it a lot at headquarters. Why is this such a big deal? Simon Erickson: I think it's a confirmation for a lot of people that self-driving cars is not just a pipe dream or a science project. We saw some pretty aggressive forecasts for autonomous vehicles come out from Goldman [Sachs] last year, which said that it would go from being a $3 billion market in 2015 -- which wasn't even a commercial market, that was more an R&D market led by Google -- O'Reilly: I was going to say, how are we defining "market"? [laughs] Erickson: Yeah, mostly just R&D work. Tesla has the Autopilot in all the vehicles it's shipped since 2014. Google has those little eggs driving around, if you've ever seen one of those. O'Reilly: Oh, yes. Erickson: But, they're saying it's going to be a $100 billion market in the next 20 years by 2025. When you see numbers like that, that are so small but growing so quickly, as an investor it demands your attention. Now, you see a company like Intel, that's really putting its money where its mouth is with this $15 billion acquisition, I think it adds a lot of credibility to those forecasts saying this is a real industry that's really going to come to fruition. O'Reilly: Have you guys spent much time, on the premium side, talking about Intel? Are they off their rocker here? Because Mobileye, as I understand it, is not terribly profitable at present. Erickson: That's right. Mobileye has working relationships with about 30 of the auto OEMs. They've committed, with Intel's partnership, to basically have a fully functional self-driving car by 2021. That puts us four years in the future that we should start seeing these out on the roads. But the step that was really required, before they could really make a big acquisition like this, was back in August, when Intel paid $400 million for Nirvana Systems, which was the AI platform that was necessary for self-driving cars and any kind of artificial intelligence. Now that they have that, Mobileye can really develop the vertical for automotive. Intel was here at South by Southwest. They talked a lot about AI. They're investing heavily in this because they don't want to fall behind the other big companies like IBM and NVIDIA that are also investing heavily in there. O'Reilly: Right. I'm sure they have a big eye over at NVIDIA, because, we both grew up with Intel processing being in basically every personal computer we ever owned. Then, NVIDIA was the graphics chips guys. Now, NVIDIA, there's whispers of them being the driverless-car stock. I wanted to give our listeners some context for just how crazy, numerically, this purchase is. 2011, Mobileye's net revenue -- do you know this off the top of your head, Simon? Erickson: No. Go right ahead, Sean. O'Reilly: $19.2 million. Total revenue. It's been growing like crazy, that's awesome. Last year, revenue came in at the year-end, December 31, at $358 million. Actually, I misspoke a bit earlier, they made $100 million, excuse me. But, they paid $15 billion for a company that is generating revenues of $358 million and profits of $108 million. The P/E ratio there is not great. Erickson: It's through the roof, right? O'Reilly: A little bit. You can't do a discounted cash flow model on something like Mobileye. What do you think Intel is thinking? You're talking about, they don't want to be left behind, and that's fine. But at that point, it becomes a defensive move. Do you think this is actually worth more than $15 billion right now? Erickson: I think it's a shift in Intel's strategy. Automotive has always been a huge industry. The U.S. alone spends $500 trillion a year on the wholesale vehicles, just on selling the cars up front. On top of that, we spend another $250 trillion a year on insuring vehicles with auto insurance. I say a shift in strategy -- this has always been a very large industry. It's just a matter of, before you had cloud computing and AI platforms and internet everywhere to connect everything and make sense of it, there wasn't really a possibility of having self-driving cars. Now I think is the time, and you really see Intel capitalizing on this. Do you remember the last big acquisition that Intel had, Sean?! It was McAfee back in 2011, which was about an $8 billion acquisition. That's the last really big acquisition that Intel has had. O'Reilly: So, this is enormous. Erickson: Yes, it is. With Intel, we've gotten in the habit of seeing $1 billion a year on acquisitions since then. They typically spend $5 [billion] to $10 billion on stock buybacks, and $4 billion a year on dividends. So, it's typically been a tech company that's legacy, they've been using their cash flows just on dividends and buybacks. Now, all of a sudden, you see this $15 billion acquisition of Mobileye, you have to assume this means they're back stepping on the accelerator, to use a bad pun, back into growth mode again. O'Reilly: Yeah. Last year, in 2016, Intel's net income was $10 billion, cash from operations was $21 billion, and capex was $9.6 billion. So, free cash flow of around $11 billion. This is a chunk of change, for sure. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Sean O'Reilly has no position in any stocks mentioned.

By Jason Perlow for Tech Broiler | March 21, 2017 -- 12:57 GMT (05:57 PDT) | Topic: Cloud While there are many milestones in the history of computing, few are as important as the introduction of the Intel 8086 microprocessor, a 16-bit CPU that laid the foundation for the client-server, multi-tier systems architecture that dominates just about every IT environment today, 40 years after it was brought to market in 1976. Other than the IBM mainframe, which began with the System/360 in 1964 and used code that can run emulated on modern IBM System z systems in 2017, no computing systems architecture has managed to survive the ages in widespread, continuous use that long. Cloud TV How business leaders are embracing cloud services The cloud is disrupting traditional operating models for IT departments and entire organizations. Read More In industry terms, where major paradigms tend to shift every five or 10 years, the x86 is a true dinosaur. Although the Intel x86 architecture was first released with the introduction of the 8086 microprocessor in 1976, it wasn't until 1981 when an 8-bit derivative, the 8088, was chosen for the original IBM PC. As PC generations evolved, it gave rise to the 286, the 386 (which was the first 32-bit version), the 486, the Pentium, the Pentium Pro, the Pentium II, the Pentium III, the Pentium 4, and so on. Depending on who you talk to, it is generally regarded that we are now in the seventh generation of the Intel x86 architecture. A lot of things have transpired in the IT industry since 1981. Workgroup LANs, PC servers, enterprise servers, multi-tier applications, wide area networks, widespread internet use, virtualization, and now the cloud, just to name a few. Never mind the utter explosion of mobile device proliferation, and I'm also ignoring the Open Source revolution, as well as a bunch of other things related to software development methodology and multiple generations of programming languages. In the cloud, x86 is still king. The reason for this is that workloads running in public cloud today are predominantly Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) based. Is x86 still a valid systems architecture in a hyperscale, containerized world that is increasingly cloud-based? For organizations undertaking migrations of on-premises workloads to the cloud or doing hybridized workloads, this makes the most sense, because it doesn't require complete redesigns or re-architecture of the applications. In IaaS, you are virtualizing entire OS images on the cloud fabric just as you would in your datacenter, and the virtual networking and storage can be set up to mimic your existing on-premises environment. Certain changes may need to be made to incorporate automation for optimizing consumption, as well as security and identity management, but overall, the workloads running in the cloud work the same in IaaS as they do in your datacenter. That's the beauty of IaaS. The problem is that IaaS is an extremely inefficient way to run cloud workloads. It's very resource-intensive, which translates into high billable costs to the end-customer unless the aforementioned workload optimization for consuming resources takes place. And not every app can be optimized in that way. Public clouds bill for every virtual machine that is turned on and running, regardless of the CPU utilization. And while "basic" storage is extremely cheap and billed out per gigabyte, high performance "premium" storage, such as what is offered in Azure, is billed out per SSD, whether you use all of it or not. Also: How ethics migrate to the cloud | Cloud migration: Dipping in a toe before diving all in | How to build a multi-cloud strategy | Secure your clouds across AWS, Azure, and more Platform as a Service (PaaS) workloads, however, are much less expensive, because the cloud provider is giving you access at the application programming interface (API) level, not at the VM level. You are billed on how many API calls or transactions you eat, so it is more utility-based. But PaaS does require a complete re-thinking of how applications are written, and it is a "born in the cloud" approach rather than a like-for-like application migration approach. So, right now, most PaaS things running are turn-key applications and services written by the cloud vendor or the SaaS provider, not applications written originally in enterprise environments. They are net-new types of things. I think it is fair to say that as long as IaaS exists, the x86 platform will exist. If the workloads running on x86 systems stay relatively unchanged in enterprise environments, x86 is likely to be around for a long time to come. Containerization However, changes are afoot. One of the more talked about technologies is containerization, which is a transitionary technology between full virtualization/IaaS and PaaS. Containers are in effect the building blocks for creating PaaS apps. special feature Enterprise Apps: The Next Generation Enterprise applications power the heart of business productivity, but they are traditionally difficult to implement, upgrade, and innovate. We look at how the next generation of enterprise apps could change the game. Read More Containers are much more efficient that VMs because they allow much more granular consumption of cloud/server resources. Containers permit many application instances to run within a single OS kernel instance while using cloned instances of shared resources and security constructs -- along with separate storage accounts -- to create cloud multi-tenancy that otherwise would require VMs to perform the isolation. The other huge benefit of containers is that containerized apps are "packaged" up like zip files or JAR files. They contain everything they need to run; as long as the host operating system supports containerization, these apps will run without additional modification and with minimal additional configuration. Additionally, since container hosts share a single instance of an operating system, patch management and other configuration-related issues are simplified. The only commonality that a container and a host needs is that the container is tied to the type of operating system it was developed on, although even that, potentially, is not an obstruction. More on this in a bit. Containers can run virtualized, within VMs, or "on the metal." Public clouds, such as Google Compute, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services, currently provide the option of doing it as VMs using their respective container services and orchestration engines. From a billing and consumption perspective, as well as from a provisioning standpoint, containers running on the metal may eventually be preferable to VMs, because you don't need to run a full-blown OS image to provision a container. The fabric (infrastructure) is run by the cloud provider all the way up to the OS level. You only touch the apps. And if it's PaaS or true SaaS, you aren't even touching/maintaining the apps as the end-user; you simply buy a subscription to use those things. Unlike today's public cloud IaaS implementations, in which you are responsible for maintaining the OS as well as the networks and storage, what you will end up managing as SaaS provider or an enterprise in a public cloud will be the actual code in packaged apps, which will run on container instances that can be scaled up and scaled down as needed by rules set in the orchestration engines. Your infrastructure becomes a true appliance. Linux and Unix have been container optimized for a long time, and they can run just enough OS, or JeOS, for supporting containerized apps using technologies such as Docker. Windows Server 2016 provides deployment configurations for Nano Server VMs, as well as Hyper-V and Windows Containers, which allow you to pare down the OS to headless, light JeOS instances as well. x86 irrelevance? What does this mean to x86's relevance in the cloud? Everything. Many applications running in the enterprise are written to legacy code that may have architectural dependencies on the x86 instruction set. Modern applications? No so much. Instead, they are written in high-level, abstract programming languages using APIs that don't reference the systems architecture directly. Examples of this includes .NET, Java and many scripting languages like Ruby, Python, and, of course, Javascript. Special Feature Cloud: How to Do SaaS Right Software as a Service offers irresistible benefits for organizations of all sizes — from cost savings to scalability to mobile accessibility. We offer guidance on avoiding the pitfalls of the cloud and choosing your SaaS partners well. Read More If the applications are architecturally agnostic, why run them on x86 at all? I think we now need to ask: Is x86 still a valid systems architecture in a hyperscale, containerized world that is increasingly cloud-based? Why continue to drag all that legacy compatibility cruft with us into the next computing paradigm? Nine years ago, when I started writing for ZDNet, I asked that very same question. At the time, I thought it was a good idea to think about developing a new systems architecture for the PC as well as the datacenter. Intel, in partnership with HP, did develop an alternative systems architecture for enterprise computing, in the form of the IA-64, the Itanium. While the IA-64 was a high-performance CPU architecture, its timing was off -- the world was still running on x86-dependent code using the Win32 platform, and the Linux port and toolchain for IA-64 was lacking many features and was not closely developed in tandem with the Open Source community. Instead, the Open Source community rallied around x86-64, which was introduced with the AMD Opteron processor. Eventually, Intel released its own 64-bit x86, with a nearly identical instruction set, and interest in IA-64 waned. It didn't help that the IA-64 chips were very expensive compared to their Xeon and Opteron counterparts and weren't optimized for most regular workloads. IA-64 survives today as a niche processor for high-end UNIX computing using HP Superdome servers. There is, however, an alternative systems architecture that is well-optimized for low-cost cloud computing -- ARM Cortex. And it has many architectural licensees, including Samsung, TSMC, Apple, Qualcomm, Huawei, and, yes, Microsoft and Intel. Linux has been running on ARM for a long time. If you use an Android phone, it most likely has an ARM processor and runs on the Linux kernel. Windows 8.1 and the NT kernel was ported to ARM for the ill-fated Surface 1 and Surface 2 tablets, as well as Windows Mobile/Windows Phone, and Microsoft has recently announced that Windows Server will also be ported to the ARM architecture on Qualcomm's SoCs for use in its Azure public cloud. When you compare the price/performance ratio and total cost of ownership of even the fastest ARM SoCs with the cheapest Intel i3 or Atoms, there's no contest, let alone if you compare them with server-class Intel or AMD chips. Although Intel PC and server chips have become much more energy efficient in recent years, the ARM chipsets to build a comparable performing server blow the Intel chips away in terms of component cost and relative performance. Potentially, you can put in thousands of datacenter-optimized ARM CPUs into a cloud fabric for a mere fraction of the cost of comparable low-power Intel chips, particularly if you are talking about a cloud vendor like Microsoft, Google, or Amazon that is buying at hyperscale quantities. Increased density and lower datacenter costs means that the compute costs can be lowered drastically, especially if all the end-customer needs to manage is their application container code and not the host OS. Today, the cloud is IaaS and x86. Tomorrow, it is likely to be containers, PaaS and ARM. When a container server instance on ARM becomes four times or eight times cheaper than a comparable x86 VM, the paradigm will change, and the x86 will be relegated to legacy and niche workloads, much like the IBM System z is now.

The new design, DynamIQ, is an update to ARM’s existing Cortex-A offering. The latter made up almost 20 percent of all ARM-based chips in the first three quarters of 2016, according to the company’s last available regulatory filing. The new design may help ARM,  bought for $32 billion last year by SoftBank Group Corp., compete with chips engineered for neural networks, a promising type of artificial intelligence software. Rivals like Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. have recently unveiled chips designed for these applications. It could also give ARM a better chance of making inroads against Intel in the lucrative server and data center market. SoftBank Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son snapped up ARM to bet on the Internet of Things -- the idea that everything from refrigerators to industrial robots will be connected to the Internet in the future. Son hopes ARM will become the leading designer of chips in these devices. The new design by ARM is aimed at higher-end IoT applications -- such as autonomous cars and robots -- that must handle complex computing tasks, such as running AI software, locally while communicating with other devices and remote servers. Energy Efficient ARM is well known for designing energy-efficient chips for power-constrained devices, such as mobile phones. More than 85 percent of the world’s most sophisticated smartphones include ARM-based chips. The new design can handle up to eight processor cores of varying size on a single chip in almost any configuration. That will give customers more flexibility than ARM’s existing designs, Nandan Nayampally, general manager of the company’s Compute Products Group, said. This is especially true in cases where a device has to switch rapidly between different tasks, for instance, using neural networks for facial recognition one moment and then handling a voice call. He said DynamIQ would be more efficient than existing architectures because the processors can share memory and switch rapidly between tasks with different power requirements. The technology will also work well in devices like industrial robots and self-driving cars that require high levels of safety and redundancy and have to process most computing tasks locally, Nayampally said. Data Center The new system could also be configured to handle difficult computing tasks in data centers, a market long-dominated by Intel and where ARM-based chips have only slowly started to catch on. When coupled with special ARM software, the new design will perform as much as 50 times better on AI tasks than the existing chips within three to five years, he said. Late last year, Intel unveiled a chip aimed specifically at AI applications. Google has also developed its own AI chip design, and several startups have announced rival offerings. ARM believes most systems will need a combination of general processing alongside specialized AI capabilities, Nayampally said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The world of High Performance Computing (HPC) is evolving at a rapid rate. Currently there is a great deal of interest in achieving exascale computing. At the same time, we are looking forward, thus ensuring that the architectures and implementations we design and build will extend well beyond exascale, and will support the new computing models of big data, cloud, machine learning, and deep learning.  A key aspect of achieving this future is have a solid and extensible infrastructure we can leverage as a base. One of the challenges that the HPC community faced until recently was the duplication of time-consuming work.  Vendors, OEMs, and customers were each building software stacks.  Unfortunately, much of the effort in doing this was repeated across each of these organizations.  A second challenge was that the HPC system ingredients were often designed and built separately.  There were network providers, memory vendors, chip manufacturers, and a software stack that was not necessarily co-designed with any of them.  Both of these challenges led to inefficiencies. Tackling the HPC Challenges in an Open Source Community To address the first issue, a cohesive and comprehensive system software stack was developed and made available as open source and the community is called OpenHPC. To address the second issue, a system-centric methodology was adopted.  Software engineers worked with network, memory, and core teams to ensure that the benefits of the resulting technology could be realized in the software stack and delivered to the application. OpenHPC was announced in November 2015 and launched in May 2016 by the Linux Foundation. It is an open community focused on HPC and is designed to allow different community members, including academic institutions, OEMs, ISVs, customers, and national labs, to contribute open source components and enhancements to those, with a focus on HPC.  The community, which is platform agnostic, includes 30 member organizations that have come together to make contributions to HPC software. OpenHPC provides a continuous integration and testing environment for all the components that are needed to develop for, run on, deploy, and manage HPC machines.  The multitude of components are freely available for open source distribution and include provisioners, resource management, I/O clients, development tools, and scientific libraries, etc. The desire to have a supported version of the OpenHPC software stack (an analogous example is CentOS and Red Hat Linux) led to the development of cohesive and comprehensive supported software stacks that is designed to run machines from a cluster up to a supercomputer.  By removing the duplicated work, OEMs, ISVs, and customers can focus on providing value based on their core competencies leading to a more efficient HPC ecosystem.  In the past, HPC researchers and developers shared new ideas through papers and online posts, but for many components it was challenging for different groups to cross pollinate code, but OpenHPC makes that option viable. Provisioning HPC in the Cloud It is clear that the face of HPC is changing.  Many want the capability to bring together cloud and HPC, to comprehend big data and analytics, as well as machine learning and deep learning. Because OpenHPC allows the HPC community to develop together, it provides a solid and extensible base on top of which to explore the melding of the technologies referenced above.  At the end of 2016, we developed a proof-of-concept (POC) that demonstrates how HPC can be used in conjunction with a cloud environment.  For this POC, we set up a head node managing a cloud environment using OpenStack. We used OpenStack components, Nova and Ironic, to carve off a set of nodes and then Glance to provision the nodes, thus producing an HPC sub-cluster in the cloud environment. We extended the base POC by combining the newly created HPC nodes with an HPC cluster and allowed a resource manager to schedule across both sets of nodes. We eventually ended up with a set of cloud nodes that were bare metal provisioned running a software stack optimized for an HPC workload.  We are working on a similar POC for creating a machine learning stack based on OpenHPC. As for what the future holds for us in exascale computing, the boundaries are limitless. I use the acronym PEZ since Petascale is established, Exascale is what we are currently focusing on achieving, and Zetascale is where we are heading. In fact, I walk around with a small PEZ dispenser to remind us of this important focus. HPC and HPC research has a tremendous set of new avenues it is opening to allow better, deeper, and more insightful science.

We round up rumours of a new 12-inch MacBook for 2017, and cover its likely design, tech specs, new features and UK pricing. Latest: after Apple's March product update included no Macs, here's why we expect new Apple laptops this summer, with Kaby Lake chips & 16GB RAM by Lewis Painter | 21 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will the new 12-inch MacBook for 2017 be released? What can I expect from the next 12-inch MacBook in terms of tech specs? How much will the 2017 12-inch MacBook cost? Will the 12-inch MacBook replace the MacBook Air range? (Click here to read the latest version of this article.) Apple released the 2016 variant of the 12in MacBook back in April 2016, and almost a year on, we're looking to the future and what we could expect from this year's model, the 2017 12in MacBook. Here, we sift through the latest rumours surrounding the 2017 MacBook and also our personal predictions. Those of you that want to find out more about the current 12in MacBook released in April 2016 can take a look at our 12in MacBook review, which covers everything from pricing to performance and design, sprinkled with our personal opinions of Apple's latest MacBook. Apple didn't update the MacBook or MacBook Air line during its October 2016 event, which saw the launch of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Following that event Apple discontinued the 11in MacBook Air, a move that suggests that the 12-inch MacBook may soon replace the Air line-up as Apple's consumer-oriented Mac laptops, although the models are likely to see a price cut before that would happen. Read more: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap MacBook deals UK When is the new 12in MacBook coming out? When will Apple release the next-generation 12in MacBook for 2017? Will it launch at a spring Apple event? Apple launched the 2015 version of the 12in MacBook at a spring event that year, but that doesn't prove that Apple will do the same in 2017. The 2016 MacBook wasn't unveiled at Apple's 2016 spring event (which saw Apple reveal the iPhone SE, a 9.7in iPad Pro and new Apple Watch straps). Instead, Apple quietly introduced the new MacBook a few weeks later in April 2016. We anticipate that the 2017 MacBook will see a similarly quiet launch. Nor do we expect to see a refreshed range in April to mark the current model's one year anniversary. We don't expect to see a 12-inch MacBook until the summer (June, or maybe July to coincide with WWDC). If Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is correct (as reported by MacRumors in January 2017) in his prediction that a new 12in MacBook is set to go into production in early Q2 2017 - April or thereabouts, a June or July launch could be feasible. On 21 March 2017 Apple temporarily shut down its online store and posted a notice saying: "We've got something special in store for you. And we can't wait for you to see it. Please check back soon." Sadly this didn't turn out to include any Macs. Apple quietly updated its online store with a new 9.7-inch iPad (called simply "iPad"), added a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and increased the storage options for the iPad mini 4 and iPhone SE. But no new MacBooks were announced, and we're holding out hope that they will appear later in the year. Will the 12in MacBook replace the MacBook Air? It certainly looks like the MacBook Air's days are numbered. After its October 2016 event Apple removed the 11in MacBook Air from sale along with the legacy MacBook Pro with SuperDrive, which had been lurking in the Apple Store for some years. While the 13in MacBook Air remains, it hasn't been significantly updated since March 2015, apart from Apple's decision to offer as standard, 8GB RAM for all MacBook Air models (given that the range was so hampered by its 4GB RAM that we recommended anyone purchasing the computer to upgrade the RAM at point of purchase, this update was rightfully celebrated and long overdue). Another reason we may soon see the demise of the MacBook Air is that Apple's MacBook Air design is not as groundbreaking now as it was eight years ago when it launched. When the MacBook Air first arrived, its biggest selling point was its thin and light design, hence the name, but the MacBook and MacBook Pro now outshine it in those areas. Plus, for those looking for ultimate portability there's the new iPad Pro with a 12.9in screen. In terms of weight the MacBook Air weighs 1.35kg while the MacBook Pro now weighs only a fraction more at 1.37kg and the MacBook weighs just 0.92kg. If Apple continues to sell the MacBook Air maybe it should drop Air from it's name. It's not all bad though. The MacBook Air is both more powerful and £300 cheaper than the MacBook. It is the only Mac laptop that is available for less than £1000. For that reason we do still recommend it, although you might do better buying a refurbished MacBook Pro if you need a Mac that costs less than £1000. Given that the MacBook Air is Apple's lowest cost Mac laptop you'd think it would be its most popular model, and yet, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (back in 2015), the 12in MacBook is Apple's best-selling computer, closely followed by the 13in MacBook Pro. See more MacBook Air rumours here. So we think that the 13in MacBook Air will be replaced, but we don't think that will happen before the price of the MacBook and potentially the entry-level MacBook Pro, is reduced. History indicates that this will be the case: the last time there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was when the MacBook Air launched alongside the old white and black MacBooks. Those models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air reduced. We hope that the same will happen, with new 12in MacBook models being priced lower than they are currently and replacing the 13in MacBook Air as the entry level MacBook, while the more advanced specs will be provided by the 13in MacBook Pro. Here's why it doesn't matter that the MacBook is expensive and underpowered. How much will the new MacBook cost? While we're still some way ahead of the official announcement of the 2017 MacBook, we can already speculate about the pricing as Apple rarely changes the price of its range from generation to generation, unless it's a fairly hefty upgrade. Currently the base MacBook sells for £1,249. However, there is a possibility that Apple will reduce the price of the MacBook in 2017, especially if it discontinues the MacBook Air. With the demise of the 11in MacBook Air came a hike to the point of entry for consumers wishing to buy a Mac laptop. The entry price of Apple's MacBook Air laptop is now £949 (thanks in part to Apple's post-Brexit £100 increase, the model had previously cost £849). Before Apple discontinued it, an 11in MacBook Air had been priced at £749. In comparison, the entry-level MacBook Pro, with 2.0GHz dual-core processor and 256GB SSD costs £1,449, while the entry-level 12in MacBook with 1.1GHz m3 chip is £1,249. There is certainly a place for a lower cost Mac laptop and it would seem that for now the MacBook Air will fulfil that role. However, a reduction in price for the MacBook is possible, bringing it into line with the price of the MacBook Air currently. It's interesting to note here that the US prices, less influenced by currency fluctuations, are as follows:  12in MacBook - from $1,299 (£1,249) 13in MacBook Air - from $999 (£949) 13in MacBook Pro - from $1,499  (£1,449) If you ignore the somewhat confusing currently translations (it's not entirely fair to convert dollars to pounds as there is also VAT to add to the US prices, and there are other 'costs of doing business' to take account of - at least that's Apple's excuse) the price differences are roughly the same, with the MacBook being £300/$300 more than the Air, and the Pro being £200/$200 more than the MacBook. Reduce the MacBook price by £300/$300 and you have a new entry-level price that's below the magic £1000/$1000 mark. We don't expect Apple to drop the MacBook Air from the line up until it is willing to shave this much off the price of the MacBook. If it was to do so expect the entry-level MacBook to offer much slower processors and probably less storage than it does currently. New MacBook 2017 specs: Processors The new MacBooks are likely to have Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. Kaby Lake is the generation of chips after Skylake, and it offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. There is another interesting possibility with regards to processors. Back in September 2016 Dutch-language site Techtastic spotted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE" being supported. The discovery was thought to indicate that Apple might be about to put ARM chips in its MacBooks. As it happens that's exactly what it did a month later with the launch of the MacBook Pro. In that case the chip powers the Touch Bar, but future ARM chips are being developed to look after other functions. The rumours continue: a Bloomberg report from February 2017 claims that Apple is working on a chip, codenamed T310, that will handle the "Power Nap"  functionality and improve the battery life of MacBooks. Whether this chip will end up in the MacBook remains to be seen. We think it's unlikely to make its debut on the next model as Apple is likely to save it for the next model of MacBook Pro. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook 2017 Specs: RAM Currently the MacBook ships with 8GB RAM as standard. There is no option to increase RAM at point of sale, and the Mac is not user upgradable. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that the new MacBooks will offer a 16GB of RAM option, up from 8GB of RAM in the 2016 models. Apple could upgrade the two current models to 16GB RAM and keep a 8GB option as a lower-priced model. What will the new MacBook 2017 look like? Looking at the change in design from the 2015 MacBook to the 2016 MacBook, it suggests that we won't be seeing huge physical changes in 2017. In fact, the only change in design from the original MacBook and the 2016 MacBook was the addition of a new colour option, Rose Gold, to sit alongside the Gold, Silver and Space Grey options. Apple seems intent on marketing the MacBook alongside the iPhone and iPad, given the matching colour choices. Aside from that, the design hasn't changed for the MacBook. It's incredibly thin at 13.1mm, and it weighs just 0.9kg, making it 24 percent thinner than the MacBook Air, and we don't expect that to change dramatically in future. New MacBook 2017 features: Bigger Screen One possible change that we might see concerns the screen size. At present the MacBook is available in one size: 12 inches, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that a 15-inch model will be unveiled later this year. In a research note Kuo mentions a 15in MacBook that he believes will go into production in quarter four of 2017. However, this model is likely to be a MacBook Pro as it is said to feature 32GB RAM, so is definitely not the MacBook. Nevertheless, adding a bigger model to the range would make sense if Apple is planning to phase out the MacBook Air. Then Apple would offer 13in and 15in MacBook Pro models as well as 12in and 15in MacBook models (or perhaps 12in and 14in MacBook models as it used to do). New MacBook 2017 specs: Ports Will the new MacBook support Thunderbolt? When the MacBook launched in 2015 it featured USB Type-C and little else. While USB Type-C now supports Thunderbolt type 3 (which as exactly the same port), this early port didn't. Described by many as the one port to rule them all, the USB Type-C port and the Thunderbolt 3 port is identical, so any device using either standard can be plugged into it. Rather than suggesting that USB-C means death to Thunderbolt, it rather suggests that the standard has been given new life, indeed, now in addition to the MacBook Pro, many PCs support Thunderbolt too. There's good reason to support Thunderbolt 3. The standard allows for connection speeds up to 40Gbps, double the speed of Thunderbolt 2 (and it's backwards compatible with Thunderbolt 2). Whether a MacBook user really needs Thunderbolt is another question though, with it being a standard utilised in video production and other high power applications.  Nevertheless, we expect that the new MacBook will feature the new USB Type-C port and therefore it will support Thunderbolt 3. Given Apple's efforts to convince the industry to adopt it since Thunderbolt's introduction in 2011 it is unlikely to fall out of favour with the company. However, Apple also promoted FireWire to the industry and eventually removed that from its Macs. Another reason Apple could turn it's back on Thunderbolt is if it stopped using Intel processors in its Macs. Intel is the company behind Thunderbolt and it requires an Intel processor to work... It's not a completely crazy idea, there have been rumours that Apple could ditch Intel in favour of its own chip production. Indeed, the company is already said to be working on its own chips with ARM, these chips would take care of certain functions, just like the Apple T1 chip in the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar does. New MacBook 2017 specs: LTE Will the 2017 MacBook have LTE connectivity? It seems that sharing your iPhone's cellular connection with your MacBook wasn't enough for Apple, if this patent approval is anything to go by. The patent, as described by the US Patent and Trademark Office, will allow the company to embed LTE hardware in the 2017 MacBook, making it the first cellular-enabled Mac in Apple's range, past or present.  As well as LTE connectivity, the patent describes the use of Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth and satellite connectivity, and mentions ways to boost the signal without interference from the metal body of the MacBook. It's worth mentioning that this idea isn't new, though - it was originally filed on June 8 2015, and there was also talk of a 3G-enabled MacBook Pro back in 2008, but the idea was eventually rejected by Steve Jobs as he felt it would tie the user down to a particular carrier.  New MacBook 2017 features: Keyboard Will the 2017 MacBook have a Force Touch keyboard? According to a 9to5Mac report in October 2016, Apple has been in talks with the Foxconn startup, Sonder - a company that uses E Ink technology to display its keys (see a video here). This allows a way of customising keys and even adding symbols which would not be possible on a regular keyboard. It's rumoured that Apple will use this technology in their next MacBook. Back in autumn 2015, it emerged that Apple had filed a patent that appeared to show its design for a Force Touch capable keyboard. Along with the 2015 MacBook Pro, the 2015 MacBook has a Force Touch trackpad, which gave electric pulses that feel like clicks, but is a glass plate that doesn't actually move. Like on the iPhone 6s, you can press harder for a deeper click to access menus and options within certain apps. The new MacBook also has keys unlike any other Mac, which have very little travel in order to make the chassis ultra-thin. The newly discovered patent shows what seems to be a whole keyboard and trackpad area fit to house this technology. As this shows, the whole keyboard and trackpad, plus areas to the left and right of the pad, could theoretically be customised to the user's tastes and, for the first time, not have a physical keyboard. However, we have seen Apple file patents in the past that are to bookmark ideas for the future. It'd be amazing if this technology were included in the new MacBook, but we feel this is one for the coming years. It would potentially allow you to have several language keyboards saved and switch between them on the adaptable display. Imagine typing on a surface that felt like a keyboard, but was actually electric feedback telling your brain you're pressing keys? If this is Force Touch's future, we are excited. New MacBook 2017 features: Trackpad Will the 2017 MacBook feature an Apple Pencil-compatible trackpad? It's not the only new addition to the MacBook either, if another patent approval is anything to go by. According to a patent filed by Apple which was approved in May 2016, an upcoming Mac could boast compatibility with the Apple Pencil - although the Apple Pencil depicted in the patent is far more advanced than the one on sale at the moment. The Pencil in question features a number of sensors that could detect movement, orientation and depth and, according to the patent, could be used with a Mac as an 'air mouse' or possibly even a joystick for gaming. The patent reads: "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." It doesn't end there, either - apparently an upcoming Mac trackpad will feature Apple Pencil support, allowing users to use and draw directly onto the trackpad with the precision of the iPad Pro. While the patent doesn't mention whether the trackpad will be built into a MacBook or offered as a standalone Mac trackpad. Thinking of buying a Mac? Read our Which Mac? Best Mac buyers guide.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents iPhones iPads iPad mini Apple Watch 3 Apple TV Macs Software & services Mergers & acquisitions But don't expect… 2016 was an interesting year for Apple. It saw the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, albeit controversially without headphone jacks, and a return to the 4-inch form factor in the popular iPhone SE. The MacBook Pro line received its first major revision for a number of years, including the introduction of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Plus there was the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and an apparently Brexit-related unwelcome hike in prices across the board. So, what does 2017 have up its sleeves for Apple fans? Well, here at Macworld we've donned our prognostication hats, investigated every rumour and trend we could find, all to bring you our predictions for 2017. It looks like it could be a big year. Apple predictions for 2017: iPhones 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so many are expecting Apple to pull out all the stops and release something quite special. iPhone SE 2: Many had anticipated that Apple would upgrade the iPhone SE model to the iPhone SE2 or SEs in March 2017, replacing the existing (and rather popular) SE that was introduced in March 2016. However the iPhone SE was only treated to a bump in storage to 32- and 128GB on 21 March and another update seems unlikely for now. We do still expect a new iPhone SE model at some point in the future, maybe in September or maybe in 2018 (KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has forecast that the iPhone SE 2 won't make an appearance in 2017 at all, on the principle that Apple doesn't want to cannibalise sales of the (higher-margin) iPhone 7). When the new model launches it is likely to keep the existing, classic design, but feature upgraded internals such as the A10 chip found in the current iPhone 7 and a more powerful camera. When? We think September  iPhone 7S or iPhone 8: Apple made a minor update to the iPhone 7 during an Apple Store update on 21 March, adding a Product RED version. Product RED is a charity that attempts to eliminate AIDS in Africa. Part of the proceeds from the new red models of the iPhone 7 will go to the charity. Apple doesn't make it clear how much it donates to the charity, but it does say that since Product RED was founded in 2006, (RED) has generated more than $465 million for the Global Fund, with more than $130 million from Apple alone. On to the new iPhones... There has been much discussion over what the new iPhone will be called. Normally Apple would continue its tick-tock rhythm of a new design one year followed by the S version which upgrades only the internals. But the iPhone 7 featured a minimal change to the design of the 6 and 6S, which leads many to think that Apple is saving the big changes for its 10th Anniversary model - the iPhone 8. Perhaps the biggest expected change to the design of the iPhone 8 is the removal of the Home button to allow an edge-to-edge glass display. But what of Apple ID and the fingerprint sensor? Well, there have been several reports that Apple intends to include technology that allows the screen itself to act as a fingerprint sensor, thus removing the need for a physical button. Alternatively, Apple might use facial recognition instead of/in addition to the fingerprint sensor. Apple reportedly purchased Israeli startup RealFace, which as the name hints specialises in facial recognition technology. This would be a truly remarkable innovation and give iPhone users display sizes on par with many premium Android devices but in a compact format. MacRumours also asserts that Apple is intending to use a flexible OLED display rather than the LCD panels that have appeared on previous iPhones. This could make the devices lighter while also offering more vivid colours and contrasts.   Image created by ConceptsiPhone Another feature often found on Android phones is that of wireless charging, and it looks very likely that this will be included on the iPhone 8. Some rumours even suggest the Apple will include long-range wireless charging, with Bloomberg Business reporting that the company wants to impliment the game changing technology that could charge an iphone from several feet away, and could have it ready for 2017.  The Jet black colour introduced with the iPhone 7 has been very popular, but its tendency to scratch easily is thought to have prompted Apple to return to a glass back and front design for the iPhone 8. There might also be new Deep Blue and Space Black colour options if the reports on various Japanese sites are to be believed.  One interesting idea that's gathering pace is that the new model will include Augmented Reality software, which overlays relevant information on any place or thing that you point the camera at. While we've yet to see proof of this, it would be a very cool addition. So with a new edge-to-edge design, software enabled fingerprint detection, long-range wireless charging, better display, plus the usual internal upgrades, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus really could be a worthy way to mark a decade at the top. Roll on September 2017. For the latest rumours and an in-depth roundup read our iPhone 8 release date rumours article. When? We think September Apple predictions for 2017: iPads New iPad Air: Since there was no new iPad Air in 2015 or 2016 Apple fans were hoping for an update to that model soon. There were some concerns that the 9.7in iPad Pro had displaced the iPad Air line, but those fears were unfounded when Apple announced a new iPad in March 2017. Apple has done away with the Air from it's name, however: what was the iPad Air line is now just the iPad. The iPad is what would have been called the iPad Air 3 and comes with Apple's A9 processor, an update to the A8X processor in the iPad Air 2. This means it has the same chip as the iPhone 6s, but retains the same display and cameras as the Air 2. read more here: New iPad latest. Apple stop using Air in all its product names very soon - as signalled by the 13-inch MacBook Air's tiny update in 2016 and the retirement of the 11-inch version. When? We think 2018 iPad mini: The iPad mini received a minor update in March 2017, gaining more capacity for the same price (£419 for the 128GB Wi-Fi model and £549 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular). However, this was not the iPad mini 5 anticipated, and given that the iPad mini 4 was last updated in September 2015, it's clear that Apple isn't too focused on its smaller tablets and Apple does state that the most popular tablet size is 9.7in. Perhaps October will see the introduction of an iPad Mini Pro with upgraded components, a new thinner, tougher aluminium chassis, and the inclusion of a Smart Connector to match that of the other iPad Pro devices. Read more about the iPad mini 5: iPad mini 5 new feature rumours When? We think 2018 Apple predictions for 2017: iPad Pro 2 With the 12.9-inch iPad Pro arriving in November 2015, and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016, it's hard to guess the plans for this line. We had hoped for an update to both in spring 2017, but no update was forthcoming. Apple did however introduce a new 9.7in iPad in the iPad Air category (so lacking the Apple Pencil support and featuring a A9 chip rather than the A9X, and £339, rather than £549. Apple may update the iPad Pro models in September or October 2017. Much will depend on how effectively they have dealt with the stagnating iPad sales problem we've observed in the past few earnings calls. One way to stimulate interest could be the introduction of a new size, which is what analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is suggesting. He has stated that Apple will offer three Pros in 2017, but not a Mini as you might think, instead a 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and new 10.5-inch variant. He makes sense of this by explaining that the 9.7-inch Pro will be a lower powered version than it's bigger brothers - possibly the existing Pro being kept as the base model and sold at a cheaper price. Kuo's thoughts were published before Apple lauched the new iPad 9.7in, which seems to sit as the lower powered version he predicted. Whether Apple would stop selling the 9.7in iPad Pro remains to be seen - the company has said it is its most popular sized iPad. Other rumours doing the rounds argue that there will be a 10.9-inch version instead of the 10.5-inch one Kuo is backing. This could also feature a design change that eliminates the bezels and makes use of the software fingerprint detection technology that is expected to appear in the iPhone 8. There's no doubt that iPads are in a transitional period at the moment, but Apple seems to be pushing the Pros as the way ahead, so expect some interesting products in March. Read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review | iPad Pro 2 rumours When? We think October Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Watch 3 Apple released the second generation of its Watch in September of 2016 which added GPS, internal upgrades, and water-proofing to the design. This was accompanied by the WatchOS 3 update that increased performance and functionality for not only the new models but also the original range.   We expect to see Apple announce the third iteration of its Watch in September 2017, hopefully for around the same price as the current models which start at £369, although that is far from certain after the increases we saw at the end of 2016. Apple did offer some new Apple Watch bands in March 2017. These include a new wide stripe Woven Nylon band, standalone Nike Sport Bands and Apple Watch Hermès bands in new colours. There's little in the way of firm evidence suggesting what the Apple Watch 3 will look like, but it's fair to say that you should expect a model that's very similar to the current version. Some experts have postulated that there could be a Watch S release in March of 2017 that would include additional storage space, but this remains a rumour at best. Several news sites have also specualted on the possibilty of a round display, much like the one found on the Moto 360 Android Wear device. It's widely expected that the Watch 3 will include a front facing camera that could be used for selfies or FaceTime calls, as Apple holds a patent for such a device and Watch OS 2 introduced support for FaceTime audio calls. The new model is also likely to feature a Micro-LED display, which would be lighter, thinner, and brighter than the LCD panels currently used.  Another common thought is that Apple will finally introduce 3G or 4G capabilities to the Watch, in order to make it more independent from the iPhone. We're not convinced by this. Apple likes its devices to be closely tied together, and the battery life problems that come with cellular capabilities might make it an unattractive option at this time. It's still early days for the Apple Watch, so we fully expect this to be a quiet evolution rather than revolution. Thinner, lighter, faster and longer battery life is the mantra, and we'd be very happy with that.

We think September Apple predictions for 2017: Apple TV It might have escaped the attention of many people that 2017 actually marks the 10th anniversary of Apple TV. With this in mind some think that Apple could celebrate the occassion with an update to its little black box. Whether this is true or not remains a mystery, as there have been very few credible rumours about any new developments inside the Apple campus. Then there's also the fact that the usual gap between iterations of Apple TV tends to be two or three years. It was curious though that a large section of the recent WWDC event was given to the software updates in tvOS. Maybe something is cooking in the labs after all?

We think WWDC Apple predictions for 2017: Macs The Mac Pro: The Mac Pro is long overdue a refresh as it hasn't been updated since its launch in 2013. The once futuristic device now looks a little long in the tooth, having been bypassed by generations of Intel chips that never made it into the chassis. Will Apple update the Mac Pro in 2017 or has it given up entirely on this professional Mac workstation? At this point we really don't know. Rumours of release dates and potential upgrades have come and gone, but nothing has appeared. We were hopeful that March 2017 would see new Pros announced, but nothing has materialised yet. We think a WWDC launch in June is possible. Read more about the Mac Pro: Mac Pro release date rumours & specs  | Mac Pro preview  | iMac vs Mac Pro, best pro Mac desktop When? We think WWDC MacBook Air: With the introduction of the 12-inch MacBook and the new, lightweight 13-inch MacBook Pro the writing seems pretty much on the wall for the old MacBook Air. Apple has already retired the 11-inch model in 2016, and once the 12-inch MacBook gets an update in 2017 to hopefully add an additional USB-C port and upgrade the god-awful keyboard, there won't be much room left for the Air brand.   All many of us wanted for the 13-inch model was to get a retina screen and a spec bump, but we suspect that will never happen and the MacBook Air, like the iPad Air, is on the way out. Read more here: New MacBook Air release date, specs & rumours. When? We think never... MacBook Pro: With the MacBook Pro having been released at the end of 2016, we don't expect much to change until very late in 2017. The massive redesign has already caused quite a reaction, so we'd rule out anything significant happening in the next iteration. Instead we think there will most likely be a shift to Kaby Lake chips, which in turn could open up higher RAM options. Other than that all we really want are the prices to come down. Read: MacBook Pro 2017 latest rumours. When? We think October Apple predictions for 2017: 12in Retina MacBook update Apple launched its incredibly thin and light 12in MacBook back in March 2015, and the MacBook's first birthday saw a solid if unspectacular update - various sensible specs boosts, and a rose gold colour option. The third iteration of the 12in MacBook is likely to appear at some point in 2017 - although there was no sign of it when Apple updated some of its products on 21 March. Rumours are thin on the ground right now, but some of the wilder speculation has suggested that the new version might feature a 'Force Touch keyboard' - a keyboard, in other words, that doesn't actually move in response to your key presses, instead simulating presses through haptic feedback just like the Force Touch trackpad. Sounds pretty bizarre - not to mention difficult to use for touch-typing - but that's the sort of thing you tend to hear this far ahead of a launch. We think it's more likely that Apple will install the second generation of its butterfly keyboard that appeared on the new MacBook Pro instead. Read more in our 2017 MacBook rumour round-up. When? We think WWDC Mac mini: Ah Mac Mini, where did it all go wrong? After being hobbled in 2014 by what can barely be considered an upgrade, Apple has left the Mini to fall fallow. Now we don't know whether 2017 will see a resurrection of its fortunes, but all here at Macworld are rooting for the little guy. Read more in our new Mac mini rumours article. When? We think WWDC New iMacs: The iMac range last saw updates in 2015 that moved the high-end models over to Intel's Skylake processors, and the 21.5in models to Broadwell chips. What 2017 holds in store for the range is still uncertain, as Intel's chipsets seem to be slightly out of step with Apple's demands at the moment. No iMac updates were forthcoming on 21 March when Apple updated the iPad, but they may still appear. Bloomberg has reported that new iMacs are on their way, at WWDC we think, but details are as yet unknown as to what upgrades the devices will be running. When?

Apple predictions for 2017: Mac processor updates Despite Apple's adventures into processor design it's unlikely we'll see the company rolling out its own chips in its desktop and laptop machines unless it can make them fully compatible with the current Intel line-up. Wonderful though it would be to run iOS apps alongside OS X software, Apple would need to give developers several years' notice to update their applications to run on any new architecture, so expect to still be buying Intel-driven machines for at least the next 12 months. Apple predictions for 2017: Force Touch Keyboard A Force Touch keyboard could be in the works, too - as a supplement to the Magic Trackpad 2 - if a recent patent filing is anything to go by. The switchless design would allow Apple to produce even thinner MacBooks, and also to take into account the force with which a key is pressed, which will be a boon for anyone making music on their Mac. In the opposite direction it should allow for haptic feedback, which could possibly be used to signify to vision-impaired users that they're correctly striking a particular key. Apple predictions for 2017: Software & services 'Wireless mystery device' Recent photos reveal a mystery wireless device submitted to the FCC by Apple bearing the model number A1844. The mystery device, of course, caused huge stirs in the Apple community. The application claimed that it was a low-powered device with both Bluetooth and NFC wireless functionality. This led some to believe that it was either going to be a new, smaller Apple TV or possibly even an accessory for Apple Pay, allowing small businesses to accept wireless/Apple Pay payments. However, while we'd all hoped it'd be a cool new Apple device, further investigation seems to suggest that it's nothing more than a badge reader that attaches to a door assembly, most likely for use in Apple's Apple Park HQ opening in April 2017. There's a snap of the wireless device above, but those that want more information can check out the full FCC filing here.  iOS 11 Apple traditionally announces new version of iOS in June, followed by the release in the autumn. So far the only strong rumour about the new operating system is that it will include an improved 'natural-sounding' Siri as Apple works to improve the behaviour and repsonse of its voice interface. Another strong possibility is the inclusion of a Dark Mode with black backgrounds rather than the bright white normally found on iOS, and there's an outside chance that your Contacts could become active in iOS11, meaning you can see when people are available to chat. Read more about the latest rumours in our iOS release date rumours UK article. Plus you can revisit the changes Apple made in iOS 10 by watching the video below. Apple predictions for 2017: macOS X Like iOS 11, the new version of Apple's Mac operating system will be unveiled at WWDC 2017 in June, and then roll out in the autumn. So far there are no real rumours about what Apple will include in the new update. Siri integration was at the centre of the 2016 release, so it's possible that those features will be enhanced and improved upon for the 2017 update. As always, check back regularly and we'll keep you up to date on any new developments. Also check out our OS X 10.13 Rumours page. To refresh your memories on what Apple included in macOS 10.12 Sierra read more here: macOS Sierra new features and release date or watch the discussion video: Apple predictions for 2017: WatchOS 4 WatchOS is developing nicely and in 2017 we expect to see the introduction of Sleep Tracking, which would further bolster the fitness focus of the Apple Watch. No other news as yet, but we'll keep digging In the mean time you could read about the improvements made in watchOS3 here: watchOS 3 new features or listen to our discussion about it. Apple predictions for 2017: tvOS Last and probably least of Apple's four software platforms, tvOS nevertheless got a decent update at WWDC 2016 which we think will probably carry it through 2017. You can read all the gory details in our article New tvOS features, but we also discuss the new features in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Pay Alongside these headline developments, there will be a whole series of speedbumps along the way as Apple extends and refines its Apple Pay offering. We anticipate that Apple Pay will be accepted in a wider range of headline stores.  Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Music Apple Music - which is now available on Android - will inevitably expand. With 15 million subscribers in 2016 Apple Music made a decent start, but is it good enough to continue this momentum and can it really compete with the likes of Spotify? As for Beats 1, we're not convinced this is making the impact Apple hoped for, but the we probably aren't the target market for it. We'd like to see more radio channels tuned to less trendy music choices. There are also rumours that streaming on Apple Music could be enhanced, with high-resolution better quality audio for that service - up to 96kHz/24-bit, according to a report on Macotakara. Since the 3.5mm headphone jack is limited to CD quality sound this appears to back up the motives for Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as the Lighting port can offer HD audio. Apple Music may also prove to be the one thing that keeps the iPod on the shelves in 2017. If you'd asked us what we thought of its chances at the close of 2014, we'd have said 'slim', but 2015 saw Apple deliver the first proper update to the iPod touch in three years, and it's now providing another entry ramp for the firm's £9.99 a month music subscription service. That alone means it makes sense to give it at least 12 months to prove itself. The same can't necessarily be said of the nano and shuffle, which are each available in just one configuration and, without streaming abilities, offer no ongoing revenue source. Apple Music saw a major redesign at WWDC 2016. We discuss the changes in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Mergers & acquisitions Apple has got quite a lot money, and armchair pundits love to spend the company's money for it. Buy Tesla! Buy GoPro! Buy Sonos! From time to time these suggestion-cum-predictions come true, as with Apple's acqusition of Beats in 2014, but it hardly needs stating that the company isn't in a hurry to divest itself of that cash cushion. Any merger & acqusition activity is likely to be comparatively conservative: rather than going for the big names that crop up in prediction articles like this one, Apple is far more likely to pick up smallish but promising firms on the way up and take their products in house - just as it did with Siri. We do know of a few big deals that Apple has considered recently, though. The Financial Times reports that in May 2016 Apple sat down with Time Warner, one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and spoke seriously about an acquisition deal. The deal never got beyond the exploratory phase, but this does strongly suggest that Apple is in the market for an acquisition that will give it a foothold in video content - something that would prove valuable in the event that its rumoured TV-streaming service comes to pass. With Time Warner apparently out of the picture, many analysts believe that the next target could be Netflix, but we're still in the realm of the mega-deal, so don't bet your live savings on the deal happening. Apple's Gliimpse acqusition On 22 August 2016 Fast Company reported that Apple had made an intriguing new acquisition: Gliimpse, a startup that enables users to collect and collate personal health data. It's not known at this point how much the acqusition cost Apple, but the company has confirmed the deal, albeit with its usual boilerplate statement that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and generally [does] not discuss [its] purpose or plans". Gliimpse was created in response to the bureaucratic difficulties in the US related to health documentation: the lack of an overarching authority or standardised system makes it exceptionally difficult for patients to access and usefully analyse their own data. And this makes it an obvious fit with Apple's recent health-related announcements. With the launch of HealthKit and CareKit, the company intends to revolutionise the health and medical care sector, and has a track record of providing umbrella services - in music, fitness and mobile software most successfully - that make complex markets easier for consumers to approach. Related fact: one of Gliimpse's founders, Anil Sethi, started his career at Apple in the 1980s. Apple's Turi acquisition At the start of August 2016, Apple acquired a Seattle artificial intelligence company named Turi, according to a report by GeekWire. The site's sources peg the deal at approximately $200m, although both Apple and Turi have declined to comment on the matter. Turi's specialities, artificial intelligence and machine learning, are hot right now and the acquisition represents Apple's way into an increasingly crucial area of the tech sector. Google is big on artificial intelligence, as are Facebook and Amazon, but Apple itself has discussed the subject in numerous recent product launches. iOS's QuickType keyboard uses artificial intelligence to predict what you're trying to type; iOS also uses it to suggest apps it reckons you're likely to use and contacts you'll want to speak to, and the new automated album creation tool in Photos uses deep learning techniques to analyse faces, places and objects and create coherent compositions. watchOS 3's Instant Apps feature is dependent on being able to predict which apps you'll want to use next. But Apple's products are only going to get smarter over the coming years, as Turi's tech is integrated into the portfolio. Apple's Tuplejump acquisition Further to it buying Turi, Apple followed up the next month, September 2016, by buying Tuplejump. Like Turi, it is a machine learning company that allows better data management for businesses. According to TechCrunch, Apple's interest in the acquisition was down to Tuplejump's focus on open source ways of applying machine learning and analytics to big data. This again points to Apple's increasing interest in improving its artificial intelligence products such as Siri.  Apple's $1bn investment in Didi Chuxing After its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch, Apple invested a huge $1bn in the uber-competitor, Didi Chuxing - a Chinese company that forced Uber out of its local market. The company is valued at $35bn, and with a further $1bn investment from Apple, it seems that there is certain weight behind the movement in China - this came come in a form of advertising of Apple products in China, to Apple-product integration within taxis. Given the boom of the Chinese market, it seems that investors are happy with this move. Apple predictions for 2017: But don't expect… The Apple Car, was the hot rumour of 2016, but now it seems that Apple has scaled back it's ambitions and now thought to see working on a software solution rather than the hardware. The company is said to have had up to 1,000 developers working on the so-called Project Titan, and to have set up various different front companies, including Faraday Futures and Sixty Eight Research. We'd love to see it on the roads in 2017, but industry chatter suggests 2020 is a more likely date. If they're right, it might not be worth holding back on an interim upgrade to your existing run-around next year. And if you were hoping for an actual television set from Apple it's time to give up on that idea too. We won't see an Apple car this year, but you can expect the rumours to continue.

New MacBook Pro models were released in October 2016, but we're already looking ahead to the next update of the MacBook Pro for 2017. In this article we round up and analyse all the rumours related to the new MacBook Pro 2017 - its release date, specs, design, likely pricing and new features. If you're interested in the latest MacBook Pro update, we also discuss the announcements and launch details from October 2016, and you can read more here: New MacBook Pro 2016 review. Updated, 21 March 2017, after no new Macs were unveiled as part of Apple's March product refresh; and on 17 Mar, with news that hackers have managed to take over control of a Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. Related: Mac buying guide | Best cheap MacBook Pro deals UK When is the MacBook Pro 2017 UK release date? The current lineup of MacBook Pro models was introduced in October 2016. Apple doesn't tend to update its Macs more often than once a year, so it isn't likely that Apple will update the range before October 2017, and when it does Apple may only refresh part of the range. Competing pro laptops coming from Dell and HP will offer newer Kaby Lake Intel processors long before October 2017, including the Dell Precision 5520 which is available now. For business people looking for a stylish laptop this may not matter, but for creatives looking for a new Mac a move away from Apple may start to look attractive if Apple makes them wait too long. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had previously predicted an update to the entire range in 2017. In October 2016 he told clients that he expected Apple to launch updated MacBooks Pros in the second half of 2017 including support for 32GB of RAM, with the proviso that Intel would launch the required processors in time. However, at that time he referenced Cannonlake processors, in February 2017 he published a new note claiming that the new MacBook Pro models will feature Kaby Lake processors and that the 13in and 15in versions of the MacBook Pro will see an update towards the end of 2017, with mass production of these models beginning in the third quarter of 2017. However, those hoping for a 32GB RAM update to the 15in MacBook Pro model in 2017 may be disappointed. The high-end MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM will not enter mass production until the fourth quarter of 2017 so its launch isn't expected until 2018. (Incidentally the Dell Precision 5520 does have a 32GB RAM configuration.) On 21 March 2017 Apple briefly closed down its online store and posted a notice saying: "We've got something special in store for you. And we can't wait for you to see it. Please check back soon." Sadly this didn't turn out to include any Macs, laptop or desktop. Apple quietly unveiled a new 9.7-inch iPad (called simply "iPad"), added a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and increased the storage options for the iPad mini 4 and iPhone SE. How much will the 2017 MacBook Pro cost in the UK? Shortly after Apple announced the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in October 2016, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo published a note to clients indicating that he expects Apple to drop prices in subsequent updates to the range. He observed that Apple tends to overprice new generations of Mac before gradually lowering prices in the following year. The pricing for the 2016 13in and 15in new MacBook Pro models begins at £1,749/$1,799 for a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and starts at $2,399/£2,349 for the 15in model. The most expensive MacBook Pro now costs £2,699/$2,799. The version of the MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar costs from $1,499/£1,449. This is the model most likely to see a price drop, potentially coinciding with an update to the 12in MacBook and the discontinuation of the MacBook Air. Processor: Will the new MacBook Pro have a Kaby Lake, Cannonlake or Apple designed processor? When they launched in October 2016 the new range of MacBook Pro models ran on Intel's Skylake processors, the processor microarchitecture that first launched in August 2015 as a successor to Broadwell. This was a disappointment to some as the Skylake chips can only support up to 16GB of RAM (to offer a 32GB option Apple would need to use battery-hungry desktop-class RAM). Given that the MacBook Pro is pitched as a professional machine there have been calls for the next model to offer the option of 32GB RAM and naturally attention has turned to Intel's roadmap for clues as to what processor might make this update feasible. Back in October 2016 Apple analyst Kuo had suggested that the MacBook Pro could adopt Intel's Cannonlake processors, or should that not appear in time, Intel's Coffee Lake processors (although that would limit the models to 16GB RAM). However, it appears that the usually accurate analyst had his chips somewhat muddled, as there are apparently no plans to design MacBook Pro-class Cannonlake chips, and Coffee Lake is not scheduled until 2018. In a note published in January 2017 Kuo predicted that the new MacBook Pro line up would feature Kaby Lake chips. Kaby Lake is the successor to Skylake. That line of processors debuted in the spring of 2016, but the processors suitable for future MacBook Pros (as suggested by beta code in macOS Sierra 10.12.4) weren't announced until the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. This beta code discovered in Sierra by Pike's Universum references the following Kaby Lake processors: The 13in MacBook Pro could gain the i7-7660U 2.5 GHz Kaby Lake chip; The 13in MacBook Pro with Touch bar could gain the Kaby Lake 3.1 GHz i5-7267U, 3.3 GHz i5-7287U, and 3.5 GHz i7-7567U processors; The 15in MacBook Pro could gain i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz, i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz, and i7-7920 3.1 GHz Kaby Lake processors. These new Kaby Lake processors offer better power efficiency and more advanced on-board GPU capabilities, but the processor power doesn't see a marked increase. Dell's Precision 5520 laptop includes Kaby Lake chips and is directly comparable to the MacBook Pro. There's another possibility, Apple could move away from Intel chips and look at what's on offer from AMD. According to an Archtosh report, AMD has launched RYZEN 7 CPUs that "promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel" and, according to a report the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X just set a new world record score for Cinebench, a respected CPU performance benchmark. That report states that the new RYZEN 7 chip lineup roughly competes with Intel's i7 line including the i7-6900K, i7-6800K, and i7-7700K. We think such a transition is unlikley however, given the fact that Apple had to rewrite the operating system to prepare for the Intel switch. Perhaps more likely is the idea that Apple will design its own chips (although we think all rumours about this pointed to the processor that powers the Touch Bar in the 2016 MacBook Pro. Will the new MacBook Pro 2017 have an Apple designed processor? The chip that powers the Touch Bar in the MacBook Pro may not be the only low power chip coming from Apple. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has predicted that the 2017 MacBook Pro will feature an Apple-designed chip to handle simple tasks such as email and updates while the laptop is asleep, citing "people familiar with the matter". "The chip, which went into development [in 2016], is similar to one already used in the latest MacBook Pro to power the keyboard's Touch Bar feature," Gurman writes. "The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer's low-power mode functionality." By building a dedicated low-power processor, Apple could reduce battery consumption for the 2017 MacBook Pro. RAM: Will the new MacBook Pro 2017 have 32GB RAM? As we mention above, a big disappointment with the 2016 MacBook Pro line up was the RAM limitations, with the models maxing out at 16GB RAM. Pro customers, such as video editors, were so disillusioned with the 2016 update that in November 2016 Apple's SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller spoke out in defence of Apple's decision not to offer more RAM, saying that to offer more RAM would be detrimental to battery life because higher amounts of RAM would require a power-hungry memory controller unsuitable for use in portable machines. Schiller said: "To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life." The problem lies with the Intel Skylake CPUs used in Apple's MacBook Pro. These processors support up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM at 2133MHz. There are processors capable of addressing more than 16GB of memory, but these rely on less efficient DDR4 RAM and are usually deployed in desktops because they can be plugged into mains power. Understandably Apple does not wish to hinder the battery life of its laptops in this way.   Schiller has also indicated that using 32GB of RAM would require a different logic board design that would limit space for other components, including the battery. In an email to MacDaddy's Ben Slaney, Schiller wrote: "To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life." So, as you can see, the calls for a 32GB RAM version of the MacBook Pro are loud enough for Apple to make a statement regarding it, but this doesn't mean that a RAM update is immanent. A Kaby Lake processor upgrade for the MacBook Pro will not increase in the RAM cap of 16GB because the Kaby Lake processor doesn't support LPDDR4 RAM and Apple is not expected to engineer a new RAM controller that does any time soon. An Intel processor capable of supporting LPDDR4 RAM isn't expected before 2018. Kuo still has some hope however, he predicts that Apple will start to manufacture a 15in MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM in the fourth quarter. And he thinks that Apple will adopt desktop RAM due in order to do so. Dell's Precision 5520 laptop is directly comparable to the MacBook Pro and has a 32GB RAM build-to-order configuration.  Amid calls for Apple to update the MacBook Pro, which some feel is hampered by its standard 8GB RAM (upgradable to just 16GB), Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that Apple still considers the professional creative market to be important. Comments from Tim Cook indicate that Apple isn't about to give up on the professional market. Speaking at the Shareholders meeting on 28 February 2017, Cook indicated that Apple is still focused on its professional customers and has plans to "do more" in that area. Cook said: "You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular. "Don't think something we've done or something that we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere," Cook added. However, the separation between 'creative' and 'professional' in Cook's comments could be telling, and a way out of giving a clear answer. Regarding Cook's comments, our colleague on Digital Arts suggested that the "people who are creative-but-not-professional and professional-but-not-creative would probably look to the MacBook Pro (which is fine for photo-editing and Office)". He considers that the MacBook Pro is more suited to people who see themselves as creatives, rather than creative professionals. Graphics: What graphics card will the new MacBook Pro 2017 offer? The 13in MacBook Pro without Touch Bar currently offers Intel Iris Graphics 540 while the 13in model with Touch Bar offers Intel Iris Graphics 550. The 15in model offers a duel graphics card set up, with the Radeon Pro 450, or a Radeon Pro 455, alongside the Intel HD Graphics 530. The Radeon Pro 400 series launched in October, so they were new graphics processors at the time the Macs launched. The Radeon RX 500 series is expected to launch this year and could be destined for the new MacBook Pro models. Screen: What improvements might Apple make to the screen on the new MacBook Pro? The current model has an impressive 4K screen but this is still few pixels than some of the competition. The 2016 MacBook Pro can output the full DCI P3 colour space used for films for digital cinema output, however, as our colleague on Digital Arts notes in his review: "It's the Adobe RGB colour space that really matters as this is what's used internally by tools from Photoshop to Illustrator to Premiere Pro – and again here the MBP is lacking. In our tests with a DataColor Spyder5Elite colorimeter, we found that the MacBook Pro's screen can output 91 percent of the colours in the Adobe RGB." In their tests Dell's Precision 5510 and the Wacom MobileStudio Pro could output 91 percent of the colours in the Adobe RGB. In the next version of the MacBook Pro we'd like to see an improvement here. Another desirable addition to the screen would be touchscreen capabilities, something much of the competition also shares. While Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs said that he felt that touch screens were a bad idea (because they would make your arm ache) there is some value in being able to touch a screen rather than use a mouse or track pad when you are in cramped conditions, such as those in which our colleague on Digital Arts wrote his review. Battery: Is 10 hours battery life enough for the new MacBook Pro? With Apple pointing to battery life as the reason it won't offer more RAM in the MacBook Pro you might be wondering whether there is room for improvements to battery life in the next model, or if battery life could (or should) suffer if Apple is to offer a truly pro-level machine. The 2016 machine offers 10-hours of battery life, as did earlier models. There was some question about the accuracy of this claim earlier in 2017 when Consumer Reports tested the battery life and found that is was less. However, Consumer Reports battery life tests had been influenced by a bug in Safari's developer mode that consumers wouldn't be using. Ports: Could the new MacBook Pro lose the headphone jack? When Apple launched the new MacBook Pro many of the familiar ports disappeared replaced by USB-C/Thunderbolt 3. The headphone jack remained despite being lost from the iPhone and iPad. Will it remain in the next version of the MacBook Pro? Possibly, although it seems likely that Apple will swap it for Lightning or another Thunderbolt 3 port in the future. Touch Bar: Will Apple improve the Touch Bar? A report on BGN outlines that Hackers at the Pwn2Own competition have exploited a security hole in Safari and take over the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar gaining root control of the MacOS on a MacBook Pro. The hackers have sent details of the attack to Apple so the company should be working on patching it now. When the Touch Bar first launched it was limited to Apple applications, however over the months it has gained functionality with many other apps including Spotify and Photoshop, and it now offers additional functionality for Microsoft Office features. You can expect more software to offer Touch Bar support in the future. Colour: Who wants a Gold MacBook Pro? The MacBook Pro series currently comes in two colour finishes: silver and Space Grey, while the MacBook series is available in Gold and Rose Gold as well. It the MacBook Pro ever likely to adopt the gold colour? We think that Apple will continue to offer gold as an option on it's consumer focused laptops, but it will keep the more business-like silver and grey for the professional machines.

We round up all the rumours of a new Mac Pro for 2017, as Apple's "something special" March update turns out to include no new Macs by Karen Haslam | 21 Mar 17 Share Tweet   Comments Contents Will Apple update the Mac Pro? When is the new Mac Pro release date? Could Apple launch a Pro iMac instead of a new Mac Pro? Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Is the new Mac Pro 2017 release date delayed? What are the rumoured Mac Pro 2017 specifications? Thunderbolt and USB 3 Intel Kaby Lake or AMD RYZEN 7? Graphics Storage RAM  Internal design Buying guide for current Mac Pro models When will Apple release a new Mac Pro for 2017? And what tech specs, new features and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2017? Or is it more likely that Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? (Click here to read the latest version of this article.) We've had a long wait for the new Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013, shipping that December, and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. In addition, many of the Mac Pro's traditional creative professional audience (videographers, designers, photographers) have hung onto their ancient Mac Pro towers that predate the 2013 redesign because their old Mac Pros, which could be customised, offered more flexibility and power, at least at the time Apple launched the new-look 'trashcan-style' Mac Pro. So we're long overdue an update to the Mac Pro before creative Mac professionals turn towards Windows and Linux for their workstation needs... those that haven't already turned their back on Apple, at least. Some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued, though, we look at the reasons why they think that below. For more discussion of upcoming Apple launches, take a look at our big roundup of Apple predictions for 2017. And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide 2017. Updated, 21 March 2017, with the disappointing news that Apple's "something special" update didn't include any new Macs (although we're still optimistic about an April launch event); and on 1 Mar, to report that Tim Cook has been talking about the importance of the professional and creative markets in the biggest hint yet that a new Mac Pro could be on the way. See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours Will Apple update the Mac Pro? There is always going to be the question of whether Apple will turn its back on the Mac, with the iPhone becoming such a significant part of its business, and with Steve Jobs having said that the desktops days were numbered when he spoke about how the iPad would revolutionise computing. However, we can confidently say that Apple isn't turning away from the Mac desktop just yet, based on CEO Tim Cook's comments below. Further comments from Tim Cook indicate that Apple isn't about to give up on the professional market either. Speaking at the Shareholders meeting on 28 February 2017, Cook indicated that Apple is still focused on its professional customers and has plans to "do more" in that area. Cook said: "You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular. "Don't think something we've done or something that we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere," Cook added. However, the 'and' between 'creative' and 'professional' could be telling, and a way out of giving a clear answer about the Mac Pro (or the iMac or FCP). Regarding Cooks comments, our colleague on Digital Arts suggested that the "people who are creative-but-not-professional and professional-but-not-creative would probably look to the MacBook Pro (which is fine for photo-editing and Office)". He feels that the MacBook Pro is more suited to people who see themselves as creatives, rather than creative professionals. Could the same be said to apply to Mac Pro users. Regardless of nitpicking about what constitutes a 'creative professional', Cook's comments give us hope that Apple will update the Mac Pro, despite all the commentary to the contrary (more on that below). While the updated unit may no longer meet the requirements of professional creatives, and while the cost of production may not justify its existence (and the cost is probably high due to Apple building it in the US rather than outsourcing to China), we don't think that Apple is about to turn its back on a product that allows it to show off its best technological advancements. There is some evidence that a new Mac Pro (one with 10 USB 3 ports) is in the pipeline - some code in Mac OS X El Capitan was discovered that referenced a machine with the codename AAPLJ95,1. The current generation of Mac Pro was codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it seems a fair bet that the new model is also a Mac Pro. Although El Capitan has now been superseded by macOS Sierra so maybe that was just an anomaly in the code. (More on this code below). In addition, a few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect a new Mac Pro by the end of November 2016, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it is certainly possible that things have been delayed and we could still see a new Mac Pro soon. When is the new Mac Pro release date? We expect (or perhaps hope) that the new Mac Pro will be launched in April 2017 (read more: What to expect at Apple's spring 2017 event), although it may be a more likely star of the WWDC keynote in June, since that event tends to have more of a focus on pro Macs. On 21 March 2017 Apple temporarily shut down its online store and posted a notice saying: "We've got something special in store for you. And we can't wait for you to see it. Please check back soon." Sadly this didn't turn out to include any Macs. Apple quietly updated its online store with a new 9.7-inch iPad (called simply "iPad"), added a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and increased the storage options for the iPad mini 4 and iPhone SE. But no new Macs were announced, and we're holding out hope that they will appear at a rather more high-profile event in April. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013. That's nearly four years ago (although the Mac Pro didn't actually ship until that December - and supply was so restrained that most users didn't get theirs until the following spring). It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. As it turned out, Apple did unveil a new MacBook Pro at the October event, so there was something for 'creative professionals' (although whether creative pros feel that it is meant for them is another question). You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) If the new Mac Pro doesn't appear at Apple's spring press event in March, then WWDC 2017, whose dates and ticket lottery were announced in February, would be the next slot in the Apple launch calendar. While Apple tends to focus on software at WWDC, and iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 will dominate the event, the launch of the 2013 Mac Pro shows there is a place for hardware at Apple's summer event if the circumstances are right. Could Apple launch a Pro iMac instead of a new Mac Pro? In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac desktop, referring only to the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" In response, Cook wrote the following (failing to mention the Mac Pro, or the Mac mini for that matter): "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important before speaking about the iMac. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why the question was asked and why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. Does this suggest that Apple will condense its Mac desktop offering into the iMac, discontinuing the Mac Pro and the Mac mini? Such a move would certainly help simplify its desktop offering. Perhaps Apple plans to do exactly that, with the launch of a Pro iMac that goes above and beyond what the 5K iMac offers currently. It's possible that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, but it's unlikely that such a model will ever meet the needs of Apple's traditional Mac Pro market, many of whom are still using old Mac Pros from pre-2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) Those who did upgrade to the trashcan-like Mac Pro are finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. Other professional creatives have abandoned the Mac and moved to Windows. It's a shame because these creative professionals, while a niche market, wield a lot of influence. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. Is the new Mac Pro 2017 release date delayed? When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. What are the rumoured Mac Pro 2017 specifications? Currently, there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. Ports: Thunderbolt and USB 3 The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon offering more Thunderbolt ports in the form of USB-3. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. (Read more about Thunderbolt and the Mac Pro here). Many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays. Processor: Intel Kaby Lake or AMD RYZEN 7? The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Another idea, although somewhat crazy, is that Apple could abandon Intel chips altogether and move to AMD. AMD has launched RYZEN 7 CPUs that "promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel" and, according to a report the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X just set a new world record score for Cinebench, a respected CPU performance benchmark. That report states that the new RYZEN 7 chip lineup roughly competes with Intel’s i7 line including the i7-6900K, i7-6800K, and i7-7700K. Perhaps more at home in an iMac then. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively, there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. An article by a video professional refers to the Nvidia GTX 1080 which is such a big deal that he thinks: "This card alone will most likely cause a shift in computer workstation ownership. However the card isn't compatible with the Mac Pro: "Even a Thunderbolt-connected PCIe expansion chassis to a Mac Pro trashcan won't help, due to the inherent bandwidth limits that Thunderbolt has as compared to the buss speeds of these GPU cards. And forget about stacking these cards in an expansion chassis… just not going to happen." Because using this card with the Mac Pro is out of the question he predicts: "a huge migration of longtime Apple users (such as me) going to Windows systems for their main workstation needs." Apple could move away from AMD with the next Mac Pro though (it has tended in the past to flit between the two graphics card manufacturers). And this time there may be a good reason: a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple. Read: Retina MacBook Pro review (15in, mid 2014) Retina iMac review OS X 10.10 Yosemite review Buying guide for current Mac Pro models While we wait for the next Mac Pro to arrive, it's worth quickly walking through the current line-up - both for the benefit of those who need a pro-standard Mac desktop right now, and for the clues it gives us to likely future updates. Read our Mac Pro reviews: Mac Pro Six-Core/3.5GHz (late 2013) review | Mac Pro Quad-Core/3.7GHz (Late 2013) review | 2013 Mac Pro review, BTO version Where can I buy a Mac Pro? The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as KRCS and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products. See: Apple price increases UK. Current pricing for Mac Pro build-to-order options  The build-to-order options will push the price higher. The following specifications are available for the 2013 Mac Pro: Build-to-order options on the 3.7GHz Quad-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.5GHz 6-core option (add £450), 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,800), or 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £3,150); 16GB (add £90), 32GB (add £450) or 64GB (add £1,170) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D500 (add £360), or or dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £900); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540) Build-to-order options on the 3.5GHz 6-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,350), 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £2,700); 32GB (add £360) or 64GB (£add £1,080) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £540); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540). A Mac Pro with the maximum 12-core 2.7GHz processors, with 30MB L3 cache, 64GB RAM, 1TB PCIe-based flash storage, Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each currently costs £8,759 including VAT.

Read the latest rumours about the 2017 Mac mini specs, price and UK launch date, after Apple's "something special" store update includes no new Macs by Karen Haslam | 21 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When is the Mac mini 2017 UK release date? Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? How much will the Mac mini 2017 cost in the UK? What are the rumoured features of the Mac mini 2017? Will the Mac mini 2017 have a new design? Also, what is the Mac mini?! When will Apple release a new Mac mini in the UK? And what new features and design changes can we expect from the updated Mac mini in 2017? (Click here to read the latest version of this article.) A new Mac mini is expected to launch in 2017, since the line wasn't updated at all in 2015 or 2016; but Apple (as usual) is giving nothing away. Nevertheless, based on past experience and the specs of current Macs, we've got a fair idea of what to expect from the new Mac mini, and when to expect it. We've got all the new Mac mini hints and rumours for you right here. Read on for the next Mac mini's likely release date, specs, design changes and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information is unearthed, so check back regularly for the latest Mac mini update rumours. And remember to check our Mac buying guide 2017 for current buying advice, and our guide to the best Apple deals. Last updated, 21 March 2017, with the disappointing news that Apple's "something special" store update includes no new Macs (although we're still hoping for an April launch event); on 21 Feb, to report on Apple's announcement of WWDC 2017, and to briefly discuss the chances of a new Mac mini appearing at the event; and previously with the news that Apple has officially made the Mac mini (Early and late 2009, and mid 2010) vintage and obsolete. When is the Mac mini 2017 UK release date? When will the next Mac mini come out? We think March 2017 is a decent bet. (Read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event.) There were rumours suggesting that Apple would do a low-key update to its Mac desktop range by the end of November 2016, focusing on the Mac Pro but potentially covering the iMac and Mac mini at the same time. But it seems Apple disliked the idea. Instead, we would expect the mini to be updated during the company's usual spring event in March 2017. But will there be a spring event after all? At time of writing (21 March) there still haven't been any invitations, and Apple has quietly updated its online store with a range of non-Mac launches and announcements: a new 9.7-inch iPad (called simply "iPad"), a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and higher storage options (at the same price) for the iPad mini 4 and iPhone SE. But no new Macs were announced, and we're holding out hope that they will appear at a rather more high-profile event in April. Availability of chipsets may influence the timing of the launch. The next generation of Intel chips was made available to OEMs in Q4 2016 - they're called Kaby Lake, and it's possible that the new Mac mini could feature processors from this batch. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We'll talk about processors, and other specs, in a later section of this article. The next slot in Apple's launch calendar after its usual spring event is WWDC. WWDC 2017 has just been announced, and while this event always focuses primarily on software (iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 will be the headline announcements), there is sometimes room for hardware. If we still don't see a Mac mini update by this point, it's probably safe to assume that Apple has killed off the Mac mini line - a possibility we address in the next section. Apple last updated the Mac mini on 16 October 2014 after a two-year wait: the previous model came out on 23 October 2012. Mac mini fans are now waiting for the next iteration of the smallest and cheapest Mac. See also: New iMac release | New Mac Pro release Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? Apple, to paraphrase a colleague, is generally very good at killing its darlings: at knowing when it makes sense to drop a much-loved product or product feature - one which is often still popular and/or profitable - and switch focus to something else that has more of a future. Think the iPod classic or the optical drive, or dropping the headphone port from the iPhone 7. There are a couple of candidates to be the next iPod classic. The MacBook Air is one. But the Mac mini, which hasn't been updated since 2014, is rarely mentioned at events, and feels surplus to requirements now that the Apple TV is making its claim as a media centre device (although for storing a large number of films the mini remains an excellent choice, offering 500GB as standard and up to 2TB as a configuration option), will be expecting a P45 more than most of Apple's product line-up. The design of the Mac mini hasn't changed significantly since it was first launched and is starting to feel a little dated, and the device doesn't have a clear selling point (or at least, Apple isn't doing a good job of communicating one). So it wouldn't surprise us if Apple quietly retired the line at its next Mac launch event. It's either that or give it a radical overhaul. If Apple does kill off the mini, we'd have to start asking questions about the 'mini' branding in general, and wondering if the iPads are going to be reorganised: there's already a sense that the 'Air' brand is on the way out, across both MacBooks and iPads. But that's a story for another day. How much will the Mac mini 2017 cost in the UK? There are currently three models of the Mac mini available; the one that's best for you will depend on your budget and computing needs. The cheapest model currently costs £479, the middle model is £679, and the priciest model is £949 - this is a price increase since its launch, likely due to Brexit. Of course, you'll still need to factor in the price of a monitor, keyboard and mouse. (For advice on that, see our roundups of the Best Mac monitors, Best Mac keyboards and Best Mac mice.) However, we don't anticipate Apple reducing the price with the new model when it launches, so you can expect similar pricing. Hopefully better specs for your money, though, of course. Which leads us on to... What are the rumoured features of the Mac mini 2017? The Mac mini is Apple's most budget-focused desktop system and as such features relatively low-end components. But what specs upgrades should we expect from the next Mac mini? Processor: The Kaby Lake question It's unlikely that Apple will include an AMD processor in the next generation of Mac minis... unlikely, but not out of the question, given that AMD's new CPUs are set to come out this year. We'd rate the chances of an AMD chip appearing in the 2017 Mac mini as slight. However, we do expect Kaby Lake, the latest generation of Intel chips. Intel has now started shipping its Kaby Lake processors. But the key word there is 'started': the Kaby Lake processors that would be suitable for a Mac mini may not appear for some months, assuming Apple decides to plump for a Kaby Lake chipset at all. According to MacRumors, in fact, mini-appropriate Kaby Lake chips may not roll out until very late 2016 or even early 2017, so any Mac mini launched before then would be limited to Skylake, the previous generation of Intel processors. That would still represent a significant power boost over the current Haswell processors. Kaby Lake supports Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2, as well as 4K video. The chips are manufactured using a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake. The next generation, Cannonlake, will switch over to a more accurate 10nm process. As we discuss in our iMac rumour roundup, Intel has laid out a roadmap for its next four generations of processor. After Skylake and Kaby Lake, Intel will release Cannonlake, then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019. Read next: Mac mini vs MacBook Air  Graphics Our iMac predictions also include new graphics chipsets: Polaris 10, by AMD, which is particularly interesting because it may make the next iMacs VR-ready. But the current range of Mac mini models feature integrated graphics, and we expect this to remain the case in the next generation. RAM Right now, the entry-level Mac mini features just 4GB RAM as standard, which we think should be ramped up to 8GB in the new entry-level model. Storage The other big change we hope to see in the new Mac mini is the addition of more flash drive options. Currently the 2.8GHz model comes with a Fusion Drive, or you can add 256GB flash storage to that model, or the 2.8GHz model. While the 500GB hard drive in the current entry-level model (and the 1TB hard drive as standard in the £569 model) might appear attractive to some, flash memory is so much faster that we believe it is well worth the compromise of storing additional files on an external hard drive. However, it seems unlikely that Apple would do away with the hard drive storage option altogether, as many workgroups choose the Mac mini as a server and will need the extra capacity and lower prices that HD storage makes possible. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook Air release | New MacBook release USB-C It's felt like the USB port has been on borrowed time ever since Apple launched the first-gen 12-inch MacBook - with its lone USB Type-C (or, more commonly, just USB-C) port for both data and charging - in 2015. Like the optical drive circa 2012, it seems likely that bog-standard USB 3.0 is no longer in Apple's thoughts, and (unless the market rejects USB-C comprehensively, which despite some qualms about there only being one port on the MacBook, hasn't happened yet) it's surely a matter of time before the rest of the Mac line-up switches across to the newer tech. USB-C offers more advantages than just being reversible and thereby easier to connect when you can't see what you're doing; in theory, it offers twice the data throughput of USB 3.0 and the ability to deliver far more power. The latter factor enabled Apple to use USB-C as a combined data and power port and further slim down its laptop design. Our feeling is that the Mac mini won't be next on Apple's update list, however - our money's on the revamped MacBook Pro. As a budget-focused (and somewhat neglected) line, the Mac mini isn't likely to get the love and cutting-edge componentry of more favoured products. And power delivery - and the ability to remove extraneous ports and slim down the chassis - is far less of a concern for a static machine like the mini than for a portable like the MacBook. Will the Mac mini 2017 have a new design? It's possible that the Mac mini will get a new design. We're not expecting a major visual or build redesign, but it is certainly possible that it could get thinner and smaller, especially since it no longer has to accommodate a CD drive. Right now the dimensions are 3.6cm high, 19.7cm wide, and it weighs 1.22kg. How about a Mac mini that has similar dimensions to an Apple TV? (That's 9.8cm wide, 2.3cm high, and a weight of 0.27kg.) There was some speculation that the reason for the long delay prior to the Mac mini update in 2014 was that Apple was looking at redesiging the Mac mini along the lines of the Mac Pro. This was probably intended as an April Fool's Day prank, but we like this render of a flat Mac mini, as seen on Apple User. Even better, how about a Mac mini that's also an Apple TV? Adding Apple TV functionality to a Mac mini would be a great way of getting the Mac mini into people's living rooms as a home entertainment device. Also, what is the Mac mini?! Not the no-brainer it might sound like to keen mini-heads: plenty of otherwise tech-savvy folk aren't aware the Mac mini even exists. Indeed, sometimes it seems like Apple itself isn't aware of its presence. That would certainly explain the long gap before the 2014 model was launched. The Mac mini is Apple's smallest desktop Mac and also its cheapest Mac, at £479. It's a full-blown OS X or macOS Sierra desktop that fits into a self-contained chassis no bigger than a set-top box. It's an inexpensive living-room Mac that lacks the power of even some MacBooks and comes with no keyboard, mouse or display, but one that works perfectly as the centre of your digital home - not least because it comes with HDMI sockets, so that plugging it into a modern TV is a doddle. There used to be a Mac mini with OS X Server available for £849 but Apple removed that option from the line-up in October 2014.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When will new iMacs be launched in the UK? What about the new iMac's tech specs? Could the iMac replace the Mac Pro? Complete guide to 2015 iMac launch When will Apple release new iMacs in the UK? Will Apple update its iMac desktop line to add Intel Kaby Lake processor chips, and what other tech specs, design changes and new features should we expect in the next generation of iMacs? Lastly, how much will the new iMacs for 2017 cost in the UK? Apple's last iMac update came back in October 2015, when it introduced a Retina-class screen resolution to the smaller Macs for the first time and equipped the larger models with new Skylake processor chips. Before that, you had to go back more than two years - if you don't include the cheaper iMac which Apple launched in June 2014 - to the last proper new iMac update, in September 2013, when Apple added Haswell processors, new graphics, next-gen Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options. It's been a while, then, which is why we're looking ahead to the next iMac launch - an early-2017 iMac update, hopefully. In this article we round up all the speculation about Apple's next iMac update: when new iMacs will be released in the UK, new iMac prices, tech specs and new features to expect, any leaked photos and videos that appear online, and all the other new iMac rumours that are fit to print. Updated, 21 March 2017, to discuss Apple's March product updates (and the lack of new Macs); and on 2 Mar, with rumours that Apple will switch from Intel to AMD processors for the next iMac Read next: Where to buy iMacs in the UK | Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iMac deals UK When will new iMacs be launched in the UK? When will new iMacs come out? Next month (April 2017), we hope, but nothing official has been announced yet. (Read more: What to expect at Apple's spring 2017 event.) Aside from September's regular iPhone launches, spring (and usually March) is the time Apple normally holds a press conference to announce a new product. The iPhone SE and 9.7in iPad Pro were announced on 21 March 2016. Fingers crossed April will bring an event with new iMacs. Apple did update a number of its products in March 2017, quietly updating its online store with a new 9.7-inch iPad (called simply "iPad"), adding a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and increasing the storage options for the iPad mini 4 and iPhone SE. But no new Macs were announced, and we're holding out hope that they will appear at a rather more high-profile event in April. The Best Buy leak discussed in the processor section of this article, which emerged at the start of October 2016, strongly suggests that the retailer has had advance warning of an imminent launch and posted a listing slightly too early by mistake - although it's also possible that this was a speculative listing created on the basis that it would probably be needed at some point. Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook veers away from using the word "Mac" in his response. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get more of a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important.  A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell.  What does previous launch history tell us? The last iMac update was in October 2015. Apple's yearly cycle is built around three major press events: autumn - usually September (new iPhones and iPads); spring - usually March (new iPhones and iPads, sometimes MacBooks and watches); and summer - usually June (WWDC - operating system updates, and occasional hardware). But that doesn't mean the company stays quiet the rest of the year. Mac updates can be folded into the big three events, but they're often launched at their own smaller launch events. The iMac update in 2015 got its own announcement, a few weeks after the iPhone 6s reveal. But bear in mind that, unlike the yearly or event twice-yearly update events we're used to for iOS devices, desktop Mac refreshes have frequently come several years apart. WWDC 2017 (which will take place from 5-9 June this year - here's how to get WWDC tickets) is therefore a possibility, and we may have to wait even longer than that. What about the new iMac's tech specs? We'll add leaked details about the tech specs of the new iMacs to this section as we hear them. Here's what we know so far. Processor Apple skipped Intel's much-delayed Broadwell processors and went straight from Haswell to Skylake for the 2015 update. Skylake uses the same 14nm manufacturing process as Broadwell, but brings even greater CPU and GPU performance, along with reduced power consumption. But what chips will appear in the next set of iMacs? Clearly that will depend on their launch date and the hardware that's available at the time. After 2015's Skylake, the next round of Intel processors, which started going into mass production in late 2016 and is still being rolled out, is Kaby Lake; this will be followed by Cannonlake (Cannonlake was due to be next, but it's been delayed until the second half of 2017). Then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019, for those who enjoy this sort of thing. Kaby Lake uses a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake, but Cannonlake switches over to a more accurate 10nm process. Intel started shipping its Kaby Lake processors in July 2016, and the chips offer support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. It's therefore now possible that Apple will squeeze Kaby Lake chips into the next iMac update, but by no means guaranteed, given Apple's past behaviour. In early January, Intel used CES 2017 in Las Vegas to introduce its Kaby Lake processors officially, after announcing low power versions of Kaby Lake processors in August of 2016. The chips shown off in January are powerful enough to be used in Apple's Macs, suggesting that updates are imminent. Processor models The specific model of Kaby Lake processor we're expecting to appear in the next iMac is the i7-7700. And as luck would have it, Tom's Hardware has got hold of what they understand to be a pre-release sample of that chip. Naturally they promptly overclocked it and put it through rigorous speed tests. Those speed tests found that the i7-7700 (or rather the i7-7700K - the K in the name denoting that the clock multiplier has been unlocked to allow for overclocking) was capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked. Serious speed which, as BGR observes, would give the new iMac bragging rights over the rival Surface Studio, launched before the relevant Kaby Lake chips became available. Micosoft could always launch an updated Surface Studio with Kaby Lake, of course, although that might annoy the early buyers. Back in October 2016, the US retailer Best Buy leaked a listing for a new iMac, and it had a Kaby Lake chipset - a "7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor". As Technobuffalo points out, this isn't necessarily genuine: an employee could have created this as a placeholder until official information is available. But slip-ups of this kind more often happen because a retailer has been given advance warning of an imminent launch and somebody sets it live too early by mistake. We'd say - based on this and other clues - that a Kaby Lake iMac is looking like a decent bet for launch in the near future. In November 2016, further evidence emerged that sheds light on the prospects of a Kaby Lake iMac. Intel briefly made documents available on its website, intended for PC manufacturer partners rather than consumers, that detail specs of new Kaby Lake processors - and Anandtech spotted and grabbed them. The documents detail 11 new processors, including seven i5 chips and three i7s; 10 of them are designated for desktop use and one is for worktop. There's still no sign of the Kaby Lake laptop processors we expect to use as part of a MacBook Pro update in early 2017. AMD processors We expect Apple to choose Intel-based CPUs, but there's a chance AMD could also make an appearance in certain iMac models. The AMD Zen processor, launched in 2016, boasts 8 cores and 16 threads - a massive amount of raw processing power. Given the suggested price tag of the Zen CPU, we expect it either to be in the top-spec iMacs or be an upgrade option. The inclusion of other AMD processors is also not far-fetched, as we still see it being an option for cheaper iMac models. At the end of February 2017, in the response to news of a recording-breaking benchmark performance by the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X processor, Architosh discussed the possibility of Apple switching from Intel to AMD as its Mac chip supplier. The site was particularly interested in AMD's superior power efficiency, something which fits in with Apple's recent philosophy. "Today's current iMac 5K model," the site points out, "uses an Intel 14nm Skylake 4-core i7-6700K processor with a TDP of 91W. Based on the iMac's actual frequency, the TDP is possibly low 80s W range. But AMD's RYZEN 7 1700 is at 65W already and has 8 cores." Architosh even ponders if AMD's recent development work has been geared towards catching Apple's eye: "Is it possible that when AMD decided to work from a clean state four years ago that they began the RYZEN line with the possibility of wooing Apple at some point in the future?" As we said above, switching to AMD processors for the next iMac would be a surprise, but it no longer seems impossible. Graphics chips It's believed that Apple's next generation of iMacs (or its higher-specced models, at least) will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, which were announced at the start of 2016. WCCF Tech reports that AMD won the contract last October but was only able to get confirmation from additional sources in April 2016. The contract is for two chipsets: Polaris 10 (previously known as Ellesmere) and Polaris 11 (previously known as Baffin), and WCCF Tech says these processors will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". With the MacBook and MacBook Air having recently seen updates, and the Mac mini highly unlikely to incorporate a discrete graphics unit, the remaining candidates are the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. MacRumors reasons that the power range of these chips makes Polaris 11 a strong fit for the MacBook Pro, while Polaris 10 suits the iMac. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations (as much as twice the speed per watt) and potential reductions in both power consumption and waste heat. They are built using a 16nm or 14nm FinFET production process, compared to 28nm on AMD's earlier chips, which means that the chip maker can fit more transistors in a given space (which makes the chips ideal for ultraportable laptops and ultraslim desktops - the latter fitting recent iMac designs) and, because the transistors are closer together, less power is needed to move a signal across them. Apple's current iMac line-up features AMD Radeon graphics chipsets as standard in the 27-inch models. The 21-inch models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Read next: New Mac Pro rumours | New Mac mini rumours Virtual reality Talking about graphics architecture can be a little dry, but the Polaris rumour discussed above has a sexier element to it: VR. AMD has consistently talked up its Polaris graphics chips as a way of bringing VR within the reach of a wider market of PC users. At present Macs are basically unusable for VR, as we discuss in our articles Can you use Oculus Rift with Mac? and How to use a Mac for VR, and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey specifically cited underpowered Mac GPUs as the reason why the company was focusing on Windows: "People have said, 'Why don't you support Macs? So many people have Macs.' It's true. A lot of people have Apple hardware, especially in the laptop space. But the GPUs in those, they're not even close to what we're pushing for our recommended spec." But adding Polaris GPUs to the iMac could change Luckey's mind. AMD's Roy Taylor thinks the company's new GPUs are about to massively expand the available market for VR. "AMD has just completed the shrink to 14nm [with Polaris]," he said. "This means we can produce GPUs that will run the minimum spec of VR at a lower cost, in larger volume, consuming less power and running faster. That means in the second half of this year and going forward, more people will be able to run those headsets." Visit WCCF Tech for more info. VR remains a niche topic in tech - the number of people actually willing to shell out for the whole shebang remains small, even if casual gamers who try the Vive or the Oculus Rift tend to love it - but it gets a lot of press at the moment. And it can't be nice for a company that prides itself on the quality of its products to hear them disparaged as "not even close" to being up to a task. As Jim Lynch on CIO colourfully phrases it, "As far as VR goes, it's not something that I have paid much attention to, but it certainly couldn't hurt for Apple's computers to be able to do it adequately... If VR lights a fire under Apple's rear end and gets the company to put out a pro version of the iMac, then it will be a good thing for all users." Flash storage We'll repeat our hope, expressed this time last year while waiting for the 2015 update, that Apple makes flash storage standard across the entire range of iMacs. At present the 27-inch iMacs get a Fusion Drive by default (Fusion Drives are a high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) and the 21.5-inch models can add them as a build-to-order option for an extra £80. We think it should be offered as standard in all Apple's desktops. The current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple's laptops - to the extent that Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives. Read next: Best external SSD flash drives for Mac Could the iMac replace the Mac Pro? In our roundup of rumours about the next Mac Pro, we discuss the possibility that Apple is planning to wrap up that line - and one way such a move could work is by ramping up the top spec of the iMac line so that it meets the needs of professional users, rendering the Pro irrelevant. TechRadar has speculated about the specs of a theoretical 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling. All of this is certainly a possibility. But while the Mac Pro doesn't appear to be tearing up trees commercially, it was never a line that was about making money. The Mac Pro is a flagship product, a niche offering and a positioning exercise - a way of reassuring Mac buyers that Apple is still a company that makes products for pro users. In some senses it's like the Apple Watch Edition: a glamorous, unnecessarily expensive aspiration point that passes on some of its stardust to the more affordable diffusion lines below.

Have your say in our poll: Turn to the next page to read about 2015's iMac update: the facts as they were announced, and the (generally quite accurate!) pre-announcement speculation we reported on beforehand. >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 Tags: Mac , Rumour , iMac Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

Jones Posted 18 Mar 1977 | 8:00 GMT 1. Intel Inside Self-Driving Cars Image: Mobileye Intel is buying Mobileye, the Israeli robocar firm, for $15.3 billion. It’s one of the largest robocar acquisitions in a two-year buying frenzy that has swept both the auto industry and the tech companies that want to eat its lunch. Intel has thus bought itself not only a full suite of robocar technology but also wide-ranging contacts in the auto industry. Its newly established self-driving unit also incorporates a 15 percent stake in Here, a mapping company.     2. Tesla Batteries Propel Renewable Energy Project A 33,000-member electric power cooperative on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, is using 272 Powerpack energy storage units—which use a design derived from the Tesla Model S electric vehicle—to make solar power produced during the daytime available to customers well into peak demand periods after sunset.   3. Smartphone Accelerometers Can Be Fooled by Sound Waves The accelerometers in your smartphone—the ones that help track the distance you walk and automatically rotate the view when you turn the phone sideways—can be remotely hacked. A research team figured out that they could fool a smartphone’s accelerometers using sound waves. What’s more, they were able to cause two signal processing components within a phone to generate a false report of the accelerometer’s behavior.   4. Why Mary Lou Jepsen Left Facebook Mary Lou Jepsen, well known for stints at Facebook and Google, went to this year’s SXSW Interactive to talk about her latest project, a startup called Openwater. The new company is the vehicle by which Jepsen plans to transform health care and telepathy. What is Openwater bringing to the game? A new type of imaging with resolution as good as that produced by massive and expensive MRI machines, but accomplished with components that fit inside a ski hat or a bandage that wraps around a body part.    5. A Big Step Toward Reversing Paralysis In a hospital in Switzerland, a permanently paralyzed people are now learning to walk again with the help of stimulating electrodes implanted in their spines. With electrical stimulation and physical training, the few nerve fibers around spinal cord injuries that had been spared from damage regrew and reorganized to bring commands from the patients’ brains to their legs.

And what tech specs, new features and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2017? Or is it more likely that Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? (Click here to read the latest version of this article.) We've had a long wait for the new Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013, shipping that December, and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. In addition, many of the Mac Pro's traditional creative professional audience (videographers, designers, photographers) have hung onto their ancient Mac Pro towers that predate the 2013 redesign because their old Mac Pros, which could be customised, offered more flexibility and power, at least at the time Apple launched the new-look 'trashcan-style' Mac Pro. So we're long overdue an update to the Mac Pro before creative Mac professionals turn towards Windows and Linux for their workstation needs... those that haven't already turned their back on Apple, at least. Some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued, though, we look at the reasons why they think that below. For more discussion of upcoming Apple launches, take a look at our big roundup of Apple predictions for 2017. And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide 2017. Updated, 21 March 2017, with the disappointing news that Apple's "something special" update didn't include any new Macs (although we're still optimistic about an April launch event); and on 1 Mar, to report that Tim Cook has been talking about the importance of the professional and creative markets in the biggest hint yet that a new Mac Pro could be on the way. See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours Will Apple update the Mac Pro? There is always going to be the question of whether Apple will turn its back on the Mac, with the iPhone becoming such a significant part of its business, and with Steve Jobs having said that the desktops days were numbered when he spoke about how the iPad would revolutionise computing. However, we can confidently say that Apple isn't turning away from the Mac desktop just yet, based on CEO Tim Cook's comments below. Further comments from Tim Cook indicate that Apple isn't about to give up on the professional market either. Speaking at the Shareholders meeting on 28 February 2017, Cook indicated that Apple is still focused on its professional customers and has plans to "do more" in that area. Cook said: "You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular. "Don't think something we've done or something that we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere," Cook added. However, the 'and' between 'creative' and 'professional' could be telling, and a way out of giving a clear answer about the Mac Pro (or the iMac or FCP). Regarding Cooks comments, our colleague on Digital Arts suggested that the "people who are creative-but-not-professional and professional-but-not-creative would probably look to the MacBook Pro (which is fine for photo-editing and Office)". He feels that the MacBook Pro is more suited to people who see themselves as creatives, rather than creative professionals. Could the same be said to apply to Mac Pro users. Regardless of nitpicking about what constitutes a 'creative professional', Cook's comments give us hope that Apple will update the Mac Pro, despite all the commentary to the contrary (more on that below). While the updated unit may no longer meet the requirements of professional creatives, and while the cost of production may not justify its existence (and the cost is probably high due to Apple building it in the US rather than outsourcing to China), we don't think that Apple is about to turn its back on a product that allows it to show off its best technological advancements. There is some evidence that a new Mac Pro (one with 10 USB 3 ports) is in the pipeline - some code in Mac OS X El Capitan was discovered that referenced a machine with the codename AAPLJ95,1. The current generation of Mac Pro was codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it seems a fair bet that the new model is also a Mac Pro. Although El Capitan has now been superseded by macOS Sierra so maybe that was just an anomaly in the code. (More on this code below). In addition, a few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect a new Mac Pro by the end of November 2016, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it is certainly possible that things have been delayed and we could still see a new Mac Pro soon. When is the new Mac Pro release date? We expect (or perhaps hope) that the new Mac Pro will be launched in April 2017 (read more: What to expect at Apple's spring 2017 event), although it may be a more likely star of the WWDC keynote in June, since that event tends to have more of a focus on pro Macs. On 21 March 2017 Apple temporarily shut down its online store and posted a notice saying: "We've got something special in store for you. And we can't wait for you to see it. Please check back soon." Sadly this didn't turn out to include any Macs. Apple quietly updated its online store with a new 9.7-inch iPad (called simply "iPad"), added a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and increased the storage options for the iPad mini 4 and iPhone SE. But no new Macs were announced, and we're holding out hope that they will appear at a rather more high-profile event in April. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013. That's nearly four years ago (although the Mac Pro didn't actually ship until that December - and supply was so restrained that most users didn't get theirs until the following spring). It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. As it turned out, Apple did unveil a new MacBook Pro at the October event, so there was something for 'creative professionals' (although whether creative pros feel that it is meant for them is another question). You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) If the new Mac Pro doesn't appear at Apple's spring press event in March, then WWDC 2017, whose dates and ticket lottery were announced in February, would be the next slot in the Apple launch calendar. While Apple tends to focus on software at WWDC, and iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 will dominate the event, the launch of the 2013 Mac Pro shows there is a place for hardware at Apple's summer event if the circumstances are right. Could Apple launch a Pro iMac instead of a new Mac Pro? In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac desktop, referring only to the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" In response, Cook wrote the following (failing to mention the Mac Pro, or the Mac mini for that matter): "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important before speaking about the iMac. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why the question was asked and why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. Does this suggest that Apple will condense its Mac desktop offering into the iMac, discontinuing the Mac Pro and the Mac mini? Such a move would certainly help simplify its desktop offering. Perhaps Apple plans to do exactly that, with the launch of a Pro iMac that goes above and beyond what the 5K iMac offers currently. It's possible that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, but it's unlikely that such a model will ever meet the needs of Apple's traditional Mac Pro market, many of whom are still using old Mac Pros from pre-2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) Those who did upgrade to the trashcan-like Mac Pro are finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. Other professional creatives have abandoned the Mac and moved to Windows. It's a shame because these creative professionals, while a niche market, wield a lot of influence. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. Is the new Mac Pro 2017 release date delayed? When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. What are the rumoured Mac Pro 2017 specifications? Currently, there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. Ports: Thunderbolt and USB 3 The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon offering more Thunderbolt ports in the form of USB-3. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. (Read more about Thunderbolt and the Mac Pro here). Many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays. Processor: Intel Kaby Lake or AMD RYZEN 7? The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Another idea, although somewhat crazy, is that Apple could abandon Intel chips altogether and move to AMD. AMD has launched RYZEN 7 CPUs that "promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel" and, according to a report the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X just set a new world record score for Cinebench, a respected CPU performance benchmark. That report states that the new RYZEN 7 chip lineup roughly competes with Intel’s i7 line including the i7-6900K, i7-6800K, and i7-7700K. Perhaps more at home in an iMac then. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively, there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. An article by a video professional refers to the Nvidia GTX 1080 which is such a big deal that he thinks: "This card alone will most likely cause a shift in computer workstation ownership. However the card isn't compatible with the Mac Pro: "Even a Thunderbolt-connected PCIe expansion chassis to a Mac Pro trashcan won't help, due to the inherent bandwidth limits that Thunderbolt has as compared to the buss speeds of these GPU cards. And forget about stacking these cards in an expansion chassis… just not going to happen." Because using this card with the Mac Pro is out of the question he predicts: "a huge migration of longtime Apple users (such as me) going to Windows systems for their main workstation needs." Apple could move away from AMD with the next Mac Pro though (it has tended in the past to flit between the two graphics card manufacturers). And this time there may be a good reason: a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple. Read: Retina MacBook Pro review (15in, mid 2014) Retina iMac review OS X 10.10 Yosemite review Buying guide for current Mac Pro models While we wait for the next Mac Pro to arrive, it's worth quickly walking through the current line-up - both for the benefit of those who need a pro-standard Mac desktop right now, and for the clues it gives us to likely future updates. Read our Mac Pro reviews: Mac Pro Six-Core/3.5GHz (late 2013) review | Mac Pro Quad-Core/3.7GHz (Late 2013) review | 2013 Mac Pro review, BTO version Where can I buy a Mac Pro? The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as KRCS and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products. See: Apple price increases UK. Current pricing for Mac Pro build-to-order options  The build-to-order options will push the price higher. The following specifications are available for the 2013 Mac Pro: Build-to-order options on the 3.7GHz Quad-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.5GHz 6-core option (add £450), 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,800), or 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £3,150); 16GB (add £90), 32GB (add £450) or 64GB (add £1,170) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D500 (add £360), or or dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £900); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540) Build-to-order options on the 3.5GHz 6-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,350), 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £2,700); 32GB (add £360) or 64GB (£add £1,080) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £540); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540). A Mac Pro with the maximum 12-core 2.7GHz processors, with 30MB L3 cache, 64GB RAM, 1TB PCIe-based flash storage, Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each currently costs £8,759 including VAT.

GPU engines are out and AI translators will help you pull 21 Mar 2017 at 09:32, Dr. Stephen Perrenod From voice translation to self-driving automobile, AI's impact in everyday life will become more and more apparent this year. The AI and deep learning market will experience even more rapid technological advancement, very rapid growth and adoption, and increasing competition for both hardware and software platforms. While AI fears will remain, the public will become more cognisant and comfortable with social media AI applications. Deep learning training: GPUs and more Deep learning training lends itself to what we call "High Density Processing". High density processing applies when algorithms are computationally intensive, having higher ratios of compute operations per byte of memory bandwidth. In such cases dense clusters of multicore CPUs hosting accelerator technology can provide highly favourable cost-performance and performance per watt. GPUs, because of their ability to provide high density processing, have enabled deep learning computations and have dominated recently. In 2017, we will start seeing a move from the near monopoly of GPUs for training to hosting on a rather wide variety of multicore and accelerator technologies. These will include Knights Landing/Knights Mill chips and AI accelerators implemented as FPGAs or ASICs. But the GPU will still be widely used. Short fixed-point arithmetic can offer order of magnitude performance advantages over floating point (see here). These low-power solutions with special purpose architectures can demonstrate better price/performance than even GPUs. Cloudy options abound with Amazon, Baidu and Microsoft having augmented their GPU-based cloud offerings with FPGA options for AI applications, and Google "supercharging" their Cloud AI with ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units employing short arithmetic. Intel will also be a leader in bringing accelerators to market, and the combination of Knights Landing plus the Nervana Engine technology to be unveiled later this year looks particularly intriguing. So in 2017, GPU dominance will be eroded. We think it is premature to talk about a "post-GPU" era, and expect GPUs to maintain a very comfortable lead, but we do expect a much richer mix of technologies to emerge. Deep learning software libraries proliferate Deep learning isn't just about the hardware; software libraries that enable algorithms that take advantage of said hardware and that put the technology into more hands are maybe even more important. We're seeing several libraries battle for dominance in the AI arena. Google's TensorFlow has leapt to the forefront on GitHub and Intel recently responded with their BigDL deep learning framework for Spark. Theano, Microsoft's CNTK and many others – the vast majority of which have CUDA support – will compete eagerly for developer mindshare. It's too early to call the race, but our prediction is that Microsoft and Intel are the most likely companies to give Google a run for the money. What's in it for Microsoft is promotion of their software ecosystem, especially around Big Data and IoT. Intel wants increased hardware sales, not surprisingly. And Google appears to be most interested in growing their developer ecosystem to gather new applications that they can then monetise in areas such as self-driving automobiles. Voice translation breaks out Voice translation will be one of the biggest breakout application segments. International travellers will begin to use it regularly on their mobile phones for short conversations, including ordering food and coffee, buying train tickets, and other shopping. Text translation in messaging apps has become routine, especially for certain language pairs, facilitating communication between lovers, family and friends, and international project team members. The many "Lost In Translation" occurrences lead to abundant laughter, frustration and misunderstandings, and even breakups. Despite the limitations of machine translation, the appeal will be irresistible. Usage in personal social interaction will initially be much greater than for business. Could this be the killer app for consumer AI? AI fears will vary AI fears in some respects will ease as the public becomes more cognisant and comfortable with AI applications that are accessed from, or that support applications running on, their mobile-based social media platforms (Google, Facebook, and Twitter in particular). But concerns around governments' electronic monitoring of social media content and face recognition in public spaces will remain. Facebook, Twitter and others will struggle with the appropriate level of tuning of AI solutions to filter out fake news, offensive videos, and hate speech. Their complicity with nondemocratic government requests for censorship will grow at the expense of freedom of expression. In addition, concerns around middle-class job losses to automated machine learning systems will continue to grow as the globalisation backlash continues. Healthcare AI will progress steadily A raft of AI applications in healthcare – including for diagnosis, patient monitoring, and even clinical trials – will make steady progress, but there will be no major breakthroughs. Patient interest will grow significantly as AI healthcare case studies become more numerous and positive outcomes recorded. AI will be seen in a very positive light for medical imaging evaluation and diagnosis, and will begin to lead to significant cost savings. Trial usage for laboratory tests (blood, urine) will grow, but lag usage for imaging applications significantly. Although patients might be concerned about robots replacing doctors, it will be enhancement, not replacement that is relevant. Generally the patient will not know when doctors and nurses are using AI to support healthcare decisions. As one example, IBM's Watson technology reached the same diagnosis as oncologists in 99 per cent of cancer cases examined, yet it was also able to explore a wider range of options, since it can extremely rapidly explore the medical literature. Second opinions will be arrived at in realtime, which will save everyone time and money. Self-driving cars will hit speed bumps Self-driving automobile ("auto-automobile") technology will advance, but will experience speed bumps and citizen backlash as a growing number of trials leads to more accidents, including fatalities, even as statistics point to a significant reduction in accidents. Local and national government restrictions will tighten, and trials will increasingly be focused on lower-risk driving scenarios. In the high-risk arena, military interest in self-driving ground-based vehicles will become very evident, due to the potential savings of lives and money, and the prospects for using such vehicles to confuse the enemy since soldier casualties will be removed from the equation. So, to sum up: You're not going to exclusively use GPUs as your AI engine forever, and you're going to have a wide range of choices when it comes to AI libraries. You'll be using AI language translators for pick-up lines on your next international business trip, making you more comfortable with AI applications, but you'll still be afraid of what the government might do with the same technology, and that an AI might take your job. You'll be healthier because AI medical care applications will speedily diagnose and recommend treatments for your injuries and ills. And, finally, there's a slightly better chance you'll need this enhanced medical care since self-driving cars will be tested in greater numbers. Phew.

Join For Free Learn how you can maximize big data in the cloud with Apache Hadoop. Download this eBook now. Brought to you in partnership with Hortonworks. There are two clear trends in the Big Data ecosystem: the growth of Machine Learning use cases that leverage large distributed data sets, and the growth of Spark’s Machine Learning libraries (often referred to as MLlib) for these use cases. In fact, Spark’s MLlib library is arguably the leading solution for Machine Learning on large distributed data sets. Intel and Cloudera have collaborated to speed up Spark’s ML algorithms, via integration with Intel’s Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL). Intel MKL is a library of optimized math routines that are hand-optimized specifically for Intel processors. For example, it includes highly optimized routines for Linear Algebra, Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), Vector Math, and Statistics functions. These mathematical operations are building blocks for Machine Learning and related analytic algorithms, and thus integration with MKL delivers a massive performance boost for machine learning workloads. Spark is already instrumented to take advantage of optimized implementations of these routines using netlib-java, but it still requires the addition of an implementation like MKL to activate these optimizations. The Benchmark We benchmarked performance of MKL against the default JVM-based execution (referred to as F2JBLAS) and against a popular open source hardware acceleration library called OpenBLAS. For the benchmark, we used an open source suite of performance tests called spark-perf. We selected seven popular Machine Learning Algorithms for the benchmark: ALS: Alternating Least Squares for collaborative filtering. PCA: Principal Component Analysis. LDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation. SVD: Singular Value Decomposition. Logistic Regression classifier. RF: Random Forest classifier. GBT: Gradient Boosted Tree classifier. For the popular Logistic Regression algorithm (which arguably still is the most popular algorithm for building predictive analytics use cases), MKL provides an incredible 9x performance boost vs. F2JBLAS, and a significant 2.5x performance boost over OpenBLAS. ALS, which is the most popular algorithm for building recommender systems, demonstrates a resounding 4x performance boost. As you can see, the achieved performance boost varies for different algorithms. Moreover, it should be noted that the observed performance boost will have some variation over different Intel processors. This benchmark was done on Intel® Xeon® E5-2697A processors, and more details about the hardware used for the benchmark are provided below. The best part about the performance boost with MKL is that it does not require a modified version of Spark or modifications to your Spark application code, nor does it require procurement of extra or special hardware (after all, most data centers in the world are running Intel processors). It merely requires a few steps to install MKL on your cluster. Moreover, we will soon simplify the installation process by providing MKL as a parcel which can be installed on your entire CDH cluster via two simple clicks in Cloudera Manager. The benefits of these performance gains are clear: improved performance means you can train with larger data sets, explore a larger range of the model hyper-parameter space, and train more models. In many cases, it alleviates the need to buy any specialized hardware for your Machine Learning workloads.

The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said. Israel has long billed itself as “Startup Nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. “This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak,” he said.

By Richard Leadbetter Published 21/03/2017 We're late with our Ryzen 7 review for a number of reasons, and some might argue that the key story has already been told. We can confirm that the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X does indeed match and occasionally even exceed Intel's mighty Core i7 6900K octo-core/16-thread monster on a great many benchmarks and heavily multi-threaded workloads. By this measure alone, AMD's return to a competitive footing in the x86 processor market is a remarkable achievement. But equally, our own tests confirm less impressive results posted by many: Ryzen 7's gaming performance does not match up to Intel's on most titles. The question is - why? One aspect we have to take into account is that the AM4 Summit Ridge platform is in its earliest days. We used two boards during our testing, an MSI X370 XPower Gaming Titanium and an Asus ROG Crosshair 6 Hero - both supplied by AMD - but try as we might, the supplied Corsair 3000MHz DDR4 modules in our press package would not work at anything like their stated frequencies. AMD suggested loosened latency timings and lower bandwidth, but we still couldn't get it to work as it should (despite other reviewers with the same kit getting better results). Our review would concentrate on gaming performance and as all of our recent CPU reviews have revealed, in-game frame-rates have a close relationship with clock-speed and memory frequency. Things are improving though - GSkill provided new Flare X-branded modules that feature low C14 latency and 3200MHz speed. On our MSI board, equipped with a fresh BIOS, everything just worked - 'A-XMP' set-up almost everything to spec, though DRAM voltage needed to be manually set. Our test system, featuring the MSI Xpower Gaming Titanium AMD provided motherboards, coolers, processors and memory to the majority of the specialist press, including Digital Foundry. Different outlets received different boards paired with different processors - with Asus, Gigabyte and MSI represented as partners for the Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X and 1700. We received the 1800X initially along with the MSI Xpower Gaming Titanium - one of the most feature-packed and indeed expensive boards available based on the X370 chipset. Definitely skewed to the luxury end of the market, the Xpower Gaming Titanium features a unique faux-metallic colour scheme paired with the usual top-end features - support for high-end storage including six SATA-3 ports, twin M.2 connections and an additional U.2 port. The 'steel armour' PCI Express ports support both CrossFire and SLI, while there's no shortage of USB 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 and Type-C support. Intel provides the Gigabit LAN controller, with Realtek's ALC1220 codec in play. Additional headers are provided for those looking to watercool their system, while the board curiously has a surfeit of ATX power inputs - the usual 24-pin and eight-pin inputs are joined by further four-pin and six-pin sockets. We didn't have much luck with the supplied Corsair DDR4 modules, but GSkill stepped in to provide one of its new Flare X branded kits - two 8GB modules with low 14-14-14-34 latency and 3200MHz bandwidth. We had no problem integrating these modules into the system to achieve the best results possible for memory performance on the fledgling platform. It's worth noting that we compared the Ryzen 7 1800X to Intel system's using legacy data from our previous Kaby Lake reviews. Here we used four sticks of Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM rated at 3000MHz with 15-17-17-35 latency. This same memory was used to benchmark the Core i7 6900K and i7 5960X. However, here, the XMP profile boosted base clock to 125MHz, overclocking processors. We dropped the base clock based to its standard 100MHz, necessitated an overclock here to 3200MHz. Because we used four modules, the X99 platform defaulted to quad-channel memory mode, potentially offering a significant bandwidth advantage over both the 7700K and the Ryzen system. Game on! Or rather... not. There's the sense that despite its lengthy gestation period, Ryzen isn't fully integrated with Windows yet, meaning that AMD wants us to make a number of changes for best performance. Dipping into the Windows 10 power profile, AMD recommends changing the setting from the standard balanced to high performance mode. The Windows high precision event timer needs to be disabled to add a few points to the performance scale. There are other tips AMD proffers, designed to push Ryzen performance higher in gaming scenarios, and we'll discuss those in due course. Rich's extended video review of the Ryzen 7 1800X. So just what is going on with Ryzen's gaming performance? Buy the Ryzen 7 1800X [?] from Amazon with free shipping. Once set-up though, it's clear that Ryzen does indeed meet the hype in many respects, particularly with its multi-threading capabilities. The results across the web demonstrating this are legion, but just to cover the bases, below you'll find our Cinebench R15 results along with h.264 and HEVC Handbrake encoding tests, based on transcoding one of our demanding 4K videos. Ryzen is faster than the 6900K on h.264, but the Intel chip takes point with intense HEVC encoding. HEVC has more of a focus on AVX2 instructions - an area where AMD has an architectural disadvantage. Regardless, the Intel eight-core chip is only 11 per cent ahead. Scalability with HEVC seems to need some work though - the i7 7700K isn't so far behind. That particular i7 may lack cores, but its frequency is higher, which still seems to count for a lot. But it's the gaming side of things where Ryzen has provoked the most controversy. In terms of single-thread and multi-thread performance, Cinebench tests - and many others - confirm that Ryzen 7 1800X is competitive with a chip Intel sells that costs twice as much, while Ryzen 7 1700X and stand a good chance of overclocking to something close to 1800X performance. With such fundamental validation on one set of number-crunching workloads, it stands to reason that Ryzen should perform in a similar manner on another: gaming - but it doesn't. First up, a look at our test system and an explanation of how we benchmark CPUs. We're mostly using parts supplied by an AMD - MSI's X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium is a beautiful, top-tier motherboard, but we've swapped out the Corsair 3000MHz Vengeance LPX that we couldn't push beyond 2400MHz with GSkill's freshly minted low-latency C14 3200MHz Ryzen-validated modules. XMP isn't supported natively by AMD (it's an Intel format), which may have led to some of our compatibility issues, but all major manufacturers have their own emulation of the system. In the case of the MSI board, it instantly locked onto the correct timings and frequency for the GSkill modules, but the latest BIOS is required for this level of 'plug and play' compatibility. AMD also supplied an EK Predator 240 closed-loop watercooler - a monstrous piece of kit. Core i3 7350K Core i5 7600K Core i7 7700K Core i7 5960X Core i7 6900K Ryzen 7 1800X Cinebench R15 Single-Core 184 173 187 133 167 162 Cinebench R15 Multi-Core 450 654 963 1310 1460 1605 Handbrake 0.10.5 x264 6.4fps 9.6fps 13.1fps 17.5fps 18.5fps 19.6fps Handbrake 0.10.5 x265/HEVC 2.8fps 4.8fps 6.2fps 6.9fps 7.2fps 6.5fps We believe that a CPU purchase should last for years, so rather than test processors with a particular GPU at standard gaming conditions, we opt instead to take the graphics hardware out of the test results as best we can and to attempt to concentrate more closely on a processor's gaming potential. The aim here is to ascertain relative performance between CPUs when running game engine code - this gives a better idea of how 'lastable' a potential processor may be. Check out this Kaby Lake CPU performance comparison, for example. It illustrates how much extra frame-rate you get from a CPU relative to the price you pay for it. To produce these results, we run a game at ultra settings or equivalent at 1080p resolution when paired with an overclocked Titan X Pascal. This ensures that the CPU is tested at its peak doing the jobs it is intended for - processing game logic, calculating animation and physics, as well as one of its most crucial tasks: preparing instructions for the GPU. It's fair to say that Ryzen is competitive in some titles here, but falls short in others. The raw numbers can be sobering though: the top-tier Ryzen is beaten by the i5 7600K in four out of seven titles, and it's significantly off the pace set by the i7s in games like Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12, The Witcher 3 and Ashes of the Singularity's brutal CPU benchmark. Far Cry Primal is a game that is multi-core aware, but is powered by a dominant single thread. Here we see the more slowly clocked eight-core chips on Intel's older architectures easily beaten by both Kaby Lake processors, but Ryzen is also significantly behind. Crysis 3 remains one of the best multithreaded gaming workouts and acquits itself well with the 1800X (more so than the numbers suggest, as we shall discover) but the disappointing Tomb Raider result is strange: this game scales up adequately on the Intel eight-core processors - something of a rarity - but Ryzen disappoints. The frame-rate result is sub-par even compared to a stock 7600K, but we should stress that a look at frame-times shows less microstutter, a similar situation to an i7. Tomb Raider really does like threads - and lots of them. Looking at the Crysis 3 test in more detail, the i7 7700K inches to victory over Ryzen, but the nature of the test result is a touch questionable. In detail-intensive, rich scenes, Ryzen pushes ahead. When the visuals are far less complex, the i7 7700K pulls way, way into the lead. Given the choice we would prefer a processor that handles the bottom end better - and in this case, that's Ryzen. However, based on our sample at least, this is an outlier. As things stand, the 7700K looks like the better bet. AMD's response to Ryzen's sub-par 1080p showing is to encourage reviewers and users to test at higher resolutions, where the processor's fortunes are healthier. We weren't so sure that this was a fair test - our initial thought is that this simply brings CPU scores more closely into line by adding the GPU as an artificial limiting factor. Well, that is indeed the case, but this is a new platform with its own strengths and weaknesses, and there's no harm in testing. A full breakdown of Ryzen 7 1800X's performance at stock and with a 4.0GHz overclock, stacked up against Core i7 7700K and Core i7 6900K. 1080p/Titan X OC Ryzen 7 1800X Core i5 7600K Core i7 7700K Core i7 5960X Core i7 6900K Memory Frequency 3200MHz DDR4 3000MHz DDR4 3000MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 119.4 121.4 132.2 124.4 122.1 Ashes of the Singularity, DX12, CPU Test 35.3 29.6 41.9 45.5 46.6 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 137.5 99.4 138.2 140.2 150.8 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 125.3 132.0 133.8 130.1 131.4 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 91.1 117.2 137.9 101.3 105.6 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12, Very High, SMAA 85.8 89.7 126.5 128.0 129.0 The Witcher 3, Ultra, No Hairworks 118.8 97.7 139.4 132.8 134.3 In re-benching at 1440p, we omitted Ashes of the Singularity's CPU test (it does not stress graphics much, and would not show much change) but by and large, you can see why AMD prefers that we use a higher resolution for gaming benchmarks. Even with an overclocked Titan X Pascal in play, frame-rates are depressed, giving more 'breathing room' to the processor. In short, more of the i7's headroom is left on the table, and Ryzen 7 is able to compete more closely. In a 'real world' gaming scenario, it's unlikely that you'll be using a GTX 1080 Ti or a Titan X, so you should see even closer performance on today's GPUs. However, if you're looking for the most 'lastable' CPU - the benchmarks basically work as a smokescreen in masking the actual top-end performance of each chip. That said, AMD told us that games could run faster than Core i7 at 1440p even if beaten at full HD, and we have been able to replicate this. Take a look at the Crysis 3 test - there's a telling shot below. Ryzen 7 1800X is very slightly off pace at 1080p, but takes a five per cent lead at 1440p. How is this possible? Well, as we mentioned, non-complex scenes see the 7700K shoot ahead of Ryzen at 1080p, while the AMD chip commands a valuable advantage at the lower end in much more taxing rendering scenarios. By running at 1440p, the GPU overhead cuts off those sky-high leaps the Intel chip enjoys in simpler areas of the test scene, and those complex areas where Ryzen takes point weigh more heavily into the overall average. The Crysis 3 result is fascinating because the GPU cutting off the i7 7700K's advantage won't just be noticeable at 1440p - it should also manifest with a less capable graphics card at 1080p too. This is a fascinating route forward for further testing with Ryzen, and we've approached AMD for its views on other games that may exhibit this behaviour. But we should be clear that it's not a silver bullet that makes Ryzen 7 the better chip - only Crysis 3 validated AMD's point out of our test titles and we would expect the Core i7 7700K to maintain its leadership in most games. On top of that, we should also consider the 'stock for stock' nature of this testing. We've paired all systems tested here with fast RAM in order maximise CPU-bound performance on stock clocks, but this actually does the Intel K chips a disservice. For years now, all enthusiast-level boards we've come across automatically invoke all-core turbo when you plug-in overclockable memory and activate XMP. For the Core i7 7700K, this takes the processor to 4.5GHz out of the box with no further user tweaks required. On top of that, overclocking Kaby Lake to 4.8GHz is usually a simple matter of typing '48' into the core multiplier box on any Z170 or Z270 board - some samples even reach 5.0GHz. Put simply: there's headroom here. So how does Ryzen compare? In most cases, Intel is simply faster, by varying degrees at all resolutions. However, Crysis 3 here shows that the 7700K dominates in simpler scenes while Ryzen is stronger at the lower-end. This results in Intel winning at 1080p, but Ryzen taking point at 1440p, where the GPU ceiling cuts off the 7700K's advantage in less complex scenarios. Thus far, Crysis 3 is the only title we've seen that exhibits this. 1080p vs 1440p/Titan X OC Ryzen 7 1800X 1080p Core i7 7700K 1080p Ryzen 7 1800X 1440p Core i7 7700K 1440p Memory Frequency 3200MHz DDR4 3000MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 3000MHz DDR4 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 119.4 132.2 87.5 91.2 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 137.5 138.2 115.9 110.4 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 125.3 133.8 96.2 101.0 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 91.1 137.9 91.6 107.1 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12, Very High, SMAA 85.8 126.5 86.1 100.5 The Witcher 3, Ultra, No Hairworks 118.8 139.4 108.1 112.1 It's safe to say that even an overclocked Titan X Pascal running at 1080p will find its limits eventually, but what's surprising is that it happens on so many games. Assassin's Creed Unity and The Division are topped out with the 7700K at 4.8GHz, while the other titles showing diminishing returns. As easy as it is to overclock the i7 7700K, simply plugging 3000MHz DDR4 and engaging XMP will do the vast majority of the work for you, giving an easy 4.5GHz all-core lock, paired with the memory bandwidth required to get the most out of it. Multi-core aware titles like Ashes of the Singularity, Crysis 3 and Rise of the Tomb Raider do see increases though. The Core i7 6900K sees some decent improvement with its 4.4GHz overclock too - single-core dependent titles like Far Cry Primal gain significant momentum, while multi-core games like Ashes of the Singularity and Crysis 3 push on to achieve results at the top of their class. It's not a ringing endorsement bearing in mind the processor's colossal price-point, but we should see similar results from the six-core i7 6800K, which is a fair bit cheaper (unfortunately a six-core sample was not available for testing for this review). Ryzen's stock clocks are pushed far closer to its limits, and there's not as much overclocking headroom. We started to worry about voltage and heat at 4.1GHz (Ryzen was toastier than the 6900K here, even though it had a meatier cooler) so we settled at 4.0GHz across all cores. Frame-rates improve, but not to a gaming-changing degree. Even Far Cry Primal - which craves single thread performance boosts - only sees a seven per cent boost. Overall, where Ryzen is competitive with the i7s, it remains competitive when comparing overclocked results, but you can't OC to significantly overcome performance deficits in titles where the new CPU falls short. While the Ryzen 7 1800X is going to be the top-binned processor in the stack, initial tests suggest that overclocking headroom on the 1700X and even the much cheaper 1700 should be similar to the top-tier product. We'll be reporting back on that shortly, but assuming we get similar results, it may well be the case that you could save a lot of money by investing in a cheaper chip - the caveat being that you should expect significantly higher power consumption and more heat. Regardless of which Ryzen 7 you choose, you will require a decent cooler if you're looking to achieve a good all-core overclock. Overclocking allows Ryzen to remain competitive in titles where it challenges Intel. However, in games like Rise of the Tomb Raider where the 7700K and 6900K take point, their overclocking headroom opens up an even wider gap. 1080p/Titan X OC Ryzen 7 1800X Ryzen 7 1800X 4.0GHz Core i7 7700K Core i7 7700K 4.8GHz Core i7 6900K Core i7 6900K 4.4GHz Memory Frequency 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 3000MHz DDR4 3000MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 119.4 120.8 132.2 132.9 122.1 122.6 Ashes of the Singularity, DX12, CPU Test 35.3 36.8 41.9 44.1 46.6 52.3 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 137.5 143.8 138.2 145.5 150.8 163.5 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 125.3 128.4 133.8 133.9 131.4 133.1 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 91.1 97.2 137.9 140.1 105.6 118.2 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12, Very High, SMAA 85.8 89.9 126.5 131.0 129.0 129.6 The Witcher 3, Ultra, No Hairworks 118.8 121.3 139.4 145.2 134.3 146.2 As the results came in, one had to wonder: at the end of the day, a CPU is a number-cruncher. Ryzen acquits itself beautifully in a vast range of workloads, but falls short to a certain degree in gaming. And yet, running game logic and preparing draw calls is still an exercise in number-crunching, so why do we see this disparity? The eight-core Ryzen processor is essentially two quad-core modules (CCXs) integrated and connected via a fabric that runs at a speed determined by the DDR4 memory. The theory goes that faster memory could see dramatic gains in gaming performance as the two CCXs could communicate faster. However, across our test games, the boost in performance from extra memory bandwidth was ballpark with the Core i7 7700K - which has no such interconnectivity fabric. The Witcher 3 loves memory bandwidth and gets a 20 per cent boost with faster RAM on both systems. Crysis 3 has lower dependency - there's a four per cent boost on the 7700K and seven per cent with the 1800X. This does not seem like much of a smoking gun when two very different CPU architectures hand in very similar results. It points more to the software's dependency on memory bandwidth. More complex is the topic of how Windows allocates CPU threads, and much suspicion has been pointed at Windows' core scheduler (for its part, AMD has ruled this out). Two key pieces of evidence are worthy of investigation. Firstly, AMD itself has recommended that we test with SMT (hyper-threading essentially) on and off, reporting performance gains in some scenarios - this would essentially force Windows to allocate code to physical cores, not the 'hyper-threaded' ones. Secondly, some users suggest that Ryzen runs games faster on Windows 7 x64. Both of these factors could be tested and from there, we should be able to figure out if there is indeed an issue with how work is distributed across cores. There is clear variance between Windows 7 and Windows 10 performance, as well as improvements with SMT on or off - but again, no smoking gun suggesting a common problem with the core scheduler. Again, Far Cry Primal shows up some fascinating results in each permutation, while Crysis 3 on Windows 7 actually seems to run as fast as the 4.0GHz overclock in Windows 10. However, the notion that Microsoft's newer operating system is slower for Ryzen than its older offering is not backed up by our testing - some games are faster, fewer are slower. It's worth pointing out that Windows 7 has no official Ryzen support - and while disabling SMT can produce increases in Ryzen performance, the notion of doing so on a per-game basis is overly onerous for the user. Our advice? Stick with Windows 10, turn off the high precision event timer, engage the high power profile, keep SMT on and consider fast, Ryzen-validated DDR4. Far Cry shows a big gulf in performance with SMT on and off. It also shows a significant performance lead when played on Windows 7, though turning off SMT on both OSes closes the gap. In general, we recommend Windows 10 for Ryzen gaming. 1080p/Titan X OC Ryzen 7 1800X/SMT On Ryzen 7 1800X/SMT Off Ryzen 7 1800X/SMT On Ryzen 7 1800X/SMT Off Ryzen 7 1800X/SMT On Memory Frequency 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 3200MHz DDR4 2133MHz DDR4 Operating System Win7 Win7 Win10 Win10 Win10 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 118.1 123.5 119.4 123.0 112.2 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 143.1 132.9 137.5 123.6 128.6 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 123.8 124.3 125.3 129.8 125.5 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 100.9 107.4 91.1 105.0 79.2 The Witcher 3, Ultra, No Hairworks 109.2 111.4 118.0 115.8 98.9 If there is an issue about how gaming workloads are distributed across cores, the most interesting evidence we uncovered concerned gaming performance results when we used the MSI BIOS to disable one core in each CCX, giving games six cores and 12 threads to work with. This is the '3+3' configuration that's being deployed on the Ryzen 5 1600/1600X, arriving next month. The 1600X actually has access to the same amount of cache memory as the 1800X and runs at the same base and boost frequencies. The results of the BIOS tweak are quite remarkable. Shorn of two cores and four threads, games only lose between three to seven per cent of the performance of the fully enabled eight-core chip. Assuming this is indeed representative of the upcoming Ryzen 5 1600X's turnout (and this can only be confirmed with actual hands-on time with the product itself), AMD may well have a highly compelling couple of mainstream products waiting in the wings that could make you think twice about a prospective Core i5 or indeed a Ryzen 7 purchase - but that's a discussion for another time. In the here and now, Ryzen remains a capable gaming performer, but the fact it's so good at some workloads while falling short in others is a puzzle wrapped in an enigma, and the disparity has yet to be explained - and we did ask. AMD released a couple of statements from Oxide Games (Ashes of the Singularity) and Creative Assembly (Total War) telling us to expect optimisation pushes for Ryzen to get more performance from the new architecture. Obviously this is welcome, but PC owners go into an upgrade expecting a big out-of-the-box improvement, not 'jam tomorrow'. Back catalogue titles likely won't receive this attention, while the immediate future for platform-specific optimisations is uncertain. Longer term, we can pretty sure that Ryzen optimisation will gain traction - we're confident that the architecture will appear in the next console generation. Ryzen 7 1800X - the Digital Foundry verdict AMD clearly gets a lot right with Ryzen. The 1800X absolutely trounces productivity and multimedia workloads, and Intel's much more expensive chips only remain at the races here owing to the ability to hit higher all-core overclocks. We do a lot of video editing and encoding work at Digital Foundry, and everything we've seen so far suggests that Ryzen 7 offers the best route forward when it comes to upgrading our systems. There are other key advantages that cannot be overlooked either: all Ryzen processors are multiplier-unlocked, while memory/processor overclocking isn't restricted to the the top-tier enthusiast motherboards as it is with the competition. There is a Witcher School and I've been It's not for the faint-hearted. Other aspects also deserve praise: Ryzen's eight-core TDPs are lower than Intel's, power consumption under load on our 1800X system was identical at 184W, while idle power consumption was much, much lower than the Intel X99 rivals (motherboard choice may be a factor here, of course). This bodes well for Ryzen's success in enterprise markets and elsewhere: cybercafes, for example. AMD's lower overclocking headroom is unlikely to be a concern for those users. It's also worth stressing that while gaming performance does lag behind Intel by and large, this does not make Ryzen 7 processors 'bad for gaming'. The Witcher 3's Novigrad City is one of the most processor-intensive areas of the game and the 1800X is still delivering a 119fps average. Our results show that the i7s AMD is targeting with Ryzen 7 are potentially longer-lasting for gaming - a key factor in any CPU purchase - but in the here and now, it's abundantly clear that Ryzen still does the job. Clearly PCs are used for more than just gaming, so if play is just one part of your requirement from a processor, Ryzen's undoubted capabilities elsewhere may make it the more logical choice than an i7 - and at these prices, the Ryzen 7 line's excellent overall performance simply cannot be ignored.

That could be happening sooner than you think. Starting next year, ARM processors will get significantly faster thanks to big changes in the company's Cortex-A chip designs. ARM is taking a page from rivals like AMD that have focused on raising the performance threshold in chips. ARM isn't known for superfast chips; it is instead mainly associated with power-efficient chips that give long battery life to devices. That focus has helped the company succeed in mobile devices, an area where Intel's power hungry chips failed. But applications like virtual reality and machine learning need more performance, and ARM is preparing its processors to take on those emerging applications. ARM is adding more cores, instructions, and faster pipelines in smaller spaces to boost performance. The new features are packaged under the term "DynamIQ" and will be in upcoming Cortex chips for mobile, PC, server, and internet-of-things devices. Performance metrics will come when ARM announces the first chip designs with DynamIQ features, which could happen early next year, said John Ronco, vice president of product marketing. DynamIQ adds more performance without compromising ARM's power efficiency focus, Ronco said. Most devices from ARM don't require cooling fans, and that will remain the case with DynamIQ features in chip designs. The improvements increase the possibility of Apple switching over to ARM architecture on its Macs. That hasn't happened yet as Intel's mainstream Core chips are significantly faster than current ARM processors. Like other chipmakers, Apple licenses ARM architecture, which it already uses in iPhones, iPads, and other devices. It's becoming a trend for chipmakers to pile on more performance in chips, especially with the emergence of gaming and virtual reality. Intel is committed to delivering a minimum of 15 percent more performance with every new chip generation, and AMD said its new Ryzen chips delivered 40 percent more instructions per cycle (IPC), an important performance metric. Architectures get modified with market demands of the time, and the chip industry is seeing the emergence of machine learning as a primary workload, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. Though ARM is a RISC design, it is getting new extensions and evolving much like x86, making the two hard to differentiate, McCarron said. ARM previously added vector extensions to its new ARMv8-A SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions) design for high-performance computing. The company has also added extensions for virtualization and other features. The new DynamIQ features will be in the existing ARMv8-A architecture. Cortex designs will be able to pack up to eight cores in a single cluster, compared to four cores in existing designs. The cores will share memory, throughput, and other core components. A chip could have different types of cores, for example, an eight-core chip with four fast CPUs for demanding applications and four slower CPUs for low-power, fast-moving tasks. That is already a part of ARM's "Big.Little" design but is being enhanced with DynamIQ. MediaTek's X30 chip already has 10 CPU cores concentrated in three packages. In theory, DynamIQ will allow Cortex-based chips to pack 16 cores in two clusters, making better use of limited smartphone space. Also in the DynamIQ are new instructions for machine learning, and CPUs will deliver 50 times more artificial intelligence performance in the next three to five years, ARM claimed. At the heart of these improvements are the ability for CPUs to do more low-level and power-efficient processing of machine-learning tasks. All of the calculations can be combined to provide an estimated answer to a question. The improvements include more half-precision floating point operations, which are common in machine-learning-focused chips like Intel's upcoming Knights Mill, and AI GPUs from AMD and Nvidia. A big performance boost will also come from faster pipelines, but there is no fundamental change in the core pipeline design or branch prediction. Radical changes there are more of a long-term project, Ronco said. ARM has older processors like the Cortex-A8, which is more than a decade old and recently used in the BeagleBone Blue robotics developer board. It won't be possible to mix those CPU architectures into the new DynamIQ design.

Product awareness, product interest, product evaluation, product trial and product adoption - the five stages of cloud acceptance have already been negotiated. With Australian organisations now on board and now investing, cloud has moved past the hype and into the mainstream, creating new opportunities for partners as a result. Whether it be public, private or hybrid, implementations will continue to accelerate in 2017 as end-users seek to take advantage of the cloud’s economies of scale to build core applications. But as cloud becomes default, a default cloud channel strategy still ceases to exist. In association with Exclusive Networks, Fortinet, Storagecraft, Veeam, Westcon-Comstor and Zerto, this exclusive ARN roundtable assessed how partners can profit amidst a seemingly lucrative cloud world, outlining the new technologies coming to play, and the strategies required for ongoing success.

Twitter Facebook ARM steps up chip performance to catch up with Intel, AMD Starting next year, new ARM processors will pack in blazing performance thanks to big changes coming to its Cortex-A chip designs Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 21 March, 2017 16:00 - - - - print email Comments Can ARM chips compete neck-and-neck with Intel and AMD on benchmarks? That could be happening sooner than you think. Starting next year, ARM processors will get significantly faster thanks to big changes in the company's Cortex-A chip designs. ARM is taking a page from rivals like AMD that have focused on raising the performance threshold in chips. ARM isn't known for superfast chips; it is instead mainly associated with power-efficient chips that give long battery life to devices. That focus has helped the company succeed in mobile devices, an area where Intel's power hungry chips failed. But applications like virtual reality and machine learning need more performance, and ARM is preparing its processors to take on those emerging applications. ARM is adding more cores, instructions, and faster pipelines in smaller spaces to boost performance. The new features are packaged under the term "DynamIQ" and will be in upcoming Cortex chips for mobile, PC, server, and internet-of-things devices. Performance metrics will come when ARM announces the first chip designs with DynamIQ features, which could happen early next year, said John Ronco, vice president of product marketing. DynamIQ adds more performance without compromising ARM's power efficiency focus, Ronco said. Most devices from ARM don't require cooling fans, and that will remain the case with DynamIQ features in chip designs. The improvements increase the possibility of Apple switching over to ARM architecture on its Macs. That hasn't happened yet as Intel's mainstream Core chips are significantly faster than current ARM processors.

The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel's more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. "In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more," said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. "Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye." She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion's annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister's Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel's only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is "ripe for change." He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. "What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in," he said. Israel has long billed itself as "Startup Nation" for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. "This is far from a one-day or one-week story," Granoff said. "This is going to be a story for the next 10 years." Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google's more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. "The deal confirms Israel's global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies," said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. "The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups." There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel's autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. "This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak," he said. × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Freedman | March 18, 2017 06:00 am MORE When you shop for a new laptop, you have to answer many questions, such as "What brand?" "What screen size?" "What’s my budget?" But one of the more difficult questions to answer is: Which processor do I need? Unless you're buying a budget laptop, you're probably deciding between a laptop with an Intel Core i5 CPU and one with a more expensive, but faster Core i7 processor. In order to help you decide between the two CPUs, we tested two otherwise identical Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1s (1080p / 8GB / 1TB HDD), one with a Core i5-7200U CPU and the other with a Core i7-7500U processor. Both CPUs are dual-core members of the latest Intel 7th Generation processor platform, also known as "Kaby Lake," and both are part of the U series, which is most common in mainstream laptops. One note before we continue: We’re focusing our comparison on the U-series of Kaby Lake CPUs, which you’ll find in most mainstream laptops. Mobile gaming rigs and workstations use quad-core HQ series chips, while some superthin 2-in-1s use low-power Y series chips. The Differences and Price Delta There’s not a ton of difference between the U-series Core i5 and Core i7. While bumping up from the Core i3 to the i5 gets you Turbo Boost (the ability to increase clock speed for key tasks), there are no architectural differences between i5 and i7. The base clock speeds on the i7 are faster than the i5 (meaning it’s faster), and you can bump up to a higher clock speed on the i7 with Turbo Boost than the i5. So it’s basically a naming convention, putting the i5 in the mainstream tier and the i7 in the enthusiast tier. The price delta between Core i5 and Core i7 is usually significant. At the time we purchased our two test beds, the Core i5 model cost $629 and the Core i7 equivalent was $849, a full $220 more. When configuring a ThinkPad X270 to order on Lenovo.com, the cost to upgrade from the i5-7200U to the i7-7500U is $160 at publication time. HP.com charges $110 more to build a Spectre x360 with Core i7 than Core i5. Overall Performance On Geekbench 4, a synthetic benchmark that measures overall performance, the Core i5 configuration of the Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 earned a score of 6,712, while the Core i7 model’s score was 7,515. That's an 11.9 percent improvement.   Video Transcoding We don’t usually run Handbrake, a video-transcoding tool, in our lab, but we pulled it out to simulate fairly heavy processing. For this test, we had both laptops use the software to convert a 4K .mov file to a 1080p .mp4 file. It’s a taxing process, and it took both laptops a fair amount of time to do it. The Core i5 laptop completed the task in 31 minutes and 27 seconds, while the Core i7 notebook took 30 minutes and 17 seconds. The Core i7 was faster here, but just by 1 minute and 10 seconds, an improvement of just 3.8 percent. Battery Life The difference in power consumption between a Core i5 and a Core i7 is fairly small. The Inspiron with the Core i5 CPU lasted 5 hours and 48 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi, while the one with a Core i7 endured for 5:22. It’s a small difference of just 26 minutes in favor of the Core i5 CPU, which makes sense. The two were basically interchangeable regarding battery life; you won’t get any major changes unless you push the i7 to its limits and run it at higher clock speeds.   OpenOffice Spreadsheet Macro In our spreadsheet test, laptops pair 20,000 names and addresses in OpenOffice. The machine with an i5 CPU took 4 minutes and 4 seconds, while the i7 laptop took 3 minutes and 43 seconds. That’s a difference of only 21 seconds, or 9.4 percent.   MORE: Best Laptops - Windows Laptops, Chromebooks and Macs Dirt 3 and 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited Finally, we put the laptops through some gaming and overall graphics tests. Perhaps because both processors have the same Intel HD 620 graphics, the differences were really small. In either case, you'd need a discrete GPU from Nvidia or AMD to be able to play serious games. On Dirt 3, the Inspiron with the i5 CPU ran at 20.4 fps, while the one with the i7 CPU ran at 21.3 fps. Both numbers are well below the 30 fps playability threshold and it’s unlikely you would be able to tell the difference. When we ran 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited, a synthetic graphics benchmark, the Core i5 configuration notched a score of 61,630, while the i7 model scored 62,481. That's a barely-there difference of just 1.3 percent. Which One to Get? While the Core i7-7500U-powered laptop showed stronger performance on just about every test, it wasn’t all that much better than what the Core i5-7200U model had to offer. A minute of extra processing here, a few more frames there, but almost nothing all that noticeable. If you’re a serious gamer or video editor, you'll see larger laptops with quad-core Core i5 or Core i7 CPUs that are part of the HQ or HK series (example: Core i7-7700HQ).In those series, the i7 chips can run eight threads, while the Core i5 models run only four, which might provide a bigger delta in performance than we saw between the U series chips. For the average person, who will be jumping between web browsing, streaming some videos and working on Word documents, it would be wasteful to pay for the extra performance of a Core i7. Even if you’ll occasionally do some light photo or video editing, it will be only a tiny bit slower with a Core i5. Rather than paying $100 or $200 more for a Core i7 on your laptop, you'd be better off spending your money on moving from a hard drive to an SSD, getting a larger SSD or making sure you have at least a 1080p screen. If you want to play games or do content creation, you may want to spring for a discrete GPU.

Freedman, on Add a comment Email Name Comment Firstname 2 comments Joe Bean Says: March 20th, 2017 at 9:28 am Good article. I never buy a mobile i7 unless it is an hyperthreading quad core and I need the performance (not many users really do on a laptop). It is just not worth it. Intel abuses the brand they have for desktop where i7 is clearly superior to sell more expensive laptops that don't make a real world difference. They shouldn't even call an dual-core an i7. It is misleading. It is a joke. William Says: March 19th, 2017 at 12:37 pm Sorry to disagree, but the i7 does run a lot better crunching numbers and on handbrake. Now, unless each computer has a different video chip, the i7 is always going to outbeat the i5.

The automotive semiconductor market is worth $24 billion, according to consulting firm McKinsey, and by 2025 more than $7 billion worth of semiconductors will be used in partially or fully autonomous cars, according to analysts at J.P. Morgan. The world’s largest semiconductor company clearly wants to dominate the market for technology used in autonomous cars. Intel recently agreed to pay $15.3 billion to acquire Israel’s Mobileye, which makes cameras and sensors for self-driving cars. That’s 36-times Mobileye’s annualized revenue, and more than double the amount analysts are predicting the entire market for chips used in autonomous cars will be worth eight years from now. Mobileye is already doing business with 27 automakers, according to Recode, and Intel apparently sees immense value in those relationships. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has said he believes automakers will outsource their self-driving vehicle technologies. The Mobileye purchase gives Intel a better shot at becoming a dominant supplier of automotive modules and the chips inside them. Meanwhile, chipmakers that focus primarily on the wireless market have been busy making their own deals with the auto industry. Qualcomm recently inked a deal with PSA Group, whose brands include Peugeot, Citroën and DS. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon automotive processor will be integrated into PSA Group’s next generation of vehicles. Qualcomm says its Snapdragon 820A processor can support in-vehicle music and video streaming, 3-D navigation and multiple high-resolution displays. Sierra Wireless recently announced its LTE technology will connect Volkswagen vehicles starting next year. The company said its AirPrime modules and Legato platform will provide cellular connectivity for Volkswagen’s Car-Net platform, which is used for vehicle access, roadside assistance, diagnostics and maintenance. The world’s fastest car, which is being made by a British company called Bloodhound, will also use Sierra Wireless’s AirPrime LTE embedded modules, as well as the company’s AirLink gateways, management services and technical support.

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) is not the least bit satisfied with Director Comey’s appearance before the House Intelligence Committee. x My takeaways: Donald Trump is a liar & the FBI Director still has no credibility. He needs to also explain HIS interference in the election.Ã¢ÂÂ Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) March 21, 2017 Waters released a scorching statement demanding answers from Director Comey about why he chose to release a letter about Hillary Clinton’s email, that contained ZERO new information about her email and did not utter one word about the FBI’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. It’s a fair question and the American people deserve answers. In her statement below, she also blasted the conduct of House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes and Republicans in the hearing yesterday, saying they demonstrated they "cannot be trusted to investigate.” Read every word: I think the American people now understand one reason why I believe FBI Director Comey has no credibility and why I’ve said that we need an independent commission to uncover the truth. Today, in publicly confirming the FBI is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and the Kremlin’s possible coordination with individuals associated with the Trump campaign, Director Comey also disclosed that the investigation has been ongoing since July 2016. Director Comey needs to answer one question: If he had information about the extent of Russia’s efforts to hack Donald Trump’s political opponents last July, why would he effectively advance their efforts by releasing a letter confirming a review of “newly uncovered” Clinton emails from an unrelated investigation in October that turned out to reveal no new information? Why did special circumstances in that instance warrant the FBI Director publicly commenting on Clinton emails but not the fact that Russia was waging an attack on our democracy, possibly in coordination with individuals associated with the Trump campaign? I believe that Director Comey bears some responsibility, along with the Russians, in adding to the confusion and misinformation campaign that led to the election of Donald Trump. Now, Director Comey presides over an FBI under a Department of Justice headed by an Attorney General who lied under oath, and both serve under a President who has shown he will stop at nothing to obstruct and distract from any credible investigations of his campaign’s ties to Russia. Even more troubling, based on the House Intels Republicans’ exclusive focus during today’s hearings on the leaks and not the Russian cyberattacks, it is clear to me that the House Intelligence Committee under the leadership of Chairman Nunes cannot be trusted to thoroughly investigate this matter. In fact, the Republicans’ questioning was more in line with President Trump’s incendiary tweets than the actual intelligence the members received from the public servants charged with ensuring our national security. Republicans must remember that Russia is not our ally and they better believe that the Russians and Putin would order a cyberattack on Republicans if it suited their geopolitical goals. Given the political motivations driving the White House and Republicans in Congress, we need a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the Russian interference in our election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.  Bravo, Maxine Waters! Keep persisting. The American people deserve the truth. The whole truth and nothing but the truth.  191 Comments Share this article 403 403 403 191 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Official: Intel Has Closed its Offices in Pakistan ProPK Staff 3 days ago Intel Corporation has shut down its offices in Pakistan recently as part of its global business strategy to focus on lucrative markets while cutting costs from different countries, sources have confirmed with ProPakistani. The shift in strategy includes focusing on the business of Cloud Computing more than hardware solutions, said one of the business partners. The same strategy has been reportedly adopted in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as well. The head office in Karachi has been closed down recently along with other representative offices in different cities. Besides, the majority of the staff members were laid off except selected employees who have been shifted to offices based in different regional countries like Malaysia and Singapore. Among the prominent faces include Naveed Siraj, its former country manager. He quit the company to join Dell EMC as its country manager for Pakistan and Afghanistan. The company’s marketing manager Asma Aziz was shifted to Singapore office recently. According to the industry people, Intel Corporation, the largest processor maker of the world, has retained its operations in Pakistan through channel business partners and different vendors; however its operations are being directed from its regional office based in Malaysia. The American multinational corporation has maintained a significant share in the business of desktop computers and laptops, said a vendor. The exit of the world’s largest semiconductor chip maker comes at a time when the economy of Pakistan is moving towards stability and sustainable growth, opening lucrative venues of opportunities— and it’s certainly not a good sign. But the good news is its foundation is still working in Pakistan for different projects related to Intel International Science and Emerging Fair. Hence, Pakistan students will have a participatory platform to display their talent in the field of science and technology. It is pertinent to mention here that Pakistani students of different cities won accolades multiple times at such fairs through the foundation of Intel Corporation in the past.

We spent the last month playing Battlefield 1, FIFA 17, Forza MotorSport 6: APEX and other games to see what this budget gaming notebook can do. While you can easily spend over $1,000 on the latest and greatest gaming notebooks from Alienware and Razer, Dell offers a middle ground that allows you to step into gaming with a nice looking well-built computer that won’t break your budget. The two biggest catches, are that you will need to run most games with medium settings and you to live with the lackluster display. Plugging in a monitor at your battle station can help alleviate the display, but you will need to live with graphics at the medium setting with this notebook. Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Review Summary Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Pros Beautiful design. Great gaming performance for the price. Impressive battery life. Budget friendly price. Cons Dull colors on display. Runs warm and fan is loud. The Dell Inspiron 15 7567 is an impressive budget gaming notebook that delivers a lot of value for the price and does it with an eye-catching design. Buy the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 $799 and Up at Dell The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 delivers the best value in gaming notebooks with long battery life and the ability to play the latest games in a sleek and sexy package. When it comes to budget gaming notebooks, you need look no further than the Dell Inspiron 15 7000. We reviewed the $849 Inspiron 15 7000 with a 256GB SSD, but if you want to get the most value, you should look into the $949 version with a 1TB 7200RPM hard drive unless you are willing to keep your installed game library to a minimum. Design The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 looks the part of a gaming notebook. The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 design is eye-catching with a bright red soft touch lid that definitely calls attention to this notebook. The look and feel is that of a more expensive notebook, which is a very nice touch considering that this is still a semi-portable machine. Red and black grilles on the front and back edge accentuate the style, and bright red edges round out the look. Inside is a spartan black interior with a matte finish. Dell doesn’t bring the soft touch onto the palm rest, but it is still comfortable for longer periods of use. There are plenty of connectivity options. You’ll find a whole host of connectivity options including three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, a headphone jack, Gigabit Ethernet and an SD card reader. The power brick is rather large, but it includes a long cord so you can plug in even when you can’t work right next to an outlet. Dell includes a 720P webcam that delivers a decent image, but isn’t special. This notebook weighs in at 5.8 pounds, which is hefty, but still light enough that you can bring it with you. You’ll need a larger backpack though as this notebook is 15.2 x 10.8 x 1 inches. Display The Inspiron 15 7000 display is the only weak point. The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 display doesn’t do the colors justice, which is a tradeoff for the price.  The 15.6-inch 1,920 x 1,080 display includes an anti-glare coating that helps you play in harsh lighting conditions. The panel and potentially this anti-glare coating wash out the colors on the built-in display. Your games still look sharp and there is plenty of detail to be seen, but the colors simply don’t pop, leaving your environments looking muted. The display isn’t the brightest but combined with the coating it is bright enough to use in most settings. If you are settling in for extended gaming sessions at home, you will likely want to look for a brighter display, but this one will get the job done when you are mobile. Gaming Performance The Inspiron 15 7000 is a capable gaming notebook. Dell packs in a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti with 4GB GDDR5 RAM to provide gaming prowess under $1,000. With this setup you can play the latest games on medium settings without any issues. You’ll be able to pull of the FPS needed to remain competitive in online gaming and the game still looks very nice. If you push the graphics settings up higher you will definitely see it with visual issues and dropped frames. Don’t buy this with hopes of using the HTC Vive, but you can, in theory use it with the Oculus Rift with games on a medium setting. The SteamVR Performance Test reports a 3.8, which is usable, but it is on the lower end. With games on a medium setting, it is tough to find a game that this budget gaming notebook cannot handle, and it delivers impressive performance for the price. When you are watching videos or performing less intense tasks, the notebook switches over to the Intel integrated GPU that will deliver better battery life. Intel’s Kaby Lake processors are inside these machines and they deliver more than enough power to handle your day to day activities including streaming videos and working on a spreadsheet or surfing through a number of open tabs. After a long gaming session the bottom of the notebook is warm, but it wasn’t too hot to use on my lap when a desk wasn’t available. Keyboard & TouchPad The keyboard and touchpad are good, but You’ll want to invest in peripherals for gaming at home. The Keyboard and touchpad are good on the Inspiron 15 7000 gaming notebook. It is an island style keyboard with decent travel and spacing. I can type quickly and nearly match my output on the 2016 MacBook Pro. There is a small amount of give in the center of the keyboard that is disappointing but not an overall deal breaker. Dell includes a number pad that allows for easy access to numbers while working on spreadsheets and for the option to set up shortcuts and macros that come in handy while gaming. The touchpad is responsive and accurately handles gestures. It is very usable for day-to-day tasks, but I wouldn’t try to game with it. Audio Dell includes two front-facing speakers that fire out of the front edge and a bottom subwoofer. The speakers sound good for music and movies and you can play games using the built-in speakers. One catch to gaming is that this budget gaming notebook is loud when you are playing a taxing game. You will want a good headset to play games unless you want to hear a fan mixed in with your gaming audio. Battery Life The Inspiron 15 7000 battery life is amazing. One major surprise is the Inspiron 15 7000 battery life. This notebook can easily last all day when you are working in a web browser or similar apps. The 74 Whr battery is capable of 10 to 11 hours of use in a web browser. Gaming will cut the battery life down significantly, but you can still get in a decent session on battery power.

View All Posts Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) — This designer and manufacturer of digital technology platforms was last reviewed by me on Nov. 16 when I recommended it as a buy “under $35” with a trading target at $40. Despite several successful trades during the year, the highest price since the last review occurred on Jan. 27 at $38.45, where it “double-topped” with the Oct. 5 high at $38.31. However, with the offer to purchase Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) at $63.54 per share and INTC’s decline to the mid-$30s, INTC’s high number of stock holders makes it attractive for another review. Despite “periods of lumpiness,” higher cloud investments, growth within “the Internet of Things” and increased demand for more powerful memory chips should benefit Intel. The company’s recent agreement to purchase MBLY, a leader in the research and development of advanced driver assistance systems, should help Intel cut prices while offering superior autonomous driving platforms. Standard & Poor’s anticipates that Intel’s cash flow will accelerate, which will enable it to raise its dividend and repurchase shares. The target for INTC is $41 and is based on a multiple of 13.9X 2018 EPS estimate of $2.94, up from EPS of $2.80 est. for 2017. INTC’s current dividend is $1.04, providing an annualized dividend yield of 2.95%. For the last year, INTC’s stock has advanced along a bullish support line. In November 2016 that line began to run coincident with the stock’s 200-day moving average. As noted above, the stock “double-topped” at about $38 in January and fell below the support line last week. However, on Wednesday it reversed up, with a CBR buy signal from my internal proprietary indicator. However, in order to confirm the reversal, it must regain the 200-day moving average now at $35.41. Thus, buy INTC at about $35 with a trading target of $41. A stop-loss order should be placed under the “CBR Buy” at $34.60. Click to Enlarge Tell us what you think about this article!

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / 32GB Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR4-3000MHz 32GB Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR4-3000MHz Leo Waldock 2 days ago Component, Featured Tech Reviews, Memory, Reviews Rating: 8.5. Corsair has jumped on the RGB band wagon with its new Vengeance RGB memory. The 32GB kit we were sent consists of 4x8GB modules and is rated at DDR4-3000MHz which is a perfectly decent speed. The reviewer’s guide also puts the CAS 15 timing front and centre, a point we shall return to later. At launch there are 16GB and 32GB kits on offer with 64GB and 128GB kits in the pipeline, although you’ll need a suitable 8-DIMM motherboard for the Big Daddy kit. Corsair currently supports Intel X99, 100 and 200 series chipset motherboards with AMD Ryzen on the ‘to do’ list. This is slightly disappointing as we rather hoped that AMD’s support of DDR4 would help draw it into the mainstream. Anyway, it’s early days for Ryzen so there is little point in getting upset on behalf of those particular enthusiasts. Watch via our VIMEO Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 2160p HERE. Now you’ve seen the video, here’s a selection of shots of the memory so you can see the various colour options in detail for yourself.                                  Specification of Corsair Vengeance RGB LED RGB Control type SMBus Software Corsair Link v4.6 or later Heat spreaders Aluminium Speed 2666MHz+ Module density 8GB and 16GB Configurations 2x8GB, 4x8GB, 8x8GB, 2x16GB, 4x16GB, 8x16GB Target platform Intel X99, 100 and 200. AMD Ryzen support coming Test system CPU Intel Core i7-6700K 4.0GHz/4.2GHz CPU cooler NZXT Kraken x42 Memory 16GB GeIL Evo X DDR4-3000MHz Motherboard Asus ROG Strix Z270F Gaming BIOS 0801 Graphics card GeForce GTX 980 4GB SSD 240GB SanDisk Extreme II PSU Sea Sonic Prime Titanium 750W OS Windows 10 Pro Installing the memory in our test system was entirely straightforward as Vengeance RGB works exactly like regular DDR4 memory. The lighting control is handled by the SMBus without any external cables (unlike GeIL Evo X) so all you need is the correct software. G.Skill uses a utility that looks very similar to AURA control software for its new TridentZ but Corsair has instead decided to extend its own Link software. We fired up the current version 4.5.0.55 and saw our chosen Corsair H100i liquid cooler was present and correct however the Vengeance RGB was not detected. We followed Corsair’s instructions about updating the Intel ME driver to v11.6.0.1036 and then installed a Beta version of Link 4.6.0.86 and bingo, job done, we now had full control of the RGB RAM. The fact is you don’t have a massive number of options however the four modes on offer are all quite usable and interesting. These are: Static, Colour Pulse, Colour Shift and Rainbow. As you will see in our video Colour Pulse and Colour Shift allow you to choose up to seven colours and the systems cycles through them, one after the other. Rainbow mode is self-explanatory. The only other decision is whether you control the modules individually or group them together and treat all four DIMMs as a single unit. This meant we effectively had three controlled lighting zones in our PC as well as the steady green light on the side of the reference GTX 980 graphics card. We had the fixed light on the H100i liquid cooler, the Aura lighting on the Asus VRM cooler and I/O panel and as the main event the Vengeance RGB RAM. It worked perfectly well but wasn’t synchronised to Aura which was disappointing for us. And irrelevant if you don’t have an Aura (or similar) system in your motherboard or case. Balanced against that, if you use Corsair Node to control LED strips or illuminated fans the new Vengeance RGB memory will expand your Link ecosystem. When we first ran the test system we found the Asus motherboard set the memory to 3000MHz on Auto settings with timings of 17:18:18:36 which wasn’t what we hoped to see. Enabling XMP tightened the timing to 15:17:17:35 which was right on the money. The curious thing is that the XMP timings performed ever so slightly worse than Auto.      We like the way that Corsair has constructed Vengeance RGB as the lighting unit hasn’t made the module overly tall. Corsair Vengeance LPX is very low profile at 37mm and the new Vengeance RGB stands at 51mm which is only slightly taller than G.Skill TridentZ at 47mm. By contrast GeIL Evo X is a giant at 63mm. Furthermore we like the way Corsair has covered the LEDs with a diffuser that softens the light. You cannot see the individual LEDs but instead just get to enjoy the effect of the lighting, which is exactly what Corsair intended. Closing Thoughts Corsair Vengeance RGB looks great and works well. In a world where DDR4 memory is the mainstream and clock speeds north of 3000MHz are common we are very pleased to see Corsair making the move to RGB lighting. It would help matters if the brightness of the LEDs could be controlled. Better yet if the lighting could be integrated with Asus/ASRock Aura, RGB Fusion and MSI Mystic Light Sync, however we do not expect this to happen. Clearly the way Corsair Vengeance RGB works with Corsair Link means it naturally lends itself to those enthusiasts who have already bought into Link-controlled hardware. Indeed we see a clear divide with Aura/Fusion/Mystic Light on one side and Corsair Link on the other. If you want a simple life you can leave the RAM cycling through the default Rainbow pattern. In terms of performance the Vengeance RGB works well and is competitive with other DDR4-3000MHz memory. On the downside the price is fairly steep, which is a gloomy way to end a review. Let’s be more positive; you get better value for money if you choose the 32GB kit rather than the smaller 16GB kit. Right now, pricing is available on the Corsair site in dollars – we’re expecting UK pricing any time soon! Discuss on our Facebook page, over HERE. UPDATE 22nd March: While writing this review we asked Corsair about software compatibility. They told us Link is entirely independent of other solutions from Asus, ASRock, Gigabyte and MSI – they now tell us that Gigabyte and MSI software IS compatible with Vengeance RGB however we have not tested this for ourselves.’ Pros: The RGB lighting looks excellent Excellent integration with Corsair Link Reasonably low profile modules help your PC build The four lighting effects work well Cons: High price AMD Ryzen is not currently supported No brightness control No integration with other lighting systems KitGuru says: Corsair’s entry to the RGB memory market is welcome – say hello to Corsair Vengeance RGB.

Keep me logged in I forgot my password No Thanks technology Ajay Agrawal, founder of the Creative Destruction Lab. Michelle Siu/The Globe and Mail Billion-dollar breakout Has this man discovered the formula for creating high-tech superstars? Sean Silcoff goes inside a bold experiment at the University of Toronto to find out Sean Silcoff TORONTO The Globe and Mail Last updated: Saturday, Mar. 18, 2017 11:39AM EDT Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Comments Cian O’Sullivan is the picture of confidence as he speaks to a packed lecture hall at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. A tall, lantern-jawed man, Mr. O’Sullivan begins his presentation with a slick video explaining the genius idea developed by Beagle Inc., his Kitchener, Ont.-based startup. Using artificial intelligence (AI), Beagle’s software reviews dense contracts and other legal documents and roots out critical information in minutes. Most of the 30 million small- and medium-sized businesses in North America don’t use lawyers for commercial deals; Beagle’s product saves them hours of aggravation. The founder throws out some impressive numbers and names. Already, it has 750 customers and prospective investors have shown “an immense amount of interest,” he tells the Rotman crowd. So have Volkswagen AG and Thomson Reuters Corp.; Mr. O’Sullivan is spending 20 per cent of his time working on these new giant customer leads. Everything seems to be going Mr. O’Sullivan’s way on this mid-April, 2016, day – that is, until the audience starts barking questions. John Harris, a retired steel magnate, asks why Beagle only charges $83 per month. If it works, that’s too low, he says. Barney Pell, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor who once led U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s AI branch, says Mr. O’Sullivan should raise much more than the $400,000 (U.S.) he’s seeking or investors won’t take him seriously. “Right now you’re in no-man’s land,” Mr. Pell says. Mike Serbinis, one of Canada’s most successful tech entrepreneurs, says Beagle must decide if it’s going after small or large customers, but not both. Others agree: Beagle has a focus problem. “I just want to know what kind of business this is,” says Shivon Zilis, a partner with San Francisco venture-capital firm Bloomberg Beta. Watching the scene unfold is the man who designed this interrogation chamber for entrepreneurs: Ajay Agrawal, one of Canada’s foremost business academics and founder of Creative Destruction Lab (CDL), a ground-breaking program for startups housed at Rotman. CDL has accomplished what few incubators of technology startups in Canada have managed to do, already making a major impact on a teeming startup ecosystem. Now in its fifth year, it has developed a promising method for helping early stage companies- many of them using AI and other leading-edge technology – to grow, flourish and attract private capital. Mr. Agrawal’s aspirations go far beyond that, however. He also hopes that what the CDL team has created can point the way to a solution for a problem that has vexed our economy for decades: our sputtering ecosystem for innovation. Canada is blessed with excellent research universities and a strong pool of engineering and technical talent. Where we often stumble is in the process of turning bright ideas into cash, and spinning out technology businesses that can grow to become global players. Since Nortel Networks Corp. went bankrupt and BlackBerry Ltd. flamed out, there has been a shortage of truly large anchor companies in the Canadian tech sector. That will have to change if Canada is going to have an economy built on the jobs of the future. With the federal government set to unveil what has been described as an “innovation budget” next week, perhaps CDL’s most impressive accomplishment is that it isn’t part of a grand public-sector innovation strategy, nor based on a recommendation from one of the many past reports on improving Canada’s spotty record for commercializing technology. Rather, CDL has acted like a startup itself, driven by ingenuity and purpose and managed by a skeleton staff on a shoestring budget mostly financed by the private sector and individuals . At the time of Mr. O’Sullivan’s presentation last spring, Beagle was one of 13 AI firms left in CDL’s machine-learning program, down from 25 that started the previous fall. All were trying to build new businesses around algorithms that can learn on their own, rather than just perform tasks programmed by humans. To stay in the program, Mr. O’Sullivan and the other fledgling entrepreneurs had to convince at least one of the “mentors” – accomplished businesspeople who act as advisers, objective setters and judges – that it’s worth devoting four hours out of their busy schedules to Beagle over the next eight weeks. If none are willing, participants are booted out of the program. “When they come here most [CDL companies] are science projects,” Mr. Agrawal says following the session. “By the time we get to this meeting” – the fourth day-long session out of five over the course of nine months – “they are ready to raise a seed round of capital.” That explains why the 60-odd observers in the room include several San Francisco-area venture capitalists. Their presence “is an important indicator” of CDL’s success, said founding partner Dan Debow. “It tells you they’re not coming to do you a favour, they’re coming to do themselves a favour.” Some liken CDL to a cross between Survivor and Dragon’s Den because most firms that start get cut. That comparison irks the cerebral and serious Mr. Agrawal. Dragon’s Den “rewards the ability to pitch,” Mr. Agrawal said. “CDL rewards an ability to perform … our ratings are the success of these companies.” If so, CDL is a huge hit. Mr. Agrawal’s initial goal was to see CDL alumni create a combined $50-million in equity value after five years. That’s how he sold the program to early benefactors, including Mr. Debow and Mr. Harris, tech entrepreneurs Michael and Richard Hyatt and ex-Research In Motion Ltd. chief financial officer Dennis Kavelman, who each donated $300,000 to get CDL started. CDL has already surpassed that goal – 20 times over. Leading the way is Thalmic Labs Inc. of Waterloo, Ont., a maker of wearable technology that was one of the first companies to go through the lab in 2012-13. Thalmic raised $120-million (U.S.) last year from Intel Capital, Amazon’s Alexa Fund and others. Much of Thalmic’s early guidance and funding came from CDL mentors. Even without Thalmic, CDL would be a success: Other CDL graduate firms are valued at about $500-million combined and sell such eclectic innovations as anti-frost coatings, low-energy display lights and speech-analysis software that detects the onset of dementia. It’s still too early to know if any will break out and emerge into significant enterprises; startups typically need seven to 10 years to reach that point. Now, like a startup entrepreneur, Mr. Agrawal wants CDL to build on its early success and expand into something significant. This year, the program welcomed 100 companies – half of them focused on machine-learning. It expanded to the University of British Columbia, where “Creative Destruction Lab West” boasts early Yahoo president Jeff Mallett as a mentor. It has fielded interest from Dalhousie University in Halifax, the University of Calgary’s Haskayne School of Business and New York University to host similar offshoots. Companies have flown in from France, Israel, Boston, New York and even Silicon Valley to participate. But there’s no time to waste: Canada’s early lead in the now hot area of machine learning, a type of AI, has eroded somewhat as U.S. giants swooped to snap up leading Canadian scientists and startups. Google, Microsoft and their ilk have set themselves up to be big beneficiaries of Canada’s AI talent pool. Mr. Agrawal says now is the time to act on another field where Canada has built an early lead before the industry giants clean up: quantum computing. It’s an emerging field based on a still developing technology that harnesses the power of subatomic particles. Quantum computers are expected to one day be significantly faster than the most sophisticated machines on the planet, enabling researchers to solve complex problems beyond current capabilities. If things break as Mr. Agrawal hopes, Canada could hold that lead. To help, he’s set this spring to announce a CDL stream exclusively centred on companies developing quantum computing-based AI companies. “Our mission is that by 2020 the quantum-machine-learning initiative will have produced more, well-capitalized, revenue-generating quantum machine learning software companies than the rest of the world combined, and majority will be based in Canada,” Mr. Agrawal says. “We have a model that works for building companies, but we are still in catchup mode.” Ajay Agrawal at a Creative Destruction Lab session. Handout Doubling down on global leaders The idea for Creative Destruction Lab came to Mr. Agrawal during a dinner in Toronto about five years ago. The topic that evening was what Canada could do to improve its woeful record for harnessing Canadian ingenuity to stimulate economic growth. This was familiar ground for Mr. Agrawal, now 47, an expert on innovation economics and one of Rotman’s most popular professors; he’d attended an “endless number” of government-sponsored panels, round tables and meetings on the subject during his career, and many of the usual suspects were in attendance, including CEOs of some of Canada’s largest companies. But something bothered him that night. Everyone at the table “was very deferential” to the CEOs “who were talking about how important innovation was,” he said. “But they hadn’t really done anything that’s innovative.” Rather, it was the scientists in attendance who were the true innovators, including regenerative medicine expert Molly Shoichet, quantum computing and robotics visionary Geordie Rose, and Steve Mann, a pioneer in wearable computers. “I thought to myself, ‘In this room … everyone is focused on the bank CEOs, but as soon as we go global, they’re not really that relevant – and the other people here are.’ A light went off and I realized, ‘OK, we need to double down on the people who are global leaders and they’re not the ones everyone else in the country is focused on.’” That lightbulb moment had been 20 years in the making. Over the course of his academic research Mr. Agrawal, who studied engineering before earning his PhD in strategy and economics at UBC had focused on why most universities struggle to help their research scientists achieve commercial success from their inventions. That was a particularly acute problem in Canada. This country’s 36 leading research universities earned a combined $62-million (Cdn) in licensing income from campus inventions in 2015, according to the Association of University Technology Managers, a paltry fraction of the billions of dollars in on-campus research expenditures annually. By comparison, U.S. commercialization powerhouses Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology alone last year brought in $94.2-million (U.S.) and $62-million in licensing income, respectively. It wasn’t that Canadian scientists were less inventive than their U.S. counterparts; in a 2008 paper, Mr. Agrawal found U of T scientists disclosed as many inventions per capita as those at MIT. However, the “technology transfer” system whereby Canada’s top research university helped campus inventors commercialize their research breakthroughs was less efficient than MIT’s as there were fewer patent applications, issued patents and licensing income, he wrote. When Mr. Agrawal broadened the study to 160 Canadian and U.S. universities, he found a similar gap between the two countries. “In Canada we have a lot of important technical breakthroughs,” Mr. Agrawal said. “But we have comparatively very little capital flowing in to commercialize those. That begs the question, ‘Why?’” He rejected conventional wisdom that Silicon Valley had better ideas, smarter people and more money. The main reason for the gap, he believed from his years of research, was what he described as a lack of good judgment in Canada – judgment that was essential to help scientists turn into successful entrepreneurs. That key ingredient was in abundance in Silicon Valley’s established technology commercialization ecosystem. Mr. Agrawal cited a compelling example to make his point. A 1997 e-mail in Stanford’s archives shows a campus graduate student working through a potential deal to license technology he has developed to early Internet company Excite. The student writes to Stanford’s technology transfer office that he is willing to sign over rights for Excite to use his technology in exchange for a salary. He figures his time is worth $100,000 a year.But his e-mail also reveals someone named “Vinod” has advised him to instead buy a company that would own the technology. The “punchline,” Mr. Agrawal said, is that the technology in question was Google’s search algorithm. The student was Larry Page, who co-founded Google a year later. “Vinod” was venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, whose early backing helped to turn Google (now Alphabet Inc.) into the world’s second most valuable public company. “The most remarkable thing about [Mr. Page’s] e-mail is how unremarkable it is,” Mr. Agrawal said. “There’s not an ounce of genius there. That could have been from a computer science student [anywhere in Canada]. In my view, the only reason this turned into a company the way it did is because of the judgment from people like Vinod.” Canadian venture capitalist Haig Farris, centre, provides feedback at a Creative Destruction Lab session. Handout The market for judgment Mr. Agrawal started to develop an idea he called the “market for judgment.” He wanted to bring together some of the sharpest and shrewdest investors to advise cutting-edge Canadian research scientists and help them build companies around their technology breakthroughs, providing them with the kind of business guidance Mr. Khosla had shared with Google’s co-founder. “The problem is if you are a person who needs judgment – like a PhD in computer science who’s come up with a new way to organize the world’s information online. You can’t go down to Bay Street and buy five units of judgment. It’s not for sale. And therein lies the problem. [Creating that market] became the essence of the Creative Destruction Lab.” The academic began developing the idea with a small group that included his former UBC entrepreneurship professor and pioneering Canadian venture capitalist Haig Farris, the late Osler, Harcourt & Hoskin LLP technology lawyer Geoff Taber, and Dan Debow, a successful Toronto tech entrepreneur and Rotman alumnus that Mr. Agrawal had met through Next 36, a program the professor had helped create to expose bright Canadian undergraduate students to entrepreneurs. Mr. Debow initially told him the world didn’t need another accelerator, to which Mr. Agrawal replied, “‘Well, I don’t want to build that, I want to build something different,’” Mr. Debow recalled. Unlike most accelerators and incubators, CDL wouldn’t offer companies free office space nor take an equity stake. This was meant to be a purely altruistic venture “that emphasized something very specific: the judgment mechanism,” Mr. Debow said. Mr. Agrawal also had a distinct idea how he program’s success would be measured: not by number of jobs or startups generated – a typical yardstick – but equity value created by CDL companies as they raised money. “That’s how investors measure the success or failure of their investments,” said Mr. Debow. To build one side of the judgment market, Mr. Agrawal felt it was crucial to take a different approach to mentorship. While mentors are a common feature of incubators and accelerators, “they generally fall into two categories,” said Mr. Agrawal: people who were “well-meaning but haven’t really built a significant business,” or “the occasional superstar mentor” who was typically too busy to provide much help. “We wanted judgment that was neither mediocre-and-highly committed, nor superstar-but-not-committed. We wanted superstars that were committed.” Mr. Agrawal set out to assemble a stellar group of seven entrepreneurs – the G7, as he called them – who had built successful businesses from scratch through to a successful sale or public offering, and who would be willing to commit five full days to CDL, spread out over the program’s nine months. “Time is the most valuable thing they have,” he said. He was also wanted them to put skin in the game by investing in CDL companies they liked, though he made a handful of exceptions for entrepreneurs whose companies hadn’t yet paid out from a sale or IPO, such as Geordie Rose, a former UBC classmate who had gone on to co-found quantum-computer maker D-Wave Systems. The G7 would be matched with an initial annual cohort of 23 early stage companies, sourced from mentors, benefactors, the Next 36, other accelerators and, most of all, university science labs. When they met, the G7 would collectively determine three short-term goals judged to be the most likely milestones to advance each CDL startup. The firms would then have eight weeks to deliver. If they couldn’t they would be out. If they did, they’d get three more objectives to meet eight weeks later. At any meeting, the G7 could invest – or vote them out. Every meeting, at least one company would be automatically cut. “We knew half [of the CDL startups] probably wouldn’t make it through,” said Mr. Agrawal, noting yet another difference from other startup assistance programs. “It turned out to be less than that.” Inside the workspace at Thalmic Labs in 2013. Tim Fraser/The Globe and Mail Thalmic for the win Mr. Debow, Wind Mobile founder Tony Lacavera and the Hyatt brothers were among those who signed up as mentors and financial supporters. Mr. Agrawal had further success wooing other mentors through Canada’s tight-knit tech sector, including Mr. Serbinis and Calgary entrepreneur Chen Fong, who were sold on his pitch that they could make a meaningful contribution to Canada. Many were impressed by the company they’d be keeping. “I say no to almost everything,” said Ted Livingston, co-founder of popular Waterloo-based mobile instant messaging service Kik and an early G7 member. “I just looked at the entrepreneurs [Mr. Agrawal assembled] and was like, ‘Wow, yes. I would be honoured.’ I thought this was one of the highest densities of great people I’ve ever seen.” But when he asked U of T and Rotman for help, Mr. Agrawal said “we didn’t get a nickel.” The extent of Rotman’s support was allowing him to book rooms in the building. “This was really happening despite the university. We weren’t really doing anything that fit within the university mould,” said Mr. Agrawal. (To date, CDL has received $2.5-million from individuals, $900,000 from companies, and $400,000 from the publicly funded Ontario Centres of Excellence) The plan came together within months and the first CDL cohort started in the fall of 2012. Almost immediately, several of the G7, including Mr. Debow, got excited about Thalmic, which just months earlier had been a mechatronics class project at University of Waterloo to make a gesture-control armband guided by electrical signals of a user’s muscles. That December Thalmic closed a $1.1-million seed financing round. “A big chunk of that came from the G7 and others they introduced us to,” Thalmic CEO Stephen Lake said. “One of the first value-adds was that not only were we getting advice from people in the room but they actually were writing cheques and becoming investors.” The following June, Thalmic raised another $14.5-million; Boston’s Spark Capital, an early backer of Slack and Twitter, and Intel Capital led the deal. “I feel comfortable saying we can put [Thalmic] in the win column,” said Mr. Debow, who joined the board. The Creative Destruction Lab in March, 2017. Michelle Siu/The Globe and Mail Just-in-Time MBA Far from celebrating CDL’s early successes, however, Mr. Agrawal took the approach of an entrepreneur, tinkering to make it better. He recruited world-renowned U of T professors including Ms. Shoichet and Mr. Mann to act as CDL “chief scientists,” testing technology brought in by the startups. He asked professional services firms including Osler and Ernst & Young Global Ltd. to advise the startups. Additional observers, dubbed “G7 Associates,” were invited to participate. These carefully curated guests – “we look for community builders, not lone wolves,” Mr. Agrawal said – included venture capitalists such as Mr. Farris and successful entrepreneurs who were expected to provide feedback, introductions and even funding to the startups. He also changed how the G7 weeded out CDL companies. At first the selection was done by a show of hands after each meeting. Mr. Agrawal didn’t like that, so the G7 was instead asked if they’d be willing to devote four hours of their time to each startup over the following eight weeks. If just one put up a hand, the startup would stay. “The best voting mechanism is individual conviction,” Mr. Agrawal said. Committing four hours “makes it expensive for them to raise their hands.” That proved to be the saving grace for some. Mr. Livingston took to two founders in CDL’s second year who were developing a robot tea dispenser called teaBOT. Their rough prototype looked like a high school science project but Mr. Livingston was intrigued by the team: one was a U of T aerospace robotics engineering PhD candidate who loved to build machines, and the Kik founder wanted to see what they could accomplish. “I just believed in these people,” Mr. Livingston said. He alone voted to keep them in initially. At each successive meeting the prototype and pitch improved, and several G7s ultimately invested. There are now 17 teaBOTs in service, including machines in three “365 by Whole Foods” stores. The biggest change came at the behest of steel magnate John Harris, a founding donor and regular observer of CDL meetings. He was learning from the CDL sessions himself and said “It’s crazy this is happening right here in a business school and there is not a single MBA student in the room,” Mr. Agrawal recalled. Mr. Agrawal and a PhD student designed a self-directed course for CDL’s second year whereby students did standard MBA analysis, observing the startup-G7 interactions and producing slides with prim recommendations. Mr. Debow called it “a lot of wasted effort, a classic MBA make-work project. Their insights were not that helpful.” But there was such a surge in demand from students and inquiries to admissions about CDL the following year that Rotman administrators took notice. That coincided with the arrival of new dean, former Bank of Canada deputy governor Tiff Macklem in July, 2014. After giving many high-level speeches over the years about Canada’s chronically stagnant productivity, Mr. Macklem quickly embraced CDL for the impact it was having. The dean has since thrown Rotman’s support behind the program and the launch in 2015 of an annual CDL machine learning conference, promoting the lab publicly and meetings with government and business. “CDL is very results-oriented but it’s also an experiment in how you teach entrepreneurship and how you actually accelerate companies,” Mr. Macklem said. “It’s working, and there are not enough examples of accelerators that are truly working.” To improve the MBA class in the third year, Mr. Agrawal decided to get students directly involved by working with the startups. Now young companies led by scientists with limited business know-how had access to “this team of super motivated, super engaged, highly talented MBAs working for them,” Mr. Debow said. Forget reading stale Harvard Business School case studies: students were now living real-time case studies. “They’re not doing an academic exercise, they’re taking their academic tools and applying it to a real problem – and it’s a problem the founders and the G7 care about,” Mr. Agrawal said. Meanwhile their professors were expected to write class notes based on the latest challenges CDL startups faced, not just wheeling out well-worn lectures. One visiting academic from Harvard called it “just-in-time education.” The CDL course became “the most competitive at Rotman to get into,” said Mr. Agrawal. “It was one of the most beneficial classes I had,” said Sasha Kucharczyk, who took the CDL course as an MBA student in 2013-14. “It taught you to think and act differently [to] help you attack and execute on abstract problems [to get] meaningful results.” Two years later he entered his startup Preteckt, which uses AI software to predict when heavy vehicles will need maintenance, into CDL. Big deals for CDL alumni $120-million Series B funding for Thalmic Labs, makers of the Myo Gesture Control armband (2016) $14-million Series A funding for Bionym, makers of a heartbeat authentication wristband (2014) $6-million Seed funding for Atomwise, developer of a drug-discovery platform (2015) $5-million Seed funding for Kepler Communications, a satellite communications company (2016) $3.7-million Seed funding for Deep Genomics, a Toronto-based bioinformatics startup (2015) $2.4-million Seed funding for Taplytics, which specializes in mobile A/B testing (2015) $1.7-million Seed funding for Bridgit, whose cloud-based platform helps manage construction projects (2016) All figures in U.S. dollars for single rounds of funding (Source: Company releases) ‘World class talent’ It’s 8:01 on April 13, 2016, and the fourth meeting of the CDL’s “machine learning” stream for the year is under way. Mr. Agrawal, who acts as master of ceremonies, runs a tight ship. He asks everyone in the room to describe themselves in one sentence – and cuts off anyone who lingers. One by one the 13 startups still in the program get up for their 30-minute slots. Each firm is introduced by a mentor who revisits how they’ve performed and proposes the next three objectives. Most of the discussion is among the associates and Mr. Agrawal, who pick over the companies as if talking about specimens while their founders stand awkwardly at the front, occasionally responding to pointed questions. “I’m really not sure yet about the company,” says Mr. Pell, the former NASA AI head, of Heuritech, a startup from Paris that assesses social media posts using AI to determine fashion trends. “They’re smart people,” he says of the team of four AI and machine learning PhDs. “My concern is: how big is the business opportunity?” In 2015-16, for the first time there are two CDL streams, with this one focused exclusively on startups based on “machine learning,” a form of AI where algorithms automatically build themselves based on big data troves fed in. (CDL has since doubled down and now runs two machine learning streams, each starting with 25 companies.) The idea was initially met with some skepticism internally that CDL was getting too narrowly focused, but it’s worked so far. Two San Francisco-based machine learning experts are mentors, known here as the ML7: Mr Pell, introduced to Mr. Agrawal a year earlier by a CDL alumnus, and Ms. Zilis of VC firm Bloomberg Beta. The machine-learning focus has also attracted interest from top U.S. venture capital firms, which regularly send partners to observe, including Bessemer Venture Partners, True Ventures, and Google Ventures. “All the companies have been very impressive,” says Adam D’Augelli, a True partner. “They have real technology and at this point will have early revenue or early product traction, which for something coming out of university is relatively rare.” One Silicon Valley early stage investment firm, FundersClub provides $50,000 to any CDL company that raises money from at least one ML7 and another $100,000. By this point some CDL companies have landed seven-figure venture financings. “There’s world class talent” in Toronto, Mr. Agrawal says. “When we built [a CDL program for machine learning], that was the first time people got on a plane from Silicon Valley to Toronto rather than the other way around. Once they make that investment, they are schlepping to Canada every quarter for a board meeting. Making a second investment is a far lower hurdle. One of the most important things we’re doing for the country is getting some of the world’s top investors to go from zero to one” in Canada. As the meetings progress, the ML7 ask who are the startups’ customers – the Beagle dilemma – what they should charge, what key positions they should fill and whether their businesses can scale into something big. “If I don’t have an understanding for how this could potentially be a billion-dollar company or if I don’t believe the founder has that ambition, I categorically can’t invest,” Ms. Zilis says later. Mr. Agrawal says there are three main startup risks: technology, market and entrepreneur. Through CDL, he says, entrepreneurs can show their technology works and determine initial market interest – while addressing the third point by showing they can steadily deliver on time-sensitive objectives. Some companies are doing well. Preteckt seems to be winning over the ML7 with news it has completed its second-generation protoypes, has installed its technology on several vehicles and is working on a letter of intent with Volvo. “I like everything they are doing,” declares ML7 and tech entrepreneur Shahram Tafazoli. The ML7 assigns Preteckt objectives to install 100 revenue-generating units, file a patent application and return with a signed letter from Volvo in the next eight weeks. Deep Genomics, meanwhile, doesn’t have a product yet, but for Silicon Valley investors, that doesn’t always matter. What Deep Genomics does have is CEO Brendan Frey, a renowned deep learning pioneer and U of T professor who is trying to apply his lab work to improve diagnostic yields. Like many AI experts who’ve started companies, he’s attracted Big Silicon Valley money at a very early stage, raising $5-million from Bloomberg Beta and others. It’s a reminder that south of the border, investors are willing to take larger, more speculative bets than more conservative Canadian VCs, who as a result miss out on the gigantic returns when some of those flyers turn into global giants. He’s the rock star of the room, looking cool and confident in a silver paisley shirt and salt-and-pepper beard. “I got on the phone with Brendan and within five minutes I said ‘You can have my money and I will help you no matter what,’” Ms Zilis says in an interview later. Brothers Alex and Eric Dolan have developed a smartwatch app that can detect when a person with epilepsy is having a seizure and alert others. The technology was inspired by their epileptic mom and 2,600 people are testing it. “We are working with people who are scared … giving them tools so they can manage their lives,” Alex Dolan tells the room. But while some ML7s praise the Dolans, they’re not convinced their Neutun Labs Inc. is a billion-dollar opportunity. One concern is that the Neutun sends out “false-positive” alarms close to half the time to emergency contacts about attacks that aren’t happening. “Can it deliver something that has value? I think it’s been nebulous,” says ML7 Moe Kermani, a Vancouver venture capitalist. Alex Dolan isn’t backing down. “I’ve found a high satisfaction among users,” he says in an emotionally charged and defensive tone. “I’m thanked profusely for it….we’re focused on the one metric that matters – growing our users and engaging with them.” Neutun is cut later that day. “The ML7 just didn’t think they could add a lot of value to the company anymore,” Mr. Agrawal explains later. He says CDL “can really only help companies that are willing to be coached.” One such company is Validere Technlogies Inc. It entered the non-machine learning CDL program in 2015-16 with technology to sniff out knockoffs of perfume brands. At the behest of the G7, Validere changed its pitch and is now a hazardous waste detection service. Alberta-based G7 Chen Fong introduced the founders to oil patch executives, securing an entree that might have otherwise taken years, and the team raised $3.3-million (U.S.) in 2016 from investors in Canada and Silicon Valley. Mr. Agrawal is particularly proud of Rotman MBA student Alyssa Randall, who “went rogue” after a machine learning company she favoured was cut early from CDL. She helped the team anyway and thanks to her efforts they have had some breakthroughs – and been accepted back into CDL for this meeting. MBAs “are viewed as suits that are overpriced and underdeliver,” Mr. Agrawal says later. Ms. Randall, on the other hand, has taken big risks and overdelivered on a long shot, rather than taking the safer route of being reassigned to a company that made it through. Her company, called Algocian, graduated from CDL and hired her. “I was really happy,” she said months later, though Algocian ultimately shut down. “It was an opportunity for me to solidify a positive reputation for the company.” As for Beagle, the company did end up graduating and focusing on larger enterprise customers, and CEO Cian O’Sullivan praised the program as “a fantastic initiative … an absolute perfect crash course for running a company.” That said, there are ways it could improve, he said months later. Not all advice he got from mentors from helpful, and Mr. O’Sullivan said he would have appreciated advice earlier on how difficult it would be “to train the marketplace” for a new type of product rather than attacking an existing market. He wondered if there were too many companies for mentors to keep track of, sometimes diluting the effectiveness of advice he received, and felt the mentors could have been more open to CDL companies airing their vulnerabilities, rather than “looking for strength after strength after strength. Highlighting weakness doesn’t fit well in that environment.” Some wonder whether CDL can replicate its success as it expands. “The real challenge is it’s all about Ajay,” said Boris Wertz, a Vancouver venture capitalist who is one of CDL West’s G7s this year. “As long as Ajay stays motivated he can create a real legacy.” CDL now faces the same challenge as any flourishing startup: not getting too cocky about its early success. “CDL’s measure of success will ultimately be 10 years in the making,”said ML7 Lisa Shields, who is now mentoring CDL West companies. Says Mr. Debow: “One of the worst Canadian diseases is to convince yourself you’re world class. Have we created Facebook yet? No? Then keep moving.” Indeed, Mr. Agrawal, who actively solicits feedback about improving CDL, hardly seems satisfied; he rejected out of hand recent suggestions CDL throw a party to celebrate its alumni hitting the $1-billion value creation mark in value. “We are so far away from achieving the mission” of improving Canada’s competitiveness, he said.

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website nine  −   =  eight Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter The Dow Jones news for Monday is the index sliding after the G20 conference. Leaders of the top global economies dropped a pledge to maintain free trade and failed to reach a compromise during a two-day meeting. Many believe the meeting reduced global trade prospects and that G20 members took a far more nationalistic approach. Here's everything you need to know on that front. Don't Miss: Trump's Secret Weapon Set to Foil China's Master Plan On Friday, the Dow Jones dropped 19 points. The downturn coincided with "quadruple witching," a day when three related classes of futures and options contracts expired. Let's look at the numbers from Friday for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq: Dow Jones: 20,914.62; -19.93; -0.10% S&P 500: 2,378.25; -3.13; -0.13% Nasdaq: 5,901.00; +0.24; +0.00% Here's a look at today's most important market events and stocks, plus a look at Monday's economic calendar. What's Ahead for the Dow Jones Industrial Average Today The Dow Jones futures projected a 15-point decline as investors prepared for a busy day of economic news. Markets are still digesting the Fed's decision last week to raise interest rates. Investors are eyeing a wealth of information on mergers and acquisitions. Shares of Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY) were flat despite news that the company could walk away from its deal with Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC). Last week, shares of MBLY surged on news that Intel would purchase the developer of self-driving vehicle technology. However, the New York Post is reporting this morning that the company may be holding out for a higher bid. Crude oil prices were falling on news that U.S. production levels were on the rise. On Friday, Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE: BHI) reported another uptick in U.S. production rigs. The increase of American production platforms offset expectations that OPEC will be able to deliver on its expected cuts to cap excessive production. BHI reported that the United States added 14 production platforms, bringing the total to 631. That is the highest figure since September 2015. This morning, the WTI crude oil price today fell 1.9%. Brent crude dipped 1.4%. Trending: The Best Oil Company Stocks to Buy Now But the big news is happening in Washington. While everyone is talking about the Trump budget, the real threat to the post-election rally is happening with the debate over the Affordable Care Act. Markets have roared higher since President Trump teased his new tax plan on Feb. 9, which promised to slash corporate taxes by 25%. But with Congress now racing to replace the Affordable Care Act, Money Morning Capital Wave Strategist Shah Gilani worries that could make investors question whether or not the tax cuts will actually come. Here's Shah's latest insight on what could happen next. Stocks to Watch Today, March 20, 2017 In deal news, shares of Sprouts Farmers Market (Nasdaq: SFM) added nearly 10% in pre-market hours after rumors emerged that the company could merge with Albertsons. Shares of Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) fell another 1.7% as concerns about the stock continue to weigh on investors. Last week, several investment banks have initiated coverage on the stock over the last week, and no one wants to attach a "Buy" rating on the social media company. The stock is now within striking distance of falling below its IPO price of $17.00 per share. Money Morning has recommended that investors steer clear of this company and wait until the lock-up period is complete before making a decision on whether or not to purchase this stock. Shares of Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) were up 0.6% after the entertainment giant reported a record weekend of ticket sales for its film "Beauty and the Beast." The film grossed at least $170 million during its first weekend. Shares of Array Biopharma (Nasdaq: ARRY) slumped more than 20% after the stock received bad news from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM). The investment bank slashed its price target on the biotech company.

By admin in Uncategorized March 21, 2017 Ron Wilson, Intel FPGA 10 Gbps Ethernet has established itself as the standard way to connect server cards to the top-of-rack switch in data-center racks. So what’s it doing in the architectural plans for next-generation embedded systems? It is a tale of two separate but connected worlds. Inside the Data Center If we can say that a technology has a homeland, then the home turf of 10GbE would be inside the cabinets that fill data centers. There, the standard has provided a bridge across a perplexing architectural gap. Data centers live or die by multiprocessing: their ability to partition a huge task across hundreds, or thousands, of server cards and storage devices. And multiprocessing in turn succeeds or fails on communications—the ability to move data so effectively that the whole huge assembly of CPUs, DRAM arrays, solid-state drives , and disks acts as if they were one giant shared-memory, many-core system. This need puts special stress on the interconnect fabric. Obviously it must offer high bandwidth at the lowest possible latency. And since the interconnect will touch nearly every server and storage controller card in the data center, it must be inexpensive—implying commodity CMOS chips—compact, and power efficient. And the interconnect must support a broad range of services. Blocks of data must shuffle to and from DRAM arrays, SSDs, and disks. Traffic must pass between servers and the Internet. Remote direct memory access must allow servers to treat each other’s memory as local. Some tasks may want to stream data through a hardware accelerator without using DRAM or cache on the server cards. As data centers take on network functions virtualization , applications may try to reproduce the data flows they enjoyed in hard-wired appliances.Click here to read more … E-mail This Article Printer-Friendly Page … Post navigation MIPS, execution culture and getting into AI Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi 21 March 2017 Watch Full Episode Online in HD Search for: Recent Posts Men!

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation Report: Breitbart News Part Of FBI’s Probe Of Election Interference By Russia Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Report: Breitbart News Part Of FBI’s Probe Of Election Interference By Russia Posted at 11:30 am on March 21, 2017 by Susan Wright Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Whoa. This is interesting. As the House Intel hearings kicked off yesterday, part of what was confirmed was that, indeed, U.S. intelligence agencies were investigating if there was some link between Russia and Trump’s campaign during the election. Today, The Washington Examiner has a story originally from McClatchy that suggests that Breitbart News is also part of the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s alleged attempts to influence the 2016 election. The report, by McClatchy, said the FBI is looking at whether Breitbart and other “far-right news operations took any actions to assist Russia’s operatives.” Breitbart was formerly run by President Trump’s White House strategic adviser Steve Bannon, who left the site to chair Trump’s campaign in the fall. McClatchy’s report, published Monday evening, said Russian government operatives used “bots” to swarm social media with links to news stories, many of which were fake, that were favorable to Trump’s campaign during times that the candidate was on the defensive. Anyone who spent any amount of time on Twitter during the election season knows exactly who these “bots” are. They’re easy to spot. Trending Neil Gorsuch Reacts Perfectly To Al Franken's Nonsense, For America Andrea Ruth These are the egg people I’ve mentioned before. They generally have ridiculously low follower numbers, anywhere from 5 to 100, and are following just as few. Their Twitter addresses are usually followed by a nonsensical series of numbers and/or letters. For example: @Trumpgirl292y91844. And of course, their profile picture is just an egg (hence the term: egg people), because bots don’t have time to put together full profiles. They’re not there to socialize, and they only seem to pop up when triggered by some discussion, usually involving Trump. I’ve definitely had more than my fair share of egg swarms. They’re super-annoying and the English is broken, or at least, very clipped. Knowing how these bots operate, it actually makes sense that in a probe of election meddling, the FBI are checking the connection between how these bots may have coordinated with some of the more blatant propaganda sites out there. Breitbart hasn’t been Breitbart for quite some time.

Digital Trends Dell XPS 15 9560 review The once and future king: Dell’s XPS 15 is still the best big-screen laptop Share DT Editors' Choice The Dell XPS 15 seamlessly blends power, performance, and excellent industrial design. The Dell XPS 15 seamlessly blends power, performance, and excellent industrial design. The Dell XPS 15 seamlessly blends power, performance, and excellent industrial design. Highs Superb display Excellent everyday performance Admirable gaming chops High-quality industrial design Lows Low-quality speakers DT Editors' Rating 9.0 DT Editors' Choice Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > Dell XPS 15 9560 review By Jayce Wagner Posted on 03.18.17 Research Center: Dell XPS 15 9560 The Dell XPS 15 is the larger version of the Dell XPS 13, one of our favorite laptops of the last two years. Set them side-by-side, and you can see that Dell didn’t want to mess with a good thing. The XPS 15 builds on the success of the XPS 13, by offering a slightly larger display in a very similar chassis, but can it surpass its smaller sibling? Premium is an understatement Shrouded in a thin plastic sleeve, the XPS 15 rests inside its soft black box, waiting. From the moment you lift the lid off of that box, it’s clear that this laptop is different. The chassis is clad in matte burnished aluminum, inset with a glossy black Dell logo. The seams are soft-touch plastic, and the interior is lined with carbon fiber. To be clear, that’s real, actual carbon fiber, not just a textured sticker underneath some transparent plastic. You’ll find none of that nonsense here, as the Dell XPS 15 doesn’t compromise on build quality. Every corner, every facet of this laptop feels high quality and robust. From the materials to the layout, there’s not much to complain about. The XPS 15 isn’t just well-designed. It’s well-engineered. Just enough connectivity The XPS 15 features an adequate, if not overwhelming, number of ports with an appreciable amount of variety. There are two USB ports, one on either side, a USB Type-C port, an SD card slot, a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, and an HDMI port. It provides just enough connectivity, even when you’re using a lot of accessories — like an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse. There is, however, a notable absence, because the XPS 15’s svelte chassis — the venerable Ethernet port is nowhere to be found. So instead, you’ll have to do with investing in an Ethernet to USB or USB Type-C adapter, if you need faster-than-Wi-Fi internet speeds. Compared to the XPS 13, which features the same number of ports, but minus the HDMI port, it’s an appreciated step up. You get everything the 13 offers, plus a little extra, which is a good thing if you happen to use external monitors on a regular basis. Alternatively, you could use the included Thunderbolt 3.1/USB Type-C port to handle video connections if you have a compatible monitor, or an adapter handy. Room to stretch out Laptop keyboards are seldom as comfortable as a full-sized desktop keyboard. Even if you’re not a fan of clickety-clackety mechanical keyboards, the extra space feels luxuriant after using a laptop keyboard for a while. The XPS 15 tries to mitigate that cramped feeling by offering a bit more lateral space than its 13-inch sibling, and its appreciated. Typing on the XPS 15, even for long periods of time, never feels tiresome. The keys have decent travel for a laptop, offering just enough depth without feeling mushy. The XPS 15 isn’t just well-designed, it’s well-engineered. The keyboard features a white LED backlight as standard equipment. The light leaks substantially from under the keys, and it’s not very attractive. It provides utility in the dark — when you need to search for your Function keys — but that’s about it. The light leakage tends to spoil the otherwise high-quality vibe the XPS 15 conveys. The trackpad is nice and matte, with just enough texture to differentiate it from the soft-touch material along the interior of the laptop. It clicks nicely, and responds well to basic taps and multi-touch gestures. Compared to the trackpads on similar laptops up and down the Dell lineup, the XPS 15 delivers an unparalleled level of accuracy and control. The Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming, for instance, opts for a cheaper trackpad and the quality gap is stark. On the business-class Dell Latitude, the trackpad feels nice, but it’s not as pleasant to use as the XPS 15 — multi-touch gestures just aren’t as quick and responsive. The closest comparison is the MacBook Pro 13. Apple has long been the king of trackpad quality, but the Dell XPS 15 comes very close. Its trackpad is smooth, accurate, and it detects multi-touch gestures instantly. Plus, the XPS 15 still has a mechanical click, which might be a bonus for users put off by the MacBook’s simulated click using Apple’s “taptic engine.” A crisp and nearly perfect display Our review model of the XPS 15 features a 4K touch screen display, and at first it seemed like overkill for a laptop — particularly a laptop that isn’t primarily for gaming. But once you feast your eyes on its inky blacks and vivid, lively colors, it’s very hard to go back to a run-of-the-mill 1080p display. It certainly helps that the XPS 15 features not only tack-sharp picture quality, but outstanding color accuracy and fidelity. The XPS 15’s display is an embarrassment of riches, so let’s start with the basics: resolution. The 4K display panel Dell chose for this model is nothing short of superb. That lavish screen real estate lends itself well to a 15-inch display, as you have enough room for two full-sized windows side-by-side, and the immense resolution ensures that text is silky-smooth and inky. Moving on to the numbers, the XPS 15 doesn’t just look great, it objectively superior to most laptop displays. Starting with the sRGB spectrum, you can see that a good display will usually land in the 90-99 percent range. With the AdobeRGB spectrum, good displays can land anywhere from 76-80 percent, meaning they’re still incapable of rendering about 20 percent of the colors in that spectrum. The XPS 15 though, hits 99 percent, meaning it’s capable of reproducing nearly every color in the AdobeRGB spectrum without fail. Not only that, it’s capable of reproducing those colors very accurately. The Dell XPS 13 and Apple MacBook Pro 15, both of which have fantastic displays, land on either side of the XPS 15 when it comes to color accuracy. The XPS 13 has an average color error of 2.65, which is a little too high, meaning colors will look a bit off — they’ll be noticeably different on the XPS 13’s display than they would be in real life. On the other hand, the MacBook Pro 15 manages an average color error of .61, meaning its colors are nearly perfect — good enough for professional-grade color-sensitive work like photo and video editing. The XPS 15 comes in right between them with an average color error of 1.23, meaning its colors are very close to perfect. But the sound? Flat and lifeless Fire up Spotify or your favorite streaming app on a laptop, and you should expect your music to sound good. The same goes for games, movies, YouTube videos, and anything else you might watch on your laptop. Laptop speakers have a bad reputation for producing flat, lifeless audio, and the XPS 15 does nothing to buck that trend The speakers on the XPS 15 aren’t the worst you’re ever likely to use on a laptop, but they crush otherwise dynamic sound by a significant degree. Everything sounds hollow, though the speakers do at least steer away from a muddy, unclear quality. The XPS 15’s built-in speakers are fine for system alerts and the occasional YouTube video, but for anything else you’ll probably want to invest in a pair of decent headphones. Quick and capable Another distinct advantage the XPS 15 has over competitors is its 7th-generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, clocked at 2.8GHz. It’s an upgrade over last year’s 6th-generation model, and it performs a bit better in everyday use but it’s not a massive leap forward. You can see those performance gains in the comparison to the Asus ROG Strix, which features the 6th-generation version of the XPS 15’s processor, the Intel Core i7-7600HQ. The Strix scores 4,137 on single core performance, and 12,314 on multi-core performance, while the XPS 15 scores 4,594, and 13,814 respectively. These scores are instructive for a couple reasons. First, you can see that the 7th-generation Intel processors are relatively quick on their feet. Secondly, the performance you gain moving from 6th-generation chips to 7th-generation chips isn’t a large as it has been in the past, so investing in a 7th-generation chip might not be necessary depending on your current needs. Overall, the XPS 15’s quad-core processor is fast and capable, edging out 6th-generation i7 chips, and blowing past 6th-generation i5 chips with ease. A sprightly hard drive Our review unit arrived with a 512GB solid state drive connected over PCI Express. That is what we’d expect to see in a high-end laptop, and it performed admirably. In our testing the drive beat out competitors in both read and write speeds. Among roughly similar laptops, only two we’ve tested beat the XPS 15. One is the Apple MacBook Pro, which is quite a bit more expensive, and can’t run the same benchmark (as it uses MacOS). The other is Dell’s Precision 5520, which is essentially a workstation version of the XPS 15 – and also a lot more expensive. Even gaming is pretty alright Just looking at the XPS 15, you’d never guess that it was a capable laptop for gaming. Black plastic, carbon fiber, aluminum, and a single-colored keyboard backlight? Without any red accents or fierce brand-names like Strix, Predator, or Razer, the humble XPS flies under the radar — and that’s a good thing. By including a solid mid-range GPU in the otherwise business-class XPS 15, Dell has created something of a hybrid, an accidental gaming laptop that eschews every “gamer laptop” design trend. The GeForce GTX 1050 purring away under the XPS 15’s hood provides enough headroom to comfortably accommodate recent games at medium-high settings if you scale your resolution down to 1080p. Games still look great on this display, but the XPS 15 just can’t reliably handle 4K gaming. In 3DMark, the XPS 15 outperforms its nearest competitors and performs nearly as well as entry-level gaming laptops like the Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming and Asus ROG Strix GL553VD. In individual games, the XPS 15 fared well, but you should expect to tweak your settings to get the most out of the GTX 1050. It’s not the fastest graphics card on the market and it shows. In Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, the XPS 15 managed an average of 25 frames per second at high detail settings and 1080p resolution, while the Inspiron managed 24, and the Strix managed 28. They’re all within the same margin, but for comparison, the Acer Predator 15, a laptop featuring the GTX 1060 graphics card, hit 58 FPS on high detail settings in 1080p. The GTX 1050 is a capable graphics card, but it’s not quite up to the task when it comes to high-detail settings on very demanding games. You can increase your performance to tolerable levels by turning down shadows, or anti-aliasing though. Despite its slim profile, the internal fans do a very good job of keeping the XPS 15 cool even while running demanding games for long periods of time. It’s surprising that the XPS 15 is an okay gaming laptop, since it’s not actually designed to be one. Light, and long-lived By filing the bezels to the bare minimums, the XPS 15 manages to maintain a very small profile despite its large overall screen size. In fact it’s smaller, though not thinner, than a MacBook Pro 15. Weighing in at just four pounds, you’ll barely even notice carrying this thing around. Putting it in a small bag designed for 13-inch laptops, the XPS 15 still leaves you with enough room to throw in a water bottle, charger, and even another — small — laptop. It’s a refreshing change. Battery life is good, but it might not get you through a full workday, and that’s due to the 4K display. Powering all those pixels takes a toll, and we were hard pressed to get more than five hours out of the XPS 15 in everyday mixed use. That said, most of that daily use was performed in a bright office, with the brightness turned way, way up. On a more sensible power plan, with brightness calibrated to around 100 lux — which is a little under 50 percent brightness — battery life improved significantly. Using browser macro loop, which essentially loads up the same webpage over and over, the XPS 15 managed up to six hours of life. Dell XPS 15 9560 Compared To Dell Inspiron 15 7000 (2017) Asus Zenbook 3 UX390UA Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Dell Precision 15 3510 Lenovo Ideapad 710S HP Spectre Dell Latitude 12 LG Gram 15 Z960 Samsung Notebook 9 Pro… Asus Zenbook UX501VW-DS71T Samsung ATIV Book 9 (2014) Dell XPS 15 (2012) Toshiba Satellite P755 HP Pavilion g6 Lenovo IdeaPad U550 Looking at its nearest competitors, you can see that the XPS 15 provides solid, if not stellar, battery life in most use cases. The video loop provided the best results, with the XPS 15 looping the same video for seven and a half hours before running out of juice. Still, it’s a bit short of what we managed to get out of the Lenovo Yoga 910, and the HP Spectre x360 15-inch, both of which managed upwards of 10 hours before falling flat. Uninvited guests Dell is usually good about keeping bloatware to a minimum, at least on its premium laptops. You’ll likely find a few Dell-branded utilities and registration tools on brand-new laptops, but not much else. The XPS 15’s only uninvited guest is a trial version of McAfee Antivirus, which nags incessantly, but it’s easily removed with a simple uninstall. Warranty information The Dell XPS 15 is protected by a one-year limited hardware warranty, covering manufacturer defects and shipping costs — but the warranty specifies that you’ll need to provide your own box if anything goes wrong. Our Take The XPS 15 is a phenomenal laptop. It does have a few flaws, as the speakers aren’t great, and the battery life could be better, but overall the XPS 15 stands head-and-shoulders above the competition in nearly every way. It’s easily one of the best 15-inch Windows laptops you can buy. Is there a better alternative? Yes and no. There are better alternatives if you don’t really need a discrete graphics card and 4K display, two factors which contribute substantially to the XPS 15’s price tag. In which case you might be better off saving yourself some cash and investing in one of the lower-end 1080p models, or even the XPS 13.

For instance, the Dell Precision 5520 is a much better choice for AutoCAD or other high-intensity software suites on account of its Intel Xeon processor and Nvidia Quadro GPU. But it will run you about $3,700. Alternatively, the Acer Predator 15 G9-593 would be a better choice for gaming, since it comes standard with an Nvidia GTX 1060 GPU, which runs circles around the XPS 15’s GTX 1050. It costs about the same as the XPS 15. Unfortunately, though, specialized gaming or business notebooks have their own unique drawbacks. Gaming performance can kill portability in more ways than one, and the high-end components in professional laptops drive up the price considerably. With the XPS 15 you don’t have to worry about that, as it’s well-balanced without much compromise. How long will it last? Longer than it needs to. Seriously, this chassis is rock-solid, and it will very likely outlast its internal components. In three or four years when your CPU is showing its age, a well-tended XPS 15 will likely be just as good-looking as it was the day you bought it. This is the closest any PC manufacturer has come to Apple’s lofty build standards. Should you buy it? Yes. This is a solid, reliable, and attractive laptop with a reasonable price, and few drawbacks. It can handle pretty much anything you throw at it, and look good doing it.

Browse Full Report Visit – http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/drone-transponders-market The simplest way to protect against mid-air collisions is to require the use of ADS-B transponders on all aircraft.  Transponders can turn an uncooperative environment into a cooperative environment. Transponders provide location and positioning information about smart commercial drones.  These drones have a computer inside, they are easy to fly, remotely maneuverable, have a camera, and contain sensor logic.  Smart drones are evolving computer driven collision avoidance technology making the flying more reliable. Remote operation occurs in the context of a workflow and sensors.  Cameras are improving dramatically to permit management of video and picture taking that is realistic and detailed.  Drone actuators, drone transponders, are needed to support drone package delivery.  This is a huge new market that speeds economic development, makes it easier for the middle class to both work, and purchase lifestyle items and food efficiently. Drones based on aerial robotic platform technology can be used to make deliveries to each person’s home, landing on the back doorstep, leaving packages in a locked box.  The drone package delivery technology has reached a level of maturity that bodes well for market development.  Drone systems are mature enough to be at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. Dronecode is an independently funded software project that harnesses the power of collaborative development.  The aim is to fuel innovation across drone industries and ecosystems.  Dronecode Foundation is a nonprofit organization working on a common, shared open source platform for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Dronecode brings together existing and future open source UAV software projects. APM UAV software platform was developed by 3DRobotics.  1,200 developers are working on Dronecode’s six projects focused on maximizing adoption of the project’s cost-effective, reliable and technologically advanced UAV software. Micro-Avionix has an ultra-lightweight low cost ADS-B transponder for UAS.  Micro-Avionix has developed an ADS-B suitable for UAVs of all sizes to improve flying safety for all.  The ping™ is a family of ultralight weight, low cost, ADS-B transponders. Browse All Reports of This Category – http://www.acutemarketreports.com/category/parts-and-suppliers-market Weights range from 1.5 to 30 grams, delivering a variety of types of performance.   The ping2020™, for instance, is capable of IN on both 1090ES and 978UAT, and OUT on 978UAT.  The products are fully compliant with the minimum performance standards of DO-282B Class A1S.  Micro-Avionix has developed an ADS-B suitable for UAVs of all sizes to The ping™ is among the world’s first families of ultralight weight, low cost, ADS-B transponders. Transponder and sense and avoid technology sponsorship by Sagetech, L-3 Aviation Products, FreeFlight, Micro-Avionix, Google, Trig, DJI, and Intel has been effective.  Development by Dronecode application ecosystem provides huge advances in drone real-time sense and avoid behavior.  An open source collaboration is expected to accelerate deployable solutions for agile and reliable operation in the national airspace.  The open source platform has been adopted by many organizations on the forefront of drone technology:  3DRobotics, Parrot, Qualcomm, Intel, DroneDeploy, Yuneec, Airphrame, and others. With 750,000 users and 500 active developers the open source code initiative represents a compelling community of professionals and enthusiasts is able to support active improvements in control of airspace and improvement in flying safety for all.  The alliance has worked on development standardization and software module interoperability. According to Susan Eustis, lead author of the study, “Use of drone transponders represents a key milestone in provision of value to the airborne package delivery industry.  Customized cameras are used to supplement GPS navigation, acting as eyes of the drone, permitting package delivery everywhere.  Digital controls will further automate flying, making ease of use and flight stability a reality. New materials and new designs are bringing that transformation forward.  By furthering transponder innovation, continued growth is assured.” The worldwide market for drone transponders is anticipated to start from nothing and reach $2.5 billion worldwide by 2022 growing in response to the need to prevent drone collisions, keep the highways in the sky safe, and manage routing of commercial drones.  Multiple applications drive market growth, most of all package delivery occurs out of line of sight. Other applications for drone transponders are in consumer photography, lightweight commercial drones for real estate, the military, law enforcement, border control, homeland security, utility infrastructure surveillance, agriculture, aerial mapping, and package delivery.

Overclocking & Power Consumption11. Tests: Motherboard Features Performance12. Closing Thoughts13. View All Pages ASRock’s Fatal1ty Gaming motherboards likely aren’t first to mind for storage and networking connectivity but the new Fata1lty Z270 Professional Gaming i7 is jam packed – three M.2,  ten SATA III, three Ethernet ports and AC WiFi . There’s been relatively little pioneering of new connectivity standards for Z270 motherboards since the chipset is loaded as standard with the likes of M.2 NVMe, USB 3.0, USB 3.1, SATA III, PCIe 3.0 and DDR4. This presents no major problems either since that default connectivity covers the vast majority of consumers and Intel’s user base for just about anything. However, ASRock has decided to push the boundaries once again, this time in the realm of networking with the implementation of a 5Gbps network interface controller on the Fatal1ty Z270 Professional Gaming i7. ASRock were, incidentally, one of the first motherboard brands to push 10 Gigabit connections with the X99 WS-E/10G. The 5Gbps controller will be compatible with a new generation of 5Gbps routers, switches and motherboards spawned from an IEEE standard finalised in late-2016. This new standard will enable 2.5Gbps (over up to 100 metres of Cat 5e cabling) and 5Gbps (over up to 100 metres of Cat 6 cabling) but we’ve yet to see any consumer-oriented devices take advantage of this yet. Thankfully, the ASRock board isn’t a one trick pony and has a number of other unique selling points, 5Gbps Ethernet aside. These include further networking prowess – dual Intel Gigabit LAN and Intel 802.11ac WiFi and a significant serving of storage potential. ASRock provides three M.2 ports capable of up to 32GB/s each and 10 SATA III ports, though there are naturally bandwidth sharing issues to be aware of when using these concurrently. ASRock’s also ticked other key requirements of a high-end motherboard with a number of handy overclocking buttons and features, a very well fleshed out power delivery system and full RGB lighting capability.    ASRock Fatal1ty Z270 Professional Gaming i7 Form Factor  ATX, 30.5 cm x 24.4 cm CPU Socket  LGA 1151, 14 Phase (8+4+2) VRM Chipset  Intel Z270 Memory  DDR4, 4 DIMMs, up to 64GB, up to 3733MHz+ with OC, 2 phase Onboard Graphics  Intel HD Graphics (supported CPUs), up to 1024MB of video memory Discrete Graphics Up to Nvidia 2-way/Quad SLI, AMD 3-way/Quad CrossFireX Expansion Slots  4 x PCIe 3.0 (16X/4X/8X/4X electrical – x16/x0, x8/x8, x8/x4/x4) 1 x PCIe 3.0 Storage 10 x SATA III (6 from PCH, 2 from ASM1061) 2 x SATA Express (Shared with SATA ports 0,1,2,3) 3 x M.2 supporting NVMe 32GB/s* *M2_1 shares bandwidth with SATA 0+1, SATA Express 0 M2_2 shares bandwidth with SATA 4+5 M2_3 shares bandwidth with SATA 3, SATA Express 1 USB 6 x USB 2.0 (6 Front, via PCH) 9x USB 3.0 (4 Rear, 5 Front, 4 Rear and 1 Front vertical via PCH, Front Headers via ASM1074) 2 x USB 3.1 (2 Rear [Type-A and C], via ASM2142) Networking  1 x Intel I219V Gigabit 1 x Intel I211AT Gigabit 1 x Aquantia AQC108 5-Gigabit 1 x Intel AC 3160 2T2R 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 Combo Audio Realtek ALC 1220, 7.1 Channel Fan Headers  5, all support 3/4pin fans (2 x CPU, 1 x W_PUMP, 2 x CHA) Rear I/O 2 x WiFi Antenna Ports 1 x PS/2 Mouse/Keyboard Port 1 x HDMI Port 1 x DisplayPort 1.2 1 x Optical SPDIF Out Port 1 x USB 3.1 Type-A Port 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C Port 3 x USB 3.0 Ports 1 x Fatal1ty Mouse Port (USB 3.0) 3 x RJ-45 LAN Ports with LED 1 x Clear CMOS Switch 5 x HD Audio Jacks UEFI 2 x 128Mb AMI UEFI Pages: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags asrock Intel kaby lake LGA 1151 motherboard Review RGB Z270 Previous Rumour claims RX 500 series will be based on Polaris 20 XTX and Polaris 12 Next Bethesda wants Quake Champions to become an esport Check Also Cryorig H7 Air Cooler Review The Cryorig H7 has been called the 'Hyper 212 killer.'

Beginning in 2001, I’ve written 10 columns recommending my favorite stocks on the Nasdaq. My recommendations have posted a 12-month return averaging 16.7 percent, compared to 13.7 percent for the Nasdaq Composite Index and 10.8 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Bear in mind that my column recommendations are theoretical and don’t reflect actual trades, trading costs or taxes. Their results shouldn’t be confused with the performance of portfolios I manage for clients. And past performance doesn’t predict future results. Last year, my picks rose 9.5 percent, badly trailing both the Nasdaq Composite (which was up 26.4 percent) and the S&P 500 (up 20.9 percent). My worst pick was Cal-Maine Foods Inc. (CALM), which dropped 22.9 percent. My best was Net 1 UEPS Technologies Inc. (UEPS), which advanced 50.1 percent. On a limb In some years, I’ve also climbed out on a limb to predict where the Nasdaq Composite Index will go. In December 1999, I said the Nasdaq “won’t repeat its great 1999,” and that “I expect weakness to begin affecting this year’s high fliers as early as January.” The weakness actually started in March, and it was catastrophic. In June 2000, I said that Nasdaq “could behave like Japan’s Nikkei, which fell 57 percent in 1990-92, and stayed depressed for a long time.” The Nasdaq index fell 39 percent in 2000, 21 percent in 2001 and more than 31 percent in 2002. In June 2002, I predicted that “Nasdaq’s days as a whipping boy will end soon.” If “soon” means 90 days later, I was right. The index rose 50 percent in 2003 and posted gains for the next four years. My prediction for the 12 months ahead is less exciting. I think the Nasdaq Composite will be within a few percentage points of its present level (5,900) a year from now. The economy is doing fine, which bodes well for profits. But stock valuations are high. The Nasdaq Composite sells for 43 times the aggregate earnings of its 2,539 members. The tug-of-war between rising profits and optimistic valuations will end in a standoff, I believe. Now, here are five stocks I like on the Nasdaq today. Intel Intel Corp. (INTC), the world’s largest maker of computer chips, recently increased its dividend again, and has been doing so steadily. I like dividend increases: I consider them a sincerity barometer showing that management believes earnings progress is sustainable. The chip giant is shelling out big money to acquire Israel’s Mobileye, a pioneer in auto vision. It can use its offshore cash hoard to pay for a good part of the acquisition. Biogen Biogen, the fourth largest U.S. biotech company by market value, posted an admirable return on capital last year, more than 22 percent. Yet it sells for less than 15 times earnings, frugal by the standards of today’s heated market. Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the company has a diverse portfolio of drugs, combating arthritis, lymphoma, multiple sclerosis and many other diseases. The U.S. healthcare system is in limbo now: No one knows what the rules will be. But a company that saves lives and reduces suffering has a good chance of continuing to show strong profits. AV Homes As a speculation, I like AV Homes Inc. (AVHI), a small homebuilder with headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona. Few analysts follow it, which creates the potential for the stock to be “discovered.” The stock sells for less than book value (corporate net worth per share). In 2016, AV Homes got about half its revenue in Florida, 31 percent in the Carolinas and 19 percent in Arizona. The focus on the South should be an advantage, as people in the U.S. continue to gradually move south for a better climate and lower taxes. Herman Miller A more conservative pick is Herman Miller Inc. (MLHR), which makes furniture primarily for offices but also for homes. It has shown slow but steady growth in the past, and analysts expect more of the same. With a dividend yield of 2.3 percent, and a stock price only 0.8 times revenue, I think Herman Miller would hold up pretty well if the market should decline. T. Rowe Price Mutual fund purveyor T. Rowe Price TK (TROW) has been whacked lately, as investors flee actively managed mutual funds in favor of various funds that mimic market indexes. Indexing has become popular, almost a fad. I think that trend will reverse in the next couple of years. Disclosure: A few of my clients own Intel shares, and most of my clients own T. Rowe Price.

I know when i use Cinebench that it also gives "single" and "multi" threaded scores. And those scores scale fairly evenly with the addition of extra cores (like 125 single threaded and 790 for a 4 core 8 threaded CPU. So roughly 7-8x the single threaded score for a 8 thread CPU.). Why then with a 64 threaded CPU is the "multi thread" score only around 13x higher then the "single threaded" score on Geekbench? I admit tjis may be viewed as a "noob" like question but i don't really care. Can somone explain it to me? Thanks.     KingK76 View Public Profile Find all posts by KingK76   (#4) Hilbert Hagedoorn Don Vito Corleone     Videocard: AMD | NVIDIA Processor: Core i7 5960K Mainboard: X99 Memory: 16GB Soundcard: X-Fi - GigaWorks 7.1 PSU: 1200 Watt 03-20-2017, 17:05 | posts: 27,983 | Location: Guru3D testlab Quote: Originally Posted by Agent-A01 4000 single core score for 2300mhz?

Though Intel is definitely nowhere close to being doomed, even if they were, this CPU would not by any stretch of the imagination be their savior. This CPU's existence is for nothing more than bragging rights. Unless they charge less than $5000 for this, it's value will be abysmal. Companies try to cut corners wherever they can, and you can save a lot more money without really losing much performance by taking a different route.

Mesa 17.0.2 Brings Improvements to Radeon RADV and Intel ANV Vulkan Drivers GO The Intel i965 and Nouveau drivers were improved as well Mar 21, 2017 00:17 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Immediately after announcing the last maintenance update to the Mesa 13.0 3D Graphics Library series, Collabora's Emil Velikov published the second point release for the new Mesa 17.0 branch. Mesa 17.0.2 is here only two weeks after the release of the first maintenance update to Mesa 17.0, which is currently the most advanced stable branch of the graphics stack used by default in numerous Linux-based operating systems. According to the changelog, which we've attached at the end of the article for your reading please, Mesa 17.0.2 includes a little over 40 changes improving the Radeon RADV and Intel ANV Vulkan drivers, but also the Nouveau, Radeon and Intel i965 ones. "One dozen fixes in each of the Vulkan drivers ANV and RADV. Misc. Improvements in the i965, Nouveau (nvc0) and Radeon drivers. To top it up we have a build fix for the clover (OpenCL) state-tracker," reads the mailing list announcement. A recommended update for all Linux users The adoption of the Mesa 17.0 3D Graphics Library series among GNU/Linux distributions moves at slow pace these days, but now that the second point release is out, we have all the reasons to believe more distros will adopt it for their users. Mesa 17.0.2 is a recommended update for all Linux users, especially gamers, and it should be soon available for installation from the stable software repositories of your favorite GNU/Linux distribution. The upcoming Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) operating system should also ship with the newest Mesa 17.0 graphics stack, along with the latest maintenance update of the X.Org Server 1.19 display server; all of them contributing to a better gaming experience. With this announcement, we're urging OS vendors to download the Mesa 17.0.2 source tarball from our website, compile and tweak it for their platforms, and distribute it to the official channels for users to be able to update at their earliest convenience.

It does not matter whether they developed and owned the next big thing in technology, or they got the backing of renowned venture capital (VC) funds, or niche sales networks. The majority will inevitably fail, and the lucky few will manage to survive just a little longer. The very small minorities statistically seen as the outliers become so epic that they disrupt and change the world. Bill Gates once mentioned that he was not afraid of large companies coming up with new technologies, but of small entrepreneurs working from their garages trying to cook up disruption after a series of failures. The world has seen those outliers mostly born in Silicon Valley in the U.S. Israel is another tech center that had many failures. But those failures led the very few exceptional startups across the chasm and become disruptive. Yozma Group, an Israeli VC, examines whether startups' founders and their teams had experienced failure before investing in them, Yozma Group Korea CEO Lee Won-jae said. "We look at that as one of the most important key criteria simply because we strongly believe failure breeds success," Lee said in an interview at Yozma office in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province. Yozma's investment strategy has so far worked. More than 80 Israeli startups Yozma's VC funds invested in went public on the NASDAQ in the U.S. This is the second highest after Chinese companies' NASDAQ listing. The country is home to more than 200 research and development (R&D) centers of multinational tech companies including Intel and Google. Israel's history of failure, conflict and risk is what made it a startup nation. Disruptive land Surrounded by Arabic countries and facing persistent conflict with Palestine, most people recognize Israel as a war zone rather than land of entrepreneurs. Many relate Israel to a country that has to endure constant threats from its neighbors; a country with Mossad agents and Special Forces to counter these threats; or the Holy Land depicted in the Bible. About 70 percent of Israel is desert. It had no resources to sustain its economy, other than oil shale it discovered in recent years. In the 1990s in the aftermath of the Gulf War, the Middle East energy crisis and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel's economy was in deep turmoil. It had an extremely high youth unemployment rate and debt. People's anxiety was running high, and confidence was running low. It needed to find a breakthrough. The solution was using its history and culture of risk-taking and countermeasures to embrace innovation and reinvent Israel. Due to continuing regional conflicts, Israel's defense technology is top of the line. It encouraged those who served in the military to start business with its defense technology. "This led to the creation of the world's first car phone by a military officer. Israel's radar-guided missile technology was used in health care for the development of capsules," Lee said. The country's innovative ecosystem quickly expanded with hospitals and universities getting involved to further develop it into a startup nation. Lee noted that it was not easy in the beginning up to the establishment of Yozma Group in 1993. "There were concerns and opposition. People and politicians were saying there is no money to set up a VC fund," Lee said. After much debate, Israel passed a bill to provide 40 percent of Yozma's $265 million fund. The rest came from the U.S. and European VCs. "What was notable then was that the Israeli government said this fund should be managed and operated by the private sector. The state only wanted to get involved to coordinate in case it failed," Lee said. "Yozma would like to bring its experience and share it with Korean startups as the two countries share similarities," he added. Reinventing Korea Like Israel in the 1990s, Korea faces uncertainty as it has a high youth jobless rate and keeps on depending on debt to maintain the economy. Not only is its population aging, but also its industries, some of which are going through restructuring to stay afloat. Also, South Korea constantly finds itself in dispute with China, Japan and North Korea. Lee, who came to Korea three years ago from Israel, said Yozma is set to help Korea reinvent itself with a 50 billion won fund for high-tech startups. It has been busy establishing networks and ecosystems with local universities and state agencies over the past three years. The fund will be launched in May. Its ecosystem will enable potential startups to grow and achieve growth through various stages. For instance, Yozma has a crowd funding platform that will help startups make their business ideas into commercial reality. Its incubation and acceleration programs will provide mentorship in areas such as finance, legal, sales and marketing to systematize their business. Yozma's VC fund will come in the third stage where it will invest in startups to further help them grow in the market. Then, it will invite other VC funds or private equities via Yozma's global networks to invest in those startups. The last stage will enable startups to go public or be sold to multinational companies, which will provide an exit for investors. This may be easier said than done, especially in Korea where there is some animosity toward selling a company to a foreign buyer. This is why Lee said Yozma will only invest in startups that have the potential to grow overseas. "As we look at startups' technology potential and their teams' past failure experience, Yozma will also evaluate whether they have a global business mindset," Lee said. "The days are gone when we used to think that if you succeed here, you can succeed overseas. That aged formula no longer works in the new age because markets and technologies change faster than we know." Taking into account Yozma's history of its investment and exit strategies for Israeli startups, all of its successfully invested companies either went public on the NASDAQ or were sold to global tech heavyweights like Google, Intel, Qualcomm and Cisco. "Israeli startups that were sold to global companies turned into their key R&D centers. That is why there are more than 200 R&D centers there," Lee said, noting that Samsung Electronics has two R&D centers in Israel through mergers and acquisitions. "We are going to help Korean startups go global first, and help them list on the NASDAQ or sell to bigger companies in the long term. We have no interest in companies that only seek to grow, list or sell locally," Lee said. Fashion followers In order to achieve this, Lee said Korean entrepreneurs need to change not only their mindset, but also become what he calls "fast fashion followers." They have to be highly aware of global IT trends, and move fast to immediately adopt them for global ventures, he said. Koreans are fast, they are highly aware of what's hot and what's not and even bring in the newest fashion from Italy and New York much faster than Japan, Lee said. In the tech sector, it is the same. There were Pandora TV, Cyworld and Dialpad in Korea before there were YouTube, Facebook and Skype. But Korean startups lack the capacity to venture and see opportunities first beyond borders as they still adhere to old ways of thinking and doing. Waze and Loc&All are both startups that developed and launched navigation apps around the same time. But Waze was an Israeli startup that was sold to Google for $1.15 billion. Loc&All's Kimgisa, which means "Driver Kim" in Korean, was sold to Kakao for about $55 million. Kakao's acquisition of Loc&All was recognized as one of Korea's biggest startup M&As, but not quite from a global perspective. "The big difference was that Waze focused on the U.S. and European traffic markets from the very beginning, while Loc&All only focused here," Lee said. Should Loc&All's Kimgisa ventured abroad like Waze did, it would have been worth at least $670 million, he noted. High-tech companies Yozma will be eyeing Korean startups in biotechnology, health care, financial technology, cybersecurity and materials. "As said before, we look at their technology potential as one of key criteria for investment. This is because they would have the competitive advantage to venture overseas without facing any intellectual property issues," Lee said. In materials, Yozma is particularly keen on investing in startups applying graphene technology, which scientists say has the potential to revolutionize practically all areas including energy, biotechnology, aviation and automobiles. The Israeli VC fund is set to select about 30 startups via its programs every fiscal quarter. "Yozma has been doing this for more than 20 years. We will use our vast networks and information pool to provide the support needed for startups here to go global like Israelis," Lee said. hyongki@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter [LIVE] Sewol emerges from water after 1073 days Seoul ranks No. 3 among cities with worst air pollution Mobile carriers fined for wooing expats with illegal benefits [LIVE] Sewol seen above water after 1073 days Park could face up to 45 years in prison Park under interrogation over corruption scandal N.

Passengers traveling to the United States from 10 airports in eight Muslim-majority countries will have to check most electronics. The ban will affect flights on Royal Jo On Tuesday morning, the Department of Homeland Security announced new restrictions for personal electronics on direct flights to the U.S. from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Devices larger than a cellphone will not be allowed in the cabin, though they will be allowed in checked baggage. Later Tuesday, the U.K. announced it would be enforcing a similar rule — using a slightly different list of countries. The rule change in both countries was unexpected and the explanations for it cryptic. Here's a quick look at what we know, and what we don't. We know the U.S. restrictions are motivated by concern about terrorism ... The Department of Homeland Security says: "Evaluated intelligence indicates that terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation and are aggressively pursuing innovative methods to undertake their attacks, to include smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items." ... but why now? Is there new intelligence, or new analysis? Is there a specific threat? DHS has been tight-lipped about its motivations for the change. "It simply has to be based on some specific intelligence," security expert Bruce Schneier told NPR by email. "It's too focused on a particular tactic to be anything else." But DHS wouldn't confirm any specific threat or say whether it is drawing on newly discovered intelligence or a new analysis of existing intel; instead, it simply refers to "ongoing," "longstanding" and "continue[d]" threats. Given deep rivalries between Middle Eastern and U.S. carriers, some analysts have implied or outright alleged business interests are at play as well. The DHS restrictions will inconvenience some passengers but not hurt U.S. carriers, since they don't use those airports. That logic doesn't explain the U.K. rule, however, which affects both foreign carriers and British companies, including British Airways and EasyJet. We know the countries affected ... There are 10 specific airports covered by the U.S. policy, located in eight countries: Saudi Arabia Qatar Kuwait United Arab Emirates Turkey Jordan Egypt Morocco Worth noting: This list of majority-Muslim countries has no overlap with the list in President Trump's much-discussed travel ban. The countries affected by the electronics policy are generally wealthier, generally stable and all traditional U.S. allies, NPR's Greg Myre says. The U.K. version of the rule has a different list of countries, which omits Qatar, Kuwait, UAE and Morocco. (It also adds Tunisia and Lebanon, which don't have direct flights to the U.S., according to Skyscanner.) ... but why those countries? The choice of affected flights to the U.S. is based on "evaluated intelligence" that "the threat exists at the 10 last point of departure airports," DHS says. That's why it doesn't cover flights to those countries, or flights from those countries with a connection elsewhere. But, again, officials have offered no details on that intelligence or that "threat," and there's no indication of why the U.K. would have a different list. The focus on individual airports could suggest possible concerns over screening or security procedures — security at the Cairo airport has come under scrutiny before, for instance. But the list also includes the Abu Dhabi airport, which is one of relatively few airports where U.S. Customs officials are stationed abroad to conduct pre-clearance inspections. And DHS, again, offered no details about any such concerns. We know the rule focuses on electronics ... Specifically, devices larger than smartphones — like laptops, tablets, e-readers, cameras, portable DVD players, "electronic game units" and travel printers or scanners. Medical devices will be allowed in cabins, after extra screening. (A quick note: The U.S. rule doesn't specify how big a "smartphone" is. DHS seems to have little patience for the question, saying the size of a smartphone is "well understood by most passengers." The Brits are more helpful, defining a normal-size smartphone as no bigger than 16 cm x 9.3 cm x 1.5 cm [6.3 inches x 3.7 inches x 0.6 inches]) ... but why electronic devices, specifically? You probably remember some previous airport security changes inspired by specific threats. The "shoe bomber" tried to set off a bomb, and passengers had to take off their shoes; authorities uncovered a plot to use liquid explosives, and the TSA banned liquids in carry-ons. It's not clear what may have inspired the change announced Tuesday. The agency does point to two recent attacks on airplanes — but only one involved a laptop packed with explosives. That failed attack, in Somalia, happened more than a year ago at an airport with no flights to the U.S. The other was the deadly downing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt in 2015. ISIS claimed to have carried out that attack with a bomb inside a soda can, which some analysts call plausible. DHS noted the incident in a Q&A Tuesday but didn't suggest consumer electronics were involved. We know the rule puts most electronics in the cargo hold ... Checking the devices means they'll still be on the plane, just in a different location. Of course, this will frustrate some passengers. It's not just a question of having the devices handy for a lengthy flight. There's also the risk of expensive electronics being broken, lost or stolen while out of the passenger's control. ... so what exactly does that achieve? Analysts have a mixed view on what this policy — phones allowed in the cabin, other devices in the hold — would actually do. Nicholas Weaver, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, told The Guardian it was a "weird" way to promote security. "If you assume the attacker is interested in turning a laptop into a bomb, it would work just as well in the cargo hold," he told the British newspaper. "If you're worried about hacking, a cellphone is a computer." Others note that while a bomb in the cargo hold can bring down a plane, it's more challenging. "Forcing it in the plane's hold would make it much harder to detonate, since the terrorist has to design an automatic mechanism rather than doing it manually," Schneier told NPR. "Remember the crude techniques by the shoe and underwear bombers?" And if a bomb does go off, Wired reports that the cargo hold is a safer place — relatively speaking — for that to happen. Alternatively, moving electronics into checked baggage might allow more intense screening of the devices, as The Atlantic notes. At the risk of being repetitive: DHS has offered no details on what its rule is meant to prevent or ensure. And finally, we know the rule is going into effect soon ... DHS says airlines have 96 hours to put it into effect, as of Tuesday's 6 a.m. ET announcement. White House press secretary Sean Spicer, asked for the reason for the delayed implementation, said you need to give airlines an "opportunity to get those procedures in place." "I will tell you that implementing something of this nature in that time frame is pretty darn quick," he said. ... but how long will it be in place? It's not clear. DHS says the limits will be in place "until the threat changes." DHS and TSA "continue to evaluate our aviation security processes and policies," the department says, and "as threats change, so too will TSA's security requirements." Copyright 2017 NPR.

(Published Tuesday, March 21, 2017) A new student-led initiative at the University of Vermont is focusing on improving the well-being of student athletes. The effort, called "Rally Around Mental Health," aims to create an atmosphere where student athletes feel more supported and comfortable seeking help with eating disorders, stress, depression, or other concerns. N. Korea's Latest Missile Test Fails: S. Korea, US "It definitely became an eye-opening experience coming to college and meeting people going through the same things I was," said Kelly Lennon, a swimmer from Methuen, Massachusetts, who says she once struggled with anxiety. While Lennon noted she sought help for her anxiety, and found ways to thrive inside of and out of the pool, she said she worries peers may not be so open. Student Sues Pa. School District Over Transgender-Friendly Policy "People come to me and say, 'I'm struggling with X, Y, and Z,' but they would never go and say that to someone else," Lennon observed. Lennon has helped lead the launch of "Rally Around Mental Health," along with other students, including one of the star basketball players of the UVM Catamounts, Trae Bell-Haynes, a junior from Toronto, Ontario. Banks Nosedive as Trump Health Care Speedbump Tanks Stocks The students said they have heard from other schools, including St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont, that have also recently embraced initiatives to promote mental health among student athletes. The topic is also picking up energy on campuses nationally, student organizers at UVM said. Baby Born With 4 Legs, 2 Spines Survives Risky Surgery "The whole athletic community has been really helpful," Bell-Haynes said of the roll-out at UVM. The basketball player said of course, any student—athlete or not—may experience ups and downs in mental health. But he speculated that sports standouts may be more hesitant to seek help, because of pressure they so often feel to appear successful. Man Breaks Up Fight, Gives Speech to Crowd in Viral Video "When you injure your leg or injure your ankle, you go to the doctor; you check it out," Bell-Haynes said. "We want mental health issues to be looked at in the same way. When something's bothering you, you can talk about it." Annie Valentine, UVM's coordinator of mental health education and outreach, said she believes the initiative will continue to break apart the stigma of mental health challenges. Man Blames Stress for Seizure-Inducing Tweet to Reporter "It starts to shift the culture," Valentine said.

Military Military: The Intel Report: Problems persist at VA crisis line. VA: It's fixed! Bumper stickers in VA San Diego Suicide Prevention Coordinator Dawn Miller's office. Hayne Palmour IV / San Diego Union-Tribune Bumper stickers in a VA San Diego Suicide Prevention Team member's office at the VA San Diego facility in Mission Valley. Bumper stickers in a VA San Diego Suicide Prevention Team member's office at the VA San Diego facility in Mission Valley. (Hayne Palmour IV / San Diego Union-Tribune) Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter A new report by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs found that problems still persist at the agency’s 24-hour crisis line, with the rate of call rollovers to non-VA centers hitting 40 percent in October. The analysis revealed that a national uproar last year over VA crisis calls — such as calls from suicidal people — going to voicemail had not led to significant changes. A VA inspector general report this week said the seven recommendations it made back in February 2016 are “still open,” meaning they haven’t been accomplished. But in a statement released Tuesday afternoon, the VA declared that the rollover problem was fixed. “Our current call roll over rate is less than 1 percent, with over 99 percent of all calls being answered by” VA workers, it said. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day “Suicide prevention is one of our highest priorities,” VA Secretary David Shulkin said. “Fixing the veterans crisis line was a critical step in keeping our commitment to veterans.” There was such furor over the 2016 report that Congress passed the No Veterans Crisis Line Should Go Unanswered Act, which was signed by the president in November. When calls were rolling over to non-VA centers, veterans could wait on hold for a while — the example given was 30 minutes — before the call was answered. The VA has acknowledged that call volume on its national crisis line, which debuted in 2007, has skyrocketed with the agency struggling to keep up. About 500,000 calls now come in per year, plus thousands of text messages and online chat messages. But an effort to expand the New York state-based call operations has been dogged with problems. RELATED: More than 1/3 of VA suicide hotline calls roll over » VA contracted with four backup call centers to handle overflow. But with concerns about call growth and quality control, VA officials formed a plan to open an Atlanta satellite call center staffed by VA workers. The goal: Zero rollover to outside call centers. That plan didn’t go so well. Full operation in Atlanta was supposed to be reached by Dec. 31 of last year. Atlanta started taking calls in October, but missed the December deadline. Frantic training in Atlanta meant that New York workers were off the phones, resulting in more crisis calls rolling over to back-up centers. In October, the rollover rate hit 40 percent. The report doesn’t say whether full operation in Atlanta has been achieved, but VA leaders on Tuesday issued the “fixed” response. The VA inspector general issued 16 more recommendations as a result of the latest report’s findings. Read VA inspector general report » Critics calling for sweeping reforms of the VA said the inspector general report is another sign that the VA’s new leader must take drastic steps. “It’s been over a year since reports emerged that the suicide hotline was ignoring one-third of its incoming calls, yet little has changed," said Dan Caldwell, policy director at Concerned Veterans for America. “We urge Secretary Shulkin to address this report immediately and to continue pushing for strong VA accountability legislation that will allow him to discipline those responsible for the continuing failures at the Veterans Crisis Line.” Caption Investigation uncovers problems with America's fleet of nuclear couriers Office of Secure Transportation big rigs haul nuclear weapons and highly enriched uranium on the nation's highways each day.

Rogers testifying as "witnesses" before the House Intelligence Committee hearing on "Russia's active interference campaign waged against our 2016 presidential election." [1] To say this whole hearing is beyond the pale is an understatement. Unsubstantiated allegations and assertions aplenty. Verifiable, factual evidence? Zero. Here's the tell tale sign of this McCarthyesque hearing as told by Admiral Rogers regarding the intelligence "community's assessment on assessing Russian activities and intentions in the recent U.S. elections". - Advertisement - "We stand by it as issued. There is no change in our confidence level on the assessment. Of course, the specifics of this assessment need to remain classified to protect the sensitive sources and methods...there are some issues I cannot discuss." But here's the kicker, "I want to assure the committee we take very seriously that obligation to protect US persons privacy". No specific "issues can be discussed and besides it's all classified. Basically it's trust us. This from the agency that lies as a given. An agency that has utter contempt for the Constitution its members swore to uphold and in particular the 4th Amendment "against unreasonable searches and seizures." An agency that is conducting unlawful electronic surveillance-thank you Edward Snowden- against everyone in the world-much of data mining without justifiable cause of any illegal acts committed- including everyone in the US and all of it conveniently stored in the $1.5 billion Data Center in Bluffdale, Utah. Well so much for the NSA taking seriously its "obligation to protect US persons privacy". If this is not Orwellian "Doublespeak" I don't know what is. Lies are presented as the truth and the truth-if it's allowed to come out at all-is a lie. "Official" Washington has descended into a political abyss where a maze of unsubstantiated accusations are trumpeted as the facts but can't be disclosed because they're classified. Read the transcript or see the video. It is a sad commentary on where we are in this country. Any country be it Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, actually any country witnessing the travesty of a Committee hearing conducted within the supposed "peoples" Congress should easily recognize the "Doublespeak" of the "witnesses". Only fools would trust "official" Washington after seeing this latest extravaganza. - Advertisement - [1] "FBI and NSA Directors: Russia is Our Adversary", Video and Transcript, "Information Clearing House", March 20, 2017   - Advertisement - 3   2   1   View Ratings | Rate It dglefc22733@aol.com Retired.

Sarah Palin Cries Foul Over James Comey’s Monday Testimony Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LOOK AT ME (Please)! Sarah Palin Cries Foul Over James Comey’s Monday Testimony Posted at 5:00 pm on March 21, 2017 by Susan Wright Share on Facebook Share on Twitter “People who have outlived their relevance” for $200, Alex. Peeling off a string of Trump train rhetoric, former Alaska Governor and 2008 VP nominee, Sarah Palin emerged today to cast aspersions on yesterday’s House Intel Committee hearing. Specifically, she zeroed in on FBI Director James Comey. We knew this was coming. They hated him when he initially dropped the investigation into Hillary’s emails… loved him when he picked it back up (after finding more emails on Anthony Weiner’s laptop)… and now it’s time to hate him, again. Palin is apparently upset over Comey’s testimony, which revealed that the FBI was investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, and was, in fact, investigating any possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia. “The swamp runs deep,” she wrote on Facebook. “Where are congressional ‘investigators’ on this conflict of interest issue?” “Why aren’t dots more clearly connected by those in authority, those privy to information that we peasants are not?” the GOP’s 2008 vice presidential nominee asked. “Why is tainted Comey still part of Team Trump? How long does he get to ride the train?” Was he ever part of “Team Trump”? Trending Freedom Caucus Holds Firm on AHCA: 'Nothing Has Changed.' Andrea Ruth He made a couple of moves that endeared him to Trump’s base during the election, but other moves turned them off. I think, if anything, that shows that he’s only on Team FBI. Further, Comey’s testimony revealed that there is no evidence of Trump Tower having been wiretapped by former President Obama. None of this makes Comey an enemy of Trump. He’s just doing the job he signed up to do. Palin went on to link a series of Breitbart News claims, which placed Comey in perceived alliance with the Clintons. The article cites a September 2016 Breitbart News report titled “Exposed: FBI Director James Comey’s Clinton Foundation Connection.” Breitbart first cited more than $6 million Comey earned in 2010 as the general counsel and vice president for Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin donated to the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative that year, it added. Breitbart next pointed to Comey’s time as a board member, director and Financial System Vulnerabilities Commission member at HSBC Holdings in 2013. The London-based bank and its various philanthropic branches routinely partnered with the Clinton Foundation, it said. The article further links Comey to the Clintons through his brother, Peter, who works for DLA Piper law firm. DLA Piper conducted an independent audit on the Clinton Foundation in November 2016, ipso facto – Director Comey is protecting the Clintons by testifying that no one wiretapped Trump Tower. Obviously. And as for the investigation into possible collusion? That’s all political. UGH. It’s tiring. Were Palin ever anything other than a crass opportunist, she would want the truth, no matter what side it came from, and she’d find more reliable sources than Breitbart News.     Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Tags: Clinton Foundation James Comey Sarah Palin Recent Stories ‘There Is No Plan B’: The House Votes Today on AHCA Caleb Howe 4 Reasons Devin Nunes’s Stunt Created More of A Mess Jay Caruso Pastor Tim Keller Too Conservative for Religious Award, Princeton Rescinds Kira Davis COMMENTS POSTING RULES  |  LOGIN TO COMMENT  |  REGISTER TODAY Trending 4 Reasons Devin Nunes's Stunt Created More of A Mess City of Boston and Hospital Violated Teen Girl's Human Rights, Hacker Who Fought for Her Faces 25 Years in Prison 'There Is No Plan B': The House Votes Today on AHCA Pastor Tim Keller Too Conservative for Religious Award, Princeton Rescinds CNN: Trump Folks May Have Possibly Coordinated with Russia, Sources Might Say.

This article will appear in the Spring 2017 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Five to ten years from now, Uber hopes, the following will be an everyday occurrence: A driverless Uber car pulls up at Nick and Nicole Smith’s house at 7:30 in the morning. Their two kids, Julia, 16, and Joey, 14, hop into the car, and it then drops them off at school. The Uber car returns to the Smiths’ suburban home, picks up Nick and Nicole, and drops Nicole at the train station to catch the 7:55 into the city. The car then drives 40 minutes to drop off Nick at his company’s headquarters nestled in an office park. During the drive, Nick uses his laptop to answer emails and finish a PowerPoint. At 5:00 that afternoon, a driverless Uber car picks up Julia from field hockey practice and Joey from baseball practice and takes them home. Meanwhile, Uber has sent another car to pick up Dad at the office park at 5:30, and that car makes it to the train station in time to pick up Nicole, who’s due on the 6:15. The car then stops at a Chinese restaurant so the Smiths can pick up a takeout dinner. It waits while Nick runs in to get the food, and it then drops off the Smiths at home. Welcome to the brave new world of driverless cars and trucks. In this not-too-distant future, many Americans are likely to conclude that they no longer need—or want—to own a car. No more worrying about tune-ups or getting gas or shopping for auto insurance or renewing registrations. Uber’s controversial co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, is very high on driverless technology, saying, “When there’s no other dude [i.e a driver] in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” And Uber is far from the only player. Ford Motor and BMW say they’ll have driverless cars on the road within five years. General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft (obtaining a 10 percent stake) to help it develop driverless cars. Tesla, Volvo, Daimler, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Google, and Apple have also joined the race. And now mighty Intel, eager to get into a new, fast-growing sector, jumped into the fray in March by announcing a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye, an Israeli company that is a leader in making sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles. Depending on how things shake out, Ford or Fiat Chrysler may own and manage self-driving fleets that compete head to head with Uber. Tony Avelar/AP Images Otto-mated: One of Otto’s self-driving, big-rig trucks leaves the garage for a test drive during a demonstration at the Otto headquarters on August 18, 2016, in San Francisco. The coming of driverless cars and trucks raises several big questions. How long will the transition to these vehicles take? What will be the benefits and the costs to society? Who will be the winners and who the losers (and it seems clear that many of the five million people who work as drivers will be losers)? And what role should the government play in managing and regulating the arrival of this new technology, or should all this be left to the free market to sort out? Also, what role should government take to help the millions of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and others who might lose their jobs, or should these displaced workers be left to fend for themselves? Should society require the winners from this new technology—most likely some giant corporations and the consuming public—to somehow share their gains with the losers, perhaps through some special levy on these new vehicles to finance programs to help the losers? The shift to driverless cars and trucks will be one of the most important new technologies since the horseless carriage replaced buggies. Yet the advent of self-driving vehicles will be different from the arrival of many previous technologies. Because we can see this technology coming years ahead of its arrival, we as a nation are in a position to take some smart policy steps to prepare and help the many people who will lose their jobs as a result of this new technology. But given America’s dismal history with easing economic transitions, such smart steps may not be taken, despite years of advance warning. Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers. Beyond that, driverless cars could mean an end to many gas stations, auto repair shops, car washes, auto dealers, commercial parking lots, and car rental agencies, not to mention traditional auto insurance. Moreover, because this new technology will lead to a more efficient use of cars, the nation could well need fewer autos—and that could reduce overall car production. These cars will benefit the public in ways that many people don’t yet appreciate. “Most of us in the U.S. commute all alone in a single car—the average American driver spends 51 minutes to and from work every day,” says Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. “This is wasted time and wasted productivity. Driverless cars would be a big win for productivity. You can spend 45 minutes doing something productive, including taking a nap.” Rajkumar also sees a sharp drop in auto accidents. “About 1.3 million people die every year worldwide from auto accidents,” he says. “In the U.S., it’s about 38,000. Most of these accidents are caused by human error. Most of these lives would be saved with driverless technology.” Rajkumar adds that autonomous cars would be a godsend for blind, disabled, and elderly Americans who can’t drive. “These people would gain mobility,” he says. “It would greatly help the 1.5 million legally blind Americans and the more than five million disabled people who can’t drive.” Autonomous cars will make it far easier and, in theory, cheaper for many disabled people to get to work. And they will make it easier for many elderly and disabled people to go to movies or parks or shopping, and for the elderly to see their grandchildren and care for them after school. LAWRENCE KATZ, A LABOR ECONOMIST at Harvard, says there’s no denying that this radical new technology will imperil many jobs. The five million drivers who could lose their jobs, he says, represent almost 3 percent of the workforce and don’t, as a group, have bright prospects if they get laid off. “It’s disproportionately male, disproportionately non-college,” he says. Five million jobs, he explains, “is about the same size as the decline in manufacturing jobs since 2000. It’s a comparable potential shock.” The move to self-driving cars will of course produce some new jobs—in engineering, software, and marketing. But displaced former drivers generally won’t qualify for these white-collar jobs. Instead, they could find themselves with lower-paying jobs at Walmart or Target, or they could be trained for something better. According to Katz, there are two big reasons that the economic pain from losing five million driving jobs will be less than from losing five million factory jobs. First, drivers’ jobs are spread fairly evenly across the United States, while manufacturing jobs were concentrated in one devastated region, the Midwest. The more-even geographic distribution should make it easier for laid-off drivers to find jobs. Second, Katz noted, because factory workers average around $20 an hour, while drivers average $13, laid-off drivers would take less of a hit than factory workers if forced to take $10-an-hour jobs at Walmart. Still, Katz added, “This will be a shock to the labor market for non-college men. They’re already in tough shape.” Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which has 19,000 taxi, Uber, and Lyft drivers as members, shares these concerns. “Our people see this as a threat, and we know it’s closer than we realize,” she says. “These are workers on the margins, with language issues and low wages. Drivers are an older workforce. It’s people who are mainly in their forties and fifties and older. It’s going to be really hard to relocate these people within the economy.” “It’s going to be very disruptive,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. “It’s going to happen faster than a lot of people realize.” How fast will it happen? Some companies, like Uber and Ford, see driverless cars becoming popular within five years, while some skeptical experts say it will take 20 or 30 years not just to develop a truly safe self-driving technology, but also to get needed government permissions, and to overcome public anxiety that could morph into public resistance. Official Leweb Photos/Creative Commons Uber’s Travis Kalanick speaking in London.  Moody’s Investors Service predicts that self-driving technology will not become a common option in conventional vehicles until 2030, and not become standard in all vehicles until 2035. Moody’s further predicts that not until 2045 will a majority of vehicles be driverless and that by 2055, they will become nearly universal. Uber and Google have prototypes on the road now. It’s one thing, though, to have a few dozen or hundred closely supervised experimental vehicles on the road, but a very different thing to have several million self-driving cars on streets and highways across America. Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm, predicted that such cars would become mainstream across America in four to ten years. But Joan Claybrook, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says it could take 10, 20, even 30 years of tinkering with and improving self-driving technology until it is truly safer than human drivers. In terms of its impact on the job market, “a huge amount depends upon the rate of change,” says David Autor, an MIT economics professor. “If this is gradual, it’s not a big deal,” he adds, explaining that if this happens over 15 or 20 years, many drivers should have time to retrain and the economy should be able to absorb them without major problems. “But if this happens overnight, it’s a very big deal.” FOR THE MOMENT, THIS technology still faces sizable hurdles. It doesn’t work when snow covers lane markers, and there’s considerable worry about what happens if the internet system controlling these cars suddenly crashes. Government approvals could be delayed for years if there are more fatalities like that of the Tesla test driver who died in May 2016 when a truck cut in front of his self-driving vehicle. To help make sure that driverless vehicles are safe, huge infrastructure spending will be needed, such as installing road signs that communicate with these vehicles and upgrading GPS systems so they are accurate to within a few inches to help self-driving cars stay in their lanes. The huge outlays needed to finance these infrastructure improvements raise concerns about cost and about fairness. Supporters of driverless cars argue that such cars will help consumers—affluent and non-affluent—because they will in theory be cheaper than using today’s taxis. In some ways, however, the public investment needed to make a nationwide system of driverless cars possible will be a subsidy for affluent families like the Smiths who will be able to afford to use them far more than poorer families. The billions that government spends on infrastructure to make driverless vehicles safe and reliable could crowd out spending for mass transit, hurting less-affluent families who rely on subways, trains, and buses. Many technology experts say major infrastructure improvements will be needed to ensure that driverless cars are safe. The electronic equipment—sensors, cameras, radar, lasers—that keeps self-driving cars from hitting other cars relies on lane markings to operate, but when there is fog or when snow covers lanes or when there is blinding glare from the sun, those sensors often can’t function. To remedy this problem, there is a push to develop a far more accurate GPS system that can locate vehicles to within four inches—helping keep them in lanes. This upgraded GPS will likely need an expensive, elaborate, and frequently updated mapping of the terrain. As a further step to ensure safety and guide these cars, industry experts are calling for a new generation of road signs and traffic lights that contain elaborate electronics to communicate with driverless cars—perhaps telling them exactly where the next exit is or warning of construction ahead or an upcoming lane merger. These infrastructure improvements will be expensive, and one can be sure that the industries rushing to introduce driverless cars will want the government to pay. In the past, the government has paid for GPS satellites and highway signs. Another infrastructure requirement: The millions of autonomous cars that will eventually be on the road will need to communicate with the cloud, and that will mean significantly expanding the capacities of the cloud. This cost is likely to be borne by companies like Uber, Google, and Ford, and not by taxpayers. Several Seconds/Creative Commons Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers.  Brauer of Kelley Blue Book has other, nagging fears, among them that computer hackers might sabotage a car’s computer controls. For example, hackers might direct 20 driverless cars on a bridge to suddenly turn right, and they then disastrously plunge off the bridge. Or there might be an unexpected technical glitch that causes five cars to blow through an intersection and take out a group of pedestrians. Such a serious glitch or hacking incident could traumatize the public and cause regulators to delay for years giving needed government permissions. Brauer sees another obstacle to rolling out this new technology. “A lot of people won’t buy into it on a philosophy and on a trust level,” he says. That creates another challenge—many traditionalists may shun driverless cars and keep on driving their own cars. That could mean big problems meshing the supposedly safer driverless technology with cars driven by often-flawed human beings, some of whom will inevitably drive drunk or carelessly change lanes and crash into a self-driving car in their blind spot. There is also the big issue of how driverless cars should be regulated. Autonomous cars present an auto-safety issue far more momentous than the battles over airbags or cameras for when one drives in reverse. But in the face of industry eagerness and rapidly changing technology, the Obama administration punted. Without much public debate, the administration gave a fairly bright green light to driverless cars in September 2016, when the Department of Transportation issued guidelines permitting self-driving cars. These guidelines call for driverless cars to meet 15 safety standards and called for the 50 states to develop uniform regulations for these cars. There was no notice of rulemaking, and no formal set of rules. Under these guidelines, Uber, Google, Ford, and other companies could move ahead in introducing driverless cars onto the roads, without any further federal authorization needed—although the government emphasized that it would look over the companies’ shoulder and intervene if it saw safety problems with this radical new technology. In the event of safety problems arising, the government reserved the right to step in and set standards for some technologies, like electronic sensors, that autonomous cars rely on. Perhaps predictably, some auto industry executives protested that these guidelines were too strict because they raised the possibility that the government would delay or block some new self-driving technologies if it saw safety problems. Currently, the auto industry self-regulates in introducing new technologies, like automatic braking, under the belief that automakers—not wanting to hurt their image or sales—wouldn’t add a new technology unless they were convinced it was safe. But in light of the industry’s checkered history on safety, some skeptics are calling for greater regulation of self-driving vehicles. In Claybrook’s view, the Obama administration was far too hasty. “There will be some good actors and some bad actors,” she says. “The question is whether the public can rely on anything.” States have asserted some regulatory authority, but that is largely being preempted by Washington. The states will continue to be responsible for inspecting cars and licensing drivers and insurance. “The way it’s going to work,” Claybrook says, “if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does nothing more, the industry can do whatever it wants on driverless cars. The federal government will have opted out.” And of course the Trump administration is even less likely to intervene. TRUCKING PRESENTS A paradoxical variation on the theme. Last summer, Michael Belzer, a professor at Wayne State University and one of the nation’s leading academic authorities on the trucking industry, was predicting that self-driving trucks wouldn’t arrive for 20 years. He said in an interview back then, “The technology is just not there.” But now Belzer says self-driving trucks might arrive in ten years, perhaps sooner. This past October, Uber’s Otto subsidiary caused Belzer to shorten his timeframe when an Otto self-driving truck equipped with $30,000 in software and hardware hauled 50,000 cans of Budweiser from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs. With a human driver sitting in the cab as a backup, the truck drove 120 miles on I-25, although the human did get the truck onto the interstate and took over again before the truck exited back onto city streets. Some experts predict that self-driving trucks will become widespread before self-driving cars do, because trucking companies are so eager to cut costs and have these expensive vehicles run nearly around the clock. “The trucking industry has a huge interest in not having to pay for drivers,” Claybrook tells me. For some long-distance trucking trips, companies may cut back from two drivers in the cab to one, and there’s talk of having convoys with two or three trucks, with a driver in the front truck, and one or two autonomous trucks following right behind. “One of the big questions should be what’s going to happen to this workforce,” Belzer adds. “A lot of these drivers voted for Trump. What’s going to happen to them? Our tradition in the United States is to hell with these workers and dump them. We get rid of that work, get rid of those jobs, and you, the worker, figure out what to do.” For now at least, officials with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters aren’t voicing much alarm about the possibility of truck drivers losing jobs. The reason: Teamster officials assert that self-driving trucks will continue to need a driver to help out in case of emergencies, to handle paperwork, to assure the safety of the cargo, to pull a truck into a warehouse. An analogy is aircraft. Planes have had autopilots for generations. Today, aircraft can virtually fly themselves—and do so in bad weather. But despite futuristic projections of pilotless planes, no serious person is pushing to have commercial jetliners without human crews capable of taking the controls. Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson, says, “We don’t see anything indicating that these vehicles will be able to function in real-life conditions, go long distances, especially through a city environment, without a human being. You hear these doomsday scenarios about jobs, but there are so many questions that still need to be addressed, like not knowing the reliability and safety, and then there are hacking issues.” Sam Loesche, a Teamsters lobbyist, adds, “We have not seen a situation where any responsible operator would agree that there’s a role for this technology without an operator in the cab. Our view is [that] the best piece of safety technology is the driver.” While insisting that drivers will continue to be needed, Loesche switches gears and says that in any conversation about self-driving vehicles, “workers’ jobs need to be a top issue.” He adds, “You can’t have the number of job losses you did in other industries and not see a role for policymakers and the government.” The main industry group, the American Trucking Associations, shares some of the Teamsters’ views. Pointing to issues like hazardous cargo, driving in cities, and interacting with warehouses and stores receiving merchandise, Chris Spear, the association’s president, told a federal transportation panel in January that ATA believes drivers “will retain an important role in trucking for the foreseeable future, even with automated trucks, just as pilots are still present in airline cockpits.” State Department/Public Domain Google Co-Founder Sergey Brin shows then-Secretary of State John Kerry the sensor displays inside one of Google’s self-driving cars in Palo Alto, California.  Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, has a surprisingly optimistic—though somewhat self-contradicting—take on what driverless technology will mean for jobs. He says that in years to come, Uber will offer a mix of rides, some provided by drivers, some by self-driving cars. Kalanick foresees skyrocketing demand for improved transportation and says this would mean a continued need for drivers—for instance, to help many disabled or elderly passengers in and out of vehicles. “Many people predicted that the ATM would spell doom for bank tellers,” Kalanick says. “In fact, ATMs cut the cost of running a local bank so more branches opened, employing more people.” Kalanick adds, “Self-driving Ubers, for example, will be on the road 24 hours a day, which means they’ll need a lot more human maintenance than cars today.” NUMEROUS CORPORATIONS stand to make a fortune from this new technology, and many consumers will benefit, too. “Well-funded companies see a lot of potential revenues at the end of this rainbow, and they all want to get there first,” says Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. “There’s lots of money to be made producing the cars, controlling them, managing their data systems, and collecting information about passengers. Companies will know when he’s going, where he’s going, what he’s doing. Talk about opportunities for targeted advertising.” Once autonomous cars become popular, Brauer adds, “there will be an explosion of new business models with billions of dollars up for grabs.” With driverless cars, Uber and Lyft won’t have hard-working drivers keeping 60 percent to 80 percent of the fares. Instead, Uber and Lyft will keep the lion’s share of fares, although some might go to taxes and fees and some might go to Google or whichever company runs the driverless cars’ data systems. “Their business model would go from having huge profit potential to having massive profit potential,” Brauer says. “The fight over whether the drivers are independent contractors or employees and the related litigation, all that goes away. It becomes an extremely desirable business model.” In their book, Driverless: Intelligent Cars and the Road Ahead, Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman point to another problematic effect of driverless cars—companies and their shareholders will grow richer as drivers grow poorer. “As machines take away human jobs,” they write, “one potentially devastating effect will be to further exacerbate the trend toward inequality, a growing global problem.” AP Photo/Jared Wickerham Pit Stop: Uber testing driverless cars on Pittsburgh streets, 2016.  MIT’s Brynjolfsson argues that we as a nation should make sure we find a way to share this prosperity and progress with the displaced drivers. The most important step, he said, will be to provide first-class retraining for them. Many economists say bigger and better retraining programs will be the key, even though the nation’s retraining programs have a less-than-stellar history because they often train unemployed workers for fields where there aren’t enough job openings. Help for laid-off drivers can take many other forms, perhaps including something akin to the trade adjustment assistance received by factory workers who lose their jobs to imports. A beefed-up version would be desirable, because trade adjustment assistance has often been underfunded and has not done enough to support and retrain laid-off workers. Harvard’s Lawrence Katz offers several other suggestions: wage subsidies, an increased earned income tax credit, and, if need be, a government-backed public jobs program. (That last idea is anathema to conservatives.) A big question is where we, in tax-averse America, would find the money to finance programs to assist displaced drivers. One option would be to impose a tax on self-driving vehicles—perhaps a tax on every mile traveled. At some point, Congress could step in and tell the many corporations eager to introduce—and cash in on—this technology that it will agree to a nationwide green light for all 50 states on one condition: that it enacts a law creating a special per-mile tax to finance programs that aid and retrain displaced drivers. “Even though this may not lead to mass dislocation,” Autor says, “it may further constrict the set of opportunities for people who don’t have specialized skills. Not to say that driving doesn’t require specialized skills, but it’s not up there with engineers or computer programmers.” Autor sees demand for skilled construction workers, skilled medical technicians, and skilled repairmen as opportunities for displaced drivers. As for those who do not retrain and develop special skills, Autor says, they might have to turn to lower-paying jobs as home health aides, security guards, or food service or cleaning workers. Brynjolfsson believes laid-off drivers should be retrained for many “different kinds of jobs and industries.” Many could be trained for sales or marketing jobs, he says, adding that there are huge unmet needs, in particular, in health care and other nurturing and caring jobs. But, he acknowledges, “a lot of truck drivers aren’t going to find much of this appealing. It will be a rough transition.” America’s retraining programs have often fallen short because they failed to place workers in jobs after months or years of retraining—often because the programs ignored whether there were opportunities in the fields for which laid-off workers were being trained. While education—whether obtaining vocational training or associate’s or bachelor’s degrees—would of course help laid-off drivers, it could prove frustrating if there aren’t enough jobs out there. An ambitious program to address the nation’s urgent infrastructure problems is badly needed, and that could create a million or more construction jobs, as well as long-term jobs maintaining and operating all manner of “smart” infrastructure systems, not to mention the newfangled auto repair stations and parking lots that will be needed for company-owned fleets of driverless cars. The nation’s renewed focus on preserving and creating factory jobs could also provide valuable opportunities for laid-off drivers. And it is of course important to strive for a full-employment, higher-wage economy that offers job opportunities not just for laid-off drivers, but for everyone. This is a long-term planning challenge that goes well beyond the question of how to re-employ the upcoming wave of displaced drivers. No one should expect a seamless transition for the many drivers whose jobs get run over by driverless technology. That’s where wage subsidies, earned income tax credits, extended unemployment insurance, and some form of adjustment assistance might come into play. Some advocates argue that universal basic income would be an ideal program for drivers thrown out of work and having a hellish time finding another job. But most drivers are eager to work and probably won’t want to just get by on a modest UBI. The development of driverless cars is a perfect opportunity for some smart public policy. We as a nation have years to plan, and there will be a rich revenue stream to draw from. Let’s hope that we, the world’s richest nation, adopt some smart, foresighted policies so that millions of drivers don’t get banged up in a head-on collision when this radical new technology takes the road.     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on March 22, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: March 22, 2017 @ 9:58 am Filed Under: 24/7 OSI, Americas, Economics, Energy, English, Environment, Intelligence, Internet Communications Technology, MIL OSI, Open Source Intel, Security, United States Government, United States of America, US Amalgamated Transit Union, US Unions NEXT ARTICLE → S. 576, Follow the Rules Act ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Intelligence and Security Bill passes third reading About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts ‘Öfisi ‘Omipatimení ko e Me’afua ki he Fakahoko Fatongia ‘a e Ngaahi Potungāue mo e Ngaahi Kautaha ‘a e Pule’angá New Zealand Employment: NZ’s investment in infrastructure creating jobs New Zealand Sport: Rugby League World Cup 2017 ANNOUNCE WOLF BLASS AS OFFICIAL WINE PARTNER Freshwater focus for World Water Day $400m Huawei investment will promote innovation and create opportunities © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

The games, viewable using the Oculus NCAA March Madness Live VR app for Samsung’s Gear VR, won’t be free. For $2.99 per game, or $7.99 for all six games, fans will receive a courtside view from several virtual reality cameras, with a special broadcast from play-by-play announcer Spero Dedes, analyst Steve Smith and sideline reporter Lisa Byington. For $1.99 per game, fans will receive the view from one courtside VR camera, with audio from the CBS broadcast with Jim Nantz, Grant Hill, Bill Rafferty and Tracy Wolfson. This year’s VR broadcasts start late, with the NCAA men’s tournament already in its semifinal rounds. The VR broadcasts start with Thursday’s West region games in San Jose, but don’t include games played in the three other regions. Finishing touches are happening at the SAP Center, as NCAA March Madness rolls into town. Tens of thousands of college basketball fans are making their way to San Jose this week. San Jose is one of four cities selected to host games at this regional Media: KTVU However, the networks, Intel and the NCAA have signed a multiyear partnership to use Intel’s True VR technology, the renamed live-action VR technology the chipmaker acquired in November when it bought Santa Clara startup Voke VR.

(AP Photo/Toby Talbot) Companies promise Trump a fight over his plan to scrap energy-efficiency program By John Siciliano • 3/21/17 3:20 PM John Siciliano Energy and Environment Correspondent The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/headshot-johnsiciliano.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More Proponents of the federal Energy Star program for energy efficient appliances are promising President Trump a fight if he maintains his deep cuts to the program in his final budget in May. "This is a destructive proposal that walks away from decades of bipartisan support for energy efficiency going back to the Reagan administration and beyond," said Kateri Callahan, the president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a group that advocates for policies to boost efficiency. "We oppose these cuts in the strongest possible terms and will do everything we can to fight them in Congress."Callahan organized a letter that was sent to lawmakers on Monday, asking them to stand against the Trump proposal that was outlined in the March 16 release of the budget blueprint. Trump's budget proposal would scrap the Energy Star program altogether, which is managed by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department. The letter included big names in energy efficiency and developing smart appliances, including 3M, Johnson Controls, Philips Lighting and Intel. It also included environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council."This voluntary partnership program ... helps businesses, state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, homeowners, and consumers save money by investing in energy efficiency," says the letter, sent to lawmakers in charge of appropriations. The proponents say the program has saved Americans $430 billion since it was created 25 years ago, while having an operating budget of $50 million per year. The letter follows a campaign started on Twitter Monday in opposition to Trump's proposed cuts to Energy Star, setting up the issue to be a major sticking point for Trump over the next several months as he makes his case before Congress to approve his cuts. The letter came as Energy Secretary Rick Perry continued Trump's regulatory freeze for a number of regulations meant to improve the efficiency of appliances through the summer and fall. House Democrats lashed out at Perry's continued freeze on Tuesday as violating rules governing how regulations are promulgated and finalized into law. In a letter, the group of lawmakers led by the top Democrat on the energy committee, Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, pressed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Michael Mulvaney not to approve the continued regulatory freeze. Nevertheless, an official with one of the largest industry trade groups for heating and refrigeration technologies, the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, praised the extension. "While AHRI supports the process used by the Department of Energy to update rules on the test procedure for walk-in coolers/freezers and residential central air conditioners, today's announcement of a delay in the enforcement date will give our member companies additional time to ensure a seamless implementation of the new test procedures for the benefit of their customers," said Stephen Yurek, president and CEO of the group. Sixty members of the Yurek's group, from Carrier to smaller mom and pop companies, plan to descend on Capitol Hill Wednesday as part of the group's annual National Advocacy Conference. One of the big issues will be maintaining support for last year's climate deal in Kigali, Rwanda, establishing a global phaseout of refrigerant chemicals identified as key contributors to global warming. "They will be tackling a number of key issues to manufacturers including [Energy Department] regulatory reform, tax reform and the new [refrigerant] limitations to the Montreal Protocol agreed to in Kigali late last year," the group said Tuesday.

Print Story X Print Story Business March 18, 2017 Share Advertisement Intel deal may fuel Israel’s rise as builder of car brains Jerusalem: Intel´s $15-billion purchase of Israeli firm Mobileye could help fuel the country´s rise in the driverless car industry -- not as a builder of vehicles, but as the brains behind them. Monday´s deal, the largest ever in Israel´s tech sector, could help boost trade despite the fact no commercial cars are assembled in the country. The self-styled "startup nation" has no real tradition of auto manufacturing: an ignoble previous stint in the 1960s and 70s produced the fibreglass Sussita car, parts of which, according to legend, were edible for camels. But the rise of new technology including driverless cars has opened space for the tech-savvy country to excel. In 2013, Google paid more than $1 billion (900 million euros) for Waze, an Israeli crowd-sourced app that plots the quickest journeys in real time, followed by Monday´s $15 billion Mobileye deal. The company makes advanced driver assistance and accident avoidance systems for car manufacturers, and has already collaborated with Intel and BMW on self-driving car technology. It was founded in 1999 but Yossi Vardi -- considered one of the fathers of Israel´s high-tech startup scene -- said the automobile industry´s growth in Israel really began in 2007 when General Motors established a research and development centre. "It surprised everybody that a company like General Motors would go to Israel to source innovation and technology." In the last three years, Vardi said, Honda, Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo and others have followed suit. Most Israeli companies in the field don´t involve production, but ways to make driving more efficient. Among them are Otonomo, which provides in-depth data on car usage; Argus, one of the market leaders in protecting cars from cyber hacking; and VocalZoom, dubbed "Siri for cars." Elan Zivotofsky, general partner at the OurCrowd equity platform that invests in a number of companies working on autonomous cars, compared it to smartphones, laptops and other sectors where Israeli technology is heavily used but the final products are still made elsewhere. "Israel is not going to be in the business of building cars," he said. "Israel is in the business of building some of the most important core elements that will enable autonomous driving." Vardi said the country´s military experience, with some of the world´s most advanced monitoring, laser-guiding and other technologies, place it in a good position. "When you drive a car, you cannot stop the car and wait 15 minutes for the computer to process. It has to be immediate," Vardi said. "This kind of talent you find in the military -- in airplanes etc." The impact of Mobileye could be significant, said Yaniv Feldman, editor-in-chief of the Israeli Geektime tech blog. There are dozens of companies in the sector and Feldman reckons Israel is already one of the leading players in autonomous driving behind the United States and China. In 2016, around $70 million was invested in automotive tech in Israel, he said, but that will increase by "somewhere between 25 to 40 percent." "We will probably start seeing much more activity in the space and investor interest rising," he told AFP. None of the other companies were as advanced as Mobileye, though, he added. Aquarius Engines, an Israeli firm that claims to have developed a radically improved combustion engine, is currently seeking $10 million in a second round of funding. Chairman Gal Fridman said they had already noticed a change. "Since Mobileye happened, our phone is ringing all the time," he told AFP. "Until now, when I came and told (car companies) I was an Israeli developing an engine, it was a bit odd as the country has no history of automobiles," he said. "Now, after Waze and Mobileye, we have more credibility, I think, and doors will open easier."   Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory Attack outside UK parliament; Muslim accused Extension of military courts by Senate deferred Chaos as laptop ban set to start on security pretext Major, sepoy martyred in Orakzai clash SECP considers shifting client’s assets’ custody away from stockbrokers View more... see all opinions Opinion Kamila Hyat A fear of numbers Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif When the past is the future Adnan Adil The PPP in Punjab Ayaz Ahmed Daesh’s battle for Afghanistan Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay Fringe is the mainstream Eric Williams E-waste see all opinions Newspost Do no harm Royal rumble Housing societies Shuttle bus Water Day View more... see all opinions Editorial The courts come back The IJT all over View more... see all opinions National Terror outfits continue to generate billions SC still not satisfied with credentials of NAB employees India denies report on Miyar power project Reko Diq project: Balochistan likely to pay $350m in out-of-court settlement China greets Mamnoon, Nawaz on National Day View more... see all opinions World Migrant, refugee children live in ‘abysmal conditions’ Drug war reports hurting tourism, says Manila Water carriers in Madagascar bear brunt of global crisis Nine US deaths linked to breast implant-associated cancer Lithuanian MP faces impeachment for ties to Russian spy View more... see all opinions Sports Pakistan beat New Zealand to go 2-1 up in series Call for calm as India tour ‘toxicity’ grows Ex-WWE wrestlers to brawl in Pakistan as security improves The runs will come, says Warner Gambhir praises Australia for proving critics wrong View more... see all opinions Business Property valuation tables to be renewed in Sindh ‘Risk-sharing Islamic finance attracts global attention’ Sindh governor calls for change in tax culture Yields of long-term Pakistan Investment bonds remain flat Kenya’s DTB to digest Habib Bank deal before further M&A View more... see all opinions Karachi Murad calls for uncontroversial census Another MQM MPA defects to PSP SHC seeks report from transport secretary, DIG traffic on movement of heavy vehicles Two Chinese nationals sent on judicial remand: Man jumps to death after mistaking census staff as loan recovery team View more... see all opinions Lahore Pakistan not established for loot, plunder: CM Officials accused of torturing man to death Moot concludes with focus on human organ transplant SC denies bail to fraud accused Illegal structures demolished View more... see all opinions Islamabad Miserable water situation perturbs residents of D-12 CDA orders probe into water theft from Simly Dam Kazmi freed from Adiala Jail Happy Pakistan Day!

And with the pace of innovation picking up, disruption in mobility seems to be just around the corner. But the implications of driverless cars go far beyond car designs and transportation. This is why companies such as Intel, Qualcomm, Nvidia and ARM feel the computing device of the next decade – akin to the position the smartphone holds today — could well be the connected car. Look at Samsung’s acquisition of Harman International Industries — the company is betting on transformative opportunities in the car. Last fortnight in these columns we had briefly outlined how driverless cars will impact not just the automobile manufacturing industry, but also city infrastructure, energy, geopolitics, economies, our future habits and the society at large. Let us now look at these implications in detail. The first layer of change lies in the approach to car design itself. With vehicles becoming sensory and perceptive, the way we test tyres, brakes or any other auto part will radically change. Cars will transform their driving behaviours in response to road conditions in real time to minimise wear and tear to auto parts. Moreover, driverless cars will open themselves up for new forms of innovation around services delivered to car users who no longer drive. These services may include entertainment or productive work within the vehicle. That, in turn, will create a new ecosystem of service providers focused on the in-car experience. So while automakers focus their attention on making the car a perfect machine, every other activity within the car — whether it is entertainment or office work - could be handled by partners, who build innovations on top of the car platform.Layers of change We are also staring at a future where the entire ecosystem around the automobile industry — maintenance and repairs, dealers, accessories, insurance — could see a radical shift. As cars becomes more sensory, they will need lower maintenance, and insurance as we know it today may cease to exist altogether. Ownership patterns will also change. Some of the models of a driverless economy proposed include those where the ownership of the vehicle is with the government. If that happens, the car financing industry could collapse as well. Car sales may move from pushing individual units catering to consumer choice, to sales of entire fleets. Road infrastructure is another layer that will get impacted, as everything from laning to traffic lights will need to be re-imagined. Driverless cars will increase greater capacity utilisation per car which is at an abysmal 4 per cent today. Higher capacity utilisation combined with lower ownership will lead to fewer cars on the road. This will allow city planners to focus on creating sidewalks as activities like biking and walking become more accessible. At a city level, we won’t need big parking lots or wider roads as idling cars would not be seen. Important roads may start getting privatised, especially if micropayment can be implemented to tax actual road usage by driverless cars. Already a lot of thinking has begun on future roads. With fewer vehicles plying, roads will wear out much more slowly. There could even be roads made of material that are power generating, either solar or through vehicle kinetic energy as the fuel of the future will likely be electric. Power shift This leads us to a higher order shift in the works. We are already seeing a gradual shift to electric power and its impact on businesses. In the future we could see the creation of energy networks that distribute solar energy harvested by small businesses. Companies that enable harvesting of natural energy sources like wind and solar, and that allow storage of this energy in high performance batteries, will fuel the coming economy. And as the world shifts from oil to electricity, new geopolitical manoeuvres will begin. North Asia, where electric power grid interconnection schemes have gained traction and key players have successfully invested in battery technology, may become a dominant force with Korea, Japan and China emerging as power generating centres. Adjacent industries will change as well. But the shift will be most perceptible in logistics and shipping. As driverless trucks gather speed, and as factories as well as cargo loading and unloading get increasingly automated, supply chains will get efficient and automated. Last mile pick up and drops could be managed through drones. There won’t be excess capacity or shortages as automated commercial fleets will run on a programmed rhythm. At the societal level, there will be big impact on jobs. The nature of jobs will change. At the white collar level, we are already seeing shifts in IT jobs where focus on automation is leading to new skill requirement and rapid redundancies. At the blue collar level, truck drivers, who number millions will get heavily affected. Within cities, autonomous cars could change the whole crime and surveillance game as well. Driverless cars which keep transmitting information could be used to keep an eye on cities, and crime may well reduce in this high surveillance world. But with reduced crime will also come the liability of increased privacy invasion. As with any connected system, cars can be hacked too. Technology, while agnostic in itself, amplifies the good as well as the bad, and driverless cars won’t be any different.

Hotel, A U.S.-Turkey Relations Conference Stirs Up Ethics Questions Facebook Twitter Google+ Email March 21, 201710:42 AM ET Marilyn Geewax Twitter Jackie Northam Enlarge this image The annual conference has taken place in recent years at Washington's Ritz-Carlton hotel but is scheduled this May for the Trump International Hotel. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP hide caption toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP The annual conference has taken place in recent years at Washington's Ritz-Carlton hotel but is scheduled this May for the Trump International Hotel. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP This spring, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., will host a three-day event co-hosted by a business group. That's not unusual. But here's what is: The group's chair founded the company that paid President Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for lobbying work that may have benefited the Turkish government. This mashup of money involving Turks, Flynn and Trump has concerned ethics experts who worry about a "pay to play" atmosphere in Washington. Here are the basics: What: The 36th Annual Conference on U.S.-Turkey Relations is scheduled for May 21-23. Where: At the Trump hotel, just blocks from the White House. It had been held in recent years at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Washington. National Security Michael Flynn Admits Lobbying May Have Benefited Turkish Government Who: The Turkey-U.S. Business Council, known as TAIK, and the American Turkish Council are the sponsors. The former group is chaired by a Turkish-American businessman, Ekim Alptekin, who has ties to the Turkish government. More about who: Alptekin also is the founder of Inovo BV, a company that paid Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, $530,000 for lobbying work that may have benefited the Turkish government. Ruya Eichelberger, a spokeswoman for the American Turkish Council, says the dates when the organization wanted to hold the conference this year weren't open at the Ritz-Carlton. The group did its first walk-through at the Trump hotel in 2015, she says, while it was under construction, and booked it in October 2016. The previous annual conference took place at the Ritz-Carlton from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1, 2016. But ethics experts have concerns about special interest groups, lobbyists and foreign governments bringing their business to Trump, who has a dual role as president and innkeeper. These critics point to the U.S. Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prohibits presidents from accepting benefits from foreign powers. Despite such concerns, Trump has not divested from the five-star hotel bearing his name and in fact has dropped in for dinner and to mingle with patrons. The website for the Turkish conference says "hundreds of stakeholders" are expected to convene at the hotel "to address key bilateral commercial and diplomatic topics." Business leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, members of the U.S. Congress and the Turkish Parliament are also expected to attend. In the view of those concerned about the Emoluments Clause, it doesn't matter when the event sponsors made plans to move to the Trump hotel; the decision to go forward with it now is inappropriate because of Trump's role as president. Parallels Kuwait Celebration At Trump Hotel Raises Conflict Of Interest Questions Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a leading independent scholar on government ethics, said that by choosing a Trump hotel, the sponsors of the event "may be trying to amplify its voice, increase its influence, and purchase access to the Trump administration by enriching President Trump and his family." The issue was raised last month, when Kuwait moved its national day celebration to the Trump hotel. At the time, Norman Eisen, who had served as President Barack Obama's ethics czar, told NPR that the Founding Fathers wrote the clause "because they were so worried about swag, any kind of swag, coming to an American president just for the reasons ... that it would distort presidential decision-making to benefit himself."

The companies, including major names such as 3M, Johnson Controls Inc., Philips Lighting and Intel, joined advocates such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and Alliance to Save Energy, which organized the letter, in backing the program in a Tuesday letter to congressional appropriators. “This voluntary partnership program … helps businesses, state and local governments, non-profit organizations, institutions of higher education, homeowners, and consumers save money by investing in energy efficiency,” they wrote. ADVERTISEMENT The popular Energy Star program, part of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), allows companies to label their products as being energy efficient if they meet certain standards. It is meant to encourage consumers and businesses to buy those products. It is among the EPA programs that Trump proposed to eliminate last week in his first budget proposal. The administration is eyeing a 31 percent cut to the EPA, focused largely on slashing climate programs, local environmental programs and Obama administration priorities. Trump’s budget is only a proposal, and Congress has the ultimate say over federal spending. “Energy Star accomplishes several highly desirable goals at once: it helps consumers reduce high energy bills, promotes economic growth by stimulating investment in new technology, reduces pollution through cost-effective measures, and helps ensure the reliability of our electric system by reducing peak demand,” the dozens of companies and groups wrote. “We believe that the wide range of benefits of Energy Star, realized across the entire U.S. economy, make it worthy of your support in FY2017 and FY2018.” Tags Energy Star energy efficiency Environmental Protection Agency   View the discussion thread.

Latest: no Mac updates included as part of March store refresh, but hopes remain for a press event later in spring by Ashleigh Macro | 21 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When is the MacBook Air 2017 coming out? Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? When was the MacBook Air last updated? How much will the MacBook Air 2017 cost? 13in, 15in & 17in? Specs & new features When will Apple release a new MacBook Air in 2017? What tech specs and new features will the new MacBook Air get? Is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Will the new MacBook Air get a Retina display at last? Apple did technically update the MacBook Air in 2016, but it was a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including what had been an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model, and not touching the 11in model at all. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air be killed off for good? In this article, we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air release for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. Read next: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap MacBook deals Updated, 21 March 2017, with the news that no MacBooks were updated as part of Apple's "something special" March update - will they get a spring launch event?; 24 February 2017, with the possibly significant news that Best Buy in the US has dropped its price for the MacBook Air - does this indicate a product update is on its way? And previous to include rumours that Apple is manufacturing more of its own chips for use in Mac laptops When is the MacBook Air 2017 coming out? Back in March 2016, MacBook Air fans were eagerly awaiting an update to their favourite laptop at Apple's special event; after all, the spring event represented one year since it was last updated. But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. We had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that was for the 13in model only. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the new MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March and May as has been the case in previous years. On 21 March 2017 Apple temporarily shut down its online store and posted a notice saying: "We've got something special in store for you. And we can't wait for you to see it. Please check back soon." Sadly this didn't turn out to include any Macs, laptop or desktop. Apple quietly unveiled a new 9.7-inch iPad (called simply "iPad"), added a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and increased the storage options for the iPad mini 4 and iPhone SE. There remain reasons to hope for an update this year, but it does seem likely that the MacBook Air line is being quietly wound down. This may or may not be significant, but in February 2017 the US retailer Best Buy dropped the price for the cheapest MacBook Air to just $800. Price cuts often precede the launch of a new model, as retailers try to clear their store of the older machine, but this could just as easily indicate that Best Buy thinks a new MacBook Air is on the way (or the old one is going to be discontinued) as it could indicate that it's got wind of some inside information. You'll recall that late in 2016 Best Buy accidentally published a spec of a new iMac on its site, which some of us thought might indicate an upcoming launch, but we're still waiting on that one.

After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry-level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that an 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in model may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We suspect that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suggest that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leapt past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out anymore," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst foresees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011. Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. In January 2017, DigiTimes cited Chinese site Economic Daily News and said Apple is going to drop the price of the non-Touch Bar 13in MacBook Pro and discontinue the MacBook Air, which only exists now in the 13in size. It added: "Apple is expected to unveil a new 12-inch MacBook in early second quarter with an additional memory option of 16GB" - this would all but render the Air unnecessary to Apple, even if consumers might lament the absence of its lower price point. We don't expect the 12in MacBook to drop in price. When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. How much will the MacBook Air 2017 cost? The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry-level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line-up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. Screen size: 13in, 15in & 17in? If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that sometime in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. MacBook Air 2017: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic Update 08/02/2017: It's not just the CPU that's getting an upgrade either, as a recent Bloomberg report claims that Apple is working on a processor that's meant to improve the battery life of its laptop range. According to the report, the chip is said to handle basic tasks like checking for email and installing updates while the computer is asleep. Apple's current way of working relies on the MacBook's main processor to handle the tasks, but by implementing a dedicated low-power processor, Apple can further reduce battery consumption and provide a longer battery life.   Those with knowledge of the subject claim that the chip is similar to that used by Apple in the MacBook Pro to manage the Touch Bar, and that the new chip may make an appearance in the 2017 MacBook Pro, along with other laptops. It makes sense, as Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has been criticised since launch for its poor battery life. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implementing the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the older 11in MacBook Air. Read more: What is a Retina display? New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. However, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently, the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP hide caption toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP The annual conference has taken place in recent years at Washington's Ritz-Carlton hotel but is scheduled this May for the Trump International Hotel. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP This spring, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., will host a three-day event co-hosted by a business group. That's not unusual. But here's what is: The group's chair founded the company that paid President Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for lobbying work that may have benefited the Turkish government. This mashup of money involving Turks, Flynn and Trump has concerned ethics experts who worry about a "pay to play" atmosphere in Washington. Here are the basics: What: The 36th Annual Conference on U.S.-Turkey Relations is scheduled for May 21-23. Where: At the Trump hotel, just blocks from the White House. It had been held in recent years at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Washington. National Security Michael Flynn Admits Lobbying May Have Benefited Turkish Government Who: The Turkey-U.S. Business Council, known as TAIK, and the American Turkish Council are the sponsors. The former group is chaired by a Turkish-American businessman, Ekim Alptekin, who has ties to the Turkish government. More about who: Alptekin also is the founder of Inovo BV, a company that paid Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, $530,000 for lobbying work that may have benefited the Turkish government. Ruya Eichelberger, a spokeswoman for the American Turkish Council, says the dates when the organization wanted to hold the conference this year weren't open at the Ritz-Carlton. The group did its first walk-through at the Trump hotel in 2015, she says, while it was under construction, and booked it in October 2016. The previous annual conference took place at the Ritz-Carlton from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1, 2016. But ethics experts have concerns about special interest groups, lobbyists and foreign governments bringing their business to Trump, who has a dual role as president and innkeeper. These critics point to the U.S. Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prohibits presidents from accepting benefits from foreign powers. Despite such concerns, Trump has not divested from the five-star hotel bearing his name and in fact has dropped in for dinner and to mingle with patrons. The website for the Turkish conference says "hundreds of stakeholders" are expected to convene at the hotel "to address key bilateral commercial and diplomatic topics." Business leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, members of the U.S. Congress and the Turkish Parliament are also expected to attend. In the view of those concerned about the Emoluments Clause, it doesn't matter when the event sponsors made plans to move to the Trump hotel; the decision to go forward with it now is inappropriate because of Trump's role as president. Parallels Kuwait Celebration At Trump Hotel Raises Conflict Of Interest Questions Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a leading independent scholar on government ethics, said that by choosing a Trump hotel, the sponsors of the event "may be trying to amplify its voice, increase its influence, and purchase access to the Trump administration by enriching President Trump and his family." The issue was raised last month, when Kuwait moved its national day celebration to the Trump hotel. At the time, Norman Eisen, who had served as President Barack Obama's ethics czar, told NPR that the Founding Fathers wrote the clause "because they were so worried about swag, any kind of swag, coming to an American president just for the reasons ... that it would distort presidential decision-making to benefit himself."

Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP hide caption toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP The annual conference has taken place in recent years at Washington's Ritz-Carlton hotel but is scheduled this May for the Trump International Hotel. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP This spring, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., will host a three-day event co-hosted by a business group. That's not unusual. But here's what is: The group's chair founded the company that paid President Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for lobbying work that may have benefited the Turkish government. This mashup of money involving Turks, Flynn and Trump has concerned ethics experts who worry about a "pay to play" atmosphere in Washington. Here are the basics: What: The 36th Annual Conference on U.S.-Turkey Relations is scheduled for May 21-23. Where: At the Trump hotel, just blocks from the White House. It had been held in recent years at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Washington. National Security Michael Flynn Admits Lobbying May Have Benefited Turkish Government Who: The Turkey-U.S. Business Council, known as TAIK, and the American Turkish Council are the sponsors. The former group is chaired by a Turkish-American businessman, Ekim Alptekin, who has ties to the Turkish government. More about who: Alptekin also is the founder of Inovo BV, a company that paid Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, $530,000 for lobbying work that may have benefited the Turkish government. Ruya Eichelberger, a spokeswoman for the American Turkish Council, says the dates when the organization wanted to hold the conference this year weren't open at the Ritz-Carlton. The group did its first walk-through at the Trump hotel in 2015, she says, while it was under construction, and booked it in October 2016. The previous annual conference took place at the Ritz-Carlton from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1, 2016. But ethics experts have concerns about special interest groups, lobbyists and foreign governments bringing their business to Trump, who has a dual role as president and innkeeper. These critics point to the U.S. Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prohibits presidents from accepting benefits from foreign powers. Despite such concerns, Trump has not divested from the five-star hotel bearing his name and in fact has dropped in for dinner and to mingle with patrons. The website for the Turkish conference says "hundreds of stakeholders" are expected to convene at the hotel "to address key bilateral commercial and diplomatic topics." Business leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, members of the U.S. Congress and the Turkish Parliament are also expected to attend. In the view of those concerned about the Emoluments Clause, it doesn't matter when the event sponsors made plans to move to the Trump hotel; the decision to go forward with it now is inappropriate because of Trump's role as president. Parallels Kuwait Celebration At Trump Hotel Raises Conflict Of Interest Questions Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a leading independent scholar on government ethics, said that by choosing a Trump hotel, the sponsors of the event "may be trying to amplify its voice, increase its influence, and purchase access to the Trump administration by enriching President Trump and his family." The issue was raised last month, when Kuwait moved its national day celebration to the Trump hotel. At the time, Norman Eisen, who had served as President Barack Obama's ethics czar, told NPR that the Founding Fathers wrote the clause "because they were so worried about swag, any kind of swag, coming to an American president just for the reasons ... that it would distort presidential decision-making to benefit himself."

About the author Lucas Käldström - Hi there and thanks for finding my profile! I'm a Swedish-speaking Upper Secondary School Student from Finland. » More about me Learn how you can contribute How to deploy Kubernetes on the Raspberry Pi In a few steps, set up your Raspberry Pi with Kubernetes using Weave Net. Posted 21 Mar 2017 Lucas KäldströmFeed 11up 2 comments Image by :  opensource.com When I became interested in ARM devices, and in the Raspberry Pi in particular, my first project was an OpenVPN server. By having the Raspberry Pi as a secure gateway to my home network, I could use my phone to control my desktop and remotely play Spotify, open documents, and a bunch of other fun things. I used an existing tutorial for that first project because I was afraid of piping anything into the command line on my own. More on Raspberry Pi Our latest on Raspberry Pi What is Raspberry Pi? Getting started with Raspberry Pi Send us your Raspberry Pi projects and tutorials After a few months, that fear dissipated. I expanded upon my original project and isolated the OpenVPN server from the file server using a Samba server. This was my first project where I didn't follow a tutorial verbatim. Unfortunately, by the end of my Samba project, I realized I hadn't documented anything, so I couldn't replicate it. To recreate it, I had to reread all of the separate guides I had used for reference and piece the project back together. I learned a valuable lesson about developer workflow—track all of your changes. I made myself a small git repo locally and recorded all of the commands that I typed into the command line. Discovering Kubernetes In May 2015, I discovered Linux containers and Kubernetes. With Kubernetes, I thought it was fascinating that I could take part in a concept still technically in development—and I actually had access to it. The platform itself and the possibilities it presented were exciting. Up until that point, I had just been running a single program on one Raspberry Pi device. With Kubernetes, I could make more advanced configurations than what was possible previously. At that time, Docker (v1.6, if I remember correctly) on ARM had a bug, which meant running Kubernetes on a Raspberry Pi device was virtually impossible. During those early 0.x releases, Kubernetes changed very quickly. Every time I found a guide for how to set up Kubernetes on AMD64, it was for an older version and it was totally incompatible with what I had at the time. I hacked my way to creating a Kubernetes node on Raspberry Pi anyway, and by the v1.0.1 Kubernetes release, I had it working, using Docker v1.7.1. This was the first fully functional way to deploy Kubernetes to ARM. The advantage of running Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi is that because ARM devices are so small they don't draw a lot of power. If programs are built the right way, it's possible to use the same commands for the same programs on AMD64. Having small IoT boards creates a great opportunity for education. It's also beneficial for setting up demonstrations you need to travel for, like a conference. Bringing your Raspberry Pi is a lot easier than lugging your (often) large Intel machines. Now that ARM (both 32- and 64-bit) support is merged into the core in line with my proposal for it, ARM binaries are automatically released with Kubernetes. Although we haven't got an automated CI (continuous integration) system for ARM yet that automatically makes sure it's working on ARM before PRs can be merged, it's working quite well at the moment. Distributed networking on the Raspberry Pi I discovered Weave Net through kubeadm. Weave Mesh is an interesting solution for distributed networking, so I began to read more about it. In December of 2016, I received my first contracting job ever with Weaveworks. I was part of the internal team that made Weave Net support ARM. I'm excited for the possibility of industrial use cases for running Weave Net on Raspberry Pi, such as factories that need devices to be more mobile. Currently, deploying Weave Scope or Weave Cloud to Raspberry Pi might not be possible (though it is conceivable with other ARM devices) because I guess the software needs more available memory to run well. Ideally, with the 2GB upgrade of Raspberry Pi, I think I would be able to spin up Weave Cloud successfully. With the Weave Net 1.9 release, Weave Net how has ARM support. Kubeadm (and Kubernetes in general) works on multiple platforms. You can deploy Kubernetes to ARM with Weave just as you would on any AMD64 device by installing Docker, kubeadm, kubectl, and kubelet as usual on all machines. Then, initialize the master machine where the control plane components will run using: 
kubeadm init Next, install your pod network with the following command: 
kubectl apply -f https://git.io/weave-kube Previously, you could only install a pod network with Flannel when running on ARM, but this has changed since the Weave Net 1.9 release, which now also supports ARM officially. Finally, join your nodes: 
kubeadm join --token <token> <master-ip> And that's it! Kubernetes is deployed to your Raspberry Pi device. You didn't have to do anything special compared to running on Intel/AMD64; Weave Net on ARM just works. Raspberry Pi community I hope the Raspberry Pi community grows and their mentality spreads to other parts of the world. They're successful in Great Britain and other countries, but not so much here in Finland. I want the ecosystem to expand and for more people to learn how to deploy Kubernetes or Weave to ARM devices. After all, that's how I learned. By teaching myself on a Raspberry Pi device, I think I understand both ARM devices and the software deployed on them a lot better than I would have otherwise. Final thoughts Everything I learned about the Raspberry Pi and Kubernetes, I learned online by joining user communities, asking questions, and testing with different levels of success. I am a Swedish-speaking upper secondary school student living in Finland, and to date, I've never attended a programming or computing class. I was still able to join the open source community because there are no restrictions on age or education: your work is judged based on its merits. For anyone nervous about making their first contributions to any open source project I'd say: Dive right in, it's totally worth it. There are no limitations to what you can do, and you'll never know which kinds of opportunities the open source world will offer you. It's gonna be fun, I promise!

Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP hide caption toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP The annual conference has taken place in recent years at Washington's Ritz-Carlton hotel but is scheduled this May for the Trump International Hotel. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP This spring, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., will host a three-day event co-hosted by a business group. That's not unusual. But here's what is: The group's chair founded the company that paid President Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for lobbying work that may have benefited the Turkish government. This mashup of money involving Turks, Flynn and Trump has concerned ethics experts who worry about a "pay to play" atmosphere in Washington. Here are the basics: What: The 36th Annual Conference on U.S.-Turkey Relations is scheduled for May 21-23. Where: At the Trump hotel, just blocks from the White House. It had been held in recent years at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Washington. National Security Michael Flynn Admits Lobbying May Have Benefited Turkish Government Who: The Turkey-U.S. Business Council, known as TAIK, and the American Turkish Council are the sponsors. The former group is chaired by a Turkish-American businessman, Ekim Alptekin, who has ties to the Turkish government. More about who: Alptekin also is the founder of Inovo BV, a company that paid Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, $530,000 for lobbying work that may have benefited the Turkish government. Ruya Eichelberger, a spokeswoman for the American Turkish Council, says the dates when the organization wanted to hold the conference this year weren't open at the Ritz-Carlton. The group did its first walk-through at the Trump hotel in 2015, she says, while it was under construction, and booked it in October 2016. The previous annual conference took place at the Ritz-Carlton from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1, 2016. But ethics experts have concerns about special interest groups, lobbyists and foreign governments bringing their business to Trump, who has a dual role as president and innkeeper. These critics point to the U.S. Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prohibits presidents from accepting benefits from foreign powers. Despite such concerns, Trump has not divested from the five-star hotel bearing his name and in fact has dropped in for dinner and to mingle with patrons. The website for the Turkish conference says "hundreds of stakeholders" are expected to convene at the hotel "to address key bilateral commercial and diplomatic topics." Business leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, members of the U.S. Congress and the Turkish Parliament are also expected to attend. In the view of those concerned about the Emoluments Clause, it doesn't matter when the event sponsors made plans to move to the Trump hotel; the decision to go forward with it now is inappropriate because of Trump's role as president. Parallels Kuwait Celebration At Trump Hotel Raises Conflict Of Interest Questions Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a leading independent scholar on government ethics, said that by choosing a Trump hotel, the sponsors of the event "may be trying to amplify its voice, increase its influence, and purchase access to the Trump administration by enriching President Trump and his family." The issue was raised last month, when Kuwait moved its national day celebration to the Trump hotel. At the time, Norman Eisen, who had served as President Barack Obama's ethics czar, told NPR that the Founding Fathers wrote the clause "because they were so worried about swag, any kind of swag, coming to an American president just for the reasons ... that it would distort presidential decision-making to benefit himself."

The simplest way to protect against mid-air collisions is to require the use of ADS-B transponders on all aircraft. Transponders can turn an uncooperative environment into a cooperative environment. Browse Full Report Visit – http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/highways-in-the-sky-market Transponders provide location and positioning information about smart commercial drones. These drones have a computer inside, they are easy to fly, remotely maneuverable, have a camera, and contain sensor logic.  Smart drones are evolving computer driven collision avoidance technology making the flying more reliable. Remote operation occurs in the context of a workflow and sensors.  Cameras are improving dramatically to permit management of video and picture taking that is realistic and detailed.  Drone actuators, drone transponders, are needed to support drone package delivery.  This is a huge new market that speeds economic development, makes it easier for the middle class to both work, and purchase lifestyle items and food efficiently. Drones based on aerial robotic platform technology can be used to make deliveries to each person’s home, landing on the back doorstep, leaving packages in a locked box.  The drone package delivery technology has reached a level of maturity that bodes well for market development.  Drone systems are mature enough to be at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. Dronecode is an independently funded software project that harnesses the power of collaborative development.  The aim is to fuel innovation across drone industries and ecosystems.  Dronecode Foundation is a nonprofit organization working on a common, shared open source platform for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Dronecode brings together existing and future open source UAV software projects. APM UAV software platform was developed by 3DRobotics.  1,200 developers are working on Dronecode’s six projects focused on maximizing adoption of the project’s cost-effective, reliable and technologically advanced UAV software. Micro-Avionix has an ultra-lightweight low cost ADS-B transponder for UAS.  Micro-Avionix has developed an ADS-B suitable for UAVs of all sizes to improve flying safety for all.  The ping™ is a family of ultralight weight, low cost, ADS-B transponders.

Transponder and sense and avoid technology sponsorship by Sagetech, L-3 Aviation Products, FreeFlight, Micro-Avionix, Google, Trig, DJI, and Intel has been effective.  Development by Dronecode application ecosystem provides huge advances in drone real-time sense and avoid behavior.  An open source collaboration is expected to accelerate deployable solutions for agile and reliable operation in the national airspace.  The open source platform has been adopted by many organizations on the forefront of drone technology:  3DRobotics, Parrot, Qualcomm, Intel, DroneDeploy, Yuneec, Airphrame, and others. With 750,000 users and 500 active developers the open source code initiative represents a compelling community of professionals and enthusiasts is able to support active improvements in control of airspace and improvement in flying safety for all.  The alliance has worked on development standardization and software module interoperability. According to Susan Eustis, lead author of the study, “Use of drone transponders represents a key milestone in provision of value to the airborne package delivery industry.  Customized cameras are used to supplement GPS navigation, acting as eyes of the drone, permitting package delivery everywhere.  Digital controls will further automate flying, making ease of use and flight stability a reality. New materials and new designs are bringing that transformation forward.  By furthering transponder innovation, continued growth is assured.” The worldwide market for drone transponders is anticipated to start from nothing and reach $2.5 billion worldwide by 2022 growing in response to the need to prevent drone collisions, keep the highways in the sky safe, and manage routing of commercial drones.  Multiple applications drive market growth, most of all package delivery occurs out of line of sight. Other applications for drone transponders are in consumer photography, lightweight commercial drones for real estate, the military, law enforcement, border control, homeland security, utility infrastructure surveillance, agriculture, aerial mapping, and package delivery.

Voice Assistants and Technologies: Ecosystem and Market Leaders examines the growing market for these smart home devices and the impact of voice control as a major market transformation in both the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI). "In the past five years, voice control and voice-based technologies have experienced massive growth in the consumer market, igniting the competitive landscape among current and emerging smart home players," said Dina Abdelrazik, Research Analyst, Parks Associates. "Voice interfaces are advancing due to continued improvements in machine learning and natural language processing, paired with the prevalence of portable devices. Apple increased consumer familiarity of voice control with its introduction of Siri in 2011, but the later-to-market Amazon Alexa has taken a clear lead in this category." Parks Associates and other industry leaders will address voice technologies at the 21st-annual CONNECTIONS™: The Premier Connected Home Conference, May 23-25 in San Francisco, California. Abdelrazik will moderate the session "Voice Control: Improving the User Experience" on May 25. The executive conference features keynotes from Comcast, Cox Communications, Intel, and Vivint Smart Home. Registration is open, and media are invited to attend. Parks Associates shows that a slightly higher percentage of consumers (56%) want to use voice-activated personal assistance to control smart home devices compared to those who want to use voice to control entertainment devices (55%). Voice-based personal assistants like Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana are driving that interest, and Parks Associates estimates that 15.3 million Amazon Echo devices (i.e., Amazon Echo, Dot, and Tap) were sold in 2016. "Adoption for voice assistants will increase as these devices add more and varied capabilities to match the many use cases possible in the smart home and IoT," Abdelrazik said. "The Alexa Skills Kit has grown by roughly 40% since January 2016, recently exceeding 10,000 skills, and Amazon plans to release new Alexa devices that can also make phone calls and work as intercoms. Google Home has countered by adding its Google Express delivery network for home shopping." Voice Assistants and Technologies: Ecosystem and Market Leaders examines the growing momentum of voice-based technologies in key industry verticals, driven by the use of connected speaker products, smartphones, and interactive devices. The report examines the ecosystem for voice-based technologies, identifies the market leaders in voice assistants, and assesses the market impact of voice on product and service sectors.

Abdelrazik will moderate the session "Voice Control: Improving the User Experience" on May 25. The executive conference features keynotes from Comcast, Cox Communications, Intel, and Vivint Smart Home. Registration is open, and media are invited to attend. Parks Associates shows that a slightly higher percentage of consumers (56%) want to use voice-activated personal assistance to control smart home devices compared to those who want to use voice to control entertainment devices (55%). Voice-based personal assistants like Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana are driving that interest, and Parks Associates estimates that 15.3 million Amazon Echo devices (i.e., Amazon Echo, Dot, and Tap) were sold in 2016. "Adoption for voice assistants will increase as these devices add more and varied capabilities to match the many use cases possible in the smart home and IoT," Abdelrazik said. "The Alexa Skills Kit has grown by roughly 40% since January 2016, recently exceeding 10,000 skills, and Amazon plans to release new Alexa devices that can also make phone calls and work as intercoms. Google Home has countered by adding its Google Express delivery network for home shopping." Voice Assistants and Technologies: Ecosystem and Market Leaders examines the growing momentum of voice-based technologies in key industry verticals, driven by the use of connected speaker products, smartphones, and interactive devices. The report examines the ecosystem for voice-based technologies, identifies the market leaders in voice assistants, and assesses the market impact of voice on product and service sectors.

Tesla looking at ABQ for $5b battery factory — with clawbacks in the offing? By Rob Nikolewski  /   February 26, 2014  /   4 Comments By Rob Nikolewski │ New Mexico Watchdog SANTA FE – Albuquerque is on the short list for a proposed $5 billion battery factory to be built by Tesla Motors, Inc., the maker of electric cars priced at more than $70,000 each. According to regulatory filings made late Wednesday afternoon, the California-based carmaker reported it is looking at Albuquerque, Reno, Nev., and two undisclosed locations in Arizona and Texas for a 500-1,000 acre site for what the company calls a “gigafactory” that expects to employ 6,500 employees. ABQ IS IN THE RUNNING: Albuquerque is on the short list as a site for a proposed $5 billion battery plan to be built by the electric car company, Tesla. The factory is scheduled to launch in 2017 and be fully operational by 2020, turning out up to a half-million cars a year. “We would covet a project like this,” New Mexico Economic Development Department Secretary Jon Barela told New Mexico Watchdog.  “It would be a transformational opportunity for this state … Tesla is a fantastic company, it’s a forward-thinking company that fits into our R&D and technology culture.” Barela said he did not have a timeline on when Tesla plans on making it decision. In an email to New Mexico Watchdog, Tesla Director of Global Communications Liz Jarvis-Shean did not give specifics but in a blog produced by the company, a projected timeline for “zoning, design and build” of the plant is slated for 2014. According to the filing, Tesla would raise $1.6 billion through a bond issue to help finance the factory and the auto maker said it plans to contribute $2 billion toward the proposed battery factory. Tesla also said it was in discussions with Panasonic about investing in the facility, something Panasonic officials confirmed Wednesday. “This would be a huge economic benefit for Albuquerque and New Mexico to get us out of the recession,” state Rep. Jason Harper, R-Rio Rancho, told New Mexico Watchdog Wednesday afternoon, pointing out that Intel’s plant in Rio Rancho employs 1,400 people — about one-fourth the size of the estimated Tesla plant. But at the same time, Harper says that should Albuquerque land the contract, it’s important that “clawback” provisions be put in place should a deal involve public dollars as an enticement for Telsa to come to New Mexico. “That way we’re protecting any taxpayer investment,” Harper said. In the 2013 legislative session, Harper sponsored a bill that passed through the Legislature and signed by Gov. Susana Martinez that attached provisions to financial deals so that if the companies fail to make good on their promises, municipalities and the state can recoup some of the losses. The law went into effect following cases involving two high-profile companies: *Hewlett-Packard received $2.2 million in incentives from the city of Rio Rancho and promised it would hire 1,350 people for a customer support center. HP hired just 860 people and later cut 200 of those jobs by Oct. 31. HP was required to repay just $71,000, something Harper called “a slap on the wrist.” *In 2012, Schott Solar declared bankruptcy after it received $16 million in state taxpayer money to break ground on a facility in Albuquerque. According to the terms of the deal OK’d by the administration of then-Gov. Bill Richardson, no claw-back provisions existed, although the New Mexico Finance Authority managed to wrest $3.3 million from Schott. Barela says he thinks the clawback law won’t scare off Tesla. “That won’t have an impact,” he said. Harper agrees, saying reliable companies have nothing to fear. “Besides,” Harper said, the New Mexico law “is a proportional clawback. I think it’s very fair.” A story late Wednesday from the Wall Street Journal cited “a person familiar with the discussions in Nevada” saying that Tesla is looking at Reno because of the northern Nevada city is home to a mining and production plant that creates lithium carbonate, a key ingredient in making the lithium-ion batteries Tesla uses. Barela said he didn’t know if Reno has the inside track on the deal and instead focused on the fact that Albuquerque is on the short list. “We’ve been making great strides to make New Mexico more business-friendly and tax competitive,” Barela said. “The key message is that now New Mexico can compete with these kinds of projects. A couple years ago, this could not have happened.” *** Here’s the blog posting from Tesla outlining some of the details of the proposed battery factory: Tesla’s “Gig a Factory” by Rob Nikolewski Contact Rob Nikolewski at [email protected] and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski Click here to LEARN HOW TO STEAL OUR STUFF!

Liesner Companies that put nothing into the pot but promises usually take all they can get and when the well is dry they blow town. The electric car business has not been a blooming industry, and most require government subsidies to operate. Secondly the American people are not all that hyped up over electric cars and tend to stick with the gas powered cars. In our economic environment today government subsidies could be a very iffy thing. FlameCCT L.E. Good observation. The one bright point about this factory would be that it produces a product that can be used in more than one application like the TESLA electric car. It can be used in various hybrid vehicles as well as static storage devices for other electrical applications. Charles Of the 4 states that Tesla is looking at, two have no state income tax (NV and TX). NM has the additional problem of a miserable public education system, a regressive gross receipts’ tax that taxes sales AND services and a Democrat controlled state legislature and appellate court system that have traditionally been hostile to business. Why would Tesla even consider coming here? I suspect that Tesla has said that 4 states are in the running to set off a bidding war among the states. I think that NM got Intel because Sandoval County gave tax breaks to Intel greater than the assessed value of ALL the real estate in Sandoval County. I suspect that Tesla is looking for a similar sweetheart deal. Gary Zeune CPA Statement on Auditing Standards “Consideration of Laws and Regulations in a Financial Statement Audit” require the outside auditor to know the law and regulations that require Tesla to book liability if it violates the agreement and owes the state under the clawback provision. So the company agrees to a clawback if better set up a system to monitor compliance and the gov’t regulators should require the outside CPAs to monitor compliance. BUT clawbacks rarely work. Why? Because the project has failed the company rarely has money to pay the state back. Think about it this way. Would you give the grocery store $1 for a can of peas with the promise they deliver? Of course not. So a MUCH better system is the state sets benchmarks, for example hiring a specified number of employees for a certain amount of time, or use amount of payroll so Tesla doesn’t hire employees then fired them once it get the state’s check. This is a lot of money. Don’t screw it up. Don’t miss our news Get the latest on government waste, fraud, and abuse - directly in your inbox.

Business ARM develops new chip for driverless cars Lucy Tobin Tuesday 21 March 2017 13:01 GMT Click to follow The Evening Standard ARM was bought by SoftBank, run by Masayoshi Son, for £24bn AFP/Getty Images Tech giant ARM Holdings today entered the race to power driverless cars as it launched a new chip — one of the first big innovations since the Cambridge company was snapped up for £24 billion by Japan’s SoftBank last year. It’s already helped to revolutionise the phone market — more than 85% of the world’s most sophisticated smartphones use ARM chips — now it’s taking on robots, artificial intelligence software and autonomous cars. Its new design, DynamIQ, is aimed at complex computing tasks such as these — areas where rivals Intel and IBM have recently launched specialist chips. The DynamIQ processor will work to ensure that a driverless vehicle reacts safely in the event of a failure when there is no human to step in, ARM claimed.  Its new design could also be used in data centers, a lucrative market long-dominated by Intel. ARM’s Nandan Nayampally, general manager of its Compute Products Group, claimed that within five years the new design will perform as much as 50 times better on artificial intelligence tasks than the existing chips on the market.

Five to ten years from now, Uber hopes, the following will be an everyday occurrence: A driverless Uber car pulls up at Nick and Nicole Smith’s house at 7:30 in the morning. Their two kids, Julia, 16, and Joey, 14, hop into the car, and it then drops them off at school. The Uber car returns to the Smiths’ suburban home, picks up Nick and Nicole, and drops Nicole at the train station to catch the 7:55 into the city. The car then drives 40 minutes to drop off Nick at his company’s headquarters nestled in an office park. During the drive, Nick uses his laptop to answer emails and finish a PowerPoint. At 5:00 that afternoon, a driverless Uber car picks up Julia from field hockey practice and Joey from baseball practice and takes them home. Meanwhile, Uber has sent another car to pick up Dad at the office park at 5:30, and that car makes it to the train station in time to pick up Nicole, who’s due on the 6:15. The car then stops at a Chinese restaurant so the Smiths can pick up a takeout dinner. It waits while Nick runs in to get the food, and it then drops off the Smiths at home. Welcome to the brave new world of driverless cars and trucks. In this not-too-distant future, many Americans are likely to conclude that they no longer need—or want—to own a car. No more worrying about tune-ups or getting gas or shopping for auto insurance or renewing registrations. Uber’s controversial co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, is very high on driverless technology, saying, “When there’s no other dude [i.e a driver] in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” And Uber is far from the only player. Ford Motor and BMW say they’ll have driverless cars on the road within five years. General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft (obtaining a 10 percent stake) to help it develop driverless cars. Tesla, Volvo, Daimler, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Google, and Apple have also joined the race. And now mighty Intel, eager to get into a new, fast-growing sector, jumped into the fray in March by announcing a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye, an Israeli company that is a leader in making sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles. Depending on how things shake out, Ford or Fiat Chrysler may own and manage self-driving fleets that compete head to head with Uber. Tony Avelar/AP Images Otto-mated: One of Otto's self-driving, big-rig trucks leaves the garage for a test drive during a demonstration at the Otto headquarters on August 18, 2016, in San Francisco. The coming of driverless cars and trucks raises several big questions. How long will the transition to these vehicles take? What will be the benefits and the costs to society? Who will be the winners and who the losers (and it seems clear that many of the five million people who work as drivers will be losers)? And what role should the government play in managing and regulating the arrival of this new technology, or should all this be left to the free market to sort out? Also, what role should government take to help the millions of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and others who might lose their jobs, or should these displaced workers be left to fend for themselves? Should society require the winners from this new technology—most likely some giant corporations and the consuming public—to somehow share their gains with the losers, perhaps through some special levy on these new vehicles to finance programs to help the losers? The shift to driverless cars and trucks will be one of the most important new technologies since the horseless carriage replaced buggies. Yet the advent of self-driving vehicles will be different from the arrival of many previous technologies. Because we can see this technology coming years ahead of its arrival, we as a nation are in a position to take some smart policy steps to prepare and help the many people who will lose their jobs as a result of this new technology. But given America’s dismal history with easing economic transitions, such smart steps may not be taken, despite years of advance warning. Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers. Beyond that, driverless cars could mean an end to many gas stations, auto repair shops, car washes, auto dealers, commercial parking lots, and car rental agencies, not to mention traditional auto insurance. Moreover, because this new technology will lead to a more efficient use of cars, the nation could well need fewer autos—and that could reduce overall car production. These cars will benefit the public in ways that many people don’t yet appreciate. “Most of us in the U.S. commute all alone in a single car—the average American driver spends 51 minutes to and from work every day,” says Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. “This is wasted time and wasted productivity. Driverless cars would be a big win for productivity. You can spend 45 minutes doing something productive, including taking a nap.” Rajkumar also sees a sharp drop in auto accidents. “About 1.3 million people die every year worldwide from auto accidents,” he says. “In the U.S., it’s about 38,000. Most of these accidents are caused by human error. Most of these lives would be saved with driverless technology.” Rajkumar adds that autonomous cars would be a godsend for blind, disabled, and elderly Americans who can’t drive. “These people would gain mobility,” he says. “It would greatly help the 1.5 million legally blind Americans and the more than five million disabled people who can’t drive.” Autonomous cars will make it far easier and, in theory, cheaper for many disabled people to get to work. And they will make it easier for many elderly and disabled people to go to movies or parks or shopping, and for the elderly to see their grandchildren and care for them after school.   LAWRENCE KATZ, A LABOR ECONOMIST at Harvard, says there’s no denying that this radical new technology will imperil many jobs. The five million drivers who could lose their jobs, he says, represent almost 3 percent of the workforce and don’t, as a group, have bright prospects if they get laid off. “It’s disproportionately male, disproportionately non-college,” he says. Five million jobs, he explains, “is about the same size as the decline in manufacturing jobs since 2000. It’s a comparable potential shock.” The move to self-driving cars will of course produce some new jobs—in engineering, software, and marketing. But displaced former drivers generally won’t qualify for these white-collar jobs. Instead, they could find themselves with lower-paying jobs at Walmart or Target, or they could be trained for something better. According to Katz, there are two big reasons that the economic pain from losing five million driving jobs will be less than from losing five million factory jobs. First, drivers’ jobs are spread fairly evenly across the United States, while manufacturing jobs were concentrated in one devastated region, the Midwest. The more-even geographic distribution should make it easier for laid-off drivers to find jobs. Second, Katz noted, because factory workers average around $20 an hour, while drivers average $13, laid-off drivers would take less of a hit than factory workers if forced to take $10-an-hour jobs at Walmart. Still, Katz added, “This will be a shock to the labor market for non-college men. They’re already in tough shape.” Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which has 19,000 taxi, Uber, and Lyft drivers as members, shares these concerns. “Our people see this as a threat, and we know it’s closer than we realize,” she says. “These are workers on the margins, with language issues and low wages. Drivers are an older workforce. It’s people who are mainly in their forties and fifties and older. It’s going to be really hard to relocate these people within the economy.” “It’s going to be very disruptive,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. “It’s going to happen faster than a lot of people realize.” How fast will it happen? Some companies, like Uber and Ford, see driverless cars becoming popular within five years, while some skeptical experts say it will take 20 or 30 years not just to develop a truly safe self-driving technology, but also to get needed government permissions, and to overcome public anxiety that could morph into public resistance. Official Leweb Photos/Creative Commons Uber's Travis Kalanick speaking in London.  Moody’s Investors Service predicts that self-driving technology will not become a common option in conventional vehicles until 2030, and not become standard in all vehicles until 2035. Moody’s further predicts that not until 2045 will a majority of vehicles be driverless and that by 2055, they will become nearly universal. Uber and Google have prototypes on the road now. It’s one thing, though, to have a few dozen or hundred closely supervised experimental vehicles on the road, but a very different thing to have several million self-driving cars on streets and highways across America. Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm, predicted that such cars would become mainstream across America in four to ten years. But Joan Claybrook, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says it could take 10, 20, even 30 years of tinkering with and improving self-driving technology until it is truly safer than human drivers. In terms of its impact on the job market, “a huge amount depends upon the rate of change,” says David Autor, an MIT economics professor. “If this is gradual, it’s not a big deal,” he adds, explaining that if this happens over 15 or 20 years, many drivers should have time to retrain and the economy should be able to absorb them without major problems. “But if this happens overnight, it’s a very big deal.”   FOR THE MOMENT, THIS technology still faces sizable hurdles. It doesn’t work when snow covers lane markers, and there’s considerable worry about what happens if the internet system controlling these cars suddenly crashes. Government approvals could be delayed for years if there are more fatalities like that of the Tesla test driver who died in May 2016 when a truck cut in front of his self-driving vehicle. To help make sure that driverless vehicles are safe, huge infrastructure spending will be needed, such as installing road signs that communicate with these vehicles and upgrading GPS systems so they are accurate to within a few inches to help self-driving cars stay in their lanes. The huge outlays needed to finance these infrastructure improvements raise concerns about cost and about fairness. Supporters of driverless cars argue that such cars will help consumers—affluent and non-affluent—because they will in theory be cheaper than using today’s taxis. In some ways, however, the public investment needed to make a nationwide system of driverless cars possible will be a subsidy for affluent families like the Smiths who will be able to afford to use them far more than poorer families. The billions that government spends on infrastructure to make driverless vehicles safe and reliable could crowd out spending for mass transit, hurting less-affluent families who rely on subways, trains, and buses. Many technology experts say major infrastructure improvements will be needed to ensure that driverless cars are safe. The electronic equipment—sensors, cameras, radar, lasers—that keeps self-driving cars from hitting other cars relies on lane markings to operate, but when there is fog or when snow covers lanes or when there is blinding glare from the sun, those sensors often can’t function. To remedy this problem, there is a push to develop a far more accurate GPS system that can locate vehicles to within four inches—helping keep them in lanes. This upgraded GPS will likely need an expensive, elaborate, and frequently updated mapping of the terrain. As a further step to ensure safety and guide these cars, industry experts are calling for a new generation of road signs and traffic lights that contain elaborate electronics to communicate with driverless cars—perhaps telling them exactly where the next exit is or warning of construction ahead or an upcoming lane merger. These infrastructure improvements will be expensive, and one can be sure that the industries rushing to introduce driverless cars will want the government to pay. In the past, the government has paid for GPS satellites and highway signs. Another infrastructure requirement: The millions of autonomous cars that will eventually be on the road will need to communicate with the cloud, and that will mean significantly expanding the capacities of the cloud. This cost is likely to be borne by companies like Uber, Google, and Ford, and not by taxpayers. Several Seconds/Creative Commons Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers.  Brauer of Kelley Blue Book has other, nagging fears, among them that computer hackers might sabotage a car’s computer controls. For example, hackers might direct 20 driverless cars on a bridge to suddenly turn right, and they then disastrously plunge off the bridge. Or there might be an unexpected technical glitch that causes five cars to blow through an intersection and take out a group of pedestrians. Such a serious glitch or hacking incident could traumatize the public and cause regulators to delay for years giving needed government permissions. Brauer sees another obstacle to rolling out this new technology. “A lot of people won’t buy into it on a philosophy and on a trust level,” he says. That creates another challenge—many traditionalists may shun driverless cars and keep on driving their own cars. That could mean big problems meshing the supposedly safer driverless technology with cars driven by often-flawed human beings, some of whom will inevitably drive drunk or carelessly change lanes and crash into a self-driving car in their blind spot. There is also the big issue of how driverless cars should be regulated. Autonomous cars present an auto-safety issue far more momentous than the battles over airbags or cameras for when one drives in reverse. But in the face of industry eagerness and rapidly changing technology, the Obama administration punted. Without much public debate, the administration gave a fairly bright green light to driverless cars in September 2016, when the Department of Transportation issued guidelines permitting self-driving cars. These guidelines call for driverless cars to meet 15 safety standards and called for the 50 states to develop uniform regulations for these cars. There was no notice of rulemaking, and no formal set of rules. Under these guidelines, Uber, Google, Ford, and other companies could move ahead in introducing driverless cars onto the roads, without any further federal authorization needed—although the government emphasized that it would look over the companies’ shoulder and intervene if it saw safety problems with this radical new technology. In the event of safety problems arising, the government reserved the right to step in and set standards for some technologies, like electronic sensors, that autonomous cars rely on. Perhaps predictably, some auto industry executives protested that these guidelines were too strict because they raised the possibility that the government would delay or block some new self-driving technologies if it saw safety problems. Currently, the auto industry self-regulates in introducing new technologies, like automatic braking, under the belief that automakers—not wanting to hurt their image or sales—wouldn’t add a new technology unless they were convinced it was safe. But in light of the industry’s checkered history on safety, some skeptics are calling for greater regulation of self-driving vehicles. In Claybrook’s view, the Obama administration was far too hasty. “There will be some good actors and some bad actors,” she says. “The question is whether the public can rely on anything.” States have asserted some regulatory authority, but that is largely being preempted by Washington. The states will continue to be responsible for inspecting cars and licensing drivers and insurance. “The way it’s going to work,” Claybrook says, “if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does nothing more, the industry can do whatever it wants on driverless cars. The federal government will have opted out.” And of course the Trump administration is even less likely to intervene.   TRUCKING PRESENTS A paradoxical variation on the theme. Last summer, Michael Belzer, a professor at Wayne State University and one of the nation’s leading academic authorities on the trucking industry, was predicting that self-driving trucks wouldn’t arrive for 20 years. He said in an interview back then, “The technology is just not there.” But now Belzer says self-driving trucks might arrive in ten years, perhaps sooner. This past October, Uber’s Otto subsidiary caused Belzer to shorten his timeframe when an Otto self-driving truck equipped with $30,000 in software and hardware hauled 50,000 cans of Budweiser from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs. With a human driver sitting in the cab as a backup, the truck drove 120 miles on I-25, although the human did get the truck onto the interstate and took over again before the truck exited back onto city streets. Some experts predict that self-driving trucks will become widespread before self-driving cars do, because trucking companies are so eager to cut costs and have these expensive vehicles run nearly around the clock. “The trucking industry has a huge interest in not having to pay for drivers,” Claybrook tells me. For some long-distance trucking trips, companies may cut back from two drivers in the cab to one, and there’s talk of having convoys with two or three trucks, with a driver in the front truck, and one or two autonomous trucks following right behind. “One of the big questions should be what’s going to happen to this workforce,” Belzer adds. “A lot of these drivers voted for Trump. What’s going to happen to them? Our tradition in the United States is to hell with these workers and dump them. We get rid of that work, get rid of those jobs, and you, the worker, figure out what to do.” For now at least, officials with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters aren’t voicing much alarm about the possibility of truck drivers losing jobs. The reason: Teamster officials assert that self-driving trucks will continue to need a driver to help out in case of emergencies, to handle paperwork, to assure the safety of the cargo, to pull a truck into a warehouse. An analogy is aircraft. Planes have had autopilots for generations. Today, aircraft can virtually fly themselves—and do so in bad weather. But despite futuristic projections of pilotless planes, no serious person is pushing to have commercial jetliners without human crews capable of taking the controls. Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson, says, “We don’t see anything indicating that these vehicles will be able to function in real-life conditions, go long distances, especially through a city environment, without a human being. You hear these doomsday scenarios about jobs, but there are so many questions that still need to be addressed, like not knowing the reliability and safety, and then there are hacking issues.” Sam Loesche, a Teamsters lobbyist, adds, “We have not seen a situation where any responsible operator would agree that there’s a role for this technology without an operator in the cab. Our view is [that] the best piece of safety technology is the driver.” While insisting that drivers will continue to be needed, Loesche switches gears and says that in any conversation about self-driving vehicles, “workers’ jobs need to be a top issue.” He adds, “You can’t have the number of job losses you did in other industries and not see a role for policymakers and the government.” The main industry group, the American Trucking Associations, shares some of the Teamsters’ views. Pointing to issues like hazardous cargo, driving in cities, and interacting with warehouses and stores receiving merchandise, Chris Spear, the association’s president, told a federal transportation panel in January that ATA believes drivers “will retain an important role in trucking for the foreseeable future, even with automated trucks, just as pilots are still present in airline cockpits.” State Department/Public Domain Google Co-Founder Sergey Brin shows then-Secretary of State John Kerry the sensor displays inside one of Google's self-driving cars in Palo Alto, California.  Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, has a surprisingly optimistic—though somewhat self-contradicting—take on what driverless technology will mean for jobs. He says that in years to come, Uber will offer a mix of rides, some provided by drivers, some by self-driving cars. Kalanick foresees skyrocketing demand for improved transportation and says this would mean a continued need for drivers—for instance, to help many disabled or elderly passengers in and out of vehicles. “Many people predicted that the ATM would spell doom for bank tellers,” Kalanick says. “In fact, ATMs cut the cost of running a local bank so more branches opened, employing more people.” Kalanick adds, “Self-driving Ubers, for example, will be on the road 24 hours a day, which means they’ll need a lot more human maintenance than cars today.”   NUMEROUS CORPORATIONS stand to make a fortune from this new technology, and many consumers will benefit, too. “Well-funded companies see a lot of potential revenues at the end of this rainbow, and they all want to get there first,” says Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. “There’s lots of money to be made producing the cars, controlling them, managing their data systems, and collecting information about passengers. Companies will know when he’s going, where he’s going, what he’s doing. Talk about opportunities for targeted advertising.” Once autonomous cars become popular, Brauer adds, “there will be an explosion of new business models with billions of dollars up for grabs.” With driverless cars, Uber and Lyft won’t have hard-working drivers keeping 60 percent to 80 percent of the fares. Instead, Uber and Lyft will keep the lion’s share of fares, although some might go to taxes and fees and some might go to Google or whichever company runs the driverless cars’ data systems. “Their business model would go from having huge profit potential to having massive profit potential,” Brauer says. “The fight over whether the drivers are independent contractors or employees and the related litigation, all that goes away. It becomes an extremely desirable business model.” In their book, Driverless: Intelligent Cars and the Road Ahead, Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman point to another problematic effect of driverless cars—companies and their shareholders will grow richer as drivers grow poorer. “As machines take away human jobs,” they write, “one potentially devastating effect will be to further exacerbate the trend toward inequality, a growing global problem.” AP Photo/Jared Wickerham Pit Stop: Uber testing driverless cars on Pittsburgh streets, 2016.  MIT’s Brynjolfsson argues that we as a nation should make sure we find a way to share this prosperity and progress with the displaced drivers. The most important step, he said, will be to provide first-class retraining for them. Many economists say bigger and better retraining programs will be the key, even though the nation’s retraining programs have a less-than-stellar history because they often train unemployed workers for fields where there aren’t enough job openings. Help for laid-off drivers can take many other forms, perhaps including something akin to the trade adjustment assistance received by factory workers who lose their jobs to imports. A beefed-up version would be desirable, because trade adjustment assistance has often been underfunded and has not done enough to support and retrain laid-off workers. Harvard’s Lawrence Katz offers several other suggestions: wage subsidies, an increased earned income tax credit, and, if need be, a government-backed public jobs program. (That last idea is anathema to conservatives.) A big question is where we, in tax-averse America, would find the money to finance programs to assist displaced drivers. One option would be to impose a tax on self-driving vehicles—perhaps a tax on every mile traveled. At some point, Congress could step in and tell the many corporations eager to introduce—and cash in on—this technology that it will agree to a nationwide green light for all 50 states on one condition: that it enacts a law creating a special per-mile tax to finance programs that aid and retrain displaced drivers. “Even though this may not lead to mass dislocation,” Autor says, “it may further constrict the set of opportunities for people who don’t have specialized skills. Not to say that driving doesn’t require specialized skills, but it’s not up there with engineers or computer programmers.” Autor sees demand for skilled construction workers, skilled medical technicians, and skilled repairmen as opportunities for displaced drivers. As for those who do not retrain and develop special skills, Autor says, they might have to turn to lower-paying jobs as home health aides, security guards, or food service or cleaning workers. Brynjolfsson believes laid-off drivers should be retrained for many “different kinds of jobs and industries.” Many could be trained for sales or marketing jobs, he says, adding that there are huge unmet needs, in particular, in health care and other nurturing and caring jobs. But, he acknowledges, “a lot of truck drivers aren’t going to find much of this appealing. It will be a rough transition.” America’s retraining programs have often fallen short because they failed to place workers in jobs after months or years of retraining—often because the programs ignored whether there were opportunities in the fields for which laid-off workers were being trained. While education—whether obtaining vocational training or associate’s or bachelor’s degrees—would of course help laid-off drivers, it could prove frustrating if there aren’t enough jobs out there. An ambitious program to address the nation’s urgent infrastructure problems is badly needed, and that could create a million or more construction jobs, as well as long-term jobs maintaining and operating all manner of “smart” infrastructure systems, not to mention the newfangled auto repair stations and parking lots that will be needed for company-owned fleets of driverless cars. The nation’s renewed focus on preserving and creating factory jobs could also provide valuable opportunities for laid-off drivers. And it is of course important to strive for a full-employment, higher-wage economy that offers job opportunities not just for laid-off drivers, but for everyone. This is a long-term planning challenge that goes well beyond the question of how to re-employ the upcoming wave of displaced drivers. No one should expect a seamless transition for the many drivers whose jobs get run over by driverless technology. That’s where wage subsidies, earned income tax credits, extended unemployment insurance, and some form of adjustment assistance might come into play. Some advocates argue that universal basic income would be an ideal program for drivers thrown out of work and having a hellish time finding another job. But most drivers are eager to work and probably won’t want to just get by on a modest UBI. The development of driverless cars is a perfect opportunity for some smart public policy. We as a nation have years to plan, and there will be a rich revenue stream to draw from. Let’s hope that we, the world’s richest nation, adopt some smart, foresighted policies so that millions of drivers don’t get banged up in a head-on collision when this radical new technology takes the road. <a href="//americanprospect-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=dd04c2a44a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//americanprospect-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=92678&cs=dd04c2a44a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> About the Author   Steven Greenhouse was a reporter at The New York Times for 31 years and was its labor and workplace reporter from 1995 to 2014.

With 3,000 exhibitors, 2,000 conferences, and 200,000 attendees, it’s pretty easy to miss something at CeBIT. The expo is currently the world’s largest and most internationally represented, considered by many to be the barometer for state of the art tech, and current industry trends. Many of the technologies on display will go on to shape the future of how business is done. CBR is attending the expo in Hannover this week, so here is a look at a few of the best technologies from the biggest themes at CeBIT 2017. AI One of the biggest talking points in the tech industry is AI, and it’s in no short supply at CeBIT with intelligent machines set to be one of the main driving forces in the coming years. The ability to create a more efficient management system whilst minimising human cost and error is something of an ideal for businesses currently, especially given the increasing amount of data that is being dealt with. AI goes far beyond file management however; the intelligent systems can be used for a number of applications including smart city management, smart building management, and even customer service roles. Accenture have even gone in so far as to say that AI will become similar to a company spokesperson in how they represent a brand over the coming years. One of the more interesting demonstrations at this years expo was from Fujitsu which saw a small hub in the style of Alexa or Google Home but with a more pronounced physical presence. The smart machine is aimed to provide a customer service role and is a fully voiced small robot that can be positioned in various poses, giving it a much more personable feel than the disembodied voice of current digital assistants.   Drones Another big area of technology at Cebit this year is unmanned vehicles, such as drones. Drones have seen rapid growth both commercially and in enterprise markets in recent years, as the technology’s remote piloting represents a host of new benefits. This years CeBIT showed off the potential of the current state of drone technology in a large outdoor park, overseen by Intel, which was even attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. CeBIT promised to “connect like-minded and innovative people, who want to shape the use of unmanned systems across all sectors and industries” and it did not disappoint. One of the more impressive models on offer at CeBIT was Chinese Manufacturer Yuneec’s ‘Typhoon H’ model which is capable of recognising obstacles and avoid collisions independently. The model is also different from standard drones as it utilises a keyboard and mouse for control instead of a controller. The flying robot is capable of operating within a 30 mile radius for up to 60 minutes.   IoT One of the biggest buzzwords floating around the expo this year was IoT, which at this point encompasses virtually anything capable of connecting to the internet. The range of technological applications on offer at CeBIT ranged from connected robots, to smart city management, to intelligent dust bins, really. IoT was also the focus of several conferences this year, including the IoT summit discussing the platforms and applications within the IoT space, as well as designing and securing the infrastructure, something that has become a very real concern over the last several years. One of the more impressive applications this year was Huawei’s smart city operations centre. The in depth system gave an overview of an entire city showing heat maps of which streets were the busiest and where emergency services and public transport vehicles were geographically. The idea is that this information will lead to shorter response times and more efficient public transport, among other things.   Virtual Reality Virtual Reality technologies enjoyed a huge presence at CeBIT 2017, with half of one of the expo’s 17 halls dedicated entirely to VR. The recent push in gaming has seen high quality devices such as the Vive and PSVR adopted by mainstream audiences and make it’s way into millions of homes. Now that VR is an accepted form of technology, it makes sense that the enterprise would look to find a way to capitalise on this new audience familiarity. This years expo saw 170 speakers, events and products that all utilised the technology. One of the more practical applications came in the form of VR Event Planner from company Framefield. VR Event Planner allows users to collaboratively plan events and manage the space in virtual reality, the user can place, modify and configure objects in space. The budget remains in focus during the complete process.   5G Connected technology is rapidly approaching 5G, and the new data trafficking technology is expected to become available to consumers sometime in the next few years. 5G is also expected to radically increase the amount of data we consume due to its higher speed and lower latency. CeBIT showcased numerous possible applications for the hyperconnected technology, which Qualcomm estimates will be generating $12 trillion by 2035, including a VR demonstrating from Vodafone which accurately illustrated how 5G technology will quickly and effectively connect vehicles. 5G itself was not necessarily at the forefront of the exhibition, but it was very much shadowing almost every showcase. Much of the exhibitions in Hanover this year relied on communicating massive amounts of data through high powered connections that will become more readily available under 5G. Whilst it didn’t have a commanding presence, it was impossible to ignore its impact. Tags 5G AI cebit cebit 2017 Drones Homepage Top Feature IoT Sidebar Editor's Pick VR Previous ArticleWhat is 5G?

REUTERS/Lintao Zhang/PoolMore By Yuval Ben-David and Michael Martina JERUSALEM/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy may be 35 times larger than Israel's, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping to use that to advantage during a three-day visit to Beijing as he looks to reorient Israel's economy towards Asia over Europe and the United States. A week after U.S. chip giant Intel agreed to buy Israeli technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, Netanyahu wants to enlarge Israel's high-tech presence in China while encouraging further Chinese investment in Israel, where infrastructure and construction projects are growing apace. More than 100 technology executives have joined Netanyahu on the visit, with meetings planned with Chinese business leaders. Bilateral trade has been hovering at around $8 billion for the last few years, but over the past decade, Israel's exports to China have tripled to $3.3 billion in 2016, with technology - from cybersecurity to agri-tech - leading the way. Half the investments in Israeli funds in 2015 involved at least one Chinese investor, and 40 percent of funds raised by Israeli venture capital firms came from Chinese backers, according to the Economy Ministry.  "Israel is pivoting towards Asia in a very clear and purposeful way," Netanyahu said last month in Singapore, which he visited along with Australia. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Israel in the summer, underpinning the Asia trend. While the European Union remains Israel's largest trading partner, Asia is steadily closing the gap and politically it tends to put far fewer demands on Israel than the EU does. Matan Vilnai, Israel's former ambassador to Beijing, said China's interests in Israel were almost purely economic. The Chinese leadership seeks to learn from Israel's culture of high-tech innovation and doesn't push beyond that. "It's very simple: technology, technology, technology," he told Reuters.  Chinese firms are driving major infrastructure projects in Israel, including Tel Aviv's metro system and new Mediterranean ports in Haifa and Ashdod. A deal for 6,000 Chinese construction workers to come to Israel was signed earlier this year, with the possibility of extending it to 20,000. Ilan Maor, Israel's former consul-general in Shanghai and the managing partner of Sheng BDO, a business advisory firm, said he thinks China's leadership is keen to limit discussions with the Israeli delegation to economics, even if Beijing has become more outspoken on Middle East issues.  "The place (Netanyahu) can make a significant contribution is opening the door to more trade, moving forward to free trade, and making a clear message that we want Chinese investment," he said. The countries are negotiating a free-trade agreement, although it remains unclear how far advanced talks are. From Netanyahu's point of view, while China and Israel may be vastly different in terms of population, physical size and resources, there is a strong fit: while Israel innovates, China concentrates on mass marketing and commercialisation. "Given the basic infrastructure of initial and secondary development - airports, sewage lines, water - once you've done that, the way to go up and up and up is to constantly improve your products and services and utilities with technology," Netanyahu told Chinese business leaders in Bejing. "We are your perfect junior partner for that effort."

RWTH is one of Europe's leading universities, with a specific approach to connecting engineering and natural sciences. The university optimises and accelerates the development process for new products in an integrated approach that is supported by mathematical modelling and simulation, such as the application of sciences, including fluid dynamics and material science. The efficient use of high performance computing capabilities enables the development of simulation techniques for the flow of materials throughout the entirety of industry process chains. The system provided by NEC is built from more than 750 nodes, consisting of large memory SMP nodes and dual socket MPI compute nodes, with a total of over 19,000 computational cores capable of delivering a performance of more than 600 TeraFlop/s, which makes RWTH one of the top 10 German universities in terms of HPC resources. The nodes are connected through a high speed Intel Omni-Path network with a topology that allows continuous expansion of the system, matching continuous growth of HPC demands from RWTH researchers. The compute cluster is completed by a 4 PetaByte NEC LXFS-z parallel file-system capable of 60 GigaByte/s bandwidth. Moreover, a scalable ZFS-based Lustre solution provides advanced data integrity features paired with a high density and high reliability design. In addition, the system not only offers leading edge performance, but it is environmentally friendly at the same time. The servers are entirely cooled with facility water, which reduces the air cooling requirements for the computer room by 90 percent. The cooling system allows water inlet temperatures up to 30°C and the cluster can be cooled for free most of the year through a heat exchanger that does not require external cooling power. "We selected the NEC LX technology because of its superior performance, as well as low total cost of ownership due to innovative cooling technology," said Professor Matthias Muller, head of the IT Center at RWTH Aachen University. "Going forward, we are excited to work with NEC as a strong corporate partner in expanding our IT research."

Having provided chip designs largely regarded as being central to the smartphone revolution, ARM is today unveiling a new technology designed to be used in autonomous vehicles and machines such as robots. "We’ve gradually evolved how we design our high end processors over the years but this is a fairly major step change in the way we combine them," said John Ronco, a product marketing head at ARM. "We think it will be revolutionary in the way it enables our customers to build their products and design their chips." When applied to a product such as a driverless car the processor, called the DynamiIQ, will be able to guarantee that the vehicle reacts safely in the event of a failure when there is no driver to step in, ARM said. "From a safety point of view what we have here is unique," he said. "We don't believe there is anyone else on the market that can do this well."  The big players | Driverless cars When the design of the processor is licensed by ARM's customers it will mark the first time that top-end chips can be certified to the highest level, Ronco added.  ARM isn't the first microchip firm to set its sights on autonomous vehicles. Intel last week announced a record-breaking deal to acquire self-driving company MobilEye for $15.3bn (£12.5bn). The purchase adds to Intel's arsenal software that helps autonomous cars navigate and systems that prevent collisions. Earlier this year Intel launched its own chip designed to power driverless vehicles. ARM's new chip could also help the company challenge Intel in the fruitful data centre and server market.  Fitted in artificial intelligence and machine learning devices, ARM's new processor, will also be able to improve performance and efficiency, leading to cheaper products and longer battery lives, the company said.  "It will be able to process much faster and more efficiently than currently available processors," said Ronco. When used alongside ARM's software the chips could be 50 times better at undertaking AI tasks within three years, he added.  "We can only begin to envisage some of the things that our customers will do," he said. "Our customers constantly surprise us in terms of how they use the technology and I’m sure the DynamIQ will be no different, and used in exciting ways." ARM's microchip designs are licensed by tech giants including Samsung and Qualcomm, and used in around 85pc of the world's most sophisticate smartphones. The British technology company, which delivers around a billion units a month, sold to Japan's SoftBank last year for £24bn.  SoftBank this month announced it will sell 25pc of its stake in ARM to its $100bn technology fund, which is backed by Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.   Should we put our trust in driverless cars?   Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest READ MORE ABOUT: Self driving cars Gadgets Artificial Intelligence ARM Holdings Driverless cars Show more Technology latest 01:11 23 Mar 2017, 12:10pm When do the clocks go forward?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 21 March 2017 | MYT 9:30 AM Swiss smartwatches multiply as makers hunt millennial buyers Going smart: A staff member demonstrating the functions of a new Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 model watch in Brunnen, Switzerland. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. — Reuters Swiss watchmakers are diving further into the unproven smartwatch market, with Montblanc, TAG Heuer and Tissot seeking to attract younger shoppers with a technology the industry largely snubbed until consumers began turning away from traditional timepieces.  TAG Heuer on March 14 unveiled the new generation of a US$1,650 (RM7,315) smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the US$890 (RM3,945) Summit. Also on March 16, Swatch Group chief executive officer Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system.  With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc, and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in.  “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.”  US$15,000 watches  Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers – who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as US$10,000 (RM44,249), more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about US$15,000 (RM66,502). The original version of the Apple Watch starts at US$269 (RM1,192).  “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP.  So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel – Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines – have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely.  The latest releases represents a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honoured watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.”  TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, which is Swiss-made, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra US$1,650 (RM7,315) that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face.  Google, Apple  Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and in February Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Models from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system.  High-profile failures, such as the death of a US$17,000 (RM75223) luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android.  IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a previous forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9% in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39%, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.  The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch this week forecast a rebound in US and European markets after previously reporting improvement in Asia and the Mideast.  Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got slightly less than 10% of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he said.

(photo credit:JUDY SIEGEL-ITZKOVICH) A wide variety of subjects – ranging from “Jewish Misogyny in the 12th and 13th centuries” to “How to Reduce Salinity in the Kinneret” to “Artificial Intelligence in Games of Luck” – were tackled by high school students at the Intel-Israel Young Scientist Competition this week at Jerusalem’s Bloomfield Science Museum. The competition is the 20th in the museum’s 25 years. The competition for college scholarships reaches a higher level of difficulty every year, requiring greater levels of competence. Subjects are divided between environment and life sciences; history and social sciences; technology and computer sciences; and natural sciences and math. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. The teenage contestants appeared fully conversant with their projects, both theoretically and practically, when responding to questions from the judges. Some subjects were so distant from the Israeli high-school curriculum – such as “Conquests of the Mongolian Empire and their Influence” – that one might wonder what enticed the youngsters to investigate them. Others topics had practical repercussions, such as a device to make cardiovascular resuscitation more accurate and effective, and ways to introduce drugs into dental implants to make recovery faster. The winners will go abroad to compete in the Intel-International World Young Scientist Competition. With the $15 billion purchase of Israel’s Mobileye company on their minds, the youngsters must have looked forward to launching startups based on their own ideas. This year, 35 girls and 31 boys were named finalists. Winners will be announced on Tuesday. Relevant to your professional network?

JERUSALEM/BEIJING: China's economy may be 35 times larger than Israel's, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping to use that to advantage during a three-day visit to Beijing as he looks to reorient Israel's economy toward Asia over Europe and the United States. A week after US chip giant Intel agreed to buy Israeli technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, Netanyahu wants to enlarge Israel's high-tech presence in China while encouraging further Chinese investment in Israel, where infrastructure and construction projects are growing apace. More than 100 technology executives have joined Netanyahu on the visit, with meetings planned with Chinese business leaders. Bilateral trade has been hovering at around $8 billion for the last few years, but over the past decade, Israel's exports to China have tripled to $3.3 billion in 2016, with technology - from cybersecurity to agri-tech - leading the way.

Picture taken March 6, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam By By David Shepardson, Reuters Mar 21, 2017 at 8:14 pm | Print View WASHINGTON — The number of unmanned aircraft, or drones, in the United States will jump dramatically over the next five years, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Tuesday. The increase comes after the Obama administration in 2016 implemented new rules that opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. Policy makers are still debating whether to allow a sweeping expansion in drone use for activities like deliveries where aircraft would fly beyond the sight of an operator. The FAA said it estimates the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple from an estimated 1.1 million vehicles in 2016 to more than 3.5 million by 2021. The agency also estimates the commercial drone fleet will grow from 42,000 at the end of 2016 to about 442,000 aircraft by 2021. The aviation safety agency said there could be as many as 1.6 million commercial drones in use by 2021. The FAA said Tuesday the key difference in its estimates of commercial drone growth is in “how quickly the regulatory environment will evolve, enabling more widespread routine uses of (drones) for commercial purposes.” The FAA on Tuesday also predicted the number of pilots of drones is expected to increase from 20,000 in 2016 to a range of 10 to 20 times as many by 2021. Since August, the FAA has approved more than 300 waivers for drone use without some restrictions, including Union Pacific Railroad, BNSF Railway Co owned by Berkshire Hathaway , Intel Corp, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts , Time Warner’s HBO and CNN units. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told firefighters in a speech this month that “while drones have a lot of potential to assist responders, they can also pose a problem if not carefully monitored.” Current drone regulations require a certified pilot to stand ready to intervene in any commercial drone flight and keep a line-of-sight view of the aircraft. Both Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google unit have been exploring the use drones to deliver goods ordered online. The White House said last year unmanned aircraft could lead to $82 billion in economic growth by 2025 and support up to 100,000 jobs. The August rules were aimed at allowing drone use for agriculture, research and development, educational and academic use, and powerline, pipeline and antenna inspections, along with aiding rescue operations, bridge inspections, aerial photography and wildlife nesting area evaluations.

Netanyahu made the request of President Xi Jinping during their talks in Beijing on Tuesday. He is the first foreign leader to express concerns over the restrictions imposed last year. “I said that Israel’s a special case” because it “has significance for technology but it doesn’t have any significance in terms of volume on markets or currencies”, Netanyahu said after the meeting. He added that some start-up deals could not be completed ­because of the restrictions. China accounted for about one-third of foreign investment in Israel last year, including the US$4.4 billion acquisition of ­Israeli social media and mobile games business Playtika. Free trade and top tech: what China wants from Israel The world’s second-largest economy introduced strict capital control measures late last year as the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate increase drove up the US ­dollar index and exerted pressure on the yuan. The move has raised concerns over its impact on the level of ­Chinese investment abroad, after years of a buying spree on ­overseas properties, sports clubs and companies. The foreign ministry said in a statement that Beijing supported Chinese companies that were making legitimate investments in Israel. China and Israel pledged to step up cooperation on innovation during Netanyahu’s four-day trip. Observers said the foreign ­exchange restrictions should be reviewed, but that Beijing was ­unlikely to accept Israel’s request. “There should be differentiated treatment for those bringing medium- and long-term benefits, but it is hard to do now when ­facing the pressure of capital outflows,” Zhang Ming, a senior ­fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said. Xi Jinping urges two-state Palestinian solution in talks with Israeli PM Zhang said a relaxation for one country could lead to other ­nations, such as Australia – in which China is the second-largest investor – making similar appeals. Chen Fengying, a senior researcher with the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, said Beijing’s implementation of the exchange ­restrictions might have been “overdone in practice”. However, Tan Yaling, head of the China Forex Investment ­Research Institute, said it was reasonable for China to introduce emergency measures with the economy facing the pressures of falling foreign exchange reserves and yuan ­depreciation.

The first variant will come with a 7.9-inch display, alongside a 4GB RAM and 64GB/128GB storage capacity. The tablet will be based on Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box and is estimated to cost around 1299 yuan and 1599 yuan for the 64GB/128GB storage variants respectively. The next version of the Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 will be the Mi Pad 3 with a significantly larger 9.7-inch display. However, apart from the display, the rest of the specifications are likely to remain the same, with similar RAM and storage capacities like the smaller Mi Pad 3. However, this one is tipped to make use of an Intel 8750 processor and run a Windows 10 OS instead of an Android OS. It is estimated that the pricing is likely to begin from 1699 yuan. As of this moment, there is no information on the display resolution of both these Xiaomi tabs. At the same time, the processor, battery capacity, and camera sensors of these tablets from Xiaomi are yet to be known (except for the processor of the Mi Pad 3). The latest reports point to the likelihood that the Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 and Mi Pad 3 Pro could possibly be announced along with the flagship Mi 6, which is rumoured to be delayed till May.

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 graphics. Compact for a gaming desktop. Integrated carry handle. Runs cool and quiet. Cons Single-color LEDs on case. Lacks USB-C port. Bottom Line The Lenovo IdeaCentre Y710 is a compact gaming desktop that's ready for full HD and VR gaming. It's portable enough to carry from room to room, or to a friend's house for a quick multiplayer session. By Joel Santo Domingo The Lenovo IdeaCentre Y710 Cube (starting at $999; $1,699 as tested) is more compact than your typical gaming desktop tower, yet its Cylon-inspired case contains the power you need for smooth full HD and virtual-reality (VR) gameplay. You'll give up some expandability due to the smaller chassis, but you'll be able to view butter-smooth animation and graphics at full HD resolution, from virtually any game you load on it. There are larger gaming PCs that have better graphics and expandability for a similar price, but if you need portability, the IdeaCentre Y710 Cube is worth a look. //Compare Similar Products Compare CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra   %displayPrice%%seller% iBuyPower Snowblind Pro   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Predator G1-710-70001   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Omen X   %displayPrice%%seller% MSI Trident   %displayPrice%%seller% Velocity Micro Raptor Z95   %displayPrice%%seller% Origin Chronos VR   %displayPrice%%seller% Alienware Aurora (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus ROG GT51   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS Tower Special Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Digital Storm Velox (Core i7-7700K)   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Tiki (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% Keeping It Compact The overall design of this PC invokes a Cylon Centurion robot from Battlestar Galactica. The black case measures 12.38 by 9.93 by 15.48 inches (HWD), and weighs 18.85 pounds. The IdeaCentre Y710 Cube isn't quite as slim as the MSI Trident, but it's certainly smaller than the CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra, our current top pick for midrange gaming desktops. A top-mounted handle lets you carry the system easily between rooms in your home, or to your car for a quick trip to a friend's house. Flanking the handle are gill-shaped vents with perforated red inserts, adding a splash of color. A Y-shaped, backlit logo and two more LED light panels on the front panel catch your eye, even in a dark room. You can't change the red color of the LEDs; you can only adjust the brightness or turn the lights off. View All 8 Photos in Gallery Compact desktops typically offer very little expansion room, and the Y710 Cube is no exception. There's not much free space inside the case, aside from a single, prewired 3.5-inch hard drive bay. Both DIMM slots already house two 8GB DIMMs, for a total of 16GB. The other drive bays are occupied by a single 128GB (2.5-inch) SSD and a 1TB, 7,200rpm (3.5-inch) SATA hard drive. Likewise, the 8GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 card sits in the single PCIe x16 slot, and a Wi-Fi card is installed in the motherboard's M.2 slot. The Wi-Fi card is a Killer Double Shot Pro card made to work with your Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections simultaneously to help reduce lag. The desktop is fairly well-equipped, though it's relatively easy for you to swap out components for more powerful replacements later. Separate headphone and microphone jacks join a pair of USB 3.0 ports on the top of the desktop, in front of the handle. On the back panel, you'll find a set of audio jacks (including TOSLink), an Ethernet port, a PS/2 mouse/keyboard port, four USB 2.0 ports, and two USB 3.0 ports. The Nvidia GeForce card has a DVI port, three DisplayPorts, and an HDMI jack. Absent are USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 ports, but they aren't must-have items just yet. For instance, the iBuyPower Snowblind Pro lacks any USB-C ports, while the compact MSI Trident only has one (albeit without Thunderbolt 3 support). In any case, this PC has more than enough ports for a full HD monitor, a VR headset, a mouse, a keyboard, headphones, and a speaker system. The IdeaCentre Y710 Cube has a one-year warranty, which is on par with the competition. You've Got the Power With its Intel Core i7-6700 processor and 8GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 discrete graphics card, the IdeaCentre Y710 Cube is ready for any AAA game at full HD resolution. When we pumped the graphics quality to Ultra and set the resolution to 1,920 by 1,080, we were able to achieve smoothly playable frame rates in the Heaven (102 frames per second or fps) and Valley (106fps) gaming tests. Those results were very close to the frame rates of the iBuyPower Snowblind Pro, which packs the same GPU. When we pushed the resolution to 4K, however, the results were understandably less than playable, at 22fps in Heaven and 26fps in Valley. We consider 30 frames a second or faster to be a playable range. To get smooth frame rates at that strenuous a resolution, you'll need a more powerful graphics card, like the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 in the Acer Predator G1-710-70001 and the Cyberpower Gamer Master Ultra, but that, of course, ups the price tag significantly. VR gaming should be a piece of cake on the system, however, since today's top-of-the-line VR headsets are designed to work with the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or higher. See How We Test Desktops When you're not gaming, the IdeaCentre Y710 Cube makes short work of whatever tasks you throw at it, including multimedia tasks and more humdrum jobs. It posted strong results in the Handbrake (55 seconds), CineBench (813 points), and Photoshop (2:51) tests. All three scores were better than the Acer Predator G1 and competitive with the HP Omen X, though a bit behind the Cyberpower Gamer Master Ultra. The IdeaCentre Y710 Cube did beat the CyberPower system in the PCMark 8 Work Conventional test, however. A Solid Gaming System The Lenovo IdeaCentre Y710 Cube is ready to put you in whatever gaming world you desire, delivering smooth animation at full HD (1080p) resolution, with graphics quality set to maximum. The Cyberpower Gamer Master Ultra, our top pick midrange gaming desktop, offers more internal expandability and the power to game at 4K resolution, but its larger price tag—$700 more—may give you pause. A better comparison would be the similarly priced iBuyPower Snowblind Pro. While it's housed in a bigger case, the system has similar components, and offers greater expandability, slightly better 3D performance, a larger-capacity SSD, and a showy side-panel LCD. That said, the Y710 Cube is still worth considering if you need a little more portability in a gaming desktop.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS US Edition News Reviews Insights TechRadar Laptops/PCs Printers Hardware Software Mobile Working Security Networks VPN Data Centre Teclast X5 Pro review Microsoft’s Surface devices are an inspiration for other 2-in-1s By Desire Athow Tablets  Shares 1. Introduction and design 2. Usage and verdict Our Verdict The X5 Pro is, on paper, a fantastic product pitched at a hard-to-believe price. However, a great device is more than the sum of its parts, and this 2-in-1 sadly lacks some of the finesse you get with the big-hitting Tier-1 manufacturers. For Great value for money Top-notch performance Superb screen Against Touchpad should be better Aftersales likely to be an issue It was only a matter of time before Chinese vendors decided to go upstream towards more lucrative market segments where profit margins are higher. What started as a flood of cheap knockoffs has gradually transformed into a steady stream of better quality products that tend to get their inspiration from Microsoft instead of Google or Apple. Chinese vendors are now bolder and they no longer hesitate to take on the big names with expensive, high-end products. The Xiaomi Air 12 is one of many devices that have attempted to carve a niche at the top-end of the market with mixed results. But that won’t prevent others, like Teclast, trying something. This little-known manufacturer impressed us earlier this year with the Tbook 16 Power which took on the Surface 3, delivering a convincing performance at a fraction of the price of its rival. But the Tbook 16 Power is not the top of the range model from the company – that badge of honour belongs to the X5 Pro, a Kaby Lake-toting tablet that goes head-to-head with another Microsoft device, the Surface Pro 4. However, at £474 (around $585, AU$760) at the time of writing at Gearbest, this 2-in-1 is not cheap, and the price tag may give you pause for thought (that said, we’ve seen it available for as low as £380 – around $470, AU$605 – during one of the retailer’s numerous flash sales). These costs are exclusive of any taxes that may be levied by HMRC or the courier companies on behalf of the vendor. Want to buy tech from online Chinese retailers? Read this first. A quick look at what Microsoft offers shows that the cheapest Surface Pro 4 costs around 60% more with a worse set of components – although it does come with a free Surface pen and Windows 10 Pro. Design The X5 Pro embraces a tried-and-trusted design, one made popular by Microsoft: it’s a large slab of glass and metal. You get a massive 12.2-inch display with a thick black frame, and a Windows logo that betrays its origins, while the rear of the device consists of a magnesium alloy enclosure with a kickstand that opens at up to 90 degrees (in 22.5-degree steps). Like the Surface, the edges of the device are slightly tapered, which helps stability when held in your hand or placed on a surface. The power button is located on one edge of the tablet; next to it on the shorter edge there’s a volume rocker, an audio port and a microUSB port.  The latter is the odd one out. It is electrically active and we managed to successfully read a microSD card using an adaptor, but couldn’t charge a phone. It cannot be used to charge the laptop. The keyboard connector is located on the other longer edge with a proprietary power connector, a mini-HDMI port, a full-size USB port and a USB Type-C connector. There’s a front-facing 2-megapixel camera and a rear 5-megapixel one. All in all, it feels solid and very well made – the choice of magnesium alloy for the chassis makes sense since it is light, scratch-resistant and an excellent heat conductor. Our sample also came with a type cover, an almost perfect copy of the one that accompanies the Surface Pro 4, an active stylus and a 24W (12v, 2A) power supply unit. The proprietary keyboard, which is magnetically docked, costs £34 (around $42, AU$55) while the active stylus pen retails for £12 (around $15, AU$20). Spec Sheet Here is the configuration of the Teclast X5 Pro TechRadar Pro reviewed: Processor: Intel Core m3-7Y30 (dual-core, 1GHz with turbo up to 2.6GHz) Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 615 RAM: 8GB Screen: 12.2-inch IPS, 1,920 x 1,200, 10-point capacitive display Storage: 240GB SSD Ports: USB 3.0 port, USB-C port, micro-HDMI, microUSB, microSD slot, headphone jack Connectivity: 802.11ac Wi-Fi; Bluetooth 4.2 Camera: 5MP rear-facing, 2MP front-facing Weight: 911g Size: 299 x 202 x 8mm (W x D x H) Specifications The X5 Pro is powered by an Intel Core m3-7Y30 processor which has a 1GHz base speed and can turbo up to 2.6GHz on demand. Based on the Kaby Lake architecture, it has two cores and four threads, and reaches a TDP of only 4.5W in normal usage. Unlike entry-level processors, the 7Y30 offers two memory channels which should improve memory bandwidth. The integrated graphics have been beefed up as well with the 24 EU (Execution Units) of the HD Graphics 615 hitting anywhere between 300MHz and 900MHz. The GPU is powerful enough to drive three separate displays including the one that comes with the tablet, a 12.2-inch IPS screen that boasts 1920 x 1200 pixels, a slightly unconventional 16:10 aspect ratio. The rest of the specification includes 8GB of RAM (dual-channel LPDDR3), a 240GB SSD (M.2) from Forsee, an Intel Wireless-AC 3165 Wi-Fi module with Bluetooth 4.2, a microSD card slot (located under the stand) and a 38Whr battery. Note that there are two speakers (located near the hinges of the kickstand) and a microphone. Don’t expect any miracles from the speakers, although the sound was average (and undistorted) on maximum volume. It did sound muddled at times though, lacking clarity. The tablet on its own is a tad smaller than an A4 sheet (299 x 202mm) and is only 8mm thick with a weight of 911g. Adding the keyboard cover bumps that up a fair bit, though. 1 2 Current page: Introduction and design Next Page Usage and verdict GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join 13,000 TechRadar Pro subscribers!

AMD readies a fix for Ryzen FMA3 bug by Zak Killian  2:30 PM on March 21, 2017 The first major bug affecting AMD's new Ryzen processors was found a couple weeks ago by folks using the open-source processor benchmark Flops. In short, certain sequences of code using instructions from the FMA3 expansion to the x86-64 ISA can cause Ryzen machines to hang irrevocably. That means that even software running inside a VM could force a hang-and-restart on a Ryzen host. Fortunately, just days after the discovery was made, AMD confirmed to Digital Trends that it has already identified the issue and that it's preparing firmware updates to distribute to motherboard vendors. Originally created by Alexander "Mystical" Yee for his own purposes, Flops first appeared on the web as a response to a question at Stack Overflow. In the creator's own words, the app seeks to "get as many FLOPS as possible from an x64 processor." The software's first version was targeted at Intel Sandy Bridge processors. Mystical eventually updated the app with five specific branches targeting Core 2, Bulldozer, Piledriver, and Haswell CPUs. It's the Haswell build that gives Ryzen trouble, as it makes heavy use of FMA3 instructions to extract maximum parallelism from the CPU cores. Loading up the Haswell build of Flops v2 on a Ryzen machine will quickly make it hang. Folks on the HWBOT forums leaped into action testing Flops in other scenarios to confirm that the issue is related to the Zen core. As a result, all current Ryzen processors and motherboards are affected. It's good news that AMD already has a fix coming, although it's worth noting that the likelihood of encountering this bug in the wild is vanishingly small. Not only is there little software using FMA instructions (after all, they're only supported on Haswell and later Intel processors), but the hang is triggered by a specific series of instructions. Other applications using FMA instructions, including Prime95 and Y-Cruncher, aren't affected by the bug. Still, if you have a Ryzen machine, best go ahead and install those BIOS updates when they arrive. Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The resurgence of virtual reality is still in its infancy, and while we do have very good VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR, in other areas the tech is still severely lacking. Take interaction, for example, it's very difficult to convey touching something in the virtual world with physical feedback. But what if you could interact with real world objects that appear in the virtual world? Disney Research decided to carry out just such an experiment by asking the question: can you catch a real ball in virtual reality? The good news is, yes you can, but there's a number of prerequisites to achieving such a simple task. For us humans, ball catching relies on good hand-eye coordination, which means being able to track the motion of the ball as it flies through the air. The main issue with allowing good hand-eye coordination in VR is the inherent latency in the system. Too much latency means the virtual representation of the ball the user sees is not actually where the ball is, which makes it much more difficult to catch. To solve that problem, Disney Research setup a very low latency ball tracking system. It relies on an OptiTrack Flex 13 motion capture system, which tracks the ball at 120 frames per second with lag of just 8.33ms. The person catching the ball was wearing an Oculus Rift and the VR environment was created using the Unity 3D game engine running on a 64-bit Windows 10 PC powered by an Intel 2.5GHz Xeon E5-2680 processor, 32GB RAM, and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 graphics card. What the Oculus wearer sees is being rendered at 140 fps. In order for the virtual ball to be represented as accurately as possible in terms of position as it traveled, Disney needed to track and predict its position and velocity. They did this by using an Unscented Kalman Filter algorithm with the data produced from the motion capture camera. Related Koei Tecmo Creates 5 Sense Virtual Reality Machine Koei Tecmo Creates 5 Sense Virtual Reality Machine As the video above shows, it was possible to predict how the ball would travel through the air once thrown and therefore allows for a very accurate representation to the catcher. So good was the system, even with the virtual ball not rendered the catcher could rely on the predicted catch point to make a successful catch. As the Disney Research paper explains (PDF), the system was tested using 140 tosses with 132 balls being caught giving an overall accuracy of 95%. It proved to Disney that even with small latencies involved that aren't experienced in real life vision, accuracy remains high. That bodes well for a future where real and virtual worlds become more fully integrated, but there's still a lot of work to do to get there.

Katie Kim reports. (Published Tuesday, March 21, 2017) A 10-month-old baby born with four legs and two spines is recovering well after undergoing a complex and risky medical procedure in Chicago, doctors say. Young Dominique came to Chicago from the Ivory Coast in West Africa with an extremely rare parasitic conjoined twin. Police Warn iPhone Users of Potentially Dangerous Siri Prank Doctors say the bottom half of her not-fully-developed twins’ body was protruding from the infant’s neck and back. “It’s very rare because it was attached at the back of her spine,” said Dr. John Ruge, a pediatric neurosurgeon. “It was as if the twin from the waist down had been attached to the back of Dominique’s neck and there was a pelvis and bladder and functional legs that moved and feet coming out the back of Dominique’s neck. This was very dangerous for Dominique.” Lena Dunham Tells Ellen Weight Loss Doesn't Make Her a Hypocrite Ruge said the parasitic twin caused Dominique’s heart and lungs to do the work for two bodies and could have ultimately paralyzed her. Photo credit: Advocate Children's Hospital The child was brought to Chicago in February with the help of an organization called Children’s Medical Missions West and has been living with a host family while doctors at Advocate Children’s Hospital meticulously studied her case. “It’s really hard to even put a number on how rare it is,” said Dr. Robert Kellogg.

On Saturday at her Junior ROTC Ball in Waveland, Mississippi, she reuinted with her rescuer.(Published Tuesday, March 21, 2017) “If you can say love at first sight I think that’s true for us,” said Nancy Swabb, who has been caring for Dominique since her arrival. The Swabbs said the decision to take in the child was made quickly, with Dominique arriving at their home about a week after they learned of her case.

The family later learned Dominique had difficulties balancing and sitting up because of the added weight from the extra limbs. N. Korea's Latest Missile Test Fails: S.

We expect her to make a full recovery and live an essentially normal life from here on.” Dominique continues to recover at her host family’s Edgebrook home.

The Cybersecurity Podcast Passcode and New America have a podcast featuring the leaders and thinkers of cybersecurity. Sara Sorcher Staff writer | @SaraSorcher March 21, 2017 —Cybersecurity is not just about computers and digital processes. The most important, and most interesting, part of the story is the people behind the keyboard. Whether you’re an IT wonk or simply curious about this key issue now all over the news, we hope you’ll listen to the Cybersecurity Podcast, a regular program featuring key leaders and thinkers in this space. Hosted by Peter W. Singer, senior strategist at New America, and Sara Sorcher, deputy editor of Passcode, our half-hour podcast goes beyond the headlines to discuss some of the most pressing issues and newest ideas in cybersecurity. You can find The Cybersecurity Podcast on New America’s Soundcloud page and for download on iTunes or Stitcher. We’ll also be updating this page with each episode. Episode 23: How to Hack the Pentagon Last summer, more than 1,500 hackers targeted Pentagon websites – but it wasn’t a massive cyberattack. These were vetted hackers invited to participate in the US government’s first ever bug bounty program. Chris Lynch, the director of the Defense Digital Service, and Lisa Wiswell, the group’s digital security lead, explain in this episode of The Cybersecurity Podcast why letting researchers find security flaws in exchange for money or prizes is a big part of the Pentagon’s push to solve complex IT problems. This episode is sponsored by HackerOne. Episode 22:  What Congress can do to fight hackers The election may be over but Washington isn’t moving on from the election hacking story just yet. With the intelligence community blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for organizing hacks on Democratic political organizations to influence the American election to help Donald Trump, Capitol Hill is abuzz with talks of more hearings and new legislation. Cochairman of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, Congressman Jim Langevin joins this episode to talk about the challenges ahead. Also on this episode, cohost Peter Singer of New America discusses the president-elect’s reticence to condemn Russia for the cyberattacks and cohost Sara Sorcher of the Christian Science Monitor’s Passcode discusses Germany’s plan to fight fake news. Episode 21: Life After the OPM Hack The breach at the Office of Personnel Management was one of the most significant cyberattacks in history, and now serves as a cautionary tale for many in Washington and beyond. But what do we know about it a year later? How did it happen? What are some of the lessons the federal government needs to learn to prevent such major breach from happening again? To answer that question and more, The Cybersecurity Podcast crew interviews one of the authors of the US House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, John Costello, who spent last year on Capitol Hill as a Science and Technology fellow through TechCongress. Also on this episode, podcast cohost Peter W. Singer from New America discusses local cybersecurity challenges and Passcode’s Sara Sorcher talks about a new report from George Washington University about active defense. Episode 20: Cybersecurity Business is Booming With a diverse array of threats facing companies and governments around the world, what ideas will resonate with investors? On this episode of The Cybersecurity Podcast, we interviewed Sunil James, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist investing in information security for Bessemer Venture Partners. Also on this episode, podcast cohost Sara Sorcher from Passcode discusses her latest feature on 15 kids under 15 years old who are rising stars in cybersecurity and cohost Peter W. Singer from New America discusses his latest piece on the Atlantic, about how social media is changing modern warfare. Episode 19: Rise of the Machines and Deterring Russian Infowarfare Thomas Rid, professor in the department of War Studies at King’s College London, joins the Cybersecurity Podcast to talk about his new book, “Rise of the Machines,” a sweeping history of mankind’s growing dependence on technology. He also discusses the challenges of attributing cyberattacks and ways to deter Russian information warfare as hackers target American political interests. Also on this episode, podcast cohost Sara Sorcher, deputy editor of Passcode at the Christian Science Monitor, discusses the emerging private etiquette questions as more people bring personal assistant technology such as Amazon’s Alexa into their homes. Podcast cohost Peter Singer, strategist and senior fellow at New America, discusses his recent trip to Sweden, where officials are viewing cybersecurity threats in military terms. Episode 18: Government Hacking vs. Human Rights It sounds like a dystopian sci-fi novel, but all around the world, governments are increasingly breaking into personal computers and smartphones to carry out spy operations. Amie Stepanovich, who specializes in cybersecurity and privacy law at digital rights group Access Now, joins the Cybersecurity Podcast to discuss her new report that looks at government hacking from a human rights perspective. She describes some of the digital methods governments use to surveil targets and whether some hacks are better or worse from a human rights standpoint. Also on this episode, podcast cohosts Peter Singer from New America and Sara Sorcher from The Christian Science Monitor’s Passcode discuss the role hacking has played in the American elections so far – and the challenges this kind of information warfare might pose well into the future. (Note: Amie’s full report can be found at www.accessnow.org/GovernmentHackingDoc) Episode 17: All Hail the College Cyberdefense Champions Heather Lawrence is the president of Hack@UCF, the team of college students from the University of Central Florida that won this summer’s National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition. She and her teammate, Alex Davis, are part of a student club that has taken three consecutive championships in the country’s largest cyberdefense competition of its kind. On this episode of the Cybersecurity Podcast, these student champions discuss what it’s like to be part of such a high-stakes competition, what young people can do to make sure they remain ethical hackers, and how they plan to adapt to the quick-changing nature of technology. Also on this episode, podcast cohost Passcode’s Sara Sorcher discusses the hacker community’s reticence to adapt to politics infiltrating the traditionally hardcore DEF CON hacker conference. New America’s Peter Singer shares some stories from an unusual Mad Scientist conference meant to help shape the way the Army fights wars in the future. Bonus episode: How should the US respond to Ukraine’s power grid hack? On this extra episode of The Cybersecurity Podcast, reporter Jack Detsch brings you the highlights of a live discussion Passcode hosted in Washington on cybersecurity and the US power grid, featuring Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, deputy secretary of Energy; Thomas Fanning, chief executive officer of Southern Company; Congressman Will Hurd of Texas; and Robert Lee, cofounder of the cybersecurity firm Dragos Security. This bonus episode is sponsored by the Edison Electric Institute. Episode 16: 'Zero Days' Director Alex Gibney on Making Stuxnet a Movie Star Filmmaker Alex Gibney is known for his awardwinning documenteries on topics that range from Enron to Wikileaks, but now he’s taken on a tough challenge: Making a movie about a secret program that few people will publicly acknowledge. “Zero Days” focuses on the Stuxnet computer virus that’s believed to be the world’s first digital weapon. News outlets had reported that both the US and Israel were behind the virus designed to slow down Iran’s nuclear program – but even now, years after the attack on Natanz uranium enrichment plant, and long since researchers discovered Stuxnet on computers in other countries, the making of Stuxnet is still shrouded in secrecy. As “Zero Days” premieres in the US, The Cybersecurity Podcast team talks with Gibney about the making of the film, the often frustrating secrecy of official Washington, and his surprise when he found out that Stuxnet was just a small part of a much broader US plan targeting Iran. Also on this episode, hosts Peter Singer of New America gives the inside story of what it’s like to testify on Capitol Hill and Passcode deputy editor Sara Sorcher talks about the 18-year-old who hacked the Pentagon. Episode 15: Hackers Infiltrated Ukraine's Power Grid. What's Next? A massive power outage in December left more than 200,000 people in the dark in Western Ukraine. It was the first time a cyberattack successfully took down a portion of a country’s power grid. Rob Lee, cofounder of cybersecurity company Dragos Security and a former US Air Force Cyberoperations Officer, personally investigated the Ukraine hack. He joins the Cybersecurity Podcast to discuss how hackers took out Ukraine's electricity, what more can the US government and companies do to safeguard the American power grid, and the challenges researchers face when trying to test threats to critical infrastructure. Also in this episode: Podcast host Peter Singer, senior strategist at New America, discusses innovative ways to get more kids involved in cybersecurity – and not just at university level. And his cohost Sara Sorcher, deputy editor of the Christian Science Monitor’s Passcode, explains the surprising findings in her recent article about what the US government really thinks about encryption. Episode 14: Cybersecurity in 2020, Hacking Ships, and the Price of Bugs What will be the state of digital security in five and 10 years? That’s the question Steve Weber, director of the University of California - Berkeley’s Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity, and his team tried to tackle in a major research project. Weber joins The Cybersecurity Podcast to talk about the maybe not-so-far out possibilities that people may soon start to see insecurity as the status quo on the Web – and that with the spread of the Internet of Things even their emotions could soon be hacked. Podcast cohosts Peter Singer from New America and Sara Sorcher from Passcode, The Christian Science Monitor’s section on digital security and privacy, discuss the cybersecurity highlight from their own work this past month. Singer explores the relatively unknown threats to the country’s ports and ships – while Sorcher explains the sometimes-controversial process of deciding exactly how much a security flaw is worth in cash. Episode 13: The Coming 'Bloodbath' in Cybersecurity Business, Defending US Networks, and Bad Hacker Stereotypes Jack Harrington, vice president for cybersecurity and special missions at Raytheon, joins The Cybersecurity Podcast to discuss the role the private sector can play in helping government improve its security, the Defense Department’s cyber strategy, and innovative technical solutions to bridge the vast talent gap in this field.

Swire, a professor at Georgia Institute of Technology who also served on President Obama’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technology, says we’re living in a Golden Age of Surveillance – and that law enforcement is not actually “going dark” in its pursuit of criminals and terrorists but actually has more available data than ever before. Rick Howard, chief security officer for Palo Alto Networks and Army veteran, weighs in on the line between spying for economic advantage and state secrets; whether companies should be able to strike back when they’re under cyberattack; and if proposed threat information sharing plans will be effective. He also shares stories about how the military, in the early days of cybersecurity, took a stab at recreating science fiction. Episode 5: Bug Bounties, Stunt Hacks, and the Golden Rules of Breach Disclosure Katie Moussouris, chief policy officer for HackerOne, joins New America’s Peter Singer and Passcode’s Sara Sorcher to talk about bug bounty programs and how to incentivize hackers to help the private sector solve cybersecurity problems.

Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), Opinion Contributor - 03/21/17 03:10 PM EDT 21   © Getty Images Last week, Raphael Bostic was named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta—becoming the first African-American Federal Reserve Bank president. That’s right, in the Federal Reserve’s 104-year history, no African-American has led one of the 12 regional Reserve Banks until Bostic’s historic selection. I wholeheartedly congratulate Professor Bostic on his history-making appointment, and applaud the Atlanta Fed for making this long-overdue selection, but clearly more progress must be made. ADVERTISEMENT Did you know that our central banking system has also only had two Asian-American and merely six women at the helm of the Reserve Banks, and still has yet to put a Latino in this position? That’s nine out of 135 regional Reserve Bank presidents, over a ten-decade span. As Maya Angelou once noted, “…in diversity there is beauty and there is strength.” That strength is actually quantifiable. A 2015 McKinsey & Company report (Diversity Matters) found that private companies with more racial, ethnic and/or gender diversity were more likely to have higher financial returns. The McKinsey report concluded that “companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians” and “companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians,” among other eye-opening findings. To build a stronger economy, and to create economic and monetary policies that works for all Americans, we need the talents, skills and expertise of men AND women of ALL backgrounds. My bill, the Ensuring Diverse Leadership Act, H.R. 485, will do precisely that by ensuring at least one gender-diverse candidate and minority candidate are interviewed when there is a vacancy among the Federal Reserve regional bank presidents. The idea behind my bill is not a new one; it is modeled after a similar, almost 15-year-old rule taken straight out of the National Football League’s (NFL) playbook—the last place you might suspect!    In 2002, the NFL realized it had a diversity problem among its coaching staff. During the 82-year-old history of the NFL, teams had hired only six minority head coaches of the more than 400 head coaches throughout the League’s history—statistics strikingly similar to those at the Federal Reserve. Even worse, only two of the six were active head coaches at the time. Worst yet, a 2002 study found that black NFL head coaches—even with impressive winning percentages—were more likely to be fired and judged by a higher standard than their white counterparts. Enter the “Rooney Rule,” a policy envisioned and named after Pittsburgh Steeler owner Dan Rooney, which requires League teams to interview at least one minority candidate for head coaching and general manager vacancies. Since its implementation in 2003, NFL teams have hired 14 head coaches of color, with a peak of eight at any given time, which will be the number entering the 2017 season. Last year, the NFL took the Rooney Rule a step further, requiring the League Office to interview women for executive positions. Today, the Rooney Rule has moved beyond the hash marks and front offices of the NFL, and found a home in the tech industry and even the Halls of Congress: Facebook, Intel, Pinterest, Amazon, Xerox and Senate Democrats have all implemented their own version of the Rooney Rule. It’s time for the financial industry to follow suit.  In 2013, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study found that only 11 percent of financial firms and 17 percent of financial regulators employed minorities in senior management positions. Also shocking, the same report found that women represented less than 30 percent of senior management positions at financial firms and approximately 36 percent at financial regulators. Looking more generally at Fortune 500 companies, only 21—or 4.2 percent—are led by a woman CEO. As a member of the exclusive House Financial Services Committee, I have talked at length with Chairwoman Janet Yellen (the Fed’s first female chair) about the need for greater diversity in the boardroom and I have also closely monitored and spoken out in support of the establishment of Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWIs)—as required by Dodd-Frank—across all federal financial services agencies. Like me, Chairwoman Yellen believes the financial industry is behind the curve, and she has assured me the Federal Reserve and related-federal financial agencies are committed to attracting and retaining a more diverse pool of professionals. However, it is readily apparent that the Fed needs help, begging the question: how can the government tell the financial industry to get serious about increasing diversity, if we are not willing to lead by example? My bill will push the Fed in that direction, while at the same time bringing about change in our monetary policy AND the financial services arena. Talk about a win-win. Yes, selecting Bostic was a giant step in the right direction for the Fed and our country, but we have an opportunity to score a touchdown if the Ensuring Diverse Leadership Act becomes law.         Rep.

Corsair Vengeance RGB memory throws on a dreamcoat by Wayne Manion  12:30 PM on March 21, 2017 Corsair is making the jump from monochromatic LED-illuminated memory to the full-boogie disco party stuff with its Vengeance RGB DDR4 memory modules. Corsair's rainbow-colored offerings compete with RGB LED-enabled memory offerings from Geil, G.Skill, and Zadak5. Corsair says its RAM chip screening process, built-in heat spreaders, custom PCBs, and XMP 2.0 support prepare the Vengeance RGB DD4 modules for the rigors of overclocking. The lighting is controlled via Corsair's Link software and requires no additional wiring to clutter up the interior of a carefully curated case. The Link software allows the user to select colors based on simple preferences, or the lighting colors can be set to respond to inputs from temperature sensors, providing at-a-glance insights to system conditions. Corsair's marketing materials specifically mention say the Vengeance RGB DDR4 modules work with Intel 100-series, 200-series, and X99 motherboards. The motherboard compatibility list includes a selection of Z170, Z270, and X99 motherboards and does not currently include any lower-end boards. Corsair says it is working on lighting control for Ryzen motherboards. Vengeance RGB DDR4 modules are available in 2666 GT/s with 16-18-18-18-35 timings or 3000 GT/s with 15-17-17-35 timings. The modules come in 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB kits. All kits are composed of varying quantities of 8 GB sticks, so buyers will need motherboards with eight DIMM slots to accomodate the 64 GB sets. The 16 GB and 32 GB DDR4 3000 GT/s kits are available now through Newegg for $163 to $300. A wider range of offerings is available through Corsair's online store.

SimpliVity’s hyperconverged infrastructure appliance, the OmniCube, replaces storage switches, cloud gateways, high-availability shared storage, and appliances for backup and deduplication, WAN optimization, and storage caching. The company also offers OmniStack, the software powering the OmniCube, packaged for other vendors’ hardware. Now HPE has qualified that software on its workhorse ProLiant DL380 server and will sell it as the snappily titled HPE SimpliVity 380 with OmniStack, Mark Linesch, the vice president for global strategy and operations of HPE's enterprise group, said Tuesday at the Cebit trade show in Hanover, Germany. SimpliVity's website already lists the 380 among the product options, alongside versions of OmniStack tailored for Dell PowerEdge, Lenovo System x, and Cisco UCS servers for which it provided first-line support, handing off hardware matters to the vendors. The website still lists the OmniCube for sale, too. Linesch said HPE will continue to provide the same support for that hardware as SimpliVity did, although going forward, it hopes to see more customers on the ProLiant version. SimpliVity used to guarantee that the OmniCube would offer a 90 percent capacity saving across production and backup storage while improving application performance, and HPE will offer the same guarantee for the SimpliVity 380, Linesch said. Three versions of the SimpliVity 380 are available, with five, nine or 12 SSDs of a capacity of 1.9 gigabytes each. The servers have dual Intel E5-2600 v4 (Broadwell) processors, and customers can configure them with up to 44 cores. Depending on how much RAM is ordered, usable memory will range from about 140 GB to 1.4 TB. Depending on the configuration requested by the customer, the total cost will vary between $26,000 and $100,000, an HPE spokesman said. Last November, HPE released a software update for another converged appliance built on the ProLiant 380, the Hyper Converged 380. Building on the existing stack of VMware virtualization software and HPE management tools, the update added integrated analytics and multi-tenant workspaces to simplify the management of servers as a single resource pool. HPE's two hyperconvergence product lines will undergo some convergence of their own at some point in the future, combining the best features of the SimpliVity 380 and theHyper Converged 380 into a new product line, Linesch said. However, HPE will continue to sell the existing products, at least according to the slide he showed. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

In particular, the sources accused alleged "Russian agents" of using automatic computer programs (bots) that filled social networks with links to positive stories about Donald Trump when he started to lose in the election race against Hillary Clinton. "The bots' end products were largely millions of Twitter and Facebook posts carrying links to stories on conservative internet sites such as Breitbart News and InfoWars, as well as on the Kremlin-backed RT News and Sputnik News," the website wrote, referring to the sources. © REUTERS/ Jonathan Drake US Citizens Split on Russia’s Alleged Meddling in US ElectionThe stories, as the sources claimed, were completely or partially false. So far, there is, however, no evidence that could prove the allegations. FBI representatives declined to comment to McClatchyDC on this issue. Russia has repeatedly denied the accusations of the US intelligence agencies over its alleged involvement in the US election campaign. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called them absurd and did not exclude that it was another attempt to demonize Russia. On Monday, FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Admiral Michael Rogers testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee on the alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election. © Flickr/ Sunny Ripert US House Intel Committee Chiefs Agree on Scope of Russia Election ProbeDuring the hearing, both Comey and Rogers repeated the conclusions written in the US intelligence report released in January, which was mostly based on media publications and social media. They also confirmed that Russia did not in any way affect the vote tallies in the US. Comey also said that the FBI's investigation into the alleged Russia's interference in the US election campaign that started in July is still underway. The Russophobia trend has become especially evident in the fake news campaign that is designed to counter alleged Russian propaganda. In November 2016, the European Parliament voted in favor of a resolution, which said that Sputnik and RT posed a danger to Europe's unity and called for extra European Commission funding for counter-propaganda projects. It also drew a parallel between the Russian media and the propaganda disseminated by Daesh, a jihadist group outlawed in Russia and numerous other states. ...

Because there is no doubt whatsoever that they were right there with CNN in bashing Trump and trying to maintain the establishment. FBI, read the articles and read the comments screaming about how the articles suck and are biased against Trump. Make sure that makes it into your reports, fellas. Reply Gary F. 21:19 21.03.2017 | 2 | Edit | Delete The paradox of the superior accusing one of its subordinates of interference and disrespect to the territory of his own past may be too complex for FBI to solve. However, it will give quite a good load of though and processing, but as the concepts are twisted together in an incompatible way, mixing phenomena across the time as well, there barely can be any final solutions to be expected either. Well, maybe there is, a fake solution, or two.

They think a few websites can compete with CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, Washington Post, NPR, Daliy Beast, ABC, NBC, CBS News, Huffington Post, etc.?

Anyone with a brain and a computer saw this stupid propaganda effort and knew it would fail. Thae damage that the projectVeritas group did to her was epic, And the real live video of the stack of minions gloating about their powers was very plain to see. Trying to blame Russia for ANY of this home grown political gamesmanship is lunacy to feed the corrupt MSM and the many zombies watching it. Proof is there to those willing to see it, Keeping your eyes plastered with lies and bullshit MSM dung is not going to build a provable case. Reply Alan Reid 22:24 21.03.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete Use some logic here, Allegedly a couple of unnamed sources claim unproven actions took place. Can it be any more plain than this? Perhaps if i posted it on a shovel an smacked you in the face with it, then yes it could. Reply dc801 23:38 21.03.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete there was nothing positive about Hillary Clinton. All nonsense aside this was the most corrupt, evil and out of touch political candidate to ever run for office. Russian newspapers, or any international newspapers are under no obligation to write flattering pieces for a woman who was openly calling for WW3 and referring to the Russian president as "Hitler". The audacity is incredible. Russia did not change any of the vote totals (nor could it have the machines arent connected to the internet). This garbage needs to stop its all a scheme to discredit Trump because the MSM here in the West they cant handle that Hillary lost. the fact that some Americans buy into this narrative is embarrassing to this country Reply michael 00:53 22.03.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete well, they have nothing else to do in such an 'investigation'. :) Reply jlamenzo 04:35 23.03.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete Some American history: two examples of U S propaganda outlets directed at all European countries are 'Voice of America' and 'Radio Free Europe'. These outlets were designed to influence their listeners in all aspects of politics, economics, and religion. From my perspective I thoroughly enjoyed the coverage of RT and Sputnik News of the U S election and can genuinely say said coverage did not influence in any way how I voted.

This isn’t the first time March Madness has been streamed in VR. Last year, Turner Sports live streamed the finals live in 360-degree video in cooperation with CBS and Oculus. That first live game was free, but this year around, consumers will actually have to pay. March Madness in VR is coming with two pricing tiers: A golden ticket, which costs $2.99 per game or $7.99 for all six games, will offer access to multiple courtside cameras and dedicated VR commentary from Spero Dedes, Steve Smith and Lisa Byington. A silver ticket, which costs $1.99 per game, will offer access to just one 360-degree camera feed, and the same commentary that can also be heard on CBS’s national broadcast feed. The NCAA March Madness Live VR app, which is available in the Oculus store, is being powered by Intel. The chipmaker acquired sports VR startup Voke, which also powered the 2016 March Madness VR Live Stream, late last year. With March Madness, Intel is rebranding Voke’s services as “Intel True VR,” and also releasing a separate Intel True VR app in the Oculus store for other live and on-demand sports content.

By Peter Sayer Paris Bureau Chief, IDG News Service | Mar 21, 2017 10:16 AM PT Credit: Peter Sayer More like this A year after separation, HP and HP Enterprise are still trying to shed rust Intel ships latest Itanium chip called Kittson, but grim future looms Dell, VMware to Sell Bundled System That Supports Virtual Desktop... Video Surface Studio First Look: Features and specs Two months after acquiring SimpliVity for US$650 million, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is beginning to reshape the company's converged infrastructure offering in its own image.  SimpliVity’s hyperconverged infrastructure appliance, the OmniCube, replaces storage switches, cloud gateways, high-availability shared storage, and appliances for backup and deduplication, WAN optimization, and storage caching. The company also offers OmniStack, the software powering the OmniCube, packaged for other vendors’ hardware. Now HPE has qualified that software on its workhorse ProLiant DL380 server and will sell it as the snappily titled HPE SimpliVity 380 with OmniStack, Mark Linesch, the vice president for global strategy and operations of HPE's enterprise group, said Tuesday at the Cebit trade show in Hanover, Germany. [ Further reading: We tear apart a hard drive and SSD to show you how they work ] SimpliVity's website already lists the 380 among the product options, alongside versions of OmniStack tailored for Dell PowerEdge, Lenovo System x, and Cisco UCS servers for which it provided first-line support, handing off hardware matters to the vendors. The website still lists the OmniCube for sale, too. Linesch said HPE will continue to provide the same support for that hardware as SimpliVity did, although going forward, it hopes to see more customers on the ProLiant version. SimpliVity used to guarantee that the OmniCube would offer a 90 percent capacity saving across production and backup storage while improving application performance, and HPE will offer the same guarantee for the SimpliVity 380, Linesch said.  Three versions of the SimpliVity 380 are available, with five, nine or 12 SSDs of a capacity of 1.9 terabytes each. The servers have dual Intel E5-2600 v4 (Broadwell) processors, and customers can configure them with up to 44 cores. Depending on how much RAM is ordered, usable memory will range from about 140 GB to 1.4 TB. Depending on the configuration requested by the customer, the total cost will vary between $26,000 and $100,000, an HPE spokesman said. Last November, HPE released a software update for another converged appliance built on the ProLiant 380, the Hyper Converged 380. Building on the existing stack of VMware virtualization software and HPE management tools, the update added integrated analytics and multi-tenant workspaces to simplify the management of servers as a single resource pool. HPE's two hyperconvergence product lines will undergo some convergence of their own at some point in the future, combining the best features of the SimpliVity 380 and theHyper Converged 380 into a new product line, Linesch said. However, HPE will continue to sell the existing products, at least according to the slide he showed. This story has been corrected to give the correct capacity for the SSDs in the eighth paragraph.

DeepScale raises $3 million for perception AI to make self-driving cars safe Posted yesterday by Lora Kolodny (@lorakolodny) 0 SHARES Next Story Pit.ai puts a financial twist on reinforcement learning to outperform hedge funds According to the World Health Organization, human error causes more than 90 percent of traffic accidents across the globe. Some 1.25 million people die in crashes, and 20 to 50 million people are injured each year. Automakers are scrambling to develop cars with advanced driver-assistance systems that are so good they’re “crash-proof,” or fully autonomous vehicles, each safer than the next. But the automakers are somewhat limited by the computational resources onboard their vehicles. Now, a startup out of Mountain View, Calif. called DeepScale has raised $3 million in seed funding to help automakers use industry-standard low-wattage processors to power more accurate perception. Alongside sensors, mapping, planning and control systems, perception, (sometimes referenced as “computer vision”) enables vehicles to make sense of what’s going on around them in real time. DeepScale co-founder and CEO Forrest Iandola previously attained a doctorate at UC Berkeley working on deep neural nets and computer vision systems. His work there focused on, among other things, making AI systems learn to do something new in just a day instead of months of training. Iandola said, “Lots of deep neural network software out there is tied to processors like Nvidia’s. They make really good libraries for running neural net stuff quickly. We built our own libraries for fast, deep neural net computation on a variety of affordable processors, Qualcomm, Intel and the like. We’re using a lot of what we learned in academia on the commercial side now.” While he did not have permission to name the companies, he said DeepScale is already working on pilot projects with some major original equipment manufacturers in automotive. With the market for automotive systems, data and services forecast to reach $70 billion in revenue annually by 2030, DeepScale is focused strictly on automotive for now. But, the CEO said, the technology could be adapted over the long term for use with unmanned drones or robotics, which also need to accurately understand and respond to changes in their environment. DeepScale’s seed investors included: Bessemer Venture Partners, Greylock, Auto Tech Ventures, Andy Bechtolsheim (who was the first investor in Google) and Jerry Yang. A partner with BVP, Alex Ferrara, said, “Cars are moving from systems today where they have a large number of small computers, called ECUs, in them, to working with smaller more powerful computers for perception. But you have all these little sensors, lidar, radar, ultrasound, and each one brings its own view of the world. There’s a really interesting opportunity here for DeepScale to pull everything together and use info from all those sensors to make computer vision accurate and efficient.” DeepScale is competing for a share of this burgeoning market versus some 800-lb. gorillas in automotive tech, like Mobileye, now owned by Intel, or Bosch, but also other funded startups like Comma.ai, Argo and Drive.ai, which are trying another approach of building their own, fully autonomous vehicles or retrofit systems.

Lindsey Graham posed questions to Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch during the Gorsuch's confirmation hearing, Graham accidentally mixed up Samuel Alito and Antonin Scalia, saying that Alito had died when Scalia passed away last year. Alito is still alive. (Published Tuesday, March 21, 2017) Whoops — Sen. Lindsey Graham killed off U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito Tuesday morning. "Justice Alito passed away in February," the South Carolina senator said as he questioned President Donald Trump's nominee for the vacancy on the high court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. Gorsuch to Democrats: No Return to 'Horse and Buggy' Era Graham's comment came as he addressed the controversial decision by Senate Republicans not to consider former President Barack Obama's pick for the court, Judge Merrick Garland. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell argued in March 2016 that the American people should have a voice in the process. There had already been three primaries by then, Graham said. Lindsey Graham just mistakenly killed Samuel Alito: “Justice Alito passed away in February...” pic.twitter.com/XJfwVc2x93 — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 21, 2017 "The campaign season in my view was afoot," he said. There was only one problem: Alito of course is very much alive. Gorsuch Calls Trump's Attacks on Judges 'Disheartening' Graham meant Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13 last year.  He soon realized his error and said he had to correct the record. "Bad news, bad mistake," he said. Gorsuch: Judicial Decisions 'Not About Politics' Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch eschewed the idea of politics being a major driving force in his former judicial decisions, in a possible attempt to distance himself from the political controversies that surround President Donald Trump and Congress. He said decisions made on the bench are "not about politics."(Published Monday, March 20, 2017) For Gorsuch's part, the second day of his hearing went more smoothly, as he declined to comment on difficult topics Democrats pressed him on, including Trump's campaign promise to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. And he declined to respond to a question about the Judiciary Committee's handling of Garland's nomination.

(FSLR) Stock If You Have Money to Lose Why Vale SA (ADR) (VALE) Stock Is Still a HUGE Risk View All Posts If you have been following my coverage of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) since it made Lisa Su its CEO in October, 2014 you have done very well for yourself in AMD stock. Source: Shutterstock Dr. Su was given a clear roadmap by her predecessor, Rory Read, and she has executed on it flawlessly. She took job cuts and an inventory write-down, then took off on the strength of Radeon graphics and Ryzen processing chips. This was a $2 stock in January of 2016. It opened at $14.40 today, but took a 3.7% haircut as the broader market drops under pressure. Since the last time I wrote about AMD stock in December, it is up 30%-plus. Everyone likes AMD. They love its niche in gaming, and analysts are pounding the table for the stock, raising their price targets.  What should the savvy investor do now? Why, sell of course. AMD Stock Is Not Intel I have covered AMD for almost four decades — from back when it was the Jerry Sanders show — and the company has had a boom-and-bust pattern since before I got here. AMD will appear to be at death’s door, then pull some new products out of its hat and appear to be competitive again with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). But AMD is not Intel. Intel is 10 times bigger by market capitalization and 16 times bigger by revenue. Intel moves slowly, but it moves. And when it gets around to it, Intel always slaps AMD back down. Hard. AMD’s key advantage over Intel remains what it was in Sanders’ day. Price. Ryzen chips are much cheaper than their Intel competitors. They’re not faster, and not better than Intel’s Kaby Lake silicon, they’re just less expensive. This is always AMD’s modus operandi. Right about now, when analysts are predicting AMD will soon have better performance than its larger rival, Intel always has the same response: It moves to a new generation, it drops the prices on the old inventory, and it blows AMD out of the water. It’s as predictable as the mouse and the cat.

These new NVDIMM test reports can be downloaded from SMART's SMTL webpage. NVDIMMs tested at SMTL go through a comprehensive and rigorous set of memory validation procedures, the results of which are documented in each SMTL report. For over fifteen years SMART has been enhancing SMTL services for its customers and providing systematic testing of memory modules before delivering an approved test report. SMART's service now supports DDR4 NVDIMMs which contain persistent memory that is rapidly being adopted in data centers. Now with the ecosystem in place for NVDIMMs, including operating system support from Linux and Windows, datacenter software applications are emerging that take advantage of DRAM access speeds of persistent memory. In use cases such as Online Transaction Processing, transaction logging and write caching can now be done with direct access to persistent DRAM memory versus storage. This change eliminates the stack software overhead as well as the need to access storage such as an SSD (solid state drive) for dramatic application acceleration. NVDIMM adoption into the data center emphasizes the need for validated persistent memory. SMART's SMTL-validated NVDIMMs undergo arduous and thorough test processes to make sure the NVDIMMs are compatible in each system and that the backup and restore functions are performing properly. SMART has developed deep NVDIMM experience over ten plus years and offers a full lineup of SMTL validated DDR4 NVDIMM-N from 4GB to 32GB and speeds up to DDR4-2666. With its SMTL services, SMART ensures that its NVDIMMs are compatible with server and storage platforms from companies such as Intel®, Supermicro®, Tyan®, AIC and many others.

(AMD), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Semiconductors steal the limelight, as options activity focuses on AMD, MU and NVDA By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 21, 2017, 9:32 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Get in Early on Bank of America Corp (BAC) Earnings Monday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Tesla Inc.

(AAPL) and Facebook Inc (FB) Trade Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock While the Market Crumbles Buy the Coming Dip in Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock View All Posts U.S. stock futures are trending broadly higher this morning, as Wall Street looks to bounce back from Monday’s mixed session. Only the Nasdaq was able to eke out a victory yesterday, driven, once again, by strength in the semiconductor sector. Chips were also all the rage in the options pits yesterday, and could remain leaders in today’s trading as well. Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up a moderate 0.12%, while S&P 500 futures have added 0.22% and Nasdaq-100 futures are hinting at record highs with early gains of 0.25%. On the options front, volume dipped sharply yesterday, as only about 12.4 million calls and 11.1 million puts changed hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio once again moved higher, arriving at 0.64, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.63. Semiconductor manufacturers were among the top vote-getters in Monday’s options activity. Leading the charge was Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) after Jefferies & Co. boosted its price target on AMD stock and said the company could steal marketshare from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Elsewhere, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) attracted a flood of call options as traders prepared for Thursday’s quarterly earnings report. Finally, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was reiterated with a “buy” at Goldman Sachs, broke above its 50-day moving average and was lifted by news of strong Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR) (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) Switch sales. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) AMD stock was back with a vengeance on Monday, as the shares rallied nearly 7% after Jefferies & Co. reiterated its “buy” rating and lifted its price target to $16 from $13. According to Jefferies, AMD can steal market share from industry leader Intel, with the brokerage firm laying out scenarios in which AMD could capture up to 15% of the server, desktop and notebook markets. The report rallied AMD call options traders, as these typically bullish bets accounted for 60% of the more than 540,000 contracts traded on the stock. What’s more, sentiment continues to rise on AMD among near-term options traders, with the April put/call open interest ratio falling from a reading above 0.90 last month to its current perch at 0.74. In layman’s’ terms, calls are being added at a faster pace that puts, indicating rising bullish expectations from speculative short-term traders. With AMD stock on the rise, this growing preference for calls could be a sign that smart money is moving back into the shares.

Meet the winner of one of the country’s most prestigious science fairs. The Washington Post Moriah Balingit 1 day ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Love-cheat golf legend sues wife for £5m in divorce battle Islamic State claims it was behind Westminster terror attack © Courtesy of Society for Science and the Public Indrani Das displays her project, which explores the death of neurons, at the Regeneron Science Talent Search last week. Das won the top prize and $250,000 for the project. Indrani Das has been fascinated with brain injuries since her freshman year of high school, when she learned that their effects can be devastating and irreversible. Later, her fascination evolved into a full-fledged research project. Das, now 17 and a senior at the Academy for Medical Science Technology in Hackensack, N.J., explored how brain damage occurs, examining a process called astrogliosis, which can lead to the excess production of a toxin that can damage neurons. If she and other researchers could better understand how brain damage occurs, perhaps they could figure out how to slow or reverse the process. “My work centers on repairing the behavior of supporting cells to prevent neuron injury and death,” Das said. “It was really that shock of what it can do to a person that pushed me to work” on research involving brain injuries. Das’s project, which explores the role of brain cells called astrocytes in the death of neurons, was awarded the top prize and $250,000 at the Regeneron Science Talent Search. Das bested thousands of high school scientists from across the country. The talent search selected 40 finalists, who traveled last week to D.C., where a selection committee grilled them on their work and put them through the ringer, testing their grasp of scientific concepts and their ability to solve problems. Four of the finalists were from the Washington area: Prathik Naidu of Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County; David Rekhtman  of Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda; and Sambuddha Chattopadhyay and Rohan Dalvi, both of Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring. Naidu placed seventh, taking home $70,000 for his project, which  created 3-D models of the genetics of cancer cells, using a computer program he built. The Science Talent Search, previously sponsored by Intel, is one of the best-known and among the most competitive science fairs for young researchers. This year, the talent search gave out $1.8 million to 40 finalists, much of which will go to cover college tuition for the budding researchers. Maya Ajmera,  president and chief executive of the Society for Science and the Public, said the finalists are often well-rounded and driven by their desire to make the world a better place, an altruism that is reflected in extracurricular activities. Das, who hails from Orendell, N.J., recently became a certified emergency medical technician and is already working with patients, helping to transport them to hospitals. While she is deeply fascinated by research, she also hopes to become a practicing physician so she can work with patients. “I would say my happiest time is when I’m with my patients,”  Das said. “I love connecting with people and understanding how I can help them. It keeps me human.” She plans to use the prize money to help pay for college and medical school. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Andrew Napolitano is a senior judicial analyst who has worked at Fox News Channel since 1998, and frequently comments on the Fox Business Network.  (Evan Vucci / The Associated Press)   By David BauderThe Associated Press Tues., March 21, 2017 NEW YORK—Fox News Channel has pulled legal analyst Andrew Napolitano from the air after disavowing his on-air claim that British intelligence officials had helped former U.S. president Barack Obama spy on Donald Trump. A person with knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a personnel matter said Napolitano has been benched and won’t be appearing on the air in the near future. Fox had no immediate comment Monday. Napolitano’s report last week on Fox & Friends, saying he had three intelligence sources who said Obama went “outside the chain of command” to watch Trump, provoked an international incident. Britain dismissed the report as “nonsense” after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer quoted it in a briefing, part of the administration’s continued defence of Trump’s unproven contention that Obama had wiretapped him at Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign. Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump FBI Director James Comey, testifying before Congress on Monday, became the latest official to state that no evidence has been found to support Trump’s charge.

I've spent the past few days hunkered down in my office poring over reams of information, and there's no doubt in my mind that's where we are with Ekso Bionics Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq: EKSO). The conclusion I've reached may surprise you. It's an update neither you nor your wallet want to miss. The Wrong Perspective Could Cost You $1.38 Million Take a seat… please. Put your cell phone aside and set down the drink in your hand. I'm going to tell you a story that upsets a lot of investors and I don't want you to spill… or choke. I've spent 35 years in global markets as a consultant, analyst, and trader, and if there's one thing I've learned from evaluating thousands of companies, it's that every single one has a defining "make or break" moment. For some, like Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB), it's releasing a disruptive technology that catches the world by storm. For others, like Eastern Airlines, it's the moment they close the doors forever despite having been a trailblazer. And for still more companies, like Monster Beverage Corp. (Nasdaq: MNST) or Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), it's the moment where they transition from a startup to a mature player ready to dominate their industry. It's hard to tell which is which unless you know what to look for and how to frame what you find in terms that make sense. So, let me set the stage. Think back to 1997. Enamored by the prospect of making a gazillion dollars overnight because of the media circus surrounding the latest crop of "unicorns" and a bull market that roared to new highs despite overwhelming odds, many investors confused patience with genius. Twenty years ago, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) – yes, THAT Apple – was on the tail end of 18 consecutive months of financial losses. Its market share was a mere 4% of the PC market, and Club Cupertino was hemorrhaging more than a $1 billion a year. The stock had fallen more than 50% and the company's balance sheet was so bad that to call it a "loser" would have been an insult to actual losers. Rival PC maker CEO Michael Dell even went so far as to openly mock Apple, saying that if he ran the place he would "shut it down and give the money back to shareholders." Obviously, that didn't happen. Today, Dell is the one who's struggling and Apple is on the verge of becoming the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization approaching $750 billion. Investors who stayed the course despite overwhelming odds and dim prospects 20 years ago have turned every $10,000 invested then into $1.38 million today. It's the stuff of legend. Which is why you've got an important choice to make when it comes to Ekso. Are You a Speculator or an Investor? From the very first moment I walked in Ekso's door, I knew the company was on to something special, and I challenge you to think differently given what they've achieved by helping stroke victims and people with traumatic spinal injuries become mobile again. Watch these two videos if you're uncertain: Sascha Miami Valley Testimonial Dan Summit Alta Bates Testimonial The U.S. spinal cord and stroke rehabilitation segment all by itself is a $20+ billion market; overseas applications may double that figure. More than 71.4 million steps have been taken by people who otherwise would never take one again thanks to Ekso products used in more than 130 rehabilitation centers around the world at last count. Then, there's the $21 billion industrial and construction industry market where EksoWorks products are helping workers achieve more with less fatigue, better quality, and fewer injuries from high-frequency, long-duration tasks. This video from United Rental will give you a quick look at why they've become one of Ekso's largest customers very quickly. And, finally, the military robotics market may be $21.11 billion by 2020, which represents a compound growth rate of roughly 9.27%, according to MarketsandMarkets. Here's a video simulating the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit, or TALOS for short. I wouldn't want to be a bad guy when this thing comes through the door! Ekso has just had its best quarter ever, booking $2.3 million in revenue – $573,000 of which came from the industrial market. That's a 324% increase in 12 months for a market that literally didn't exist a year ago. I can easily imagine a series of doubles in the next 12 months if sales continue to grow at this pace. Further, the company has raised more than $100 million, holds 279 patents worldwide (of which 140 are issued and the rest are in prosecution or provisional), and is moving further into sales channels by leveraging early adopters like the Kessler Foundation, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Swiss Paraplegic Centre. Yet, Ekso's stock has dropped 50% over the past 18 months to $2.75, where it's trading as I write. So Now What? Ekso has to put some numbers "on the board" quickly or risk the wrath of increasingly impatient investors, just as Apple did 20 years ago. I won't mince words. This is Ekso's "make or break" moment. The company's latest 10-K report suggests they have enough cash on hand to survive through the end of the third quarter. I see three possibilities. First, the company raises more capital, broadens marketing efforts, and continues operations. The markets recognize that as it becomes profitable. Prices rise accordingly as revenue begins to match expectations. This is complicated by a shareholder base that is largely individual, short-term oriented, and fickle, as opposed to institutional, longer-term focused, and stable. I bring this up because most individuals think additional capital raises are dilutive when, in fact, companies do them all the time as a means of growing faster and more profitably than they would otherwise. Tesla Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA), not coincidentally, is getting ready to do the same thing. Second, the company sells to a much bigger player with deeper pockets that can capitalize the long-cycle sales process and development at the same time. This is a viable alternative for management and shareholders alike. It's also very typical for growing companies with the kind of valuable intellectual property like Ekso has that just need a little "umppph." Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Intel… between them they've probably purchased more than 100 smaller companies with attractive technology. And that's worked out well for long-term shareholders. I've long thought that Medtronic Plc. (NYSE: MDT) would be a suitable buyer, as was the subject of unconfirmed rumors last month. However, I could also envision a defense contractor moving in simply because so much of the intellectual property could easily cross over to military applications. Or even Google X, for that matter. Third, the company simply shuts down. Frankly, I have a hard time imagining this would happen. At this point, Ekso's intellectual property portfolio could be worth $75 million to $100 million, or roughly 30% to 80% more than the current market capitalization at $2.75 a share. Factor in the discounted cash flow associated with existing sales channels and the combined market potential of both the medical and industrial markets, and another few hundred million dollars isn't inconceivable. Now comes the tough part. You've got to decide if you're an investor willing to take a longer-term leap of faith based on extraordinary market potential and disruptive technology or a short-term trader willing to dance like a kite in a hurricane. As much as I'd like to, I can't make that decision for you because I don't know your individual risk tolerance, nor do I know your individual investment objectives. My preference, of course, is that you approach Ekso as an investor. If you're following along as directed, that means: a) limiting your investment to 2% of overall holdings to control risk and b) making sure that Ekso is part of a larger, disciplined investment strategy like the 50-40-10 portfolio we talk about frequently. Unbelievably, it also means you think very seriously about buying more Ekso stock. "Buy low, sell high" is how the game works, and the path to profits. If you're not yet fully invested – meaning that your Ekso position is less than 2% of your overall investable assets – then you can afford to "tank up" – meaning buy more shares – to the point where you reach the 2% threshold. Much the same way as dollar-cost averaging, this actually improves your profit potential even if the company ultimately blows up. If you've got more than 2% tied up in Ekso stock, then you're overexposed and taking on too much risk. In that case, consider unloading enough shares so that the amount of money you have at risk drops back under the 2% Rule of Thumb. And, if you're holding Ekso shares having already converted them to a "free trade" early on, then you've got nothing to worry about and don't have to do a thing. I know it's not easy; situations like this never are. Then again, neither was the decision facing Apple investors under very similar circumstances in 1997… …do I hold on or buy more? I will be with you every step of the way. Until next time, Keith The post Update: Ekso Bionics: "Make or Break" Moment appeared first on Total Wealth. Join the conversation.

I think your description is apt…a story stock indeed. We've had "show" and now we need "tell" which is, not coincidentally, something every company has to do when it hits the make or break moment. Best regards and thanks for being part of the Money Morning Family, Keith :-) Reply Glenn Timberlake | March 22, 2017 What about BNKL? Bionic Laboratories. About $.51. (What is this? bid 0.0500 and ask 80.00 at vol 17781?) Stock has been struggling, also. But has made some significant progress in a similar if not the same field. EKSO shows $3.34 today. Thanks. Love your research and reports. Reply Keith | March 22, 2017 Thanks for the heads up and, of course, the kind words as well. Let me take a look. As for the numbers, that's not atypical for a penny-stock trading in illiquid conditions when the bid/ask spread gets wide enough that you can drive a Mack truck through.

Over a year after release, the game continues to receive free updates from Ubisoft to add new maps, operators, and weapons. If you’re new to the game and looking for advice, we’ve rounded up some of the top tips and tricks so you can catch up to longtime players. I’ve sunk over 400 hours into Siege and am learning all the time. That said, there are a number of basics that you should know before hitting the battlefield to ensure that you’re a valuable asset to your team. If you think we’ve missed an important tip for new players, please be sure to let us know in the comments below. 1. Play the Situations There’s no single-player campaign, unlike in the recent shooter Sniper Elite 4, but the next best thing are the Situations. There are 11 different missions to play through, each built to help you get to grips with some of the maps and operators. While each has its own objective, be it killing all the terrorists or extracting the hostage, there’s also three challenges per Situation designed to increase your skill. Some challenges require you to perform a certain amount of headshots, finish the mission without losing much health, or use your operator’s gadget in a particular way. Each challenge that you complete will earn you 200 Renown (Siege‘s in-game currency), which you can then use to unlock operators, weapon attachments, and more. You can play through the Situations as many times as you like. If you think you’ve messed up, just restart and learn from your mistake. Along with Terrorist Hunt, these are great offline environments to get used to how the weapons handle, what the operators’ unique gadgets do, and the best way to approach various situations. 2. Learn the Maps As a new player, your biggest disadvantage is that you don’t know the maps. That’s probably obvious and something you’re painfully aware of. This game is all about understanding your position compared to the enemy, knowing what angles to hold, and what you can destroy. You need to be aware of your surroundings and know where the enemy can come from. Are you in sight of a camera? What’s the quickest route for you to get to the objective? Can you safely rappel up that wall? Chances are, a lot of your deaths occur because you are caught unaware. The ultimate way to combat this is to just keep playing. Nothing beats being in a real match, seeing how other people operate, and learning from your mistakes. However, there’s value in solo practice too. There are a couple of ways to do so. First, you can jump into a Lone Wolf Terrorist Hunt and run around while killing enemies at the same time. Alternatively, create a custom private game on hostage mode, and kill the hostage when you want to switch sides. Roam the map, trying out all the different routes on a floor, and pay attention to where the stairs and ladders are. Be sure to note camera positions, too. When you’re feeling more confident, turn your focus to the environment. Remember how rooms connect to one another — horizontally, but also vertically. Destructible environments are key in Rainbow Six, so take some shots and figure out what you can shoot through or open up to create new routes or line of sights. You can get aid with this from the awesome resource R6Maps. Here, you can get a top-down view of every map and see the objective points, drone tunnels, hatches, and more. 3. Master a Few Operators Excluding the Recruit, Rainbow Six Siege features thirty operators at time of writing, split between attackers and defenders. That number will increase over the coming year as the developers continue to provide free updates, a rarity from a big developer nowadays Big Game Studios Are Killing the Video Game Industry Big Game Studios Are Killing the Video Game Industry The big names in gaming—like EA, Square, Valve, Blizzard, and Ubisoft—have a big problem. They've lost sight of their most important market: gamers. Read More . As such, it can be a bit overwhelming knowing where to start. I’d recommend starting with the characters that sound most appealing to you. Besides, you’re here to have fun, so first check out those who sound the coolest. That said, there are some operators who are more advanced than others. Caveria can quietly sneak around and interrogate people to reveal their teammates’ positions, but this requires keen map knowledge. Similarly, Pulse has a scanner which can detect heartbeats, but he’s best played when you know what is destructible. If you’re looking for some beginner-friendly operators, try Sledge and Ash on attack and Rook and Smoke on defense. Assuming you don’t intend to spend real money, you can use Renown to purchase more operators. Renown is best earned by playing more matches and completing daily challenges. You’ll rack it up quickly without noticing, by which time you’ll have already begun mastering the operator you’ve been using. Then you can unlock another and do it again! 4. Adjust Your Loadout There’s a variety of guns to choose from, including assault rifles, submachine guns, and shotguns. They all handle uniquely, deal different amounts of damage, and will react in a particular way once fired. Each operator has access to a particular set of weapons, and you can customize their design and attachments. The former purely because it’s fun to change the skin of your gun, while the latter has tactical benefits. You can put different sights onto your gun, like an ACOG or red dot, to make aiming easier. You can also apply a grip to increase the speed at which your operator moves their gun from hip to sight. As you adjust your loadout, pay attention to the values like damage and recoil to see how your changes are impacting the weapon. No matter which gun you use, it’s important to remember that a headshot is always a one-bullet kill in this game. Aim for the head and you’ll take enemies down more efficiently. It’s wise to adjust your loadout at the start of the round depending on the map and your intended play style. If on Plane, a tight map, you might want to take a shotgun for close range and aggressive combat. If you fancy being a bit more sneaky, perhaps you should equip the silenced pistol. It’s up to you how you play and you’ll soon work out what is best for you. 5. Pay Attention to Sound Sound is so important in Rainbow Six Siege. You’ll want to turn your in-game volume up so that you can hear everything clearly. Don’t have your team chat too loud, else it’ll mask the more important game audio. If you can, invest in some good quality headphones The 10 Best Wired Headphones of 2016 The 10 Best Wired Headphones of 2016 Looking for the best wired headphones? We've covered 10, ranging from ultra budget to super high end! Read More , though you can play with decent speakers too. Absolutely everything you do makes a sound. There’s the obvious stuff like walking and rappelling, but consider that aiming down your sights or turning on the spot also emits noise. Different floors make different noise too, so walking on carpet is quieter than stepping on metal. Sometimes making a sound is unavoidable, but you can learn to adjust your movement based on what’s happening around you. A huge amount of gunfire? Time to sprint because chances are no one will hear it over the bullets. If you hear something to your left or right, that doesn’t mean someone is on that side — it just means that’s your shortest route to get to them. Use this knowledge to your advantage to get the one-up over your opponent. For example, if you hear them deploy a drone, consider rushing for the kill. If you hear a breaching charge placed, shoot it off the window. Reckon there’s someone on the hatch above? Quickly chuck and detonate your C4. 6. Be Frugal With Drones Drones are extremely useful and should be treated with care. If you use them effectively, you’ll know exactly where your enemy is and take them completely by surprise. Attackers get 45 seconds when the round starts to drone the map and hunt the objective. However, remember that your four teammates are doing the same thing. Once the objective has been marked, look for the enemy characters and focus your drone on them for a few seconds. This will add their operator symbol to the top interface, allowing your team to know who they’re up against. During this stage, do not spot the enemy with the red marker. Not only is the intel useless, since by the time you spawn everyone will have moved, but it’ll notify the defense that your drone is there and they’ll destroy it. Instead, move somewhere out of sight — perhaps in a shadowed corner or atop a cabinet, since your drone can jump. Use the drone holes and gaps beneath barricades to your advantage to quickly sneak between rooms. Now, when you start attacking, you’ll have that drone ready to go, plus an extra in your inventory for later use. Drones are noisy and emit a red light when active. As a defender you need to make it a priority to pay attention to these signs and destroy drones as quickly as you can. You don’t want the attackers to have eyes on you. If you’re playing as Mute, get your Signal Disruptor gadget down as quickly as possible at round start, preferably near doors and drone holes. If you’re on attack and notice your drone view is getting distorted, consider turning around and approaching from another angle. Run completely into a Signal Disruptor and your drone will be useless until someone destroys the gadget. 7. Teamwork Is Everything Rainbow Six Siege is not a game where you should go Rambo. Nine times out of ten, you’re better off sticking with the group. Each operator possesses a unique skill that compliments the team. Let’s say you encounter a reinforced wall that is jammed by Mute. You can use Thatcher’s EMP grenades to get rid of the jammer, Thermite’s breaching charge to open the wall, then push through with Montagne’s shield and Sledge as Glaz snipes from a distance. If you’re own your own, you’re likely to get flanked or blocked off by the enemy and you’ll have no one to support you. This is so much easier if you’re all using microphones to communicate to one another. Sure, you can type, but who has time to do that during a game as intense as this? Being able to quickly call out to your team is invaluable. Let them know that someone has breached the hatch above you, where a drone just came from, or that you’re about to plant the diffuser. It’s great to always play with the same people, since you’ll learn how everyone works and build your communication. Talking to each other is also beneficial when looking through cameras or drones. Rather than marking the enemy, which draws their attention to the fact they’re being watched, simply call it out to your pals — either in-game or through a voice chat application like Discord Discord: The Best Free Voice Chat for Gamers Yet Discord: The Best Free Voice Chat for Gamers Yet Are you a gamer struggling to find a reliable voice chat app to talk to your friends?

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 MacBook Pro Updates Posted: Mar 22 2017, 2:09am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     New MacBook Pro refresh is likely just about performance. Apple released a series of new products on March 21. As expected, a new 2017 MacBook Pro was not part of the new releases. The only difference in 2017 MacBook Pro laptops would likely only be in processors. After all, the MacBook Pro line got an overhaul only a few months back in late 2016. A new MacBook Pro is expected for fall and not earlier. Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway! Chances are the only upgrade you will see for MacBook Pro models in 2017 will be the introduction of new Intel Kaby Lake processors to the mix. Those Kaby Lake processors would bring reduced heat output and reduced power consumption meaning longer run time for MacBook Pro users. The move to Kaby Lake processors for Apple could mean that SSD performance increases as well. These moves would mean more performance for new models but just as importantly more run time away from an outlet. One change that could be significant is the elimination of the MacBook Air that has been rumored. That MacBook Air is expected to be replaced by the 13-inch MacBook Pro lacking the Touch Bar writes Forbes.  There has been a lot of controversy when Apple introduce the 2016 MacBook Pro about the small touchbar and the removal of ports. Apple could actually be forced on redesigning the MacBook Pro in case sales have slowed. At this point we don't have sales numbers of the 2016 MacBook Pro. Find savings on MacBook Pro on Amazon.com.

Many of the new applications right now use a version of machine learning to predict or anticipate a user’s next action. While the technology is still in its early stages, more and more companies are developing application-specific hardware components that are targeted for AI. One company in particular is ARM. The company just announced its next-generation Cortex-A processor for artificial intelligence applications, the ARM DynamIQ. In its most basic definition, the ARM DynamIQ is pretty much the same as a standard Cortex-A processor. The main difference is, instead of having a group of generic processor cores, the ARM DynamIQ is consisted of different kinds of cores. To explain this further, take for example a standard quad-core mobile ARM processor. In a general sense, this processor will have either four identical processor cores or two pairs of identical cores, each pair of a different kind. The ARM DynamIQ processor is a step above that. Instead of having identical cores, it is possible for the new ARM architecture to contain four different kinds of processor cores. Each core is made specifically to perform better in artificial intelligence or machine learning applications. ARM DynamIQ (via arm.com) In addition to the new configuration, ARM also claims that the new architecture will be 50 times better at performing AI operations than a standard Cortex-A73-based system. Furthermore, the new design will also respond ten times faster between CPU and other hardware operation transfers. This will, in effect, result in faster responsiveness to artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. At the moment, there are no known physical applications of the new ARM processor architecture. The company has just started the marketing phase for the ARM DynamIQ processor. It will not be long before Intel, Qualcomm, and Apple will use the said chip in their AI design efforts. Nevertheless, ARM predicts that by 2021, the company would have sold more than 100 billion ARM processors across the globe. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 March 2017 by Military News iQIYI Launches Asia’s first Online Variety Show in HDR Technology BEIJING, March 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — iQIYI, China’s largest video streaming platform, announced that Sound of Journey, Asia’s first online variety show produced with HDR technology, would be released exclusively on its platform on March 21. The reality show features three new-generation musicians traveling to Sri Lanka, China’s Yunnan Province and Tunisia for a music journey pursuing freedom and independence. It has six episodes, each lasting 15 to 20 minutes. The biggest highlight of the program is that it is completely produced with 4K HDR technology. HDR is a digital imaging technology that provides a greater dynamic range of luminosity than standard imaging techniques. It is capable of delivering significant improvements to color, contrast and brightness without increasing the native pixel count of the image. In order to ensure the 4K HDR version of Sound of Journey can be presented more realistically with high dynamic range and wide color gamut on terminal devices, the production cycle is longer than other ordinary self-produced shows. Duan Youqiao, senior vice-president of iQIYI, said the HDR technology has made the screening pictures ten times brighter than those without using it, which better reflects the visual effects of real environments and brings better immersive experience to the viewers. „It would be the first time for Chinese audience to enjoy the high-quality original online content produced with the 4K HDR technology on their TV sets at home,” said Duan. „This has also made iQIYI a pioneer in applying this top technology in the shooting of online commercial programs.” Currently, 4K HDR has been one of the most popular technologies adopted by global video streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. Sound of Journey, made by iQIYI’s in-house production team VC Studio, has marked an important milestone in China’s and even Asia’s video industry. A leader in China’s video streaming industry, iQIYI has always taken technology and product development as the key driver for its business growth. By working with international strategic partners including Intel and Ericsson, iQIYI has dedicated to enhancing video services quality and improving users’ viewing experience. Currently, iQIYI has also ventured into high-tech areas like cloud, virtual reality and artificial intelligence, providing viewers with premium video content as well as various entertainment services including gaming, e-commerce, movie ticketing and live streaming.

This is despite the strong bull move in the overall market. Source: Shutterstock So might the current value of NVDA stock be at an attractive level now? Or maybe it’s a better idea to hold off? Well, the fact is that Nvidia remains one of the best operators in the semiconductor industry, with a dominant position in graphics processing units (GPUs). While this technology is still primarily for gaming — which continues to be a solid market opportunity — the applications span emerging categories, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, self-driving cars, internet of things and cloud computing. The main reason is that GPUs can process enormous amounts of data on a cost-effective basis. And yes, NVDA has had little trouble monetizing its valuable assets. Just look at the most recent quarter, in which revenues spiked by 55% to $2.17 billion and the adjusted earnings came to $1.13 per share. The Street, on the other hand, was looking for $2.11 billion and earnings of 83 cents on NVDA stock. It was certainly a blow-out. But interestingly enough, it didn’t really matter — that is, at least for NVDA stock. Then again, much of the story is baked into the valuation. Consider that the price-earnings ratio is at about 40. By comparison, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) sports a multiple of 23 and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) trades at 16.5. Granted, NVDA stock deserves a premium valuation because of its torrid growth ramp. But according to several notable Wall Street analysts, the current multiple appears to still be at frothy levels. During the past couple weeks, Instinet analyst Romit Shah put a price target of $90 on NVDA stock and analysts from BMO Capital Markets went even lower, with a $85 price target. Actually, the Wall Street consensus is for $113.59 a share, which implies only 9% upside. But it is important to note that there are some notable risk factors, which could easily weigh on Nvidia stock as well.

iQIYI, China's largest video streaming platform, announced that Sound of Journey, Asia's first online variety show produced with HDR technology, would be released exclusively on its platform on March 21. The reality show features three new-generation musicians traveling to Sri Lanka, China's Yunnan Province and Tunisia for a music journey pursuing freedom and independence. It has six episodes, each lasting 15 to 20 minutes. The biggest highlight of the program is that it is completely produced with 4K HDR technology. HDR is a digital imaging technology that provides a greater dynamic range of luminosity than standard imaging techniques. It is capable of delivering significant improvements to color, contrast and brightness without increasing the native pixel count of the image. In order to ensure the 4K HDR version of Sound of Journey can be presented more realistically with high dynamic range and wide color gamut on terminal devices, the production cycle is longer than other ordinary self-produced shows. Duan Youqiao, senior vice-president of iQIYI, said the HDR technology has made the screening pictures ten times brighter than those without using it, which better reflects the visual effects of real environments and brings better immersive experience to the viewers. "It would be the first time for Chinese audience to enjoy the high-quality original online content produced with the 4K HDR technology on their TV sets at home," said Duan. "This has also made iQIYI a pioneer in applying this top technology in the shooting of online commercial programs." Currently, 4K HDR has been one of the most popular technologies adopted by global video streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. Sound of Journey, made by iQIYI's in-house production team VC Studio, has marked an important milestone in China's and even Asia's video industry. A leader in China's video streaming industry, iQIYI has always taken technology and product development as the key driver for its business growth. By working with international strategic partners including Intel and Ericsson, iQIYI has dedicated to enhancing video services quality and improving users' viewing experience. Currently, iQIYI has also ventured into high-tech areas like cloud, virtual reality and artificial intelligence, providing viewers with premium video content as well as various entertainment services including gaming, e-commerce, movie ticketing and live streaming.

Andrew Williams21 March 2017Laptops Pocket-lint 4.5 stars - Pocket-lint recommended from £1,349 For Slim and light design, great build quality, good screen, avoids the bling route, silent operation Against Low-power CPU, expensive Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment There are a few kinds of hybrid laptop: ones with screens that pull off; those with 360-degree hinges; and (now rarer) ones whose screens flip around, almost independent of the base. Dell has had a go at the lot, but it seems to have settled on a style in the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1. This is a very laptop-like hybrid, whose hinge simply lets the display fold back further and further until it reaches the back of the keyboard half. It's a similar style to what Lenovo has also settled on in its 2-in-1 hybrid Yoga laptops.  The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 has a lot of the same draws as Dell's other XPS laptops, although we do rather get done over in the UK, where the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 starts at £1,349. US buyers can get an entry-level model for $999 (making the UK equivalent around 68 per cent pricier - even Brexit can't explain that). As 2-in-1 devices go, is it worth the splash of cash? Dell XPS 2-in-1 review: Design 360-degree hinge Slim and light at 1.24kg Aluminium and carbon fibre construction From a quick glance the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 looks like a Dell XPS 13 with an extra-foldy hinge. But it's actually a rather different kind of laptop. Pocket-lint It has less power, but is significantly thinner and lighter. Take its 14mm thickness, add in Dell's now famous slim-surround InfinityEdge screen, and its 1.24kg weight makes for a laptop that's hard to beat if you're after something to carry around all day, every day. There are plenty of straight-up laptop alternatives, of course, like the MacBook 12, the Asus ZenBook 3, HP Spectre 13, but there's a low-flashiness appeal to how Dell makes its most style-driven laptops. Like the XPS 13 and XPS 15, the lid and bottom of the 2-in-1 are aluminium, but the inside is soft-touch carbon fibre-infused plastic. It has warmer feel than metal, but also seems just as tough, without the flexing you'd see in a cheaper plastic surround. The superb portability is at least as much a draw as the hybrid form, and we've certainly appreciated it more during testing. People must find uses for these flip-over hybrids, though, as companies keep on making them. Pocket-lint Potential uses include browsing while you cook, watching Netflix in bed and letting you fit the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 on all but the tiniest of plane/train tables. Or just looking flashy in a work meeting. Dell XPS 2-in-1 review: Connectivity No full-size USBs; pair of USB-C microSD card slot Fingerprint scanner This is the first Dell laptop to really delve into the latest trends of ultra-portable laptops, in that it leaves out full-size USB ports entirely. It's a vision of the laptop as a cousin to the phone rather than something into which you'd want to plug hard drives, mice and monitors. You get two of the smaller USB-C 3.1 ports instead. If that's going to be a struggle then there's also a USB adapter cable in the box should you not quite be ready for the peripheral-free future. Pocket-lint Most laptops of this style do not have a memory card slot, but the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 does. Sorry photographers, it's not a full-size SD card slot but a microSD one instead. Like the other XPS models, there's also a little battery indicator: press a button on the side and a row of LEDs light up to tell you how much juice is left. It's not on all the time, to avoid it becoming irritating. Pocket-lint There's one present here that's missing from its bigger, more traditional laptop brothers too: to the right of the keyboard there's a fingerprint scanner in the form of a little indented square. This lets you sign-in with a finger press rather than a pin or password. To date most of these Hello pads have been quite unreliable, but this one works very well. It has almost never failed to work on its first try - a far cry better than what we experienced in the ZenBook 3. Dell XPS 2-in-1 review: Keyboard and trackpad High-quality backlit keyboard Textured glass trackpad Thankfully Dell has avoided using the new wave ultra-thin keyboard - many competitors typically feel like you're tapping away on squares of glued-down dry lasagne sheets - instead opting for a 'board with keys that move with only a bit less travel than Dell's larger XPS models. Pocket-lint We've typed a few thousand words on the laptop with no issue (indeed, you're reading them). It doesn't feel cramped, partly because this is isn't a truly tiny laptop. It's big enough for a full-size keyboard, and that's the main thing that counts. It also has a keyboard backlight, making it easy to work, or noodle about on Facebook, in the dark. The trackpad beneath the keys is strong too. Its surface is smooth textured glass, it has a meaty click that doesn't have too high-pitch an action and isn't hard to press at speed. It doesn't have pressure-sensing smarts like the latest MacBooks but is a rival in terms of pure feel. The trackpad alone is enough to make the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 more appealing than the Asus ZenBook 3, whose pad is nowhere near as nice. Dell XPS 2-in-1 review: Display 1080p display, with QHD+ an upgrade option Normal colour saturation rather than ultra-wide gamut Touchscreen with glossy finish We could happily use this as our main work machine. A lot of that is down to the screen. As the name suggests, the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 has a 13.3-inch display. It's covered with tough Gorilla Glass, and as a hybrid it is, but of course, a touchscreen. Pocket-lint There are two display specs to choose from: both use tablet-like IPS LCD panels, but one has resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, the other 3200 x 1800. Dell sent us the lower-end version, which is a very solid display. You don't get the ultra wide colour gamut of some laptops, but its tones are vivid enough to avoid appearing undersaturated. There's enough brightness on tap to use the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 outdoors and contrast is very good. Dell doesn't seem to make any specific claims about deeper colour reproduction in the top-end screen version, but it will be noticeably sharper. You can see pixels in our 1080p one without trying too hard, although the higher resolution is very much a luxury upgrade that many won't really need. As much as you may want it. Dell XPS 2-in-1 review: Performance Not as powerful as the XPS 13 Still feels fast for day-to-day use Not much good for gaming Pure power is where the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 lags behind the normal, slightly larger, XPS 13. Instead of using one of Intel's normal dual-core laptop CPUs, it has an ultra-low power “Y” series chipset. You'll find this kind of processor in a handful of the thinnest and lightest computers, including the 12-inch MacBook. Pocket-lint Our review model has a Core i7-7y65, and the cheaper alternative has the i5 version. This will either be a non-issue or a deal-breaker depending on how steep your demands are. The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 feels nimble, unlike a laptop with an Atom processor, but it's just not as powerful as the Core i7 you'd see in a slightly larger laptop. The point of these ultra-ultra-low power consumption chips is to squeeze as much performance as possible without needing a fan. This laptop is passively cooled, making it completely silent. That said, at one point the SSD, or at least one of the internal components, did start clicking for a short period. Still, it's not mad-noisy like the high-powered Lenovo Yoga 910, for example. We'd like to think anyone who's going spend hours editing video on Adobe Premiere would benefit from a CPU powerful enough to need a cooling fan, but the more mainstream impact of the efficiency-obsessed processor is gaming. No laptop with integrated graphics is a gaming powerhouse, but in the last couple of generations we've ended up with enough grunt to play Xbox 360-era games reasonably well. Pocket-lint The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1's gaming chops are in a lower league, though, losing maybe 10 frames per second compared to the non-hybrid XPS 13. Games playable on the Dell XPS 13 chug on the XPS 13 2-in-1. As these are Windows machines, not Nintendo Switch, you can always lower the resolution and turn off some graphical effects, but we don't feel mean saying this is machine is rubbish for gaming. The only real day-to-day annoyance of the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is it's relatively slow to boot given it uses fast SSD storage (256GB in our review model). If you tend to actually shut down your laptop rather than leaving it in standby, to save battery life, you lose some sense of responsiveness. There's no real explanation for this in the specs. Dell XPS 2-in-1 review: Battery life and speakers 46Wh battery Around 10 hours of light use There's a solid argument to be made that the lower-power CPU is a result of the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1's slim frame, but Asus managed to cram the more powerful kind into its even thinner, lighter ZenBook 3. It's not so much a question of what chipset will fit, but what sort of battery life each will allow. Pocket-lint Dell's XPS line is a bit obsessed with battery life, and the 13 2-in-1 will significantly outlast a ZenBook 3. With light tasks like playing a movie or writing something in Word, it'll last just over 10 hours. At one point we took to working outside on a sunny day with the laptop, meaning a jump to 100 per cent screen brightness, and an hour ate just 12 per cent battery. That's over eight hours of use with a maxed-out screen: not bad at all. The Dell XPS 13 lasts longer still, though. And unlike the Apple MacBook 12, the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 does not have speakers that seem almost bizarrely powerful given the size of the laptop. Sound quality is fine enough, but a bit timid, lacking any low-end and with limited volume on tap. Verdict The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is a laptop you'll enjoy using, but probably won't like to pay for (in the UK at least). It's very slim and light, avoiding using one of those annoyingly shallow keyboards, which makes day-to-day use ideal. Its 360-degree hinge design is far subtler than most too, in particular the bling watchband hinge of the Lenovo Yoga. Unless every gramme of weight matters and you love the idea of its hybrid style, the 2-in-1 does feel like you're paying more and getting a little less compared to the normal Dell XPS 13. But if the variable positioning is essential for you and you're willing to pay then there are few finer, better balanced 2-in-1 style laptops on the market. All in all, the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is a joy to use and a more versatile alternative to the smallest MacBook. It's a bit expensive though. The alternatives to consider… Pocket-lint Lenovo Yoga 910 If you fancy something a bit more bling then Lenovo's watch bang hinge Yoga products certainly look the part. The 910 is a potentially great machine, so long as you don't go for the over-powered model: the Core i7 choice kicks in with fan noise at the drop of a hat. Otherwise this 4K master is a great looking piece of kit with all the same positional advantages as the XPS 2-in-1.

But it has an annoying trackpad. It's less fun to use day-to-day than the Dell as a result, and lasts less long between charges too. Read the full review: Asus ZenBook 3 review: A super-thin Macbook killer? Pocket-lint Apple MacBook (2016) The laptop that started the whole low-connectivity mess we're in right now. It's less powerful than the Dell as it uses older-gen processors, and doesn't have a touchscreen or hybrid design. But it's still rather nice to use. Read the full review: Apple MacBook (12-inch) review: Is port-free the future? Pocket-lint Acer Swift 7 A good lower-cost alternative to the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1, the Swift 7 has some similar ideas, but misses out on a few features. There's no keyboard backlight, no touchscreen and no ultra-flex hinge. At £300-400 cheaper, though, it's still compelling.
