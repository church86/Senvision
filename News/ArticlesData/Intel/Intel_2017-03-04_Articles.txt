SWR Software Rasterizer Now Supports Geometry Shaders Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 5 March 2017 at 01:43 PM EST. 7 Comments Intel's "SWR" software rasterizer living within Mesa now has support for OpenGL geometry shaders. Thanks to work that landed today by Intel's Tim Rowley, there is now support for OpenGL geometry shaders in this software rasterizer. The code amounts to over 700 lines of new code to implement GL GS support. Geometry shaders are mandated by the OpenGL ES 3.2 specification and this was the last extension SWR had to implement for GL 3.2 and 3.3 The other software rasterizers in Mesa -- Softpipe and LLVMpipe -- have already implemented geometry shaders and the other extensions through OpenGL 3.3. But we haven't seen any Mesa software rasterizers yet have working OpenGL 4.0+ support. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

It didn’t take long for the glow of the president’s address to Congress to turn cold after reports surfaced that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had not been accurate about his contact with the Russians during the 2016 campaign. President Trump found himself once again on the defensive against damaging leaks and intensified the focus on the Russia story, launching an unsubstantiated claim on Twitter that the former president had wiretapped his campaign headquarters to investigate Trump’s Russia ties. We will explore all of this today with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, and fellow Republican committee member Susan Collins. Former CIA and Defense Chief Leon Panetta will also be here. And we will go in-depth into a blockbuster “New York Times” report that the U.S. has been involved in cyber-warfare against North Korean missile launches. As the president and Republican leaders begin a coordinated push to replace Obamacare, we will get a progress report from Health and Human Services head Dr. Tom Price. And we will have plenty of political analysis -- all straight ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning , and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I am John Dickerson. The Senate Intelligence Committee was already investigating Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 election, but yesterday the president opened a whole new set of questions by accusing his predecessor, President Obama, of wiretapping Trump’s campaign headquarters. And this morning, the president has asked congressional committees to investigate. We are going to try and sort through all of this today. And we begin with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia’s Mark Warner. Senator, let’s start with the claims by the president. He tweeted that he -- on Saturday that he had just found out Obama had “my” -- quote -- “wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found.” He called it McCarthyism. What do you make of this? SEN. MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA: Well, John, let’s step back for a moment and look at what we do know. We know that we have seen an unprecedented attack by a foreign adversary, Russia, in terms of meddling in our election. We saw before the election a thousand Internet trolls trying to use and place false information. We saw manipulation of certain algorithms, so that if you Googled certain items, you got Russia news, R.T. News, other false news. We saw the selective hacking into DNC and individuals that then tried to leak that information to benefit Mr. Trump. We also saw before the election an unusual change in the Republican platform in favor of Russia. We saw Mr. Trump himself encourage the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton. And we saw this just unusual affection that the president seems to have, where he won’t say anything bad about Vladimir Putin. And since the inaugural, we have seen the resignation of the national security adviser and recusal of the attorney general because of contacts with Russians. Now we have this unsubstantiated claim made by the president, which shows in a certain way that the president doesn’t understand how you obtain a wiretap. You have to go before a judge and show either probable cause or, if it is in terms of foreign intelligence, a FISA court and show that there is evidence of some type of contact with a foreign adversary. And so what I find so strange -- and I thought the president’s comments could no longer surprise me, but, boy, this one yesterday surprised me. To make that type of claim without any evidence is, I think, very reckless. DICKERSON: Do you think there is a -- let’s stick to the president’s claim first and then go back to the other list you made. Do you think there is any FISA court order? This morning on “Meet the Press,” former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said there was no FISA court order. WARNER: I am not aware of any FISA court order regarding the Trump Tower. DICKERSON: But there have been ones of -- other kinds of FISA court orders? WARNER: Listen , I’m not going to get into what ongoing investigations the FBI might be taking. But I think it doesn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to realize, with this litany of events and this drip, drip, drip of activities, our investigation -- I have to tell you, I have been in public life a long time. There is nothing I have done in my life in public that is as important as trying to get this investigation done right and bipartisan and get the facts out to the American people. DICKERSON: The president’s claim, is it -- could he just be going off of something in a Breitbart report, or do you think he has access to -- he has access to the best possible intelligence. WARNER: He has access to the best possible intelligence. DICKERSON: So, which is this, do you think? WARNER: I think time will tell. But I am not aware, as General Clapper has said, of any kind of FISA order that was somehow, you know, in effect bugging Trump Tower. But I feel like this -- again, feels like an attempt where the president is trying to distract us by filling out -- and he is distracting with unsubstantiated information, which, again, if the president is correct, and he says there is nothing here, then he should welcome this investigation, because what we will do... DICKERSON: Have you seen any connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians? WARNER: We are early into this investigation. We have our staff out looking at information at Langley. I’m going to go out this week. We are going to have unprecedented access to all of the intelligence. DICKERSON: Meaning the FBI intelligence as well? Because... (CROSSTALK) DICKERSON: ... says the FBI is holding back. (CROSSTALK) WARNER: All of the intelligence that is appropriate, we’re going to get to all of that. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will look at this. And one of the things that gives me pride that this is happening, I have seen colleagues on the committee, Republican colleagues, like Susan Collins and Roy Blunt, Marco Rubio, all make public statements saying they are committed to not having this being interfered by politics and us getting to the bottom of it and getting the facts. DICKERSON: And quickly on the FBI, though, House Intel -- ranking member on the House, Adam Schiff, has said that the FBI is withholding significant issues from top members of Congress. Is that true? WARNER: I believe I have a good working relationship with Director Comey. DICKERSON: Are you getting what you need? WARNER: There’s plenty of time. You know, we are at the beginnings of this. We’re going to get the information we need to get to the bottom of this. DICKERSON: Who are you going to call? Is Michael Flynn going to testify? WARNER: Listen, I think that we will be -- we are looking at when we will hold public hearings. We’re also starting to prepare lists of individuals that I think need to come testify. I believe, considering General Flynn’s series of contacts and the fact that he had to resign, I want to hear from General Flynn. DICKERSON: And are you working hand in hand with Senator Burr, who is the chairman of the committee? WARNER: Listen, Senator Burr and I are friends. We have the ability to have kind of frank conversations. We have had conversations like that. I can tell you, as recently as Thursday, Chairman Burr and I -- and he was very, very strong with the intel community that we need to get all the facts. We need to get access, unprecedented access. And we got that access. DICKERSON: You say you have frank conversations. Senator Burr was one those the White House called and asked to act as a kind of character witness against these news reports that there were connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians. You talked to Senator Burr after that. Do you have any doubts that he can carry out his role as chairman? WARNER: Listen, I have confidence that we are going to get to the bottom of this. DICKERSON: You have confidence he is going to do his job? WARNER: I’m -- Chairman Burr, Richard Burr, and I are going to get this done. And if at any point -- and I made this very clear from the outset -- if at any point, I feel like we are not getting access to all the information, or if there are barriers to getting this done, then I will say so, and look for a different venue. But what gives me faith is that this is a committee -- the Intelligence Committee, for a lot of reasons, works in a more bipartisan way than virtually any other committee. And the fact that we have got so many Republican members on the committee who I think are as equally committed to getting to the bottom of this, this is as serious as anything I have ever been involved in. DICKERSON: Final question. It is serious. And there is obviously an attempt by some people in the bureaucracy somewhere to put forward leaks that hurt the president. Do those leaks, which some in your party cheer like crazy, undermine what you are trying to do and undermine getting to the bottom of this? WARNER: Listen, any kind of leaks of intelligence is serious and needs to be investigated, because you put people’s lives in jeopardy potentially. I have great trust and respect for the intelligence community. I wish the president would show that same level of trust and respect for the intelligence community, because they do a good job for us. And they need to have -- and we got to have their back. DICKERSON: All right, Senator Warner, thanks so much for being with us. WARNER: Thank you. DICKERSON: And we now turn to a Republican colleague of Senator Warner’s on the Intelligence Committee, Maine Senator Susan Collins. Senator, what do you make of what President Trump has said about these wiretaps? Should he be talking about this on Twitter? Is this helpful? SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: It would be more helpful if he turned over to the Intelligence Committee any evidence that he has. What we need to deal with is evidence, not just statements. At this point, I have seen no evidence of what he has alleged, but I have also not seen collaboration, as Director, DNI Clapper also said today, that he had seen evidence of collaboration. But we are at the very early stages of our investigation. And this is why it is so important that we do an in-depth, exhaustive, bipartisan, independent investigation, because the American people deserves answers to all of these allegations and counterallegations, so that we can get on with the business of this country. DICKERSON: The president has said and the White House has said they are not going to talk any more about his accusations over the weekend. But now that he has put that out there, he is the president of the United States. He has access to this information, even if he might have been going off of a news report. He has access to all of this information. Do you think it is important for him now to put forward this evidence in some form to back up his claims, because it is now out there, and people might think, because he is the president, he has some special understanding, in other words, not wait until the committee is done with its work, but that he -- does he have an obligation to present some kind of evidence now, now that he has put this charge out there about President Obama? COLLINS: The president has called for congressional investigations into the allegations that he made starting yesterday morning. So I would expect that he is going to want to provide our committee with any evidence that he has. My own theory is that the Russians are determined to sow the seeds of discontent and doubt about the legitimacy of our democracy and other Western democracies, and that they were going to do that regardless of who was elected president. So, it is really important, so that we know what happened and what the facts are, that we get to the bottom of this. DICKERSON: When you say he will provide the committee with information, but do you think he owes something to the public, now that he has kind of thrown this out there, and now isn’t going to say anything more about it? But now it is out there. It’s live. Does he owe the public something more than what he owes the committee, just as a matter of what Senator Sasse said, it was a matter of public trust? Do you agree with that? COLLINS: It would probably be helpful if he gave more information, but it also might be helpful if he just didn’t comment further and allowed us to do our work. The committee’s work is under way. I am convinced that we are going to do the kind of exhaustive, in-depth and prompt investigation that will help put these allegations to rest, one way or the other. DICKERSON: You mentioned going through everything. And I want to ask you about President Trump’s tax returns, because some people believe, in order to really figure out whether there was any influence on the president, you have to know whether there were any ties to Russia. You have said that the committee will perhaps subpoena the tax returns, if necessary. Do you think a committee investigation that ends without looking at the tax returns has fulfilled its duty, that the committee will have fulfilled its duty? COLLINS: It is premature for me to reach that conclusion right now. What I am convinced of, because I know this committee well, and I know how seriously we take this charge, is that we will go wherever the evidence leads us, and that we will get all of the information that we need. If that includes President Trump’s tax returns, then I have confidence that we will ask for them. If we don’t need them in order to reach our conclusions, then we won’t. But it is too soon to tell. DICKERSON: But will you come up with sort of a hunting list in terms of all the places you would want inquiry? And wouldn’t the tax returns be a pretty -- pretty high up on the list in terms of that? COLLINS: Well, let’s see where the evidence leads us. We are just now beginning to have access, as Senator Warner mentioned, to the information that the intelligence community has. Like Senator Warner, I will be going over to review that information. It is many binders-thick. So, let’s see where the evidence leads us. DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question quickly on the Affordable Care Act. You have put forward an alternative, or a bill. Where do things stand in the Republican ranks in terms of a replacement for the Affordable Care Act? COLLINS: There is not a consensus. This is very difficult to achieve the president’s goals and the goals that many of us have of wanting to expand access to coverage and have a damper on the prices. We have seen a lot of problems with the individual markets, in a death spiral in many states under the ACA. So, the irony here is , regardless of who was elected president, we were going to have to do major repairs on the ACA. I have put forth a plan with Senator Cassidy, who is a physician, that is a comprehensive plan that gives states the options of doing what is best for their citizens, and which we believe would actually expand access to health insurance. That is our goal. But there is not a consensus at this point. DICKERSON: Very quickly, how long do you think it will take to get to consensus? It’s a few little minor details, or are we still talking about the big, complicated business of something that takes up 18 percent of the economy? COLLINS: It is very complicated. And we shouldn’t rush it. We need to get this right. DICKERSON: All right, Senator Collins, thanks so much for being with us. And we will be back in one minute to talk to the former head of the CIA, former secretary of defense, and former chief of staff. It is all one person. That is Leon Panetta, coming up when we’re back in one minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Joining us now is former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director Leon Panetta. Secretary Panetta, let’s start with these new revelations or new claims by the president. Who do Americans look to be the adult who says, here is what is happening? LEON PANETTA, FMR. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Well, you know, what I see here is that this president is making the same mistake past presidents made when they faced scandals, that he is trying to divert attention. They are trying to obfuscate. They’re trying to cover up. They are trying to somehow raise other issues. And, in the end, it is going to be the truth that will determine what is involved here, and not tweets, but the truth. DICKERSON: We had an instance where, this week, the attorney general has had to recuse himself from investigations into campaign events. We have got -- now you have got investigative -- intelligence committees investigating. I mean, is -- do you think people just need to wait for the Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate to do their work, or is there some better route, you think, to trying to get at what are now several sets of issues? There is the Russian meddling and now the claims that the president has made, quite extraordinary claims -- and maybe you can, given your experience, put them into some kind of context, for the president to claim that his predecessor was wiretapping him, and comparing him to Nixon and McCarthy. PANETTA: You know, the best advice I could give the president and this administration is to get ahead of this, don’t get behind it. Get ahead of it. Present the facts as they know it, and commit themselves to cooperating with the investigations that are going on. This issue is not going away. It is not going away. There is too much here. We have found the Russians to have tried to interfere in our election process. We have a situation now where the administration has denied contacts with the Russians. And we are finding out that that is not true, that there have been contacts with the Russians. And, lastly, the president himself has raised this issue. His whole national security team has condemned the Russians and Putin. And he still winds up defending Putin. So, you put all of that together, it may not lead you to some kind of collaboration or collusion, but it raises issues that have to be investigated. That’s why you need a bipartisan, an independent, a thorough and a credible investigation. DICKERSON: When you say independent, but that can still be within the Congress? PANETTA: Yes. No, I think, as you have seen, these are responsible members of Congress who want to look into this issue. I think they deserve the opportunity to do that. I would hope they don’t run into problems, because, if they do run into political problems in the course of this investigation, then we may very well have to turn to a special prosecutor. DICKERSON: What do you think foreign, other countries think about when they look at this? Does this have a -- we have got the president accusing his predecessor. You have got investigations into the president. How does this affect our standing as other countries look at America? PANETTA: It is sending a terrible message out there. I can tell you, based on my own conversations with people abroad, that they are very concerned about the administration, about the president. They are concerned about whether he truly is going to be committed to the kind of world leadership that we have seen the United States provide. But every time these things happen, every time he tweets, every time these issues come up that indicate that -- you know, there’s obviously something to this Russian issue, and the administration is not cooperating, when that happens, when he accuses a past president of wiretapping, without any evidence of that being the case, it makes us vulnerable. It weakens the United States, and it makes us vulnerable to our enemies. That is the danger. DICKERSON: Speaking of enemies of the United States, North Korea, “The New York Times” has a piece today about U.S. efforts using cyber-warfare to basically hurt the North Korean missile system. Are we -- is this -- should Americans be in fear of a cyber- retaliation by the North Koreans? PANETTA: I have always felt that cyber is -- it’s here to stay. It is one of the weapons that we have to deal with. And we have to be smart enough to use it, not only defensively, but offensively as well. And I think, you know, the stories you are seeing indicate that the United States is on the cutting edge of that kind of technology. DICKERSON: President Trump is most concerned about North Korea. Does he have it right? In terms of all of the global threats, he seems to be most concerned about North Korea. Do you share that concern? PANETTA: Well, there are a number of threats that are out there that -- we are dealing with a very dangerous world. I think the Pentagon feels that Russia is at the top of the list because of the nuclear threat, and I understand that. But we also have to worry about North Korea and the unpredictability of that leader. We have to worry about the Middle East and the chaos there. There are a number of crisis points that the United States has to consider. And the problem is, when we are diverted, when the president is diverted from paying attention to those crises, we pay a price. DICKERSON: All right. Stay right there, Secretary. We will be right back. We are going to take a short break, but we will be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we are back with Leon Panetta. President Trump has suggested that he wants $54 billion in defense spending next year. What does the Defense Department need? Is that a good idea, and what would they spend it on? PANETTA: You know, the worst thing that they could do is to go through a roller-coaster ride on defense spending, where we are down, increase it dramatically, then, next year, take it back down. We have gone through the sequester process , which has literally impacted on our readiness. So, yes, we need an increase to try to deal with the readiness issue, but what we really need is a gradual increase and certainty in the budget. And if you are not providing certainty as to where the defense budget is going, you can talk about increasing it all you want. You are going to create chaos in terms of the Defense Department. DICKERSON: And how do you get -- you mentioned the sequester. That was the draconian budget cuts as a result of not reaching budget agreements. How do you get that certainty in budgeting for the Defense Department or anywhere else, for that matter? PANETTA: Well, John, what has to happen in this town -- and it hasn’t happened for a long time -- is that the president and the Congress have to come to a budget agreement that really deals with this $20 trillion debt that we face. And the problem now is that they are all trying to do this by going after discretionary spending, which only constitutes a small part of the overall budget. What you have got to do is put everything on the table. You have got to put entitlements, you have to put taxes, and you have to put discretionary. That’s what we did in the past. That’s how we got a balanced budget. We are not going to be able to deal with the budget unless there is that kind of agreement. And that is essential, not only for purposes of the budget, but for the American people to understand what our priorities are for the future. DICKERSON: The president has said he won’t touch Medicare. PANETTA: Well, I think it is dangerous. Any time you put something off -- you know, off the table, you are just asking for trouble. Entitlements make up two-thirds of the federal budget, for goodness’ sakes. You are not going to look at how you can develop cost controls on those programs? You will never be able to deal with a budget crisis if you just eliminate that whole area. DICKERSON: You were brought into the White House as chief of staff during a rocky period in the Clinton years. What do you make of the current White House operation, as you viewed it? PANETTA: Well, I worry about it, because, when the president goes off and does what he did within the last few days of just going ahead and tweeting without checking on things, there is something wrong. There is something wrong in terms of the discipline within the White House and how you operate. I mean, you cannot have this kind of situation, where the president is not properly briefed, that you think out what the president is going to say. And that you have somebody in charge of the White House staff, that, I think, still hasn’t taken place. And I think the White House is paying a price for that failure. DICKERSON: All right, Secretary Panetta, thanks so much. And we will be right back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I’m John Dickerson. “The New York Times” chief Washington correspondent is David Sanger, and he detailed a U.S. covert cyberattacks against the North Korean missile program under the Obama administration in the paper and he joins us now to discuss this latest reporting. Welcome, David. Before we get to your specific reporting, President Trump is very focused on North Korea. Give us your sense about why you think -- why he should be. DAVID SANGER, “THE NEW YORK TIMES”: Well, when President Obama leftovers office, he made it pretty clear, as President Trump has said, there’s one big military problem out there. President Trump has never quite said what that is, but clearly it’s North Korea. And it’s North Korea because in the last year and a half of the Obama era, the North Koreans made huge progress in both their nuclear tests and in bringing in a new generation of missile technology that eventually, maybe two years from now, maybe three, maybe four, but not that long, is going to be able to reach at least the West Coast of the United States. So that timeframe for dealing with this problem, which has been kicked down the road by president after president after president is really narrow. DICKERSON: And you detailed the cyberattacks used to -- to try and keep that time frame really long. SANGER: That’s right. So the -- the key to this right now is keeping the North Koreans from learning how to get that ICBM across the Pacific. And the Pentagon, with the help of the intelligence agencies, worked for many years to come up with ways to do this using cyber technology to actually interfere with the way that the North Koreans would send those launches. And, in fact, the origin of the story, John, was that my colleague, Bill Broad and I, who worked on nuclear issues for a long time, were sitting around one day last spring saying, these things are just falling into the ocean too fast. And Bill went back and discovered that the design on which this missile is -- is based, which is an old Russian design, had a failure rate of about 13 percent -- DICKERSON: When the Russians were shooting them off. SANGER: When the Russians were doing them. DICKERSON: Yes. SANGER: And the North Koreans were running a failure rate of about 88 percent. Now, a lot of things could explain that. The North Koreans are not the best manufacture in the world, you know. They are not the best welders in the world. But clearly something else was making this worse. And -- and that was it. And then there’s President Obama, who looked across the spectrum of our defenses and said, this missile defense that we have spent $300 billion building since the Eisenhower era, the stuff that’s up in Alaska and California -- DICKERSON: Right, that shoots it out of the air? SANGER: Shoots it out of the air -- DICKERSON: Right. SANGER: Has a failure rate of about 56 percent under ideal conditions. So he said, this is not going to defend us against the problem. DICKERSON: So have the North Koreans figured out these cyberattacks and have they gotten better? And what does that mean for U.S. venerability? SANGER: Well, one of the reasons we ran the story now is it became pretty clear that the North Koreans will have an investigation underway, figured out that somebody was messing in their system. And so we went ahead and wrote a story carefully in a way that we thought would not provide the technical details that would allow the North Koreans to defeat what the United States is doing. But it’s clear that we’ve got a big issue, several big issues here. One is, is this enough? And that’s a big issue that Mr. Trump is going to have to go deal with. Second big issue is, are there other alternatives? Do you negotiate with the North Koreans? Which a lot of people say we should. President Obama decided not to. Do you take more decisive action? Do you try to attack these launch sites kinetically? You can do that -- DICKERSON: Meaning militarily? Blow them up? SANGER: Militarily, right. You blow them up. If you do that, you -- and you miss some, you run the risk of starting off another war in the Korean peninsula, and no one wants to go do that. So, you know, the Russia story is a fascinating one. The tweets are a fascinating diversion. But in the end, at some point, President Trump is going to have to sit down and actually focus on a few threats like this one. DICKERSON: All right, David Sanger, thanks so much. A fascinating piece of reporting. SANGER: Great to be with you, John. DICKERSON: And we’ll be right back with our panel. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: One of the top items on the president’s legislative agenda is the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. Health & Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price joins us from Atlanta to give us an update. Secretary Price, the president said that he would have a replacement for the Affordable Care Act on day one, and then more recently he said it was more complicated an issue, health care, than anyone would have guessed. Where does -- where does the president’s plan stand at this point? DR. TOM PRICE, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: John, thanks so much. Good to be with you today. Before I -- I answer that, let me just say that -- that it is an incredible privilege for me to serve as the Health & Human Services secretary. And the mission of HHS is -- is to improve the health and safety and well-being of the American people. And right now, across the country, there are many individuals who have a challenge from healthcare access and -- and cost of insurance in the individual and small group market. And that’s what we want to focus on. And there are literally millions of folks who have either -- aren’t unable to afford their insurance or paying premiums, the premiums are up 25 percent over the last year, almost 100 percent over the last three to four years. So what we want to make certain is that we’re being true to the principles of health care, which is a system that’s accessible for everybody and affordable for everybody and of the highest quality, making sure we incentivized innovation and empowering patients through both transparency and accountability. So that’s the plan we’re been working on and we look forward to moving it very, very soon. DICKERSON: The president has -- has said the following about what the plan will -- will do. He said it will offer better care for more people at lesser cost. He said people will have access to the doctor that they want and the plan that they want. And it will be paid for without touching Medicare. Is all of that still true? PRICE: Absolutely. And I think it’s important for the American people to appreciate. And the speech that the president gave this past Tuesday night, what he did was outline the priorities for the American people. They want a system where the states have the flexibility and authority is returned to the states for the regulation of -- of health coverage. They want to make certain they can buy across state lines. They want to make certain that preexisting illness and -- and injury is not -- makes certain it’s covered from -- from an insurance standpoint. They want drug prices to come down. He said something also very important about lawsuit abuse. He said that we ought to address the issue of lawsuit abuse and the practice of defensive medicine where we’re wasting hundreds of billions of dollars every single year. And so these are the priorities that the president has outlined. They’re consistent with the priorities that we’re moving forward with at Health & Human Services. And we’re very, very excited about the opportunity to once again respond to the needs and the concerns and -- and -- and the fears, frankly, of the American people about the health care system that they currently find themselves in. DICKERSON: One of the fears that people currently on the Affordable Care Act have is that they will not have it after these reforms are put in place. And there seems to have been kind of different claims about whether the 20 million or so who are on it will be able to continue their coverage. Some -- people in the administration have said absolutely yes they will be covered. Others have said that’s a goal. Those are two different things. Which is it? PRICE: Yes. Well, I think what -- our -- our goal is to make certain that every single American has access to affordable coverage that’s of the highest quality. You know what’s oftentimes missed, John, is -- is that there are 20 million Americans across this land who -- who are exposed to the penalty, have either chosen to take the penalty, not purchasing insurance, or taken a -- a waiver. And the reason is because the federal government has dictated to individuals what they must buy, what kind of health coverage they must purchase. So what our goal is, what the president’s goal is, is to give people choices, to let them purchase the kind of insurance that they want for themselves and for their family, not what Washington forces them to buy. This is a real important distinction between where we are right now in that individual and small group market and where we want to go. DICKERSON: So if I’m on the Affordable Care Act now, I don’t have to worry about losing coverage? It’s not going to become so expensive that I won’t be able to afford it? PRICE: Well, it is becoming expensive right now. As I mentioned, the premiums are going up, the deductibles. If you’re a -- if you’re a guy or a gal out there, you’re making $50,000, $60,000, you got a couple kids, you know, your premium, by and large, is somewhere between $8,000 and $12,000 a year. You don’t have that kind of money. So you may have a card, you may have an insurance card, but you don’t have care because you can’t afford the deductible in order to -- to get the kind of care that you need. DICKERSON: But -- PRICE: So our goal is to bring those costs down. And the way that you do that, again, is through flexibility, though allowing states to have the flexibility to care for their vulnerable populations as they see fit, choices for patients all across this land, making certain that they can purchase what they want, not what Washington says they must buy, making certain that the doctors are able to provide the kind of care that they believe to be most important, not, again, responding to what Washington tells them they must do. So we’ve got a lot of wonderful opportunities to make certain, again, that the American people are able to afford the kind of care that they want. DICKERSON: Final quick question on Medicare, Mr. Secretary. Speaker Paul Ryan said it may still be an open question about whether President Trump really doesn’t want to touch Medicare. Is it an open question? Might there be a back door way that the president will go back on his campaign promise not to touch it either for current retirees or for anybody in the future? What’s the final bottom line here? PRICE: I’ll tell you what -- I’ll tell you what’s not an open question, is that -- is that we believe in the guarantee of Medicare for our -- for our seniors. The challenge that we have, as you well know and your viewers know, is that Medicare is -- is -- as some folks have said going insolvent or going broke. Within a ten year period of time, we won’t have the money in the Medicare program to be able to pay the benefits to seniors in this country that has been promised to them. We don’t think that’s appropriate. So we believe in -- strongly in the guarantee of Medicare and make certain that it’s a viable, financially secure program going forward so that seniors now, and in the future, know that it will be there for them. DICKERSON: All right, Mr. Secretary, sounds like a guarantee with perhaps some -- some changes maybe, maybe not, but we’re out of time. I really appreciate you being with us. And we’ll be right back. PRICE: Thanks, John. It’s good to be with you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Panel. Julie Pace is the White House correspondent for the Associated Press. Ed O’Keefe covers politics for “The Washington Post.” We’re also joined by CBS News political analyst and Slate’s Jamelle Bouie, and Ramesh Ponnuru, senior editor of “The National Review.” Julie, I want to start with you. This week saw Donald Trump give his most sustained public comments that were restrained. The word presidential was used a lot. Then, Saturday, a series of tweets that seemed the opposite of that. Where are we now going into Monday with the Trump presidency? JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: It was incredible whiplash this week. I think we have to give the president credit for the speech that he gave on Tuesday night. It was a side of him we don’t often see. It was restrained. It was traditional. He got into some of the agenda that he wants to see going forward. But it just quickly gets overtaken in some cases because of actions by people with Jeff Session, who didn’t totally be up front with the congressional committee when he was doing his confirmation hearing, but then it’s the president himself who goes out on Saturday and distracts with these series of tweets. And the overarching problem for him is, he is going into a week that is going to be policy heavy. A new rollout of the vetting EO and then a rollout of healthcare. And the success or failure of healthcare is going to be one of the -- one of the measures by which his swear presidency is judged on. And -- and to distract from that, to not go into this week with a sense of focus, I think, really hampers his administration. DICKERSON: Ramesh, on that point, one of the things that made Republicans happy about this speech was that it was focused. RAMESH PONNURU, “NATIONAL REVIEW”: Right. DICKERSON: The president hit the marks of a speech like that, which is important when you’ve got to sell a piece of legislation. Now the -- the worry is back to distraction. PONNURU: I think there was a very short lived (ph) sigh of relief that came from Capitol Hill Republicans about the president. But I think there’s a connection between what we saw on Tuesday night with the president’s speech and what we saw on Saturday morning with these tweets, which was, the president thought he had hit a home run with the speech. He was getting great positive reviews. And then reportedly he was furious that the story moved on to Attorney General Sessions misleading testimony in Congress, and that’s what I -- apparently set him in this mood where he sets these tweets. Now, one other thing about these tweets that I think really is remarkable is, he’s alleging explicitly a Nixon Watergate level conspiracy on the part of the previous administration against his own presidency, and then he starts commenting about “The Apprentice” within the same hour. I mean, this is -- this is a -- this is just a remarkable set of things, and it makes you wonder how certainly you can take the things that he’s saying. DICKERSON: And it was also after a speech in which on Tuesday night he said, there’s no more time for trivial fights and “The Apprentice” would be probably in the trivial category. Jamelle, a question for you is, when the president takes to Twitter, it’s often as a strategic move to distract from one thing and move to another. Do you see strategy in -- in what was happening yesterday? JAMELLE BOUIE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I see some strategy in that he does want to kind of regain the -- the attention of the media, the attention of everyone from the Sessions controversy. I -- I think -- I think it’s -- we should not overstate the degree of strategy here. It’s -- we’ve -- we’ve seen over the years, over the last 24 months, that Trump is impulsive, that Trump is very self-involved, you might say. And so this could also just well be Trump lashing out as Trump does. I want to say one quick thing about last Tuesday’s speech that while it was relatively more calm and serious and mature than most of Trump’s addresses to the public, it -- it should be said that some of the policy content there is just -- was just as extreme and just as aggressive as we’ve seen in his less stable moments. Stable might be the wrong word, but in his less -- in those moments. So, for example, in that speech he announced the creation of an office dedicated to publicizing crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, which has two problems. The first that it resumes that undocumented immigrants are responsible for a huge number of crimes, and the second is that it is stigmatizing and contributes to an atmosphere of people arguing harm to immigrants. And Trump’s tone shouldn’t distract from that. DICKERSON: Ed, picking up on what Jamelle said, the president talked about unity, but if you’re trying to unify with Democrats and yet doing things of what Jamelle just described, they’re not going to be in a mood to unify. ED O’KEEFE, “THE WASHINGTON POST”: Not at all and they weren’t -- I mean they fled the chamber as fast as they could Tuesday night, having essentially held their nose throughout the whole thing. And they -- they have said, look, we see no reason to work with him. He has made no real attempt to -- to make any, you know, overtures to us, why -- why should we bother? And I think the fact now, even today, we’re seeing the Senate minority leader on another program raise doubts about the Republican leader of the Intelligence Committee. It now shows you to what extent this really spreads. It spreads all the way now into the even -- even into the investigation into Russia. There is no appetite up there among Democrats to cooperate with this president because they’re convinced that he’s just so tarnished and they see no political benefit. Whether that works for them ultimately remains to be seen, but I think it’s -- it’s a real testament to the poisonous nature and the fact that he has done nothing so far, at least in their view, to fix things. DICKERSON: Mark Warner working very hard to -- O’KEEFE: Right. DICKERSON: To keep support there for -- for his chairman, Richard Burr, and in his comments. Julie, I want to ask you about the substance of President Trump’s Russia policy, because there’s a lot of talk about Russia and connections and all of that. But what’s happening with respect to actual U.S. policy towards Russia and the president’s position on that. PACE: So this is really an interesting conversation that’s happening in the White House against the backdrop of all of these revelations about people meeting with the Russian ambassador. The president came into office talking about striking a deal with Russia. It hasn’t quite been defined. But the broad buckets include cooperation on the Islamic State, Ukraine, some kind of negotiations over arms control. And I’m told that he’s been sending signals, both to his advisors and to allies, that this may not be the right moment for that kind of deal. There are a couple of reasons why. One is that the White House is very concerned, legitimately, about some treaty violations that Russia has had involving a cruise missile launch a few weeks ago. But there are other factors. You have some new voices in the room with the president who are tougher on Russia than he has been and some of his previous advisors have been. You have European allies that are learning to speak the language of Trump, talking to him about a deal. You don’t want to make a bad deal with Russia. You don’t want to make a weak deal with Russia. So they’re -- it’s interesting that they’re picking up on those cues. And, frankly, it just underscores the political climate right now for him to have a president moving forward on a robust deal with Russia against all of these questions about his relationship I think even he, and his advisors, are realizing that that would be pretty difficult to -- to strike that kind of deal in this climate. DICKERSON: Ramesh, let me switch to Obamacare here from Russia and ask, where do you think things are, as the House leaders begin their process, and as the White House sort of comes along with them, what’s the state of play with respect to replacing Obamacare in the -- in Congress and the White House? PONNURU: I think there’s considerable confusion and disagreement still among Republicans. I think that the congressional Republican leadership has its own basic sense of where it wants to go. It wants to have a tax credit driven strategy that provides coverage to a lot of people, even in a post Obamacare world. But there’s a significant number of conservatives in Congress who don’t want any part of that. And the administration is not being entirely clear about where it stands on this basic divide among Republicans. Normally, congressional Republicans, in charge of Congress, with a Republican president, would be looking to the administration to set their direction on this kind of issue. This time, they’re not, or at least that direction is not being provided. O’KEEFE: I -- a fascinating piece of context today by our friend Paul Kaine (ph) in the post. He said more than 160 House Republicans have never worked before with a Republican president. They’re used to blocking and tackling. They’re not used to running with the ball. And we are seeing this every day up there. I mean all the other noise about Russia and whatever the president is tweeting about or doing and saying, they do not know how to deal with this issue and they’re going to have real trouble. To hear the secretary here now dodging your questions about the specifics of what this outline will look like, they’re allegedly working off of his blueprint that he wrote as a congressman. And even that isn’t able to generate enough agreement. If you have as many as 40 House Republicans, and they’re out there concerned about this, wanting to stand in its way because they don’t think it’s conservative enough or costs too much money, that’s the end of the game. There will not be healthcare reform if they can’t get it out of the House and if they can’t find Democrats to work with them, and they don’t want to. DICKERSON: Well, the Democrats definitely don’t want to work with them. BOUIE: Well, absolutely. Yes. It’s almost a perfect storm of dysfunction for the effort to get -- to repeal the Affordable Care Act because you have Congress people who have not worked with a Republican president, have very little experience with this kind of legislation. You have a White House that is arguably in disarray, or at least is not -- does not have the kind of experience that you need to shepherd major pieces of legislation through Congress. You have a president whose stated goals for reform are count run -- run kind of counter to what congressional Republicans say they want. And the, of course, you have Democrats who have just decided largely to say, hey, we’ll let you take care of this and we not really going to help out. There is a timer here too, right, that as time goes on this just becomes more and more difficult. And so -- DICKERSON: It’s a political matter. BOUIE: Right, it’s a political matter. And so we may actually already be approaching the point politically where there isn’t that much to do because it’s just -- opposition is building, voters are speaking out in the opposition and Democrats are really rallying their side against it. DICKERSON: Julie, one thing I heard from Secretary Price when I asked him about Medicare, is he said the promise of Medicare will be there. PACE: Right. DICKERSON: When -- when Donald Trump was a candidate, he, no tinkering, no how. PACE: Absolutely. DICKERSON: Promise is different. Promise is you can get a whole different kind of thing. The promise is there but the form of it is different. PACE: And the president, in the campaign, said that over and over and over again. That will come back to haunt him if an eventual package does -- does make changes there. I mean I think what’s so interesting about this -- about this moment that we’re entering is, Trump is now going to have to really be a president who gets involved in legislation if he wants to get this through. You have people -- lawmakers on The Hill who want to hear from him. They want him to pick up the phone and give him a call. We don’t know if he’s capable of doing that. This is going to be a big test for him as a president. DICKERSON: Ramesh, and the president -- the reason Paul Ryan wants flexibility on Medicare is to find some money to pay for all the other things that President Trump wants to do. PONNURU: That’s right. I do -- I think that this point Julie made about the president’s involvement and its possible effect on The Hill is a really important one because it’s -- it’s right saying that 40 conservative Republicans are holdouts, you can’t pass anything, but will they stay holdouts if at some point President Trump is saying -- O’KEEFE: Right. PONNURU: I need you to replace Obamacare. I understand you’ve got some -- some problem you’ve got with this legislation, but it’s decision time. Are you going to be responsible for defying me, hurting my presidency and keeping Obamacare on the books? I don’t think that those 40 stay 40. DICKERSON: Right, he’s still got political power. Ed, I want to ask you quickly about the president -- or the White House had a little faint towards immigration reform. The day of the speech, there was a little notion that the president might support permanent legal status, have a job, pay your taxes, you won’t have to worry about getting deported. What did you make of that? O’KEEFE: Twice in February he had private lunches with people where he raised this issue. Repeatedly in public he hasn’t brought it up. So one wonders really what is his stated goal here? You know, all he really talked about was that immigration victims -- crime victims office -- DICKERSON: Right. O’KEEFE: Which is not going to be a very busy office, frankly, because there are isolated and very high-profile examples of this, but it’s not widespread. What is widespread and what’s causing a lot of trouble and concern for people right now is the really uneven enforcement of the immigration laws. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, to their credit, has done a good job tracking this. And, you know, the examples of, you know, a 22-year-old who was arrested by ICE after speaking out at a press conference about them is being sent back to Mexico. A mother who was checking in with ICE for years being sent back to Mexico for the same reason. DICKERSON: In other words, it’s not just the -- the bad dudes. O’KEEFE: And it’s happening all over the country. It’s not the bad hombres. DICKERSON: Right. O’KEEFE: These are good hombres, in many cases. No criminal record at all. And the confusion that this is causing with very little congressional oversight, while the president’s talking about the idea of doing it and people are waiting for him to signal what they want to do, is just incredible and causing great confusion. DICKERSON: All right, we’re going to have to leave it there. Thanks to all of you. And we’ll be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Thanks for watching FACE THE NATION.

Robots glide along the ceiling, moving silicon wafers the size of dinner plates between hulking machines that deposit and etch microscopic layers of material to build the most advanced memory chips in the world. For the 1,700 technicians and scientists who tend to the robots and troubleshoot problems in the delicate manufacturing process, the jobs offer generous pay and benefits and easy access to Utah’s many outdoor attractions. For Intel and Micron Technology, the two US companies that jointly own and operate IM Flash, the venture allows both of them to sell cutting-edge, three-dimensional memory chips while sharing the multibillion-dollar costs of a modern semiconductor factory. The memory chips produced at the plant are “probably one of the biggest advances of technology in the last 20 years,” said Jon Carter, who oversees Micron’s strategy for new memory products. And, as he was quick to point out, all of the work was done in the United States. “Micron has done a really good job of having a good footprint on the home front,” he said. In many ways, however, the IM Flash plant is an outlier. While companies based in the US still dominate chip sales worldwide, only about 13% of the world’s chip manufacturing capacity was in this country in 2015, down from 30% in 1990, according to government data. Chipmakers attribute the decline to a variety of forces, including high US tax rates and the hefty subsidies offered by foreign governments for new semiconductor plants, which can cost as much as $10 billion. “It’s quite a bit more expensive to build a factory in the US,” said Stacy J Smith, the executive at Intel overseeing manufacturing, operations and sales. Intel — which predominantly manufactures in Oregon and Arizona but also has factories in Ireland, Israel and China — estimates that the extra cost for a US plant is more than $2 billion. Chipmakers are hopeful that President Donald Trump, who has promised large corporate tax cuts and a tougher approach to trade with China, will help them. Intel’s chief executive, Brian M Krzanich, made a public display of his faith in the administration this month when he stood by Trump in the Oval Office to announce that the company would spend $7 billion to complete a leading-edge chip factory in Chandler, Arizona, creating 3,000 full-time jobs. Intel said it was talking with the Trump administration and Congress about a broad corporate tax cut as well as other ways to improve the financial incentives for chipmakers to locate new projects here. Although the United States has 76 semiconductor plants, many of them are older, and few new ones are being built. Intel, whose workforce relies heavily on highly skilled immigrants, is also pressing the administration to continue allowing such immigrants to enter the country. “We benefit from being able to hire the best talent from around the world,” Smith said. The chip industry spends about one-fifth of its revenue on research and development, but it wants more federal funding for basic research into fundamental problems, like how to pack transistors closer together and whether materials other than silicon could form the basis of future chips. “We would like this administration to double down on investments in basic research in universities,” said John Neuffer, chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group that represents US chipmakers. “Help us pedal faster.” Foreign countries have become more appealing for chip manufacturers, in part, because of the rise of contract chip foundries owned by Samsung of South Korea and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. They have made it easy for US tech companies like Qualcomm and Apple to design cutting-edge chips in the US but outsource production to Asia. Looming in the background is China, which is a bit player in the industry but has committed to spend upward of $100 billion to create a world-class chip industry. “Today, it’s a modest threat, but two, three, four years out, if China plays out as it plans, it could be very significant to subsectors of our industry,” Neuffer said. The IM Flash plant in Lehi was built in 1994 and was Micron’s first factory outside Boise. In 2005, Intel and Micron struck a partnership to expand the plant and make flash memory there, sharing costs and output. The two companies have spent the past 11 years developing the newest type of memory, which they call 3-D XPoint. The design combines the functions of a computer’s ultrafast working memory and its slower, longer-term storage to create a hybrid aimed at companies like Facebook, Goldman Sachs and Exxon Mobil, which need to process vast amounts of data reliably and at the highest speeds. David Kanter, principal analyst at the research firm Real World Technologies, said the technology, which is still being tested by the first round of customers, was very promising. “It could the change the way that computing operates,” he said. Foreign factories However, as with all new chip technologies, the initial products are likely to be expensive. The Lehi plant will continue to make traditional, cheap 2-D memory chips while gradually expanding production of the newer chips. Both companies have turned to foreign facto­ries to hedge their bets with other products — less expensive, less capable 3-D flash memory designs aimed at the broad slice of the market that wants better performance but is unwilling to pay top dollar for best technology available. Micron committed $4 billion to expand a plant it owns in Singapore to make the 3-D flash memory chips, which it began selling last year. Intel converted an ageing factory it built a decade ago in Dalian, China, into one that produces state-of-the-art 3-D memory chips. “China is the largest market for us on the planet,” said Smith of Intel. “It made sense to locate some production in China.” Given China’s position as the biggest buyer of US chips, the industry is concerned about Trump’s talk of a trade battle with China. At the same time, chipmakers believe that China has sometimes treated US companies unfairly and relish the idea of help from Washington on that front. In any case, Intel and Micron, which rejected a $23 billion acquisition bid by a Chinese company in 2015, say they intend to keep the bulk of their chip manufacturing in the US. Rob Magness, an IM Flash employee who works with the equipment that etches and polishes the silicon wafers, is optimistic, but said he knew just how fragile the industry was. During his 25 years making chips, he has seen employer after employer downsize and move factories offshore as they coped with the brutal economics of chip making. “All the places I came from are dying,” he said. “The other two memory companies I worked for actually went under. The prices just got too cheap.”   Tweet Go to Top Videos Congress, SP, BSP have different culture of... Marches kick off across world ahead of... Cabbies on Strike: Ola and Uber drivers...

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes).

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Availability: 4-5 years by Russ Juskalian One of the labs at QuTech, a Dutch research institute, is responsible for some of the world’s most advanced work on quantum computing, but it looks like an HVAC testing facility. Tucked away in a quiet corner of the applied sciences building at Delft University of Technology, the space is devoid of people. Buzzing with resonant waves as if occupied by a swarm of electric katydids, it is cluttered by tangles of insulated tubes, wires, and control hardware erupting from big blue cylinders on three and four legs. Inside the blue cylinders—essentially supercharged refrigerators—spooky quantum-mechanical things are happening where nanowires, semiconductors, and superconductors meet at just a hair above absolute zero. It’s here, down at the limits of physics, that solid materials give rise to so-called quasiparticles, whose unusual behavior gives them the potential to serve as the key components of quantum computers. And this lab in particular has taken big steps toward finally bringing those computers to fruition. In a few years they could rewrite encryption, materials science, pharmaceutical research, and artificial intelligence. This story is part of our March/April 2017 Issue See the rest of the issue Subscribe Every year quantum computing comes up as a candidate for this Breakthrough Technologies list, and every year we reach the same conclusion: not yet. Indeed, for years qubits and quantum computers existed mainly on paper, or in fragile experiments to determine their feasibility. (The Canadian company D-Wave Systems has been selling machines it calls quantum computers for a while, using a specialized technology called quantum annealing. The approach, skeptics say, is at best applicable to a very constrained set of computations and might offer no speed advantage over classical systems.) This year, however, a raft of previously theoretical designs are actually being built. Also new this year is the increased availability of corporate funding—from Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft, among others—for both research and the development of assorted technologies needed to actually build a working machine: microelectronics, complex circuits, and control software. The project at Delft, led by Leo Kouwenhoven, a professor who was recently hired by Microsoft, aims to overcome one of the most long-standing obstacles to building quantum computers: the fact that qubits, the basic units of quantum information, are extremely susceptible to noise and therefore error. For qubits to be useful, they must achieve both quantum superposition (a property something like being in two physical states simultaneously) and entanglement (a phenomenon where pairs of qubits are linked so that what happens to one can instantly affect the other, even when they’re physically separated). These delicate conditions are easily upset by the slightest disturbance, like vibrations or fluctuating electric fields. This blue refrigerator gets down to just above absolute zero, making quantum experiments possible on tiny chips deep inside it. In subsequent photos are scenes from the Delft lab where the experiments are prepared. People have long wrestled with this problem in efforts to build quantum computers, which could make it possible to solve problems so complex they exceed the reach of today’s best computers. But now Kouwenhoven and his colleagues believe the qubits they are creating could eventually be inherently protected—as stable as knots in a rope. “Despite deforming the rope, pulling on it, whatever,” says Kouwenhoven, the knots remain and “you don’t change the information.” Such stability would allow researchers to scale up quantum computers by substantially reducing the computational power required for error correction. Kouwenhoven’s work relies on manipulating unique quasiparticles that weren’t even discovered until 2012. And it’s just one of several impressive steps being taken. In the same lab, Lieven Vandersypen, backed by Intel, is showing how quantum circuits can be manufactured on traditional silicon wafers. What Is a Quantum Computer? At the heart of quantum computing is the quantum bit, or qubit, a basic unit of information analogous to the 0s and 1s represented by transistors in your computer. Qubits have much more power than classical bits because of two unique properties: they can represent both 1 and 0 at the same time, and they can affect other qubits via a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. That lets quantum computers take shortcuts to the right answers in certain types of calculations. Quantum computers will be particularly suited to factoring large numbers (making it easy to crack many of today’s encryption techniques and probably providing uncrackable replacements), solving complex optimization problems, and executing machine-learning algorithms. And there will be applications nobody has yet envisioned. Practical Quantum Computers Breakthrough The fabrication of stable qubits, the basic unit of quantum computers. Why it Matters Quantum computers could be exponentially faster at running artificial-intelligence programs and handling complex simulations and scheduling problems. They could even create uncrackable encryption. Key Players - QuTech - Intel - Microsoft - Google - IBM Availability 4-5 years Soon, however, we might have a better idea of what they can do. Until now, researchers have built fully programmable five-qubit computers and more fragile 10- to 20-qubit test systems. Neither kind of machine is capable of much. But the head of Google’s quantum computing effort, Harmut Neven, says his team is on target to build a 49-qubit system by as soon as a year from now. The target of around 50 qubits isn’t an arbitrary one. It’s a threshold, known as quantum supremacy, beyond which no classical supercomputer would be capable of handling the exponential growth in memory and communications bandwidth needed to simulate its quantum counterpart. In other words, the top supercomputer systems can currently do all the same things that five- to 20-qubit quantum computers can, but at around 50 qubits this becomes physically impossible. All the academic and corporate quantum researchers I spoke with agreed that somewhere between 30 and 100 qubits—particularly qubits stable enough to perform a wide range of computations for longer durations—is where quantum computers start to have commercial value. And as soon as two to five years from now, such systems are likely to be for sale. Eventually, expect 100,000-qubit systems, which will disrupt the materials, chemistry, and drug industries by making accurate molecular-scale models possible for the discovery of new materials and drugs. And a million-physical-qubit system, whose general computing applications are still difficult to even fathom? It’s conceivable, says Neven, “on the inside of 10 years.” Tech Obsessive?

Home International Fact Check: Trump’s Skewed Ledger of Achievements News International Fact Check: Trump’s Skewed Ledger of Achievements By Associated Press - March 5, 2017 11:50 am Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter President Donald Trump walks on the tarmac as he waves to the crowd upon his arrival IN January at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. Photo: Jose Luis Magana / Associated Press WASHINGTON — The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over by the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: – Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. – Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. – An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. – A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. – A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. – His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly – the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: Trump: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” The facts: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money.   Trump: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” The facts: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.”   Trump: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. The facts: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 – after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.”   Trump: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” The facts: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10.   Trump: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” The facts: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the USD $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by USD $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by USD $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by USD $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   Trump: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” The facts: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade.   Trump: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” The facts: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I – bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching – much less exceeding – the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level.   Trump: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home – from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” The facts: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens.   Trump on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” The facts: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority.

What a week! The annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) took place in Barcelona from Monday to Thursday, and there was no shortage of big announcements at that event – but there was plenty of exciting news and developments across the rest of the tech world too. If (somehow!) you’re not familiar with MWC, this quick video intro from the beginning of the week should give you some idea of what it’s all about: If you struggled to keep up with everything that’s been happening this week, don’t worry – 7 Days is here again to walk you through the week’s top tech news. There’s a lot to get through this week, so let’s waste no more time! The new BlackBerry KEYone was among the many new devices unveiled at (or immediately before) MWC. The $549 upper-mid-range Android 7.0 handset was designed and built by TCL, which referred to it as a 'flagship', although it doesn't have the specs to match rival flagship-class handsets from other manufacturers. There's plenty to like about the new device, though - and you can get a first look at it in my hands-on video from the launch event (I hope you like videos, because there's lot more of them coming up!). Reports have since emerged of up to three more BlackBerry-branded devices on the way this year, including photos of one with a very different design to the KEYone. In off-camera conversations at the KEYone launch event, several BlackBerry staff hinted to me that a 'true' flagship is in development, possibly with a Snapdragon 835 processor. The stunning new LG G6 also made its debut at MWC, featuring an unusually wide 5.7-inch Quad HD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Along with a stylish metallic body, it also features a Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB RAM and up to 64GB storage, along with IP68 dust- and water-resistance and a fingerprint sensor. I'm already a fan of this device, especially its dual 13MP rear cameras which are capable of snapping some great shots. Check out my hands-on video with the LG G6 here. Huawei introduced its new P10 and P10 Plus flagships just before MWC at a rather poorly organized event which left hundreds of journalists standing outside the venue for hours, long after the event had already begun. During the announcement itself, Huawei spent around half an hour talking about the many colors of the new handsets, so perhaps those of us left outside were the lucky ones. Nonetheless, the new P10 family are beautiful handsets with plenty of high-end specs, and a new version of Huawei's dual-camera technology co-engineered with imaging specialists Leica. You can find my hands-on video for the P10 here. Alongside the P10, Huawei also announced the Watch 2 and Watch 2 Classic, its new Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches, which include IP68 protection, a dazzling array of color options and all sorts of premium specs and features. The Watch 2 also includes integrated 4G LTE connectivity. Nokia was one of the biggest stars of MWC this year - quite a turnaround from what appeared to be the end of its mobile ambitions following the sale of its devices business to Microsoft in 2014. Among its many announcements in Barcelona, Nokia revealed that it's killing off the Withings brand for its wearable devices, in favor of its own brand. The Nokia 6 Android smartphone - designed and developed by HMD Global, built by Foxconn, and sold under the Nokia brand - launched in China in December. At MWC, HMD announced that it will soon be launching the 6 internationally, priced around €229 EUR. HMD also unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5, its new entry-level and mid-range handsets, respectively. You can view the full specs for both devices here, and as I discussed in my hands-on video with the two new Android smartphones, they appear hugely impressive - especially considering their relatively low prices. But the biggest attraction at Nokia's MWC stand was a blast from the past. HMD announced a new version of its much-loved classic phone, the Nokia 3310, updated with a range of more modern features. Every time I visited or walked past the Nokia stand, it was packed with people of all ages - including those too young to remember the original - wanting to get their hands on the new 3310. As you'll see in my hands-on video with the device, it's far from perfect - but there's a lot to like about it. It even includes a new version of the old-school Snake game, which is also coming to Facebook. Archos showed off its new low-cost Android 7.0 tablet. Despite being aimed at budget-conscious buyers, the 101 Saphir offers some rather nice features, including dust- and water-resistance, and a rugged design offering some protection against drops. Samsung had already confirmed that its new Galaxy S8 flagship wouldn't appear at MWC, but the company did announce the launch date for the new handset. And the leaks about the Galaxy S8 just keep coming - new images have emerged twice in the last few days. Samsung revealed its new rugged Galaxy XCover 4 smartphone with a 5-inch 720p display, IP68 rating, and MIL-STD-810G impact protection. It will ship in Europe with Android 7.0 onboard from April, priced around €259. Samsung also introduced a new version of its Gear VR headset, co-developed with Oculus, featuring a new controller with improved navigation. Samsung's new Galaxy Tab S3 made its first official appearance at MWC too. The high-end Android tablet has a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and 32GB storage, along with a keyboard cover and S Pen stylus support. And Samsung showed off its new Windows 10 2-in-1, the Galaxy Book, which comes in two configurations: a Windows 10 Home model with 10.6-inch LCD and 7th-gen Intel Core m3 processor; and a Windows 10 Pro version with a 12-inch Super AMOLED display and 7th-gen Core i5. Both models support 4G LTE and come with a keyboard and S Pen stylus. You can get more info on both variants in my hands-on video here. Porsche Design revealed its new premium Windows 10 laptop. Unlike Samsung's Galaxy Book - which is a tablet with detachable keyboard cover - Porsche Design's new Book One is an actual notebook (albeit with a detachable display!). It's conceptually similar to Microsoft's Surface Book, and features Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Panasonic showed off its latest Toughbook, an ultra-rugged Windows 10 detachable that's waterproof and has a briefcase-style carrying handle. It's packed full of the latest high-end specs - but it will come at quite a high price. Alcatel introduced its Plus12 Windows 10 2-in-1 aimed primarily at business buyers on a budget. It features some pretty modest specs, but - as you'll see in my hands-on video - it also has one of the worst keyboards I've encountered for some time. Alcatel's Idol 4S with Windows 10 has been available in the US for months, but the company finally announced its European launch this week, priced at €599. For some reason, the device has been rebranded as the 'Idol 4 Pro' for Europe, but the Windows 10 Mobile flagship's features are identical to those of its US counterpart. Image via PC World Our friends over at PC World spotted a refreshed version of HP's Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship that had accidentally appeared on its stand at MWC. However, when I went down there to check it out, the company had removed it from view, and its staff rather joylessly refused to say anything about it, brusquely parroting the phrase "we haven't announced anything". Still, HP did announce new accessories for the Elite x3, as well as revealing the Pro x2 612 G2, a premium 12-inch 2-in-1 targeting enterprise customers. The Elite x3 also received a firmware update this week, bringing performance improvements and camera optimizations. Lenovo unveiled a range of new Android devices aimed at families, including some features designed with kids in mind... ...as well as a selection of new Windows 10 devices covering a wide range of price points. The Miix 320 - which is priced as low as $199.99 USD - was my personal favorite, offering some very nice features, along with rock-solid build quality. But the new additions to the Lenovo range include a 14-inch Yoga 520 notebook, and two flagship-class Yoga 720 convertibles with stylus support, stylish design, and beautiful displays. You can get an overview of all four of those new Lenovo Windows 10 devices in my hands-on video. Lenovo's rather lovely new G5 and G5 Plus mid-range smartphones were revealed at MWC too. They offer a decent set of specs combined with some thoughtful design features, along with stylish looks. The G5 was one of my personal favorites at MWC - you can see my impressions of both handsets in my hands-on video. Sony revealed four new Xperia devices in Barcelona, including two high-end handsets, the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZs. The Premium features Sony's Motion Eye camera technology which offers slow motion video capture at up to 960fps. But perhaps the most exciting device on Sony's stand was the Xperia Touch, a €1,500 EUR device running Android 7.0 that projects its user interface onto a flat surface, turning it into a 23-inch touch display. The projector is portable too, but it currently offers just one hour of battery life. Find out more about that device in my hands-on video here. Jolla announced that it has added support for its Sailfish OS on some of Sony's Xperia devices. The company also revealed plans to build a local mobile OS aimed specifically at China. Chinese manufacturer ZTE revealed its new Blade V8 Lite and Mini handsets, offering lesser specs in a more affordable package than the Blade V8 Pro that it announced at CES in January. Xiaomi showed off its new Mi 5c featuring the company's own Surge S1 processor, along with 3GB RAM, 64GB storage and a 5.5-inch display. Xiaomi also introduced its new Redmi 4X, a low-cost smartphone with Qualcomm's latest mid-range Snapdragon 435 chipset, and a very spacious 4100mAh battery, priced from as little as $102. Meanwhile, General Mobile debuted the GM6, the latest handset to launch under Google's Android One initiative. While the new devices were the major focus of attention at MWC, they weren't the only big announcements at the show. Meizu, for example, revealed its new Super mCharge battery technology with a live demo in which it charged a flagship phone with a 3000mAh battery from 0% to 100% in just 18 minutes. And in a year when 'the next big thing' was the subject of endless discussion at MWC, the International Telecommunication Union released a draft report detailing the specifications of the next-generation 5G mobile standard, promising 20Gbps download speeds and latency as low as 1ms. Image via Shutterstock The GSM Association, which hosts the Mobile World Congress expo each year, published its annual Mobile Economy report, in which it estimated that there will be five billion mobile users by mid-2017. Moving on from MWC, fresh details emerged this week of Apple's plans for its 'Anniversary iPhone', which is due to arrive later this year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the new handset will include a curved AMOLED screen along with USB Type-C support, while a separate report suggested that Apple is investing heavily in augmented reality technology for the device. Nvidia announced details of its new GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU, with a whopping 11GB of GDDR5X memory. Pre-orders opened on Thursday, and deliveries will begin on March 10. The Raspberry Pi Foundation marked the fifth anniversary of its original maker board by announcing a new variant of the ultra-low-cost Raspberry Pi Zero, which now features 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 for just $10. Elsewhere, an intrepid developer built a Raspberry Pi wearable device running Windows 98 (!!). Developer Michael Darby said: "I thought, wouldn’t it be ridiculous and awesome to have Windows 98 on my wrist?" Yes, Michael - "ridiculous and awesome" is the exact phrase I would have chosen. Love it! <3 "Hello, computer" There was much rejoicing among Star Trek fans in January when Amazon added 'Computer' as a wake-word for its Alexa digital assistant. Now, the company is apparently preparing to add new capabilities to Alexa, including voice calling functionality. Google has started to bring its digital Assistant to millions more Android devices, after initially limiting it to its Pixel phones, Android Wear devices, and its Home speaker hub. And the long wait for Google Home to launch in the UK will soon be over. The company announced that it will launch there in June, although pricing hasn't yet been revealed. There's been some confusion surrounding the future of Google's Pixel laptops running Chrome OS. At a roundtable with reporters at MWC, Google gave the clear impression that it would not launch any more of its own-branded Chromebooks - but a few days later, it stated that its Pixel laptops aren't dead after all. However, Google did confirm that it will definitely be launching new Pixel smartphones later this year. Google's Nougat update continued to slowly make its way to more devices around the world in recent days: Droid Turbo 2 on Verizon gets Android 7.0 update Android 7.0 begins rolling out to the Moto G4 and G4 Plus in the US You can now sign up for the Honor 6X beta program to get Android 7.0 Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta finally heads to the Nexus 6P OnePlus 3 and 3T get Android 7.1.1 beta in China (HydrogenOS) and other markets (OxygenOS) Microsoft updated its Arrow Launcher for Android to version 3.0, calling it the "biggest release yet", bringing new features and major performance enhancements. A couple of days later, it rolled out beta version 3.1, bringing support for Android tablets. We got a small taste of what might have been for Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile flagships, as a series of screenshots revealed support for unique gestures originally intended for inclusion on the Lumia 950 and 950 XL - some of which may have been developed as part of the stillborn Lumia McLaren project. Skype for Linux emerged from the alpha phase of its development with the release of a new beta that included all sorts of improvements and new features. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced that it is discontinuing its Skype WiFi service at the end of this month - and it's not yet clear what the future holds for the separate Microsoft WiFi offering. Microsoft Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains more or less stagnant, while Chrome has extended its lead from 57.94% to 58.53%, according to the latest data from NetMarketShare. NetMarketShare data also showed zero growth (in fact, a very slight decline) for Windows 10, while Windows 7's share of the desktop market grew from 47.20% last month to 48.41% this month. A similar picture was painted by the latest usage stats from gaming platform Steam, where Windows 10 usage declined by almost 1% in the last month, while Windows 7 increased. A new version of Windows 10's iconic 'hero' desktop wallpaper was spotted in the latest build of Windows 10 Cloud - and there's some speculation that the updated version may be unique to the Cloud SKU of the OS. A Windows 10 Cloud build that leaked earlier this week included the ability for users to download and install Win32 apps from the Windows Store. The upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will include the option to prevent users from installing any apps except those downloaded from the Windows Store, in an effort to improve on-device security. Microsoft outlined details of new controls over Windows Update that will be introduced with the Creators Update in the next few weeks. These will include more granular controls for when to schedule updates and associated reboots. Thanks to Microsoft's new Unified Update Platform, or UUP, future updates for Windows Insiders could see download sizes reduced by up to 65%. It's been a busy week for Windows Insiders, with numerous new builds being released. After Windows 10 build 15046 brought new features to PCs in the Fast ring on Tuesday, Microsoft rolled out build 15048 to Fast ring PCs on Friday, along with build 15047 to Windows 10 Mobile devices. Build 15043 also made its way to Windows 10 Mobile handsets in the Slow ring on Thursday - the first Slow ring build for those devices since December. On top of that, Windows 10 SDK Preview build 15042 was released on Wednesday... ...along with ISOs for Windows 10 build 15042 for PCs. Microsoft introduced Wake-on-LAN support for its Surface devices when used in conjunction with a Surface Ethernet adapter or dock - a very welcome addition, and rather a long time coming! Microsoft also announced general availability of Visio Online on Wednesday, following several months in public preview. Coinciding with that announcement, it also added a couple of new features. The Movies & TV app on Windows 10 (known as Films & TV in the United Kingdom) was updated for Windows Insiders to include support for 360-degree video, along with some other improvements. However, in less welcome news, Microsoft slashed its OneDrive storage allowances on Wednesday. The company had previously announced plans to remove its 'unlimited' storage plan, blaming customers for using too much of their unlimited allowance. All customers who previously had an unlimited or 10TB allowance will now see their storage reduced to just 1TB. Here's everything you need to know about the implications of those changes. And Microsoft announced a further change on Wednesday, ditching its Windows Holographic brand in favor of 'Windows Mixed Reality'. The new name sounds rather bland in comparison to the old one, but it was a necessary change, given that the virtual reality headsets that run the OS offer none of the 'holographic' elements available on augmented reality devices like HoloLens. Microsoft confirmed to Neowin on Wednesday that it will be bringing mixed reality experiences to both its current Xbox One consoles, and to its new Project Scorpio console, in 2018. It will begin shipping mixed reality dev kits this month, including a headset manufactured by Acer. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced its new Xbox Game Pass, a $10 monthly subscription offering unlimited access to over 100 games for Xbox owners. The new service will be launching this Spring, and you can check out all the games that will be available on day one here. Xbox One Insider Preview build 15039 was released to the Beta ring last weekend, while build 15045 made its way to the Alpha ring on Tuesday with several new features. Build 15046 was pushed to the Alpha ring on Thursday with various fixes for a range of issues. Over 1,000 games are currently being created by developers under the ID@Xbox program; on Wednesday, Microsoft announced details of 22 of those games that are coming to both the Xbox One and Windows 10. Battlefield 1 is free to play this weekend for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, and will also be available to buy with a hefty discount. But after a wonderful and exciting week, our odyssey across the tech world ends this week on a truly sad note. Last weekend, gamer Brian Vigneault died in the final hours of a 24-hour gaming marathon. He was live-streaming his gaming session on Twitch in an effort to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which arranges memorable and happy experiences for terminally ill children. 22 hours into his marathon, the 35-year-old took a break from the stream, but never returned. Brian had previously raised over $11,000 for non-profits during the course of five years as a charity live-streamer. The thoughts of the whole Neowin team are with his family and friends. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Timi Cantisano reviewed the unusual GPD WIN, a handheld computer with a built-in QWERTY keyboard, and gaming controls, including a direction pad, thumbsticks and ABXY buttons. That's definitely worth a read! Byron Hinson published his review of Sniper Elite 4, which is available on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. The game isn't for the squeamish as it can get a bit gory at times, but Byron found it to be a lot of fun, although it can become a bit repetitive. Check out his full review here. And after an action-packed week at Mobile World Congress, crammed full of big announcements, we're eager to hear your thoughts on what was revealed at the event. Was there a particular device that you're looking forward to buying? A new technology that you're keen to try out? A new machine that you're determined to save up for and treat yourself to? Or just something that you really like the look of? Join in the discussion, and have your say! ...and finally, don't forget that you can check out all of our coverage from Mobile World Congress right here. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

HARRISBURG, Pa. — For some residents of this small city, there was something familiar about Foxconn’s recently announced plan to hire up to 50,000 U.S. workers, one of the many hiring pledges from companies rounded up by President Trump in the first weeks of his administration. Quotes in the article Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd HNHPF ▼ 5.81 -0.01 -0.09% Intel Corp INTC ▼ 35.57 -0.33 -0.92% SoftBank Group Corp SFTBF ▼ 73.82 -0.30 -0.40% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 139.34 -0.44 -0.31% The only difference was the scale. In 2013, Foxconn’s chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. Locals were giddy. Foxconn had a small office here, but this seemed like the start of an entire new industry. Pennsylvania’s governor boasted about the deal. The Brookings Institution think tank hailed Foxconn’s decision as a sign of U.S. manufacturing’s strength. But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. “It just seemed to fade to black” after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. In December, Pennsylvania’s economic development staff was still touting the $30 million factory that never was. What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. “I’m delivering on everything we promised,” Trump said last month during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. “People are saying they’ve never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency.” Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump’s election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, too, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have made an unusual display of loudly announcing their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump’s delight. Full screen 1/3 SLIDES © Mark Makela/For The Washington Post A Donald Trump campaign sign remains atop a pile of gravel in Harrisburg, Penn, where Foxconn said in 2013 it’d build a $30 million factory. It didn’t happen, but more promises have returned. “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said, “and probably more than one.” 2/3 SLIDES © Mark Makela/For The Washington Post David Black, head of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber of Commerce said FoxConn’s earlier promise to build a plant created “intense buzz” in the town. 3/3 SLIDES © Mark Makela/For The Washington Post In 2013, Foxconn’s chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. 3/3 SLIDES “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said the day after the investment was revealed, “and probably more than one.” But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and what takes place on the ground can be huge — and frequently overlooked. “They are scrambling to look good,” Mark Selden, senior research associate at Cornell University’s East Asian program, said. “It’s a sign of the pressure that Trump is placing on everyone in the world to deliver on his agenda.” Companies tend to view these announcements as an opening bid in a negotiation, said Alberto Moel, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. Firms know politicians like the splashy headlines. And if everything falls into place — the business climate improves, they extract enough concessions such as tax breaks and free land — they might be able to make it happen. “It actually puts the onus on the U.S. in a way,” Moel said. “They are saying: ‘I’m along for the ride. Here’s my proposal.’ ” If the deal falls apart, as it often does, no one is going to talk about it. “The government themselves aren’t going to remind you of that, Trump has no intention of helping you remember that,” Moel said. “What’s the downside?” Trump is far from alone in using corporate announcements as political backdrops. It’s why ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial shovels exist. In 2012, President Barack Obama visited a new $5 billion Intel computer chip plant in Chandler, Ariz., citing it as “an example of an America that is within our reach.” But the facility, known as Fab 42, was never completed. Last week, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich stood in the Oval Office with Trump to announce a $7 billion investment — essentially, Fab 42 was back on track, with a new price tag and a new president. Trump tweeted his praise. Even before he was sworn in, it was clear Trump placed greater importance on these job announcements than past administrations. Among the first signs came in December when Tokyo-based SoftBank’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, stood with the president-elect to announce a plan to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 new U.S. jobs. Two days after Trump’s inauguration, Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou told reporters in Taiwan that his company planned to spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory to make computer displays. It wasn’t iPhones — which Trump has said he wants to be “Made in the USA” — but Gou said the factory could create 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. jobs. Details were few, but one clue seized on was the presence of a Pennsylvania state trade representative at Gou’s talk. Foxconn said in a statement that it is “exploring a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations.” But the company could not confirm “the number of jobs that might be created.” Foxconn is a coveted hardware manufacturer because of its size. Last year, it reported $136 billion in revenue. It has more than 1 million employees, mostly in China. A single factory making iPhones or LCD screens can employ tens of thousands of workers. When Foxconn says it will invest in a new plant, the decision can transform a region. That’s why countries all over the world are eager to lure Foxconn to their shores. Gou, Foxconn’s founder, for years has described the United States as a “must-go market.” In 2014, as the Pennsylvania deal was quietly dying, Gou teased the opening of a LCD display factory in the states. His company talked with officials in Colorado and Arizona. Nothing happened. That same year, the company signed a letter of intent to invest up to $1 billion in Indonesia. That investment still has not occurred. Foxconn said it would invest $5 billion over five years in India as part of an ambitious expansion in 2014. The deal would create up to 50,000 jobs, Gou said. But Foxconn’s investment in India has amounted to only a small fraction of what it originally promised. Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5 billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10 billion plan in 2011. The company made its first major foray in Vietnam only last year. In Brazil, Foxconn has an iPhone factory, but its investment has fallen far short of expectations. “There’s a pattern here,” said Moel, the analyst. Gou’s plans for Harrisburg were revealed in 2013 while he was in the United States on a tour with other Taiwanese business officials to, in part, drum up support for Taiwan’s bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as TPP. (Coincidentally, Trump pulled the United States out of the trade treaty in his first days in office.) It was a surprise when Gou said Foxconn planned to invest $30 million over two years in a factory to make technology equipment and servers. Gou noted his company’s history in Harrisburg. He said the goal was to create “high-precision, high-tech, high value-added manufacturing in the U.S.” Gou also said Foxconn would donate $10 million to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for robotics research. “IPhone maker Foxconn to invest $40 million in the US,” wrote the China Post. “Foxconn to build plant in Pennsylvania,” CNN said. Local media quoted state officials as saying Gou would sign a memorandum of understanding and the company was busy scouting sites. “There was this intense buzz,” recalled David Black, president of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber. “Lots of us were excited by the opportunity,” said Bub Manning, who at the time co-owned a local construction firm. “Anytime something of that size comes along in central Pennsylvania, that’s a big deal.” For years, Foxconn has maintained an office with about 50 workers in Harrisburg, a hub of the computer connector industry. The office is in an old brick warehouse. On a recent visit, the building was filled by a half-empty warren of cubicles. A worker declined to comment to a reporter with The Washington Post. According to local government officials, Foxconn has not done any permitted alterations to the building in 15 years. Manning recalled how his firm tried to chase down information about the planned $30 million factory. “It felt like I was grabbing Jell-O. It never got any traction,” Manning said. The $30 million factory faded from view. Foxconn said its $10 million donation to Carnegie Mellon was “moving forward very successfully,” with half of the funds having been spent four years later. The school declined to comment. None of this has stopped the praise for Foxconn’s investment in Pennsylvania. Recent stories have referred to the phantom factory as a sign of Foxconn’s U.S. beachhead. A state economic development official wrote about Foxconn’s $30 million factory as evidence of foreign companies that operate in the Keystone State. (The piece was fixed after The Washington Post inquired about it.) State officials toured potential sites with Foxconn representatives, the state Department of Community and Economic Development said in a statement. “Unfortunately, a project did not come to fruition.” Foxconn attributed the failure to “material changes to the business and operating climate at that time.” “The proof is always in the pudding,” said Scott Andes, a senior policy analyst at Brookings. The assumption is that companies follow through on major announcements. “But it is important to be skeptical,” Andes said. “I would hope it’s not just smoke and mirrors with Foxconn or any other of these companies.” Feeling burned by the fate of the $30 million factory, some in Harrisburg are cautious about getting their hopes up again. “We learned something from that,” said Black of the Harrisburg chamber. But, Manning said, it would be hard to not be seduced by the size of Foxconn’s ambition, real or not. “If you smelled a project like that,” he said, “you’d get excited even though you know better.” Todd C.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen WASHINGTON — The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over by the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. READ MORE: Donald Trump takes credit for jobs that predated his presidency He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. an infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. a tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. a $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. his plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. WATCH: Trump alleges wiretapping by Obama; gives no evidence Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: Story continues below WATCH ABOVE: Trump says he strongly supports NATO TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. READ MORE: Who in Trump’s inner circle doesn’t have ties to Russia? TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” WATCH: Trump discusses money saved on Air Force One and for allies on F-35s TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” WATCH: President Trump says he will bring manufacturing jobs back to America TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. READ MORE: Donald Trump saves jobs in Indiana: good PR, bad economics or something else? Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. WATCH: Trump vows to lift defense sequester TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. WATCH: Trump wants to restore U.S. auto industry jobs TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labour force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. WATCH: President Trump to speak about military spending as new scandal looms TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. WATCH: President Trump calls illegal immigrant removal a ‘military operation’ TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. READ MORE: Donald Trump missed some key facts about immigrants It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. WATCH: President Trump said he will send a budget to Congress that’s “one of the largest increases in national defence spending” TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority.   © 2017 The Canadian Press Report an error Defense Secretary Jim Mattis Donald Trump donald trump fact check Donald Trump immigrant comments Donald Trump immigration Donald Trump jobs Donald trump NATO Donald Trump Russia F-35 Fighter Jet NATO President Donald Trump Editor's Picks Health Why are colon cancer rates in Gen Xers and millennials in Canada rising?

Ford at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Va. (Steve Helber, File/Associated Press) By Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard | AP By Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard | AP March 4 WASHINGTON — The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over by the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: —big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. —corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. —an infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. —a tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. —a $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. —his plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” ___ TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” ___ TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over by the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: Federal employee bill tracker: How pending legislation could affect your bottom line —big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. Advertisement —corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. —an infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. —a tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. —a $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. —his plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” ___ TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” ___ TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

Geminilake Will Require Intel Audio Firmware Blobs Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 4 March 2017 at 08:02 AM EST. 22 Comments Besides recent Intel graphics hardware making use of firmware binary blobs now for the GuC/HuC functionality, Intel audio hardware continues in making use of firmware binary-only blobs for audio support. Intel Skylake audio began needing firmware audio blobs along with Skylake as well as Broxton hardware. Thus it probably doesn't come as any surprise (unless you were hoping your protesting efforts were paying off) that the upcoming Geminilake hardware will also need firmware blobs for audio. We've been covering Geminilake's upbringing in Linux and the latest is the addition of audio firmware for this upcoming hardware. So Geminilake will be some more hardware unfriendly to GNU Linux-libre users. Geminilake is the SoC successor to Apollo Lake and will be used in low-end laptops, 2-in1 devices, all-in-one PCs, and more. Geminilake uses the Goldmont architecture and Skylake era graphics. Geminilake systems should be shipping later this year. 22 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect!

Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater!

It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games.

Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Intel’s Broadwell-E processors might boast high-end multi-core performance, but this is reflected by their high price. AMD has upset the market with its high-value eight-core processors and their increased performance over Intel’s multi-core solutions. Intel has continued to refine its architecture and provide small performance boosts each generation, while AMD has launched its new Ryzen processors – which are set to compete with the longstanding market leader. Ryzen 7 The most powerful Ryzen processor is the Ryzen 7 1800X, which AMD said is the fastest eight-core processor in the world. Despite its impressive performance, it is priced at R8,199 – less than half the price of the Intel Core i7 6900K (R18,591). This price difference makes the Ryzen line-up a great choice for high-end desktop users looking for a powerful and affordable eight-core CPU with relatively low power consumption. Another important feature of Ryzen 7 processors is that all chips are unlocked, unlike Intel’s Core processors. The increased implementation of new APIs allows processors with good multi-threaded performance to scale well in future applications, including high-resolution gaming. Below are benchmarks published by AMD for the Ryzen 7 1800X and Intel Core i7 6900K. Microarchitecture Intel’s approach to desktop processor architecture has changed since it reached the 14nm processor node, breaking its “tick-tock” design model. The “tick-tock” model involves the release of two architectures per fabrication process node, with the second being a refinement of the previous architecture on the same manufacturing process. The company previously progressed through architectures in this manner, but has remained on the 14nm fabrication process of late – choosing to continue optimising its microarchitecture. While Intel has been upgrading its processors with small performance and clock speed improvements on the 14nm process, AMD has been working on Ryzen – the company’s first desktop CPU architecture manufactured on the 14nm process node. Intel’s Kaby Lake chips received criticism for their small performance increase over previous CPU generations, with the the new processors providing little motivation for upgrading from a Skylake product – apart from Optane support and slightly-higher clock speeds. AMD has reportedly seen a 52% increase in IPC compared to its previous processor architecture, which is the result of a new process node and redesigned CPU architecture. While Intel’s mainstream – and more affordable – desktop products still remain unchallenged, AMD is yet to unveil its Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 processors. These are set to compete with Intel’s Core i7, Core i5, and Core i3 CPUs. If the price-per-performance ratio of Ryzen 7 processors scales down to AMD’s mainstream Ryzen products, Intel’s popular Core i5 and Core i7 gaming chips could be the next CPUs threatened by AMD’s new processors.

SHARE Governor hires Intel official as broadband guru Anthony Neal-Graves By Charles Ashby Friday, March 3, 2017 DENVER — Colorado has its first-ever broadband guru. Gov. John Hickenlooper on Friday hired Intel vice president Anthony Neal-Graves to be executive director of the new Colorado Broadband Office. Hickenlooper announced plans to create such an office during his State of the State address before a joint session of the Colorado Legislature in January, saying it was high time the state had someone to head up efforts to ensure the entire state has adequate internet services. “We are working tirelessly to make sure every county throughout the state has the tools needed for economic development, especially in rural areas,” the governor said in a statement. “Tony’s leadership will help move the needle so that all Coloradans have improved access to broadband services sooner rather than later.” The Democratic governor said that about 70 percent of Colorado residents have access to adequate broadband services, a ratio he wants to increase to at least 85 percent by the time his term in office ends next year. His goal, however, is to have the entire state covered by 2020. Graves comes to the state from Portland, Oregon, where he headed Intel’s “Internet of Things Group.” His primary role will be to drive the state’s broadband strategy, which is to include public-private partnerships to lay the equipment needed to extend broadband to all areas of the state. The Legislature has struggled in recent years to find ways to get private companies to invest the money needed to reach rural parts of the state, including creating a special Broadband Deployment Fund. That fund was created as part of a long-range plan to do away with another fund designed to help telecommunications companies bring landline telephone service to all areas of the state. Under current law, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission is to declare certain areas of the state sufficiently equipped for landline and cell service, diverting a charge consumers pay for that into the new broadband fund. But since that fund was created in 2014, only about $2.1 million has been transferred into it, partly because telecommunications companies have sued the utilities commission over the matter, delaying its ability to designate areas of the state as being adequately served for telephone service.

Portwel’s 125 x 95mm “PCOM-B642VG” COM Express Basic Type 6 entry taps Intel’s higher-end quad- and dual-core S-series desktop-class models. No model details were offered, so presumably the module supports all 16 Kaby Lake-S parts, from a dual-core, 3.4GHz Core i3-7100T with 35W to a quad-core 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K with 91W TDP. The CPUs are available with HD Graphics 630, and one of three Intel chipsets: Q170, H110, and C236. PCOM-B642VG, front and back (click images to enlarge) No OS details were supplied for the module, which follows earlier Portwell Type 6 COMs like the Haswell-based PCOM-B630VG, but Linux should run just fine. The module supports Intel Kaby Lake functionality such as Intel Turbo Boost and Hyper-threading technologies, as well as Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions), Intel MPX (Memory Guard Extensions), and additional HSIO (High Speed Input/Output), says Portwell. The PCOM-B642VG can load up to 32GB DDR4-2400 via dual sockets, and when using the C236 chipset, it supports ECC RAM. Four SATA III ports are provided along with a GbE controller and both PCIe Gen 3 x16 and 8x PCIe Gen 3 x1 expansion. There’s an option to swap out the latter for a single PCIe x4 interface. Triple simultaneous displays are supported via DisplayPort, VGA, and eDP interfaces. An LVDS interface also appears to be available. The PCOM-B642VG is further equipped with 4x USB 3.0, 8x USB 2.0, and Intel HD Audio. The module supports TPM security, as well as I2C, SMBus, and UART interfaces. The PCOM-B642VG “typically” runs on “12V, 5VSB, VBAT” power, and can operate at 0 to 60ºC temperatures, says Portwell. Optional services include carrier board design and development, review schematics and BIOS customization. The module supports applications including medical healthcare systems, military equipment, retail systems, and IoT.   Further information The PCOM-B642VG is available now from Portwell, and will also be distributed via Arrow Electronics and Avnet. More information may be found at Portwell’s PCOM-B642VG product page.   Related posts: First Apollo Lake Nano-ITX SBC emerges COM Express Type 6 quartet sings Braswell's praise Qseven COM offers Apollo Lake and a security chip Linux-friendly COM offers a choice of Bay Trail SoCs COM Express modules build on Intel's Kaby Lake Industrial focused Mini-ITX board packs Skylake punch Kaby Lake board lineup includes a Mini-ITX SBC and two COMs COM runs Linux on Kaby Lake, supports Intel Optane Kontron launches Linux-friendly Kaby Lake COMs Three more Apollo Lake COMs support Qseven and COM Express (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Based on Intel’s latest diversity report, it seems the company is moving in the right direction when it comes to retention of diverse employees. Overall, Intel hit its goal retaining diverse employees, with a 15 percent exit rate for women and people of color compared to a 15.5 percent exit rate for employees in majority groups (white people, Asian people and men). Last year, 14.2 percent of Intel’s new hires were from an underrepresented minority group, which led to an increase of people of color representation from 12.3 percent during the middle of 2016 to 12.5 percent by the end of the year. It’s also an overall increase from Intel’s 2015 representation of people of color (12.4 percent). The exit rate for people of color was slightly higher than their majority colleagues — 15.5 percent for underrepresented minorities compared to 15.3 percent for white and Asian employees. Retention for black employees, however, was slightly better, with an exit rate of 15.2 percent. Regarding the Hispanic/Latinx employee population at Intel, representation of Latinx people dropped from 8.4 percent in 2015 to 8.2 percent by the end of 2016. But Intel says it’s because of a reclassification of race and the addition of a “two races or more” category. The Latinx exit rate at Intel was 15.5 percent, which means a worse retention rate for Latinx employees than black, Asian and white employees. But it wasn’t as bad as the retention rate for Native Americans, which had an exit rate of 17.3 percent. So, Intel is (somewhat surprisingly) best at retaining black people and the worst at retaining Native American employees. In general, Intel retains women at a higher rate than men. In 2016, the exit rate for women at Intel was 15 percent while the exit rate for men was 15.4 percent. It’s not clear why Intel is better at retaining some groups more than others. Across the board, exit rates drastically increased last year compared to the year before, in part because of layoffs. intel retention race intel retention gender  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit This is not the first time Intel has reported retention data, but it is the first time it’s reported retention data specific to underrepresented minorities in its main report, rather than just in the addendum. It’s also worth noting that the data from previous addendums were not relative to each respective race’s size at the company.

For one, it implemented WarmLine, a service to provide support and guidance to people thinking about leaving the company. Since its launch in Spring 2016, 1,200 people used the service. Intel also did a retention survey around underrepresented minorities. Details of the study’s results were scarce, but Intel Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Danielle Brown (pictured above on left) wrote in the diversity report that it “provided us a thorough look into the challenges our employees of color face.” The next step is to create “Tailored playbooks” to improve representation of diverse people at the company, as well as inclusion. “Our aim is to engage business leaders and managers in diversity and inclusion efforts more directly so that we can collectively work toward meeting hiring, retention, and progression goals,” Brown wrote. Overall, Intel exceeded its 2016 hiring goals, with 45.1 percent of its new hires coming from an underrepresented group. At the leadership level, female representation grew from 17.6 percent in 2015 to 18.4 percent by the end of last year. Underrepresented minority representation at the leadership level also increased, from 6.3 percent in 2015 to 7.1 percent at the end of 2016, with each respective group seeing increases (representation of black employees went from 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent, Latinx employee representation grew from 3.8 percent to 4 percent and Native American representation increased from 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent). Moving forward, Brown says Intel will address intersectionality, “starting with a focused and targeted strategy around improving the retention and progression of Intel’s women of color.” intel diversity 2017 intel diversity 2017  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Intel Founded 1968 Overview Intel designs, manufactures, and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide.

Woodvine on March 4th, 2017 at 5:29 PM 1 of 1 2 of 1 At least 147 U.S. tech companies now publicly oppose President Trump’s so-called Muslim travel ban, including some of the most capitalized and influential corporations in the world, such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Intel. The backlash from the tech sector began within days of January 26, when President Trump signed his executive order banning certain immigrants from entering the United States, including all Syrian refugees and anyone from seven predominantly Muslim nations. Most recently, Yahoo and Tumblr filed an amicus brief on Friday (February 17), in support of Darweesh v. Trump—one of nearly 50 court challenges to the travel ban. Seemingly, all the other 145-plus tech companies publicly opposed to the travel ban have associated themselves with the well-publicized lawsuit State of Washington and State of Minnesota v. Trump. It is this latter legal action, commonly called Washington v. Trump, which has been blocking implementation of the travel ban since February 3 and which a U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco refused to quash in a unanimous ruling on February 9. In their amicus brief, Yahoo and Tumblr neatly sum up the pro-immigration attitude of all the tech companies opposed to the Trump travel ban: “Immigrants to the U.S. bring with them immense talent and entrepreneurship that help drive the innovation economy. Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo—two Stanford grad students, one from Taiwan and one from Louisiana—so we know firsthand that great things can happen when America welcomes the world’s best and brightest.” However, the tech companies’ arguments against the travel ban are rooted less in warm humanist virtue than in hard economic necessity. The U.S. education system, the companies say, does not produce anywhere near enough Americans with the requisite computer science skills to fill more than a fraction of U.S. tech jobs; therefore it is absolutely necessary to attract a constant influx of the world’s “best and brightest” in order for the tech sector in the United States just to survive, let alone thrive. Keep in mind that opposing a newly-elected president who is carrying out a campaign promise is not—strictly speaking—a good business move; rather it is a sure way to piss off millions of voters/consumers. I take the fact that so many tech companies (almost all of them dependent on consumer sales) have been willing to come out against Trump’s travel ban as proof of two things. That the companies see the travel ban and similar anti-immigration policies as truly threatening their survival and that they can count well enough to know that more U.S. consumers voted for Hillary Clinton (65,844,954, or 48.2 percent) than for Donald Trump (62,979,879, or 46.1 percent). President Trump keeps a divisive campaign promise In brief, U.S president Donald Trump’s travel ban–properly titled “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States”, which Trump signed on January 26 as Executive Order 13769, does the following: Permanently closes the U.S. borders to all Syrian refugees. Closes the U.S. borders for 90 days to immigrants and travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries (Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen)—including immigrants with valid U.S. visas. After 90 days the list of banned countries will be revised and perhaps even expanded. Suspends for 120 days the troubled U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Caps to 50,000 the total number of refugees allowed in the U.S in 2017. Instant legal challenges On January 30—only four days after the Executive Order was signed—Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson (later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota) was in a Seattle U.S. District Court seeking to have the executive order declared “illegal and unconstitutional”. Ferguson argued that the Muslim travel ban was both discriminatory and directly harmed the interests of the state’s residents as well as the foreign students and lecturers attending state educational institutions. On February 3, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart sided with Washington State and granted a temporary restraining order against key elements of Trump’s executive order. On February 9, a three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, California, unanimously denied the Trump administration’s request to lift the temporary restraining order stopping the U.S. government from enforcing much of the travel ban. This effectively threw the matter back to the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Washington, where it began. On February 27, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to put a hold on the Washington v. Trump suit seeking to overturn the current travel ban, despite claims by the Trump administration that it is readying a differently formulated travel ban, intended to be immune from judicial challenge. On February 28 it was widely reported that the newly revised travel ban would drop Iraq from the list of banned countries of origin. The U.S. tech sector stands for immigration The U.S. information technology sector only needed to look at itself in a mirror to see why it had to oppose the Trump administration’s specifically Islamophobic and generally xenophobic immigration travel ban: Current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was born in Hyderabad, India. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was a refugee from the former Soviet Union. Current Google CEO Sundar Pichai was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. Twitter’s executive chairman Omid Kordestani was born in Iran. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos‘s step-dad immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba. Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was a refugee fleeing the 1978 Iranian Revolution. California entrepreneur Safi Qureshey—a practicing Muslim born in Pakistan—cofounded the (now defunct) U.S. personal computer company AST Research in 1980. And on and on. Besides the gifted foreign-born entrepreneurs and executives mentioned above (some of whom have slowly risen up through the corporate ranks), U.S. tech companies appear to be very dependent on attracting very large numbers of foreign-born computer science graduates, in order to fill positions in middle management and below. It's all thanks to a massive ongoing shortfall in skilled American computer graduates. According to several sources, including the Atlantic, there are  currently about half a million computer jobs to be filled in the U.S. tech sector. But only about 43,000 Americans graduate college annually with the required computer science degrees to fill these jobs. Meanwhile, considerably more than one million  IT engineers graduate in China and India every year, according to Newsweek. The U.S. government has been trying, in fits and starts, to grow the number of American science graduates for decades. Most recently the Obama administration tried hard but was largely unable to convince a Republican-held Congress to approve a package of programs designed to produce more college graduates in the so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. Simply put, the U.S. technology companies which are opposed to Trump’s travel ban say that in lieu of a large-enough pool of sufficiently skilled Americans, they must hire skilled foreign workers. And insofar as the travel ban makes it difficult for U.S. tech companies to attract and keep the best-qualified foreign-born workers, it does real harm to the long-term prospects of the U.S. tech sector, which is a significant segment of the U.S. economy, accounting for millions of good domestic jobs and trillions of dollars of domestic spending. How the tech opposition to Trump’s travel ban evolved First off, on January 31, Amazon and Expedia (both based in Washington state) each filed declarations joining the Washington lawsuit against the travel ban. Amazon’s motion cites the travel ban’s adverse affects on both employees and prospective employees, including a Libyan-born Amazon lawyer with British citizenship, as well as 49 employees born in the seven Muslim-majority countries included in the ban. Expedia’s motion says that the ban could damage its international travel business, considering that at least 1,000 of its customers hold passports from the seven restricted countries. On February 6, 96 U.S. companies filed an amicus brief in support of the suit against the ban, including many of the heaviest hitters in tech: AdRoll • Aeris Communications • Airbnb • AltSchool • Ancestry.com • Appboy • Apple • AppNexus Inc. • Asana, Inc. • Atlassian Corp Plc • Autodesk • Automattic • Box • Brightcove • Brit + Co • CareZone • Castlight Health • Checkr • Chobani • Citrix Systems • Cloudera • Cloudflare • Copia Institute • DocuSign • DoorDash • Dropbox • Dynatrace • eBay • Engine Advocacy • Etsy • Facebook • Fastly • Flipboard • Foursquare Labs • Fuze • General Assembly • GitHub • Glassdoor • Google • GoPro • Harmonic • Hipmunk • Indiegogo • Intel Corporation • JAND, Inc. d/b/a Warby Parker • Kargo Global • Kickstarter • KIND • Knotel • Levi Strauss & Co. • LinkedIn Corporation • Lithium Technologies, Inc. • Lyft • Mapbox • Maplebear Inc. d/b/a Instacart • Marin Software Incorporated • Medallia, Inc. • A Medium Corporation • Meetup, Inc. • Microsoft Corporation • Motivate International • Mozilla Corporation • Netflix • NETGEAR • NewsCred • Patreon • PayPal Holdings, Inc. • Pinterest • Quora • Reddit • Rocket Fuel • SaaStr • Salesforce.com, Inc. • Scopely • Shutterstock • Snap • Spokeo • Spotify USA • Square • Squarespace • Strava • Stripe • SurveyMonkey • TaskRabbit • Tech:NYC • Thumbtack • Turn Inc. • Twilio • Twitter • Uber Technologies, Inc. • Via • Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. • Workday • Y Combinator Management, LLC • Yelp • Zynga.   By the evening of February 6, another 31 companies had reportedly joined the brief, including Adobe Systems, Tesla, and Space X, bringing the total to 129: Adobe Systems Incorporated • Affirm, Inc. • Ampush • Brocade Communications Systems • Bungie • Casper Sleep • Cavium • Chegg • ClassPass • Coursera • EquityZen Inc. • Evernote • Gusto • Handy Technologies • HP • IAC/InterActiveCorp • Linden Lab • Managed By Q • MobileIron • New Relic • Pandora Media • Planet Labs • RPX Corporation • Shift Technologies • Slack Technologies • SpaceX • Tesla • TripAdvisor • Udacity • Zendesk • Zenefits.   Between February 7 and 9 a minimum of 16 more companies joined the Technology Companies amicus brief, bringing the total to at least 145: Akamai Technologies, Inc. • CREDO Mobile, Inc. • DiCentral • Fitbit, Inc. • Groupon • Medidata Solutions • Molecule Software, Inc. • MongoDB, Inc. • Pivotal Software • Postmates • Redfin • Quantcast Corp. • SoundCloud, Inc. • Skycatch, Inc. • SpotHero • WHOmentors.com, Inc.   The late addition of Yahoo and Tumbler on February 17 brings the total to at least 147. The tech companies in Trump’s corner Donald Trump does have his supporters in the tech sector. Notable U.S. technology companies that have not voiced opposition to the travel ban include: AT&T • Cisco • General Electric • IBM • Oracle • Palantir Technologies • Sprint • T-Mobile • Verizon • WeWork. Notably, AT&T, Cisco, IBM, and Palantir do very little or none of their business with the general public. AT&T, in particular, dares not anger Donald Trump because it needs his administration’s approval of its huge merger with Time Warner, the owner of CNN. IBM’s CEO Ginni Rometty is a member of Trump’s business advisory council and in November 2016 wrote an open letter to president-elect Trump on the subject of creating “new collar” jobs, wherein she promised that IBM would bring 25,000 more jobs to the U.S. Oracle’s CEO Israeli-born Safra Catz was part of Trump’s transition team and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins has gone on record as supporting Trump’s tax reform policies. Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp attended Trump’s tech summit but more to the point, the data mining software company is firmly in the Trump administration’s pocket. Palantir was cofounded by Trump supporter Peter Thiel with backing from Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture arm and counts the FBI, Pentagon, and IRS among its largest clients. And to paraphrase Intercept, Palantir is providing the engine for Donald Trump’s deportation machine. Is Trump trying to prevent terrorism or cause it? The majority of mass killing incidents in the United States have been committed by citizens born in the United States and the common thread that connects all the terrorists—domestic and foreign—from the Unabomber to Timothy McVeigh to Omar Mir Seddique Mateen to Osama Bin Laden—isn’t nationality or religion, it is the nihilistic surrender to extremism, hate, and murder. Between 1975 and 2015, nationals from five of the banned countries (two Iraqis, six Iranians, two Somalis, six Sudanese, and one Yemeni) were convicted of attempting or executing terrorist attacks on U.S. but all the same, no one from the seven banned countries killed anyone in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil during that period. None of the perpetrators of terrorist attacks in the U.S. claiming 10 or more victims were from one of the seven banned countries. The majority of attacks were committed by people born in the U.S. Over the last four decades, only 20 of 3.25 million refugees have been convicted of attempting or committing terrorism on U.S. soil. Only three Americans have been killed in attacks committed by refugees—all by Cubans in the 1970s. None of the birth countries of people who have killed people in U.S. (Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia) are affected by Trump’s travel ban. No Muslim-majority countries where the Trump Organization holds business interests, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, the U.A.E., and Azerbaijan are affected by the ban. Arguably, only someone ignorant of the actual history of terrorism in the United States could imagine that Trump’s Muslim-centric travel ban could do anything to reduce the threat of such acts on U.S. soil. However, I do not consider Trump to be unintelligent, just uncaring of the larger consequences of his self-centred actions; I see him as someone who would burn down a forest just to warm his little hands. Trump also looks to me like a man in a hurry to start something. His March 2 speech aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier wearing a flight jacket and an admiral’s cap suggests how badly he wants an excuse to dress up as the warrior—Il Duce-style; to clothe himself and his actions in the wardrobe of scoundrels and by that I mean jingoistic “love it or leave it” patriotism. I admit that it’s a terrible thing to suggest, that Trump’s travel ban may be coldly calculated to provoke the very terrorism that it speaks of thwarting; likely it’s just the simpler sort of pandering bigotry that one associates with a populist demagogue of Trump’s stripe. Either way I’m sure that its purpose doesn’t extend much beyond selfish political considerations on Trump’s part. And I agree wholeheartedly with the technology companies opposed to the travel ban that whatever comes of it will be to the expense and detriment of the United States. And you know that something’s really rotten when you find yourself in perfect accord with a bunch of avaricious corporate entities such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Intel.

The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. "I'm not sure what it is he is talking about… Perhaps the President has information that is not yet available to us or to the public. And if it's true, obviously we're going to find out very quickly. And if it isn't, then obviously he'll have to explain what he meant by it," Rubio told the CNN.

The White House statement said this should be carried out as part of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the election.

U-blox just completed the US$52.5 million acquisition of Shanghai-based SIMCom’s cellular modem product line, its research and development team, and its customer base. It was U-blox’s biggest-ever takeover. The Swiss company creates wireless semiconductors and modules for consumer, automotive and industrial markets, including GPS technology, GPS chipsets and smart antennas. It is betting on high growth demand in China, the world’s biggest auto market. Seiler calls it a “step-forward” industry in progress toward “smart driving,” or Internet-based driving. U-blox isn’t the only company investing heavily in the sector, which enables people, vehicles and machines to locate exact positions and communicate wirelessly over cellular and other networks. Such systems are regarded as a basic and necessary step in the development of the more ambitious target of “self-driving” cars. Industry giants like Intel, Qualcomm, China Mobile, Baidu, Huawei and start-ups like Mobike and Ofo are entering the sector, which comprises an industry chain from chip design, telecommunications networks and satellite positioning to chip-making and Internet services. The market is no doubt worthy the heavy interest. By 2020, more than 152 million cars are expected to feature Internet-connection functions in location positioning, communications and entertainment. Cars capable of autonomous driving will begin appearing on highways by 2020, according to US-based research firm IHS Automotive. The Internet of Things market in China, which relies on the technology of machine-to-machine communications, is forecast to grow at an average 13 percent annually, topping US$361 billion by 2020, analysts said. China Mobile, the world’s biggest mobile carrier, has partnered with Ericsson Inc and Mobike to adapt the latest location application technology to track bike-sharing in Shanghai. New narrow-band Internet of Things technology can help Mobike users easily locate shared bikes and can assist Mobike in finding lost bikes faster. It also helps China Mobile to improve its network coverage ability by five to seven times, the firms said. Huawei, China Telecom and bike-sharing service provider Ofo also launched similar services last month. The technology used in bike-sharing is seen as a prelude for technologies that will soon be installed in cars. Such technology can be used in parking lots, industrial plants, rural regions and other places without mobile network coverage, said Sweden’s Ericsson, which plans to set up a new Internet of Things research center in Shanghai. Chip giants like Intel and Qualcomm expect new 5G technologies, scheduled to be in commercial use between 2018 and 2020, to become a key catalyst in developing the smart driving industry. Intel has allocated a US$100 million fund for smart driving. It has said it expects more than 100 million Internet-connected cars on the road by 2025, creating a market valued at US$42 billion. The 5G network, offering high-speed connection and improved bandwidth capacity, will push the development of smart driving. By 2025, the average data-transmission capacity of a smart car is forecast at about 750 megabytes per second, creating a “powerful smartphone” on wheels, according to Intel, the world’s biggest computer chipmaker. U-box, which supports various satellite communications systems including GPS and China’s Beidou system, is able to offer location positioning systems on vehicles with an accuracy rate of within one meter. Its more advanced positioning system has a rate within one centimeter, but so far it is available only in some professional sectors, like architecture, at a high cost, the company said. But such location technology is expected to be widely adopted within one or two years, especially in tandem with the advent of 5G technology. That will be a big step forward for smart driving and even self-driving, industry officials said.

Digital Trends Home > Home > Intel patents a 3D camera baby monitor that could… Intel patents a 3D camera baby monitor that could detect breathing patterns By Lulu Chang — March 2, 2017 3:47 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Keeping a watchful eye on a newborn is of the utmost importance to new parents, which could make this 3D camera baby monitor a hit. Even the most watchful parents can’t have their eyes on their newborn at all times, but luckily, they may be getting some help from Intel. A new patent filed on Thursday for a 3D camera system for infant monitoring explains how a proposed device could use a “depth-sensing camera to detect abdomen rise and fall during an infant sleep period, or lack thereof, due to respiratory arrest.” The 3D camera would be able to ascertain some surprisingly minute details, including the “distance between an infant’s abdominal cavity and a camera baseline over time.” Should the baby stop breathing, the device would trigger an alarm to notify parents via smartphone, laptops, tablets, or another device. Moreover, the patent suggests that this futuristic camera would be able to detect when an infant shifts sleeping positions from sleeping on his or her back to the belly, again alerting parents if there is cause for concern. The camera, the Intel team hopes, could help to prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which occurs most frequently during sleep and seems to be linked to respiratory issues. More: This non-contact baby monitor gives new parents some peace of mind “Conventional approaches to detecting an infant respiratory problem in real time require physical attachment of devices to the infant,” the patent reads. “A more robust system for infant respiratory monitoring is therefore needed.” While digital cameras certainly already exist in most modern infant monitoring systems, many of these are unable to provide the level of detail that may be required in life-or-death situations. With little image analysis capacities, many of these cameras allow parents a broad overview of the goings-on with their child, but not much by way of specifics like their breathing patterns. The 3D camera, however, could be a solution. It’s unclear as of yet exactly what form this 3D camera will take, but if it does come to fruition, it could come as a huge relief to parents everywhere.

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffJuan Williams: Time for a special prosecutor House intel chief: Russia probe will include potential surveillance of campaigns Schiff: Not even Spicer wants to speak about Trump's wiretapping claim MORE (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, slammed President Trump on Saturday over his allegation that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower before the election. "If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation's chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them,” Schiff said in a statement on Saturday. Trump took to Twitter early Saturday morning to accuse his predecessor of ordering the wiretaps, but did not provide any evidence to support the claim. ADVERTISEMENT “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” Trump wrote. “Is it legal for a sitting President to be ‘wire tapping’ a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!” he added in another tweet. “I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!” A spokesman for Obama issued a statement denying that Obama's White House ordered such surveillance.  "A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice," said spokesman Kevin Lewis. "As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen," Lewis added. "Any suggestion otherwise is simply false." Democratic lawmakers slammed Trump over the tweets, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) arguing that Trump was attempting to distract from his own scrutiny. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said if Trump Tower had been bugged, then it would mean Trump is in trouble. “Mr. President: If there was a wiretap at Trump Tower, that means a fed judge found probable cause of crime which means you are in deep sh--,” Lieu wrote in response to Trump. Schiff said Trump’s recent tweets show he will never be a man who understands the Constitution or regards the truth. “No matter how much we hope and pray that this President will grow into one who respects and understands the Constitution, separation of powers, role of a free press, responsibilities as the leader of the free world, or demonstrates even the most basic regard for the truth, we must now accept that President Trump will never become that man," he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over by the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama's time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: —big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. —corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. —an infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. —a tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama's presidency. —a $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. —his plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission "was started before I got here," Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, "Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice." THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: "According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year." THE FACTS: That's not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants "contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services." The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants' children "are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population." This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the "long-run fiscal impact" of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive "if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account." ___ TRUMP: "We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price" of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company's CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, "I don't see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this." ___ TRUMP: "Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump's term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer "one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history." THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn't come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: "Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force." THE FACTS: That's true, but for the vast majority of them, it's because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn't have a job and isn't looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It's true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation's unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: "Our Navy is now the smallest it's been since, believe or not, World War I. Don't worry. It's going to soon be the largest it's been." THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it's been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a "peace dividend" from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump's military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It's unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: "According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center." THE FACTS: It's unclear what Justice Department data he's citing, but the most recent government information doesn't back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren't entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It's true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI's primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that's no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: "We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world." THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world's best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy's top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world's finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson's main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. "We will not be able to 'buy' our way out of the challenges that we face," he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

Valleyview & Cherryview To Get Atomic Mode-Setting Enabled Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 4 March 2017 at 08:14 AM EST. 4 Comments Intel's set to enable atomic mode-setting by default with code slated to land for the Linux 4.12 kernel. The initial patches for enabling atomic mode-setting by default turned it on for Gen5 (Ironlake) hardware and newer, but left out Valleyview and Cherryview hardware due to problems. But now it looks like for Linux 4.12 the Cherryview/Valleyview problems could be addressed and see those mobile platforms go atomic too. These patches published Friday by Ville Syrjälä fix the VLV/CHV hardware's watermark issue and goes ahead to enable the atomic support by default. See the aforelinked article for more details on the atomic mode-setting impact. To test Intel's atomic support right now on a Linux 4.9+ kernel, boot the kernel with i915.nuclear_pageflip=1 to enjoy it until the default change-over is made, most likely for Linux 4.12 unless something goes awry. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Twitter Facebook Fileless Powershell malware uses DNS as covert communication channel DNSMessenger is a multistage threat written in Powershell that uses DNS for two-way communication with attackers Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 04 March, 2017 04:01 - - - - print email Comments Targeted attacks are moving away from traditional malware to stealthier techniques that involve abusing standard system tools and protocols, some of which are not always monitored. The latest example is an attack dubbed DNSMessenger, which was analyzed by researchers from Cisco Systems' Talos team. The attack starts with a malicious Microsoft Word document distributed through an email phishing campaign. When opened, the file masquerades as a "protected document" secured by McAfee, an antivirus brand now owned by Intel Security. The user is asked to click on the enable content button in order to view the document's content, but doing so will actually execute malicious scripting embedded within. The script is written in Powershell, a powerful scripting language built into Windows that allows for the automation of system administration tasks. What's interesting is that until this point, everything is done in memory, without writing any malicious files to disk. The second stage is also done in Powershell and involves checking for several parameters of the envrionment, like the privileges of the logged-in user and the version of Powershell installed on the system. This information is used to determine how to proceed to the next step and how to achieve persistence. Depending on the result of the stage-two checks, yet another Powershell script will either be stored in an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) in the NTFS file system or directly inside the registry. The third stage Powershell script contains an additional obfuscated script that establishes a fairly sophisticated two-way communications channel over the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS is normally used to look up the Internet Protocol addresses associated with domain names, but it has support for different types of records. The TXT record in particular allows a DNS server to attach unformatted text to a response. "All C2 [command-and-control] communications associated with this malware are performed using DNS TXT queries and responses," the Cisco Talos researchers said in a blog post. This covert communication channel allows attackers to send commands to be executed on the system and to receive the output of those commands. Organizations typically go to great lengths to filter HTTP and HTTPS traffic that goes in and out of their networks, but not many of them monitor DNS. Attackers know this and are encapsulating other protocols inside DNS to remain undetected. The use of system tools like Powershell and code that's executed directly in memory are also increasingly common techniques that makes the detection of compromises much harder. "This malware sample is a great example of the length attackers are willing to go to stay undetected while operating within the environments that they are targeting," the Cisco Talos researchers said. "It also illustrates the importance that in addition to inspecting and filtering network protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP/POP3, etc. DNS traffic within corporate networks should also be considered a channel that an attacker can use to implement a fully functional, bidirectional C2 infrastructure." 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Mesa 17.0.1 Adds Better Support for "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth," Other Games GO Several crashes were patched for the Gallium drivers Mar 5, 2017 23:06 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Collabora's Emil Velikov was proud to announce this weekend the availability of the first point release to the recently released Mesa 17.0 3D Graphics Library stable series. The development cycle of Mesa 17.0.1 was small, and a Release Candidate (RC) build was announced just a few days ago, so we could give you a heads up on what's coming. Looking at the appended shortlog, we can notice that there are a little over 60 improvements implemented in this maintenance update. All sorts of changes are available, starting with better support for various games, including The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a fix for a regression with the EGL/Wayland support, many bug fixes for the Gallium drivers, as well as better eglQuerySurface geometry when using EGL under X11 with DRI3. "In this release we have GLX/GLVND fix for 'The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth' and other games. When using EGL under X11/DRI3 eglQuerySurface now returns correct geometry. A regression in EGL/Wayland where the wrong format was passed is addressed," said Emil Velikov, Software Release Engineer at Collabora. All GNU/Linux distributions should update to Mesa 17.0.1 The list of changes continues with a patch for an old regression with the r300 driver on BE hardware, Tessellation shader improvements for Stoney and Carrizo AMD GPUs when using the RadeonSI driver, compute shader improvements for the Nouveau driver to make various nvc0 devices work better, and some more fixes for the VC4 and Etnaviv drivers. The Radeon RADV and Intel ANV Vulkan drivers also received various improvements so they should perform better on some systems. These include better handling of Intel graphics cards that lack LLC (Last Level Cache) support, better swizzle clears, as well as CTS fixes for Sandy Bridge. Some of these changes are also present on the Intel i965 OpenGL driver. Other than that, it looks like Mesa 17.0.1 ships with a new script that allows for parsing of bug fixes and possible nominations, and build fixes for the Android platform. We believe that by now all GNU/Linux distributions should use the Mesa 17.0 3D Graphics Library, so updating to Mesa 17.0.1, whose sources are available for download right now from our website, is essential for a better gaming/graphics experience. The full changelog is attached below for more technical details on the fixes.

FBi Director James Comey  (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) The Justice Department had not responded to the request Sunday after Comey's extraordinary request to discredit claims of a plot to sabotage the president's campaign. The official who confirmed the FBI director's action, first reported by TheNew York Times,  is not authorized to comment publicly. Comey, the official said, wanted Justice to comment, because Trump's claims were not true. The Justice Department and the FBI did not immediately comment on the matter. The revelation of Comey's request capped off a weekend in which Trump made a series of unsubstantiated claims about illegal wiretapping, while Democrats said he was trying to change the subject from the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in last year's election. Through a spokesman Saturday, Obama denied wiretapping Trump, and on Sunday, former director of national intelligence James Clapper said he knew of no effort to seek wiretaps against Trump during his tenure. Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press, Clapper said “there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time, as a candidate or against his campaign.” Pressed on whether he would know whether the FBI had obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order to wiretap the Trump campaign, Clapper said he would have known and that none existed “to my knowledge,” and none was authorized for Trump Tower, the president’s campaign headquarters last year. The statement followed Trump’s claim, in a series of tweets early Saturday, that Obama “had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” and, minutes later, “Is it legal for a sitting President to be ‘wire tapping’ a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court order. A NEW LOW!” Trump also asked for a congressional investigation of his claims, saying in a statement from White House spokesman Sean Spicer that "reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling." Trump is "requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016," Spicer said. While Trump repeatedly tweeted about Obama during the weekend, Spicer's statement said "neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted." The Sunday news interview shows focused on the Trump wiretap allegation, the campaign’s alleged contacts with Russian officials and Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ decision last week to recuse himself from any investigation of the 2016 presidential race. The recusal came after news reports established that though Sessions testified under oath during his confirmation hearing that he, being a Trump campaign surrogate, had not met with Russian officials, he had in fact met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Session’s spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said he met with the ambassador in his capacity as a senator. Read more: Sessions recuses himself from Russia probe Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a sometime Trump critic who serves on the Intelligence Committee, said on Meet the Press regarding the wiretap claim that he had “never heard that allegation made before by anybody. … But again, the president put that out there, and now the White House will have to answer to exactly what he was referring to.” Former CIA director and Defense secretary Leon Panetta, on CBS’ Face the Nation, said that Trump is making the same mistake other presidents have during scandals by seeking to “divert attention, trying to obfuscate, trying to cover up,” but that truth will come out. “This issue is not going away,” he said. “There’s too much here.” “Every time he tweets, every time these issues come up that indicate that there’s obviously something to this Russia issue, and the administration is not cooperating when that happens, when he accuses a past president of wiretapping without any evidence of that being the case, it makes us vulnerable…It makes us vulnerable to our enemies,” Panetta said. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican on the Intelligence Committee looking into the Russian influence in last year’s election, said that rather than tweeting accusations, “it would be more helpful if he turned over any evidence he has,” and not comment further. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine  (Photo: T.J. Kirkpatrick, Getty Images) “The president has called for a congressional investigation into the allegations he made starting yesterday morning, so I would expect that he’s going to want to provide our committee with any evidence that he has,” Collins said. “My own theory is that the Russians are determined to sow the seeds of discontent and doubt about the legitimacy of our democracy and other western democracies and that they were going to do that regardless of who was elected president, so it’s really important that we know what happened,” she said. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said he believes the investigation underway will “get the information we need.” He said he expects to hear from former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned after his contacts with Kislyak during the transition to Trump’s presidency were revealed. Read more: Trump wants congressional probe of evidence-free claims about Obama National security adviser Michael Flynn resigns Georgetown University law professor Paul Rothstein said an attack like Trump’s on a former president is “unprecedented. I am aware of no other one like this.” Rothstein explained that the president himself could not legally order a wiretap but the FBI or the Justice Department could apply for a warrant if they could demonstrate to a judge that there was evidence giving rise to probable cause a crime has been or is being committed or spying is being done by a foreign agent and that a domestic wiretap would reveal it. In the case of a possible foreign agent, the application would be to the FISA court, Rothstein said.

Home India news HP15-BAO21 AX: Priced at Rs 38,690, this is a value for money laptop HP15-BAO21 AX: Priced at Rs 38,690, this is a value for money laptop HP15-BA021AX comes with an AMD processor and seems like a value for money laptop By: Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Published: March 6, 2017 2:17 AM   HP15-BA021AX is one giant laptop, especially given that we are now in 2017. A lot of people still ask me to suggest a good, affordable laptop and I tell them to push their budget to get the cheapest Mac, the MacBook Air. My reasoning for this is simple: ever since Windows 10 has come out, buying an under-spec laptop might not give you a great user experience with the Microsoft operating system. I am speaking more from experience as I had to return my office laptop and move to a workstation instead. Anyway, it is rare to get hold of a laptop to review these days, and so I latched on the opportunity to test an HP laptop that is powered by AMD, and not the ubiquitous Intel. HP15-BA021AX is one giant laptop, especially given that we are now in 2017. This model seems to have been designed by someone, who was under a rock when the world was talking about ultrabooks and ultra-thin laptops. Anyway, this is more a desktop replacement, rather than something you would enjoy lugging around on your back. But most of us will not have a choice as this is what we will be able to afford, or what the IT department of your organisation will choose for you. But let’s look beyond design. My objective with this laptop was to test if the processor is able to take in the rigours of daily (online) life these days. For instance, in my line of work I have scores of tabs open on multiple browsers by the end of the day. This would invariably prompt a medium range Windows laptop to express its displeasure and stall. My IT department came up with a simple solution: open just one tab on Chrome, which is just impossible to follow. So I started with multi-tab browsing and the laptop held up well. Yes, it did slow up a bit as the Firefox browser crossed 12 tabs, still it was not that bad. I am not sure this is better than the experience I have had on similar laptops, but this was certainly not worse off. The other test was with high resolution images. Again with mid range photos, the laptop had no issues. But when I got into the really heavy photos, it takes time to load. Once the initial loading was done there wasn’t any issue doing regular edits and flips of the images. With Full HD video, the laptop performed reasonably well. However, it could not play either 2K or 4K content. I tried different players, but to no avail. You may also like to watch this video Overall, the HP15-BA021AX is powered by the AMD Quad-Core A10-9600P APU and seems like a value for money laptop. But it should also be understood that at this price you are not expecting a device to be able to offer much in terms of high-end performance. If you need a regular laptop that has good processing power and are not very ambitious about what you expect from this device, then this seems like an option you can explore.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | March 5, 2017 -- 17:24 GMT (09:24 PST) | Topic: Mobility Litebook's $249 Linux laptop The market for Linux-equipped laptops continues to expand, whether crowd-funded or DIY or just replacing Windows on an existing notebook on your own. Another entrant has emerged that's more powerful than the Kickstarter-backed Pinebook but less expensive than the KDE Slimbook. what's hot on zdnet Why Raspberry Pi is the future of computing devices Eight obstacles to overcome in your digital transformation journey Ford to trial Stratasys system to use 3D printing of one-piece auto parts IBM, Maersk aim to speed up shipping with blockchain technology A company called Litebook has released a new Linux laptop that is priced to compete with Chromebooks -- if not as cheap as the $89 Pinebook. That's because the Pinebook is bare-boned when it comes to specs, using an ARM CPU, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of built-in storage. The Litebook, on the other hand, uses an Intel Celeron processor (the N3150), twice as much memory, and a 512GB hard drive. (An extra $20 gets you a 32GB SSD in addition to the hard drive to help speed up boot-ups.) It also includes a 14.1-inch display with 1,920x1,080 full HD resolution. It's similarly priced to the assembly-required Teres laptop, though it appears to be much better equipped. The Litebook ships with the Elementary OS flavor of Linux, though you can install an alternate that uses the Linux kernel 4.8. It also comes with WPS Office pre-installed. It comes in a choice of colors (black, red, or white) and provides a $20 discount if you want to order it without a drive installed. Liliputing has done some sleuthing on the Litebook and suggests that it looks like a rebadged older Chinese laptop. This might explain the lack of some of the latest components (no USB Type-C port, no 802.11ac Wi-Fi) as well as the company's confidence that the hardware can handle a Windows installation, if you so choose. Nonetheless, the system offers a 1-year warranty on it and says it does not install any bloatware on the Litebook. Some Linux laptops are priced like mid-tier Windows notebooks, such as the Dell XPS 13 (starting price: $949) or the new Slimbook (starting price: around $770), with specs to match. If you want a Chromebook equivalent, however, the Litebook appears to be a more appealing option.

INNOVATE If You Want To Know How Technology Will Affect Your Work, Look at These 3 Long-Term Trends We now need to hire, manage and train for new skills, such as empathy and social sensitivity By Greg Satell Greg Satell is a popular writer, speaker and innovation advisor. Previously, he served as Senior Vice President – Strategy & Innovation at Moxie Interactive, a division of Publicis Groupe, one of the world’s leading marketing services organizations as well as Co-CEO of KP Media, a leading publisher of magazines and websites in Ukraine, including the news magazine Korrespondent and the web portal, Bigmir. You can find Greg's blog at DigitalTonto.com. His first book, Mapping Innovation, will be published by McGraw-Hill in May. @Digitaltonto Author, Mapping Innovation@Digitaltonto WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Work used to be pretty simple. You got up in the morning, did your job and came home at the end of the day. Most people spent their whole career doing pretty much the same thing for the same employer. They were judged by their skill, diligence and seniority and, at the end of it all, they looked forward to a peaceful retirement. Today, those seem like quaint notions. Nobody spends an entire career doing the same job the same way anymore. In fact, a recent study at Oxford found that as many as almost half of the jobs in the US are at risk of being automated. A report by Deloitte also finds that technology is significantly changing how organizations function. These trends are often attributed solely to artificial intelligence and machine learning, but that misses a large part of the story. The truth is that the real shift has less to do with any particular branch of information technology and much more to do with how three digital forces are beginning to invade everything else. As it turns out, our digital future is all too human. 1. Acceleration In The Second Machine Age, MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee tell a story about the invention of chess. As legend has it, the emperor was so impressed with the game that he invited its creator to name his reward. The inventor's request seemed modest, he simply told the Emperor: 'All I desire is some rice to feed my family.' Since the emperor's largess was spurred by the invention of chess, the inventor suggested they use the chessboard to determine the amount of rice he would be given. 'Place one single grain of rice on the first square of the board, two on the second, four on the third, and so on,' the inventor proposed, 'so that each square receives twice as many grains as the previous.' For the first half of the chessboard, the emperor had to pay 2^32 grains of rice, or about the equivalent of one field, but as the doubling continued, the total amount owed far exceeded all the rice that existed in the world. That, in essence, is the concept of accelerating returns. When growth is exponential, even seemingly insignificant trends can become predominant. This phenomenon is commonly known as Moore's Law, the observation that Intel co-founder Gordon Moore made about the continuous doubling of transistors on a microchip, but it's grown far beyond that. Today, as digital technology pervades everything else, we can see similar trends in everything from solar panels to gene sequencing. 2. Democratization The decades after World War II saw a number of technological revolutions. During the 1950s and 60s, the discovery of the genetic code and nuclear energy, the rise of digital computing and humanity's first forays into space all became realities. These achievements, unimaginable to previous generations, created completely new realms of possibility. It was also an era of increasing scale. Companies mass produced products that were mass marketed toward mass audiences. Corporate strategy focused on wringing ever more efficiency out of the value chain, because lowering your cost basis meant that you could reinvest in assets that would create even more efficiency and unlock a virtuous cycle. Yet those days are over. Competitive advantage in a networked age is no longer the sum of all efficiencies, but the sum of all connections. To take just one example, consider the IBM 360 series of computers which dominated the 60s and 70s. It was vertically integrated and every piece of hardware and software had to come from IBM. Today, however, its Bluemix cloud computing platform is built on top of open source software and offers services from competitors. The reason why is that now even the resources of a massive organization like IBM aren't sufficient to compete anymore. So unless it can tap into the talents of thousands of developers across the world and make its technology accessible enough to allow others to build products on top of it, the company would fall behind its rivals. This trend is constantly reducing the technical knowledge you need to create with technology. Want to build a website? Platforms like Wix will have you up and running in minutes. Want to build a mobile app with artificial intelligence capabilities? Platforms like Mendix are so simple even those with no coding expertise can get in on the action. 3. Convergence The final force shaping technology today is convergence. A computer is no longer something in a room somewhere doing calculations for back office functions like payroll or inventory, or even a smaller machine that sits on a desk to help automate basic office work. Today, computing is more like electricity, an invisible force used to power other machines. Moreover, the ubiquity and abundance of computing is what's enabling the new technologies that are driving the 21st century, such as genomics, nanotechnology and robotics. These, in turn, are driving transformational change in scientific labs, factory floors and marketplaces. IBM's Angel Diaz observes that this convergence has had a profound effect on the computing industry. "To truly change the world today we need more than just clever code. We need computer scientists working with cancer scientists, with climate scientists and with experts in many other fields to tackle grand challenges and make large impacts on the world," he says. But the impact is even larger on other industries. As the bits of computer code pervade the atoms of our workplaces, we're increasingly living in an automated age and the nature of work is becoming less about performing tasks and more about using technology to collaborate with other people. Moving From Disruption To Collaboration Let's return to where we began. Work used to be fairly stable because technology was fairly stable. Products changed with the times, but mostly because of changing tastes and styles. Functionality evolved slowly, which allowed business to maintain their business models for decades and, in some cases, even longer. Yet today, business models no longer last. The twin forces of acceleration and democratization made it possible for a couple of guys in a garage somewhere to compete with the world's most powerful corporations. All of a sudden, the American dream morphed from getting a corner office in an executive suite to building a startup and achieving a billion dollar valuation. The future, however, belongs to the third trend, convergence. As digital technology seeps into every product, service and endeavor, no one organization has all the skills and knowledge it needs to compete and collaboration itself is becoming a competitive advantage. That, in turn, is changing the nature of work. To win in this new marketplace, you no longer need the best people, you need the best teams. Value is shifting from those who can perform tasks efficiently to those who can work well with others to design jobs for machines, which means that we now need to hire, manage and train for new skills, such as empathy and social sensitivity. As automation produces ever greater abundance, humanity itself is becoming the scarce, and therefore most valuable, resource.

"One of the focus points of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation is the U.S. government's response to actions taken by Russian intelligence agents during the presidential campaign," said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes in a statement Sunday. "As such, the committee will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party's campaign officials or surrogates, and we will continue to investigate this issue if the evidence warrants it." Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, an intelligence panel member, told Fox News host Chris Wallace the Senate would investigate too. "As part of our inquiry, we are going to review allegations of any kind of improper contacts between Russian officials and campaign officials or other American citizens, and I'm sure that we will be reviewing any allegations such as this," "I think all these matters will be part of our inquiry.

Cotton said he has "seen no evidence" of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during last year's election, despite intelligence reports alleging that activity. Cotton defended Trump's treatment of Russia, calling it harsher than his predecessor's based on foreign policies that have already implemented. Following Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusing himself from campaign- or election-related probes, Cotton still stood by a previous statement that his former colleague should have to step aside to allow someone else to oversee the investigation. Cotton added that he does not believe any additional investigation into Russia-Trump campaign contacts would be worthwhile because the Senate intelligence committee is looking into the matter. "We've made the decisions — or we've made the agreements with the intelligence community to review the documents," he said. "If you started over with a new commission or new committee, that could take months. I think it's in the best interest of the American people if we conduct our view as quickly as possible and make as much of our conclusions as public as possible."

Linux 4.11 Doesn't Change The Game For AMD's Ryzen Written by Michael Larabel in AMD on 5 March 2017 at 07:56 AM EST. 23 Comments Linux 4.11 is worthwhile in that it's bringing ALC1220 audio support, the codec used by many Ryzen (and Intel Kabylake) motherboards, but this next kernel version doesn't appear to change Ryzen's performance. I didn't see anything notable this Linux 4.11 merge window with regard to Ryzen for potentially affecting its performance, but I ran some benchmarks this weekend just to confirm. With the Ryzen 7 1700 configuration on the MSI X370 XPOWER GAMING TITANIUM configuration I ran some benchmarks between Linux 4.10 and then Linux 4.11 Git as of yesterday. There are potential gaming performance improvements to find on Linux 4.11, that's when using the AMDGPU DRM driver and in particular AMDGPU changes in 4.11 appear to mostly benefit the RADV Vulkan driver. In most OpenGL games, the performance is the same. Nothing really to see on the Ryzen performance side for Linux 4.11. Those that were hoping for any magical scheduler improvements or other refinements to Ryzen's Linux support will need to wait another couple months. 23 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Print Email Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com By Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on March 05, 2017 at 6:45 AM, updated March 06, 2017 at 10:47 AM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from being truthful while under oath.   President Donald Trump has recused himself from being a stable, sound-minded, responsible president and quelling suspicions about an improper relationship  between his campaign and Russia.   As a result, Sessions should recuse himself from being Attorney General and a 9/11-type independent commission needs to be appointed a.s.a.p. to fully investigate the Russian-Trump connection. Just three days after a Congressional address in which Trump pivoted to acting and sounding like a president, he pivoted back to being a reckless tweeting nit-wit. Early Saturday morning, Trump unleashed a twitter torrent, accusing Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower during the election, calling him "a bad (or sick)guy."  These are the tweets Trump unleashed from sunny Mar-a-Lago, Florida: "Terrible! just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory.  Nothing found.  This is McCarthyism!" "Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an  election?  Turned down by court earlier.  A NEW LOW!" "I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!" How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process.  This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!" Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 Obama's spokesman released the following statement Saturday afternoon refuting Trump's claims:   "A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice.  As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen.  Any suggestion otherwise is simply false." Trump offered no proof for his serious allegations against the former president. The key words in Trump's tweet storm are -"just found out."    Where did Trump find out about the alleged wiretaps?    It's speculated the source of Trump's allegations are  comments made Thursday by conservative talk radio host  Mark Levin and a story on Breitbart, Friday.  Trump's tweets echo an argument made by Levin and Breitbart that Obama used "police state" tactics in an attempt to sabotage the Trump campaign.   The Breitbart story was said to be circulating in the White House, where it's former CEO, Steve Bannon appears to be the de facto president. The Department of Justice and U.S. Intel agencies have been reported to be conducting an ongoing investigation into connections between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russian operatives.   Three Trump associates that have been named are his former campaign boss Paul Manafort, and former advisers Roger Stone and Carter Page.  It's believed the agencies conducting the investigation have obtained a FISA warrant. Trump tweets mean one of three scenarios could be true, all are bad. 1) President Obama broke the law and ordered wiretaps on Trump. 2) Investigators obtained a FISA warrant to wiretap Trump after showing significant evidence that illegal activity likely occurred. 3) Trump smeared a former president based on nothing more than claims made by dubious far-right media sources. Trump may not fully grasp the seriousness of what he just tweeted.  He may have intended to only vent, or distract, but he may have actually just declassified and confirmed that he and is associates have had  FISA warrants issued against them. Trump furious over Sessions' recusal. The Washington Post reported that Trump left for Florida Friday after fuming at a senior staff  about Sessions' decision to recuse himself. "Trump was angry and told his top aides that he disagreed with the attorney general's decision."   Trump felt his staff  should have done more in Sessions' defense. So, Trump isn't upset that the nation's top lawman gave misleading answers, or perjured himself, under oath, he's ticked off with his staff? Sessions is claiming he didn't think his meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were relevant to Sen. Al Franken's question.  He also claimed he met with Sergey as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In the confirmation hearing, Franken brought up that Trump had been warned by the FBI and intel agencies about the dossier alleging he had been compromised.  Franken cited the news reports of the Trump campaign being in constant contact with Russian operatives.   Franken asked Sessions what he would do if those reports were true. Sessions replied, "I'm not aware of any of those activities,  I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians." The question was what would Sessions do? Instead he gave a defensive answer that someone who's guilty would give. Sessions met Kislyak in July, at the Republican convention, and again in September.   At the time of the meetings, U.S. Intel agencies had determined Russia was responsible for hacking the DNC and Clinton campaign.   The Trump campaign was already being viewed suspiciously over Trump's fawning praise of Putin.  Sessions was far more than just a surrogate. At the time he was Trump's top national security and foreign policy adviser, working with  Michael Flynn. The Washington Post checked to see if any other members of the Armed Services committee met with Kislyak.  Twenty of the twenty-six members responded.  None met with Kislyak that year, including Chairman John McCain.  A Committee staffer told the post, "Members of the committee have not been beating a path to Kislyak's door.   There haven't been a ton of members who are looking to meet with Kislyak for their committee duties." Sessions also wrote that he never met with Russians in a confirmation hearing questionnaire from Senator Patrick Leahy.  Sessions doesn't pass the smell test as the nation's leading lawman.  What's being smelled and seen is ever-increasing smoke billowing from the Trump administration when the topic turns to Russia.   Congress needs to appoint an independent commission to find the truth once and for all, and if necessary, a special counsel. If Trump tweets were intended as a diversion, or fed by anger over the Russian story not going away, all he did is turn up the heat on it.

Cautionary Statement This press release contains forward-looking statements concerning Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (“AMD” or the “Company”) including the features, functionality, availability, timing, expected benefits of AMD future products including AMD’s Ryzen processors, which are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by words such as ”would,” “intends,” “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this press release are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this press release and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD’s ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) with obligations to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, from GF with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMD’s manufacturing requirements, its business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD’s business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD’s products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMD’s business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; AMD’s receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMD’s business and operating results; the markets in which AMD’s products are sold are highly competitive; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD’s notes and the secured revolving line of credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect its ability to operate its business; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD’s products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD’s products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for AMD’s products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMD’s ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporation’s support for its products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on AMD’s products, its ability to sell its products could be materially adversely affected; and AMD’s reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects it to certain risks. Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in AMD’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to AMD’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Rasgon lowered his target price for the company's stock from $36 to $30 and downgraded the stock from "Market-Perform" to "Underperform." This means he expects the stock to trail the performance of the SP 500.

By Gary Jones / Published 5th March 2017 GOOGLE The Google Pixel 2 will be released in 2017, facing the Samsung Galaxy S8 The Google Pixel 2 is currently being worked on as the next Google Phone to launch in 2017. That’s according to the company’s SVP of hardware, Rick Osterloh, who revealed the big news during a press event at Mobile World Congress earlier this week. The company is set to reveal the Google Pixel 2 later this year and will remain a “premium” device. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it,” Osterloh commented. “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” Rumours of the Google Pixel 2 first emerged earlier this year, with the device expected to feature a number of hardware improvements on the first-generation device. Samsung Galaxy S8 - Leaked photos and concept images REVEALED Tuesday, 17th January 2017 SAMSUNG'S Galaxy S8 looks set to be unveiled in April and here's how it could look. 1 / 15 PH Samsung Galaxy S8 in pictures This will include a more powerful processor, as well as more memory and storage. It’s rumored that Google is carrying out several tests at the moment with different processors, including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and specialised Intel hardware. Despite the latest update, Google is set to feature renewed smartphone competition in the coming weeks, with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 both set to launch in the not too distant future. The Samsung Galaxy S8 release date is still weeks away, but now a major new leak has revealed everything you could want to know about the new phone. Having already been the subject of multiple leaks and countless rumours, the entire Galaxy S8 specs sheet has now emerged online. Revealing all the inner workings of the upcoming iPhone rival, the leaked specs sheets has confirmed the eagerly awaited handset is going to be something truly special. Related Articles Major Samsung Galaxy S8 leak reveals phone's entire specs sheet and it's amazing Google Chrome Warning - This serious scam could put your online activity at risk BlackBerry KEYone launched - Iconic smartphone maker is back with shock iPhone 7 rival Surfaced via tech blog TechnoBuffalo, the comprehensive Galaxy S8 leak also shows how similar the phone will be to the Galaxy S8+, with the larger phone having seen its full features list emerge earlier this week. Kicking things off with the screen, the S8 looks set to be a visual delight with a 5.8-inch QHD panel set to boast a stunning 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. This panel will curve around both the phone's left and right hand edges and will be squeezed in to a phone with near identical dimensions to last year's 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 thanks to a new edge-to-edge design made possible by killing off the physical home button on the phone's lower front edge. Elsewhere the phone, which like its predecessor will be water and dust resistant, will play host to a 12MP dual pixel primary camera and a new 8-megapixel selfie shooter that'll be enhanced by its own integrated flash. That's not all the front camera will be capable of, either. Partnered with a new iris scanner, the phone will be capable of being unlocked just by looking at it, with the camera helping read the unique pattern within your eye.

Abu Sayyaf extremists in the Philippines have released a video of the beheading of Kantner.

(SITE Intel Group via AP) Updated: 12:54 a.m., March 5, 2017 ZAMBOANGA CITY – Government security forces on Saturday had recovered the remains of beheaded German hostage Jurgen Kantner in Indanan, Sulu. Col. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of the Joint Task Force Sulu, said soldiers were conducting search and retrieval operation when they found Kantner’s body and severed head in Sitio Talibang in Barangay Buanza around 5:45 p.m. ADVERTISEMENT Professor Octavio Dinampo, who was once also kidnapped, said Kantner’s remains were recovered “between the vicinity of the camps of two leaders of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).” He said the two camps belonged to Nur Misuari in Sitio Bacud in Kagay village and that of Lupa Sug State Revolutionary Command chair Khaid Adjibon in Sitio Talibang. The distance between the MNLF camps is about half a kilometer. Sobejana said Kantner’s remains would be kept at the morgue of the Kuta Heneral Teodulo Bautista Hospital Morgue while documentary requirements were being completed before to transport to Manila. Kantner’s remains will then be sent home to Germany, he said. Meanwhile, Sobejana said members of the Scene of the Crime Operatives (SOCO) in Sulu were requested to conduct site preservation for evidence gathering and post mortem procedures. Kanter was abducted by members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) from his yacht, the Rockall, in waters off the southern Philippines last year. The vessel was found drifting last Nov. 7, with the body of Kantner’s female companion, Sabine Merz, inside. The couple had previously been kidnapped and held for 52 days in Somalia in 2008. The Armed Forces of the Philippines said that the ASG, tagged as a terrorist organization by the Philippines and the US, still has 31 hostages – 12 Vietnamese, seven Indonesians, six Filipinos, five Malaysians, and one Dutch.  /atm RELATED STORIES Abus show beheading of German German hostage last words: ‘Now he kill me’ German hostage beheaded by Abu Sayyaf – SITE Intel group play_circle_filled Duterte to CA: Allow Gina Lopez to present her mining stance March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Nationwide smoking ban to include indoor cigarette use, says Palace March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Palace: There was a 'certain attempt' to influence Duterte financially March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Palace: 'Madam Secretary' show should’ve used fictional US President instead March 07, 2017 TAGS: Abu Sayya hostage, Jurgen Kantner For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.

For trans people in tech, it’s complicated when the industry suddenly cares Posted Mar 4, 2017 by Taylor Hatmaker (@tayhatmaker) 0 SHARES Next Story Crunch Report | NBCUniversal Invests $500 Million in Snap When Yelp added a way for its trans and gender non-conforming users to find safe restrooms, it felt like a mixed blessing for a community that’s used to being ignored. Over time, Yelp’s feature will provide a robust database of public bathrooms — the kind the transgender community has been building for itself for years. While just about everyone can agree that having restroom info right on Yelp’s massive legacy local business platform is a good thing, it does bring some tensions to the surface for the transgender tech community. From North Carolina’s HB2 to the upcoming Gavin Grimm case, the issue of transgender rights does appear to be reaching a tipping point in the tech community. The big question: What took so long? In an atmosphere of intense political polarization around the issue, figuring out a low-stress restroom contingency plan in public places can be a total nightmare for trans people. Naturally, most people outside of the trans community have no idea how much fear and stress can go into something as simple as meeting a friend for a beer or two after work. Now, that conversation — and the larger accompanying question of equal access — comes up on the national stage in the way that marriage equality did a few years prior. Yelp makes a statement For a company like Yelp, building bathroom data into a platform that already tracks things like Wi-Fi, bike parking and kid-friendliness wasn’t that difficult. Still, it did require dedicated resources, pulling as many as a dozen people off of their existing tasks, ratcheting up the priority level and getting it done. Last week, news of the upcoming Supreme Court case of transgender student Gavin Grimm set Yelp’s wheels in motion. It set out to demonstrate its commitment to transgender rights beyond just signing onto tech’s “friend of the court” brief with 53 other companies. Yelp’s new restroom tool announcement was originally timed for the same day as the brief, but after the brief was released a day early, the restroom feature news stood alone a bit more than intended. “Given the attention this issue is receiving on a legislative level, the choice to build this resource into the fabric of our platform really does — and has — opened up Yelp to a lot of criticism from those on the other side of the transgender rights issue,” a Yelp spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We made a lot of conscious choices along the way that others would view as incredibly risky, and they may well be, but from our perspective, accepting those risks to get this done actually defines how genuine this effort is.” Trans rights in tech’s rocky landscape Talking to trans people who’ve waited for this day to come, it’s clear that casting aside skepticism can be a challenge. For Teagan, a software developer who founded Refuge Restrooms, a crowdsourced database of safe bathroom info, it mostly boils down to one question. “How committed are they actually to this stuff?” She cites a litany of diversity and inclusion controversies in tech as the foundation for that cynicism, including Github’s Julie Ann Horvath and Yelp’s own Talia Jane. “I mean honestly… I want the information to exist. I’m glad they are doing it. I don’t think it was done to specifically target Refuge [Restrooms]. But yeah, they feel like a mainstream tech corp took a feature worked on by and for trans folks. A feature and app that was made specifically because Yelp & Foursquare didn’t have anything like this.” Teagan described how members of the Refuge team were caught off guard by the wave of mainstream publicity around Yelp’s news. As a trans person in tech, seeing major companies take up the banner of transgender rights can feel bittersweet if not downright disorienting. As Teagan observes, “Yelp had a PokeStop filter before they had a gender neutral bathroom filter. So you know?” One former Intel software engineer who spoke with TechCrunch is heartened by trans issues coming to the fore in tech, but he has plenty of reservations. As a trans guy, he stays in the loop about the experience of other transgender employees at Intel, where things are still hit or miss. “A [trans woman] that came out while on the job has been gushing about how great her experience is, meanwhile a trans friend of mine who was stealth at Intel is afraid to come out because of his transphobic team members.” For long-time industry workers like him, tech’s sudden interest seems a bit out of left field. “The amicus brief feels like ‘huh?’ to me… Like, I didn’t know these companies cared? Which does make me wonder. It’s easy to sign onto a thing, less easy to do things like provide training to teams to help gender transition, provide insurance that covers trans healthcare and allowing trans folks to take leave to deal with surgery.” Show them the money In talking to advocates for the transgender community, one piece of advice comes up again and again: Pay trans people. “Partner with them, or support them financially, or work out a licensing deal,” suggests Brook Shelley, Senior Developer Relations Engineer at Turbine Labs and co-chair for Basic Rights Oregon. “Marginalized folks are doing this work, and they need the financial and personal support that a company can bring, because ‘thanks!’ doesn’t pay the rent.” At the very least, for companies willing to listen, growing pains around how to best serve the trans community will make for a rich learning opportunity. For its part, Yelp seemed to be open to hearing criticism around implementing the trans-friendly feature. The company consulted with its LGBTQ group OUTburst — “The gravity that centers [Yelp’s] efforts and priorities on any LGBTQ-related initiative” — and transgender engineers and other trans team members during the process, as well as coordinating with the Human Rights Campaign for how to contextualize the new feature. Reaching the inflection point In response to the Yelp news, Kristin Russo, the co-founder of OUR Restroom, looks forward to leveraging the platform’s new feature to put the heat on business owners who don’t see her mission to “[help] businesses understand the importance of unisex single-stall restrooms” as a priority. “A company like Yelp holds a giant sway for so many businesses,” Russo explained to TechCrunch. “I think it will help us enormously to be able to say things like ‘Hey, we do this work and can help you change your signs, and did you also know that gender neutral restrooms is now a search filter on Yelp?'” As a cisgender ally who works on many LGBTQ projects, Russo doesn’t believe that it’s too little too late, but she understands why many trans people are frustrated with the pace of progress. “Would it have been great to have more companies fighting for this years ago? Sure. However I think that it does often take a certain kind of critical mass to get these kinds of decisions on the desks of the people who make big changes in the ways their business operates, so I’m just happy that we are reaching that place.” If mainstream support will actually move the needle remains to be seen, but with 2017 shaping up to be a landmark year for trans rights, tech companies wishing to champion them will have plenty of chances.

Terry McConnell More from Terry McConnell Published on: March 4, 2017 | Last Updated: March 4, 2017 6:00 AM MST Demonstrators, including Michaela Danek, center, and Carmen Gonzalez, right, shout slogans during a protest against President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on immigration Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017, in San Francisco. Immigrants around the country have been staying home from work and school today, hoping to demonstrate their importance to America's economy and its way of life. Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP Share Adjust Comment Print A lot of Californians are mad as hell. Some even say they’re not going to take it anymore. “It” is the result of November’s presidential election. What these Californians are doing is organizing a secessionist movement — as in, taking California out of the United States. Their movement is called Calexit, as in Brexit. Their inspiration is the growing gulf that separates them — politically, culturally, demographically — from the rest of the union. Hillary Clinton outpolled Donald Trump by a two-to-one margin here. “Without California, Trump would have won the popular vote,” tweeted conservative pundit and Trump critic David Frum. The Golden State has a population of 39 million people, more than any other state in the union, and more people than in all of Canada. Metro Los Angeles alone is home to close to 19 million, a total greater than Ontario and Alberta combined. As Frum points out, those are numbers that come with economic clout, and therein lies the rub for many Californians. The U.S. without California, he writes, would be the world’s second-ranked technology power instead of the first. California boasts the world’s sixth largest economy, greater than France, Italy, South Korea and India. It’s also a global technological giant, home to Silicon Valley and companies like Google, Apple, Cisco, Intel, Oracle, and SpaceX. California is also culturally distinct from much of the rest of the U.S. It’s synonymous with liberal causes, from environmental protection to gun control to health care, and that has other Americans judging Californians, and not in a flattering way. It’s a reality not lost on Marcus Ruiz Evans, one of the movers and shakers behind Calexit. “California,” he admitted to the Washington Post, “(is) seen as weird.” That weirdness extends to politics beyond the presidential variety. Governor Jerry Brown has vowed to ensure Californians have health insurance coverage, offered through the state-run health exchange called Covered California, even if Trump Republicans repeal ObamaCare. But where the state most hears a different drummer is on immigration. Californians are decidedly in favour of it, and it’s easy to see why. California has the largest immigrant population in the union, approximately 10 million in total, a quarter of those undocumented. If you’re not an immigrant in California, you know one. Or two. Or more. In response to Trump’s ambitions to engage in large-scale deportation of illegal immigrants, the state legislature is considering a bill that would declare the state a “sanctuary.” Lawmakers have even hired former Obama attorney general Eric Holder to battle the Trump administration on the issue. That step earned the enmity of the new president. “Trump claims California is ‘out of control,’ ” writes columnist George Skelton in the Los Angeles Times, though the irony is undoubtedly lost on the president. Trump has threatened to cut off federal funds to California. “We’ll defund,” Trump told Fox News. “We give tremendous amounts of money to California.” The problem is that, like residents of Canada’s “have” provinces, Californians contribute more money to the federal treasury than what comes back. There has been much grousing about the Trump administration ever since the threats were levelled, fertile ground for Calexit. The secessionists even have the support of Silicon Valley billionaires Peter Thiel and Shervin Pishevar. Companies like Google have expressed concern about their ability in an anti-immigrant climate to recruit foreigners for jobs not enough Americans are qualified to fill. In January, the group Yes California was given permission to circulate a petition with the intention of putting the sovereignty question on the 2018 ballot. If the petition is successful — close to 600,000 signatures are required — a special vote to decide the state’s future would follow in 2019.  Calexit does have its skeptics. “Canadians know you don’t escape the shadow of your giant neighbour by drawing a border,” wrote Prof. Timothy William Waters in the Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he believes secession is a bad idea. Such opinions are far from universal. According to a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll taken in California, one-third of respondents support “peaceful withdrawal from the union.” As one tweeter wrote: “We’ll just take our avocados and legal weed and go.” Terry McConnell is a former Journal columnist, editorial writer and copy editor now living in California Saturday's letters: Protect species at risk Dan Barnes: Tone set, statements made, points milked as Oilers kick...

Hammond Jim Miles Paul Craig Roberts David Swanson Select Page Economic Impact of Trump Immigration Policies on Chinese By Antonio Graceffo | Mar 3, 2017 | News & Analysis, Politics, US | 1 | Donald Trump speaking at CPAC 2011 in Washington, D.C. (Gage Skidmore/CC BY-SA 2.0) Three groups of Chinese are facing very different forms of US immigration and possible changes under the new administration. One of Trump’s main campaign promises was to radically restrict immigration. At the time many pundits and commentators dismissed this as campaign rhetoric. However, it seems that this is one promise that Trump intends to make good on. The Trump administration has already attempted to ban immigration from seven Muslim countries, and DW has now reported that he has targeted over 11 million undocumented immigrants for forced deportation. The H1B visa for highly skilled workers may be overhauled or even abolished. According to Max Bearak of the Washington Post, Trump feels that the programs brings cheap labor and is open to “widespread abuse”. The H1B visas are widely used by the IT, engineering, and other high tech industries in order to attract foreign talent to work in US firms. Paige Tanner of The Market Realist reported that US companies such as Apple, Google, and Intel (INTC) would be hardest hit, as between 17% and 38% of the work force at American technology firms is Asian. Chinese graduates hoping to go to the US under this program may no longer be able to. Additionally, economists believe that losing all of those skilled workers will have a negative impact on the US and take away the US competitive edge in the technology sector. While ending the H1B visa may have some impact on the economy, the Chinese English language news outlet Juwai reports that the visa with the most direct impact is the EB-5 investment visa, which is favored by the Chinese. Juwai explains that under this program foreigners investing $1 million or as little as $500,000 in an economically depressed area and creating 10 or more full-time jobs can remain in the US with a Green Card. This visa has been a major source of funding for various construction projects, such as Brooklyn’s Atlantic Yards, as well a small North Dakota factory that makes biodegradable food containers. According to The Guardian reporters Sam Thielman and Mona Chalabi, Trump’s new tower in Jersey City known as Trump Bay street, as well as a project led by President Trump’s son-in-law have received considerable financing through the program. They estimate that approximately $50 million of the Bay Street funding has come from ChineseEB-5 visa holders. Forbes Magazine estimated that the EB-5 visa has been responsible for $8.7 billion worth of investment in the US since 2012. Forbes Magazine reports that over 90% of Eb-5 applicants are Chinese. The real estate news source The Real Deal implied that demand for the visa usually goes up when the Chinese economy turns south, as investors are keen to get their money out of China and into dollars. According to CNN Money, the program is so popular among Chinese that in the government actually ran out of EB-5 visas in 2014. This surge in demand came in spite of increased regulations regarding financial disclosure. With Trump’s tightening of immigration laws, many investors are wary about investing in the US until they know whether the EB-5 will remain in place. As buying property is one of the quickest and easiest ways to invest a million dollars in the US, restrictions on the EB-5 visa could negatively impact the US real-estate market. Forbes Magazine’s Kenneth Rapoza reported that Trump opponents speculate that while the president may order mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and crackdown on the H1B visas, he will not restrict the EB-5 visa because the program provides much needed investment capital, which helps the US economy. Forbes journalist Ellen Sheng reported that the EB-5 program may soon be altered. In early January, the Department of Homeland Security suggested increasing the investment minimum to $1.35 million. The program will be up for renewal on April 28, 2017, and as of now, it remains unclear if the investment limits will be increased or if the program will be renewed at all. While debate rages in the US about illegal aliens, foreign H1visa experts and Chinese EB-5 investor visas, the US edition of the China Daily reports that one of the fastest growing Chinese demographics in the US is Chinese pensioners. The Chinese government has even made it easier for these people to collect their Chinese pensions while living abroad. Adam Hartung of Forbes Magazine felt that not enough attention was being paid to this group who will add to an already ageing US population and potentially become a burden on the US social system. Hartung stated that under customary visa conditions, people lacking the ability to work would not be admitted into the country and that accepting this many elderly could be a disaster economically. In short, three groups of Chinese are facing very different forms of US immigration and possible changes under the new administration. Chinese foreign experts in the IT industry are afraid of losing their visa privileges. In contrast, EB-5 visa holders are probably protected by Donald Trump because of his own personal interest in the real-estate industry, and the US receiving investment dollars in general, but the privilege of coming to the US may wind up increasing in price dramatically. The final group, Chinese pensioners are quietly increasing in number and could become a further drain on US social security which is already threatened by America’s own ageing crisis.

(Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) 1039 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 209 COMMENTEMAILMORE MOSCOW — Russian politicians enamored with President Trump's talk of improved relations with Moscow last fall are already disillusioned that he's reversed course because of investigations into Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said he was surprised Trump started “receding” from his earlier pro-Russian rhetoric about closer cooperation. “Even in the way he talks you can now hear notes of Obama,” he said. “And you can hear in his address (to Congress Tuesday): the military budget will be increased by over $50 billion.” “We have to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst,” Sergei Mironov, head of the Just Russia party told a parliamentary round table on foreign policy this week.  “The sooner Trump understands that world history is governed by laws and not business schemes, that there are values that are not measured in dollars, the better for Russian-American relations.” Their disappointment follows a tougher line on Russia from Trump’s White House. Last month, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump expected Russia to return Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014. That is at odds with comments Trump made during the campaign, when he suggested Russia should keep Crimea and that U.S. sanctions imposed after its seizure be lifted. The Kremlin rejected any intention of returning Crimea. Shortly after, state-run media suddenly stopped its pro-Trump coverage. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share According to Bloomberg, the media in Russia are covering President Trump too much. Veuer's Nick Cardona (@nickcardona93) has the story. Buzz60 In the United States, anti-Russian sentiment has been growing in Congress over intelligence allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered cyberattacks aimed at helping elect Trump, charges both the Kremlin and Trump deny. Still, the FBI is investigating contacts between Russians and Trump officials before and after the election, and the scandal already has forced Trump to fire his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. The allegations prompted Trump to acknowledge at a news conference last month that he probably can't do business with Russia now because of the political climate. Some Russians are skeptical of a Kremlin plot to elect Trump. "Whatever silly thing the president does raises the possibility of a Russia connection," said Alina Lobzina, a freelance news producer, who urged Americans to stop blaming Russia. "Seriously, from across the ocean it looks like a House of Cards episode, and not the best one." Breaking with his earlier praise of Russia and Putin, Trump did not mention either in Tuesday night's speech to Congress. “There was an atmosphere of positive expectations” in the Kremlin, said Konstantin von Eggert, a political commentator with Russia’s independent Dozhd TV station. Now the relationship between the two countries is "toxic," he said. "The Kremlin is realizing that maybe the best outcome would be to maintain the current level of tensions between Russia and America rather than having something worse,” he said.

Sessions said the meetings were innocuous and the election never came up. Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday that he agreed with Trump that the examination of innocent contacts with Russia amounted to a “witch hunt.” Peskov said on Wednesday that he saw nothing wrong with Trump’s failure to mention Russia in his hour-long address to Congress. “We have patience. We will wait until Trump’s statements are backed up by some action that will allow us to understand what we can expect in terms of bilateral Russian-American relations,” he said. Alexei Makarkin, deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, said Russian officials' expectations about Trump are becoming more realistic. “There was a sense in the beginning that Trump is our kind of guy, that he will come in and solve everything," he said. "But these sentiments did not take into account the nature of the American political system and the character of the new president, who really does not intend to be Russia’s ally." "Everything will depend on whether they are able to reach an agreement on specific issues, like Ukraine or Syria."

By Charlie Osborne for Between the Lines | February 27, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (06:00 PST) | Topic: Open Source Stock photo Open-source projects underpin many of today's popular apps, software packages, and online services. what's hot on zdnet Why Raspberry Pi is the future of computing devices Eight obstacles to overcome in your digital transformation journey Ford to trial Stratasys system to use 3D printing of one-piece auto parts IBM, Maersk aim to speed up shipping with blockchain technology If a vendor releases code to the open-source community, license restrictions are removed and software can be integrated into other systems. From Google's end-to-end encryption system E2EMail to the Netflix cross-scripting site vulnerability scanner Sleepy Puppy, open-source development is thriving and thousands of developers contribute their time to improving coding and ferreting out bugs every month. There are ongoing open-source projects which have been built upon for years, but as the technology space evolves and moves into new areas. According to open-source software management provider Black Duck Software's ninth annual Open Source Rookies of the Year report, in 2016, the best, new open-source projects to be found online in the past year relate to the blockchain, database data analysis, deep learning, network agility, container clutter removal, network security, and ed tech. The 2016 Black Duck Open Source Rookies of the Year are below: 1. Sawtooth Lake | Blockchain: Intel's new distributed ledger platform for the Hyperledger blockchain, which was developed to boost the scalability and security of existing blockchain technologies. 2. CarbonData | Big Data: A fresh approach to data organization, multi-level indexing, and optimization for more-efficient use of computer resources. 3. Deep Scalable Sparse Tensor Network Engine: DSSTNE ("Destiny") | Deep learning: Destiny focuses on neural network development for data sparseness and scalability, as well as the optimized use of multiple GPUs. 4. OpenCORD | Software-defined networking: An end-to-end solution which combines SDN, NFV, and cloud with commodity infrastructure to bring datacenter-grade scale and agility to vendors. 5. Poseidon, Trireme | Network security: The Poseidon project provides situational awareness to items being added or removed from networks, as well as the traffic being generated, while Trireme allows the creation of security policies through end-to-end authentication and authorization. 6. Ansible Container | Containers: The result of the Ansible development team's desire for an alternative to Docker files, Ansible Container works to automate the container build, deployment, and management process using nothing but Ansible Playbooks. 7. Kolibri | Edtech: Kolibri seeks to make learning resources available to students and teachers in areas with limited education resources.

He is best-known for taking computer firm Compaq Asia Pacific from a US$30 million dollar company to US$1 billion. He did this as Vice President and Managing Director in seven years, between 1989 and 1996, three years ahead of schedule. Over the years, besides being a CEO, technopreneur and private investor across industries like IT, air transport and education, he has been active in public and community service in organisations like the National Family Council, and the Halogen Foundation, which mentors young leaders and entrepreneurs. Lim is currently the Founder and Managing Director of PLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd, a boutique corporate advisory firm, and has made it his mission to turn other businesses around through restructuring, acceleration, mentorship, and technology incubation. He went On the Record with Bharati Jagdish about what he thinks is wrong with the macro-economy, what is needed to help SMEs in Singapore and how he pulled off his first big success.   Lim Soon Hock: Ekhard Pfieffer, the then-President and CEO of Compaq was a great influence. He taught me a very valuable principle - that if you believe something is impossible, you will never get it done; but if you believe something is possible, the impossible becomes possible. After I signed on to the Compaq job, I have to confess, I had a lot of trepidation because Compaq at that time was one of the most expensive PCs and I had to sell it in one of the world's most difficult markets - Asia. Asia was price-sensitive and had low purchasing power then. He gave me this challenge saying: “Lim Soon Hock, I have only one goal for you. In 10 years' time, that is, in 1999, this has to be a billion USD company.” I said I would try. I signed the employment contract in spite of the fear I had. But he was proven right, that even if you have supposedly insurmountable odds in the market, if you are willing to be creative, innovative, establish new rules in the playing field, you can succeed. That is exactly what I did.   Bharati: What do you think was the key to making that happen?   Lim: I cannot claim all the credit. I had a fantastic team. It was an A-team. I didn’t expect to transplant everything that worked in the US or in Europe into Asia. You’ve got to find your own strategies and you’ve got to find your own tactics to develop and grow the business. At the time I was recruited, China was already starting to open up. Every company in the US was looking at China because it had huge potential. I struggled developing the business. Struggled. Out of the whole Asia Pacific region, this was the market I had most difficulty in developing the numbers.   China was only just opening up. They were poor. Compaq machines were the most expensive. Where to find the money? No clients wanted to buy. I was struggling, but I was able to seize what I called the opportunity of the moment. The day before my trip to Beijing, there was a big article in the local newspaper about the political leadership. I realised that something like 80 per cent of the political leadership was actually from Tsinghua University.   The day after that I was driving past Tsinghua University, and I got an idea. I asked my colleague in China to arrange a meeting for me to meet the president of the university because I wanted to understand what they were doing in terms of promoting PC technology, and encouraging PC adoption. He managed to arrange a meeting and I saw him the following day. I had lunch with him and took a tour around the campus. We passed by a few empty rooms in the building. The lights were switched off and they were run-down. So I spoke to him in the office, seizing the opportunity. I proposed a training centre be set up, a joint venture between Compaq and Tsinghua University. I would provide all the equipment. I would provide all the training to three professors. I would bring in Microsoft. I would bring in Intel. I didn't even clear with my boss that I was going to set up a joint venture, but it was the moment and I didn't want to miss it. I wanted to seize it.   The university president was so delighted. For him, it was great political credit to be able to go into something jointly with a very successful US company. The rest was history. We started the training centre and the whole of China covered the event. It was front-page news. My sales in the next six months went through the roof.   Bharati: How did people who couldn’t afford a PC before manage to buy one after this development?   Lim: They bought our machine. They bought our PC, but not so much because they wanted our machine. They wanted a PC, but because of the university partnership, they now had a larger purpose in buying our machines. By using and buying our machine, they would have the opportunity to be trained by the very prestigious Tsinghua University, to get a certificate, a joint certificate: Tsinghua-Compaq. The certificate was the incentive. That was the incentive, the value, the asset they were trying to purchase. At the same time, they got a good machine and possibly a good job after that. So they worked harder to afford it.   RELYING ON FOREIGN INVESTORS   Bharati: You’ve worked for several MNCs. What has your experience taught you about what’s wrong with the Singapore economy and local businesses and how these problems can be addressed better?   Lim: I think if you look at the success of our model today, the success is very much driven by foreign MNC investment. It is also driven by the fact that we have succeeded in promoting wealth management, financial management in Singapore, the services industry, telecoms, airports, ports, and of course the government-linked companies have a role to play. I think those we should continue to promote, those we should continue to keep, and grow.   But where I think we could have done better, is developing entrepreneurship in Singapore and also developing and growing our SMEs. We should have spent more time to grow more of the promising SMEs to be more successful. If you look at many economies, whether Taiwan, Korea, or the US, the entire economy is driven by a critical mass of large companies. We could have done this earlier. But it’s not too late. We do more now.   Bharati: The government has been doing it though. There are entrepreneurship schemes, schemes designed for SMEs in particular. What more would you like to see?   Lim: Yes, I acknowledge that there have been many initiatives. But at the core of it, we need to develop and build a more vibrant and sustainable culture of entrepreneurship, not just schemes; and people shouldn’t be too dependent on these schemes or handouts. We need to start with the schools. We need to get more of our young people exposed to entrepreneurship, and beyond entrepreneurship, a larger objective of developing an entrepreneurial mindset. And I think that's important.   We can intensify our efforts, we can strengthen it, we can solidify it, we can deepen it. Help people develop the ability and willingness to take risks, the ability to see the opportunities out there, the ability to set new rules, to play in blue oceans, create blue oceans where you can succeed and the aggressiveness to not want to succeed just in Singapore, but also globally.   Bharati: How exactly do you think this mindset and attitude can be cultivated?   Lim: Some schools are offering entrepreneurship education. Based on what I understand from the ministry, they basically left it to the schools to decide whether they want to embark on it. My view is that if we truly believe that entrepreneurship is going to be a very important pillar of our future economy, then I think we should introduce entrepreneur education nationwide. We should also make sure that entrepreneur education is not just an enrichment program, a 2-3 day kind of thing. It has to be a structured programme where students are put through the entire process, the entire journey, the entire cycle of developing a business. My view is that at the end of the day, Singapore has to depend on its own entrepreneurs and businessmen.   Bharati: Not foreign investors.   Lim: My biggest worry is that our fear of foreign investment hollowing out of Singapore is going to happen. I am hoping it won't. I hope I am wrong. Not that Singapore is politically unstable, not that Singapore is not economically attractive in terms of the right environment, incentives, economic support, talent pool etc., but I think China will be so big, so developed, so mature that foreign companies would have to be in China to compete with the Chinese to succeed worldwide.   I know the thinking of MNCs. They have to be in markets where there are going to make a big difference. I think soon there are going to be so many big Chinese companies that are global in orientation, global in terms of reach, doing their own business; but I think you are going to see a lot of foreign companies here moving to China. I think we’ve got to be aware of that, because if that happens who are we going to depend on?   We are going to depend on our own local companies to provide the jobs, to generate GDP. We have no choice.   I hope I am wrong, I just worry about it. Hopefully we can have more SMEs become bigger local companies to create more jobs. What we need as a country Is a critical mass of large local companies, not just large local banks, not just the large GLCs, but we want more clones of companies like Hyflux, OSIM, and previously Creative. You can count the number of companies. They are not enough.   Don't get me wrong. I am not saying the government is not doing enough. The government is doing a lot, but what I am trying to say is that we need to do something revolutionary, not evolutionary.  I feel the revolutionary way is to introduce entrepreneur education in schools for everyone. Not from Primary 1, but the moment they get into secondary school. Maybe Secondary 3 onwards and again, not just entrepreneurial skills, but the entrepreneurial mindset.   CULTIVATING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET   Bharati: This mindset, you mentioned earlier, comprises the ability and willingness to take risks, the ability to see opportunities, the ability to set new rules. How do you really teach such things? People need to be exposed to such things from a young age and not just in school but in every aspect of their lives, don’t they?    Lim: Yes, to also know that it's not about all success, you must also have strength and resilience to take failure. When I try to market this idea to government, I tell them that it should be a non-examinable subject. No exam. Why would you want to have exams?   In real life, when you set up a business, you can either fail or you can succeed, but it doesn't say anything about you.   It just means wrong business, wrong choice, execution, but valuable lessons to learn. In Silicon Valley right now, the badge of honor is failure. So between two companies, all things being equal, investors are going to invest in a guy who has failed before and picked himself up or wants to learn and pick himself up. If the political leadership here truly believes in entrepreneurship, then they must put their money where their mouth is and invest in our youth nationwide.   I have been invited to be a judge in many business plan competitions. Invariably, the presentations are very well done - beautiful slides, plenty of text, plenty of pictures. But when I ask them the basic question: “Can you tell me in no more than 2-3 sentences, what business you are in,” many stumble.   If you don't have a clear understanding of what business you are in, how are you going to move forward? What problem are you trying to solve for your customers? You need to know these basics.   Bharati: You mentioned entrepreneurship education. My concern is that the approach to the other aspects of education within our system or the way parents condition their kids could negate the building of an entrepreneurial mindset.   Lim: I hope not. I think the recent move by the government to focus on skills and experience and expertise, rather than just academic education, to de-emphasise academic achievement or academic excellence is the way to go. Ideally, if we can have both, great.   But not everybody is academically brilliant. I think what we need is someone who is academically well-informed, academically well-developed. That's all.   The rest is what I call the non-academic challenges that would take advantage of any special skill set you have, any special talent that you have, any special passion you have, any special interest that you have.   In my view, there is value in all these non-academic capabilities. So the SkillsFuture move, the direction to de-emphasise academic qualifications, and also to look at passions, interests, excellence in non-academic areas, in lieu of academic qualifications, to secure a job, to secure a government position, to start a business, I think, is the right way to go.   Tongue-in-cheek, I told a minister once, that actually Singapore would have arrived, if our next PM is not somebody from the elite admin service, but completely an ordinary person with special skills. Perhaps he could have been a great painter. He could have been a successful businessman. He could have been a successful sportsman.   Bharati: Why do you believe in that?   Lim: It's not about me believing in that. It's about delivering the ultimate promise of this new focus on skills, experience alongside academic qualifications.   Bharati: What did this minister say to you in response?   Lim: He just smiled at me. Elsewhere in the world, President Reagan was an actor. I think he made a great president.   Bharati: Now, there’s Donald Trump, who is a businessman.   Lim: Well that's a separate story, but we should have done it much earlier, this focus on skills. It took us some time to realise that in the new digital economy, in the new shared economy, it's not all about academic qualifications. It’s about the ability to get things done, the ability to innovate, the ability to create and you don't have to be academically brilliant to be creative and innovative. I think it's good that the government is seeing that and the government is promoting that.   Bharati: How do you think this can change on the ground though?   Lim: That is the parents' problem and the employers’ problem.   Bharati: How do you think that mindset can be nudged into positive change?   Lim: I think government, businesses, both the private and people sector would have to embrace the new philosophy. The government is taking the lead. Some government agencies already have an alternative path created for people without relevant academic qualifications, with relevant skills and expertise they would be considered. I think that's good.   I think in Singapore, unfortunately, people are always looking towards the government as a role model. I think that must change too. I think it's also timely that the private sector take the lead. I wish more private companies were willing to take the lead, do what is right, and pull the rest of the community along.   ZERO GOVT GRANTS   Bharati: While you’ve worked for MNCs, you have been helping turnaround SMEs as well.  What would you say are the biggest obstacles for SMEs today even with the numerous government schemes that we’ve been seeing recently?   Lim: I think SMEs have to learn to be resilient and not too dependent on handouts from the government. I think if anything at all, the government has been too generous and too kind in providing the subsidies and grants.   Bharati: But businesses’ concerns are legitimate. Among other things, they have to contend with high rentals, labour costs and now, rising water and energy prices. Why shouldn’t businesses expect some assistance?   Lim: There is some merit in the complaints from businesses about high costs. There is no long-term viability or growth to talk about if companies cannot get through the short-term. That said, there are at least 10 initiatives from the budget, which companies can tap, to offset indirectly or to neutralise the increased costs.    But also, the issue of high business costs in Singapore has been around for many years now. Companies should have taken steps early to manage and overcome this. For example, if I have one dollar left, where should I deploy it to generate more than one dollar of revenue. In other words, companies should not continue to do more of the same, as the outcome would be predictable. If companies cannot contain or lower costs, then they should relocate to the region to enjoy the comparative advantage.   In the companies that I am involved in, we planned on the basis that there are no government subsidies or grants. It compels you to rethink how you would want to manage, develop and grow your business.   If I can, I do not want to be dependent on government handouts.   You’ve got to work on the basis that you get zero grants. You’ve got to work on the basis that you don't get funding from government. You need to find your own sources of funding. Where are the sources of funding?   First, you can do equity financing, so shareholders, investors, but that has to start with a good business proposition. Do a good job in generating revenue. If you can't really get the revenue that you want, you’ve got to make sure the quality of your business is good. The growth margin should be very good. How do you make sure growth margin is very good? You’ve got to manage the cost of goods. That's where companies need to have a strong focus. Go through it with a fine-toothed comb. Spend when needed and save when needed. To me it's not about saving the dollar. It's about how you spend the next dollar wisely to generate more than a dollar of revenue.   SMEs need to look at their business model. If I continue with the business model, doing more of the same, my outcome will be predictable, but if I intend to have extraordinary growth, stretch my target, do more than what I set out to do, I must think through what else I need to do differently. What else do you need to do unconventionally?   That, to me, is important, but let me tell you what the biggest problem is right now. I have always said that businesses do not fail, people do. It doesn't matter what business we are in. We are ultimately in the business of managing people. The biggest asset of a company is always the human capital. Build an A-team. Recruit good people, train and develop them and you will get your returns most times.   So companies in Singapore, for some unknown reason, are not that keen to invest in people development. The company does not always have to have the most amazing and best product, but if you execute well, chances are that the company can even do better than another company with the best product, the most amazing product, but poor execution.   So it is in businesses’ interests to invest in people. Do all this and use the government schemes for the added advantage, as a bonus.   Bharati: Speaking of government schemes unveiled in this year’s Budget, some critics say it's more of the same. Also, for instance, we’ve seen productivity enhancement schemes in the past and they don’t seem to have worked.  So critics have been saying that the government can unveil one scheme after another, but whether they are going to have a real impact, a better result, is questionable. What do you think?   Lim: To be fair, I think this time round, there is more meat in the Budget. I see Budget 2017 as more broad- based, but broad-based in a T -shape, with the deliberate stem and discernible stem to develop and grow SMEs more extensively and intensively.   There are about 10-12 schemes available that SMEs can tap, so it's really up to them to take advantage of it, but the key thing is that if you take a look at the other things that are there, they are not more of the same.   The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) are a big thing.   But again, it will remain as an idea if the execution is bad. The industry must play a part, government must play a part, businesses must play a part, the associations must play a big part. We are such a small country that you cannot cover things broadly.   You have to be targeted, identify what I call the low-hanging fruit, focus on them, develop it, and then pull the rest of the industries along. Then you take a look at the startups and SMEs, the Global Innovation Alliance, trying to link up companies with companies elsewhere to take advantage of capabilities elsewhere, technologies elsewhere. But like everything else, it's not about the plan, it's about the execution.   ENTREPRENEURIAL CIVIL SERVANTS   Bharati: And the people.   Lim: Yes, and this is where I would like to encourage and appeal to our government, meaning our civil servants who are managing some of these schemes to be more entrepreneurial in terms of their mindset too. You cannot on the one hand, try to encourage companies to be innovative, to be creative, to be more productive, but on the other hand, you are not seen to be that way yourself.   What do I mean by that? With all the funds that they have, they should be more generous in wanting to provide grants and subsidies in the right way for maximum effect.  That means being less risk-averse, and not being constrained by the fact that this is taxpayers’ money.   Bharati: But you just said that the government is being too generous already?   Lim: Yes, from the businesses standpoint, they really shouldn’t demand or expect more. But if the government wants to be revolutionary, it also should be willing to invest in the right way and bet on more companies with potential even if those companies end up failing in the end. It is a reality that out of 20 companies, usually only one succeeds. That is the investment success rate. One shouldn't be too afraid of this because the one that really succeeds is going to cover all your losses in the other 19 companies. You have to have more multiples of 20 companies that you invest in, take the risk and bet on. That is really what I think we need to do. So it's not about having all the initiatives, not just about trying to push and promote productivity. It’s got to be smart investments that cover more entities so that you can get more companies that truly become big.   Bharati: You said this means being less risk-averse, and not being constrained by the fact that this is taxpayers’ money. But surely government can’t spend taxpayers’ money willy-nilly. So how do you suggest this be done? You could rationalise it by saying that if you are less risk-averse, you might end up making more companies successful and that would power the Singapore economy.   Lim:  I don't think we need to rationalise it.   Bharati: Why not? It’s taxpayers’ money.   Lim: Yeah I agree. I think there is that moral obligation to ensure that it's being spent wisely. I am not suggesting you give up money haphazardly. I would to be the last to not agree with you that we have to be prudent. We have to exercise responsibility in managing it and offering grants and subsidies, but what I am saying is that it’s an accepted fact in the investment community that the success rate is 1 out of 20. Therefore we need to be realistic to try to support those multiples of 20 companies. You can’t tell SME startups to be risk-taking and bold but on the other hand, you continue to be…  Bharati: …rigid?   Lim: I won't say rigid. “Rigid” is not the word, but I think you can’t allow yourself to be overly-guided by the fact that this is taxpayer's money. Then, you end up not helping to bring into being larger numbers of strong local companies.  - CNA/rw Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Image Credit: Drew Tarvin/Flickr Google today enhanced its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) public cloud infrastructure offering with new virtual machine (VM) instances that boast up to 64 virtual central processing unit (CPU) cores, effectively providing more computing power for applications. They’re available now in beta for all users and projects out of Google’s data center zones that run Intel’s Haswell and Broadwell chips. There are three available flavors in the Google Compute Engine (GCE): a standard instance called n1-standard-64, a high-memory instance called n1-highmem-64, and an instance with high CPU-to-memory ratio called n1-highcpu-64. They’re all available from Google’s web-based Cloud Console and in the command-line interface (CLI) with the Google Cloud SDK. Google has been taking many steps to become more competitive with other public clouds. The biggest one, Amazon Web Services (AWS), does offer machines with 64 vCPUs. There are even 128 vCPU machines available from AWS. Currently, Microsoft Azure, the second biggest cloud, does not have machines with more than 32 vCPUs. Google followed AWS and Azure and introduced a key management service in January. People with free trials will need to ask for a quota increase in order to spin up one of the new instances — if you try to create one with a free trial, you’ll receive an error saying you’ve reached a limit of 24 CPUs. “We’ll improve the way quotas work in the near future so that it will be possible to create a 32-core instance for new, free trial users, a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. Google’s prowess in getting big customers for its cloud was proven last month, when Snap, the newly public company behind Snapchat, revealed that it had a $2 billion contract with the Google Cloud.

Gaming? If your looking at running 1440p (if gaming), i'd suggest a gtx1060 or gtx1070. Otherwise, solid build. Could save some $ by getting 16Gb ram instead of 32. Do you really need 32Gb? Could add AIO cooler instead of Noctua NH D14 - Kraken x61 is below $200 au. I believe NH D14 is close to $100 au, Kraken is a great cooler - I've got one and it keeps everything nice and cool in a hot climate - increased room for OCing too.

I'll certainly wait for the reviews on the 1700 and the B350 board. At face value the 1700x seems to be the sweet spot as far as cost and out of the box performance, but the 1700 may change that. It is exciting to see something new. As far as the 32Gb of RAM, that is purely for future proofing. If I have the bones new system for as long as my current system, it will be worth the cost to me. I already have the 970 video card, and I don't see a huge benefit for changing it out to a 1060 or 1070, considering the performance of the cards and their cost. I'm interested in Vega and Nvidia's answer to Vega. Perhaps we will get a modern version of the 6800GS or 8800GTS 512. As far as the Noctua cooler, I'm reusing it from my existing machine, so all I have to buy is the AM4 adaptor kit. The Noctua D15 does out perform it, and I am sure other AIO coolers do as well, but again I am not sure if the performance is worth me replacing a perfectly fine aircooler.     ProfBP View Public Profile Find all posts by ProfBP   (#6) jura11 Maha Guru     Videocard: Titan X SC GTX 1080 FE EK Processor: i7-5820k 4.4GHz EKWB Mainboard: ASRock X99 Extreme 6 Memory: 6x16GB DDR4 2133MHz LPX Soundcard: AVID Mbox 2 PSU: Seasonic X1250W 03-04-2017, 02:23 | posts: 1,126 | Location: London Hi there As above 1700 I would choose and looks like I will be going as well with 1700 as seems these chips runs cooler and OC bit better from reports which I've saw 32GB should be OK and air cooler,NH-D14 or D15 should be probably best there and in yours case I would stay with NH-D14,you still can attach there extra fan,I would have look on TY-143 or TY-147A fans which are probably best fans which I've run on NH-D15 and they should good as well on yours NH-D14 AM4 mounting bracket,I would contact Noctua they should be able send you for free bracket if you are willing to wait Hope this helps Thanks,Jura     jura11 View Public Profile Find all posts by jura11 « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Photo: Getty March 5th 2017 2 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/USA/ Heated oval office meeting Debra Killalea and Megan Palinnews.com.au Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend A HEATED discussion between US President Donald Trump and his chief strategist Steve Bannon as his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner watched on has been captured on video. Mr Bannon can be seen through an Oval Office window waving his arms around and appearing agitated. Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and Sean Spicer can also be seen in the background. News.com.au understands White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and press secretary Sean Spicer were also in the explosive meeting While it is unclear what the debate was about it comes after CNN reported Mr Trump was “extremely frustrated” with his staff for allowing his address to Congress last week, which was well received, to be overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ meetings with the Russian ambassador. “Nobody has seen him that upset,” an anonymous source told the network. Tense moments between US President Donald Trump and chief strategist Steve Bannon Mr Trump’s anger at the repeated “mini disasters” that have distracted his administration boiled over during a heated meeting in the Oval Office on Friday, where he reportedly dressed down White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Donald Trump is reportedly a grumpy man at the moment. Pic: APSource:AP Today, Mr Trump demanded Congress investigate his claims that Barack Obama ordered a wire-tap on Trump Tower in the lead-up to last year’s election. The White House has not provided any proof to back up Mr Trump’s extraordinary accusation. In an early morning tweetfest on Saturday, the President claimed his predecessor had ordered surveillance on him. He compared the alleged wire-tapping to Watergate and McCarthyism, and called Mr Obama a “bad (or sick) guy”. Meanwhile, the director of the FBI, James Comey, has reportedly asked the US Justice Department to publicly shoot down Mr Trump’s accusation that Mr Obama ordered Trump Tower to be wire-tapped. Mr Comey reportedly said Mr Trump has falsely insinuated that the FBI broke the law. But his request to the Justice Department, made on Saturday according to the New York Times, has not resulted in a public statement. A spokesman for Mr Obama called Mr Trump’s accusations completely false. But the White House continued its attack overnight, with Mr Trump’s deputy White House press secretary calling it potentially the “greatest abuse of power” the country has ever seen. Speaking on ABC’s This Week, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the President was determined to find out exactly what happened. “Look, I think he’s going off of information that he’s seen that has led him to believe that this is a very real potential,” she said. “And if it is, this is the greatest overreach and the greatest abuse of power that I think we have ever seen and a huge attack on democracy itself. “And the American people have a right to know if this took place.” A spokesman for Barack Obama has dismissed Mr Trump’s claims as utterly false. Picture: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/APSource:AP Politicians from both parties appealed for Mr Trump to provide proof for the startling claim, however the White House insisted there would be no further comment until “such oversight is conducted” by the congressional intelligence committees. Mr Trump claims the wire-tapping happened in October at the New York skyscraper where he ran his election campaign. Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 However House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi rubbished the claim. “It’s called a wrap-up smear,” she said. “You make up something. Then you have the press write about it. And then you say, everybody is writing about this charge. It’s a tool of an authoritarian.” FBI director James B. Comey has asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Mr Trump’s claim saying it is false and must be corrected. Mr Comey made the request following Mr Trump’s Twitter tirade on Saturday, according to US officials, although the department has not released such a statement, the New York Times reported. Mr Comey reportedly said there is no evidence to support his claim which implies that the FBI broke the law. As the fallout continued, it also emerged Mr Trump’s accusations may be based on unproven claims by alt-right news site Breitbart News and conservative radio. CNN anchor and chief, Washington correspondent Jack Tapper, tweeted that White House sources told him Mr Trump did not get his information from government sources. WH officials with whom I spoke said POTUS got the info about wiretap from media - Breitbart, Levin - not from govt sources.— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) March 5, 2017 Obviously FBI/DOJ wiretap of POTUS would be HUGE story. One illegally ordered by previous POTUS even bigger. BUT WH officials have no proof— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) March 5, 2017 3/Most reporters I know are digging on this. But every current Intel voice is saying they know of nothing to back up this claim.— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) March 5, 2017 Tapper also said if this was indeed the case it would be a massive story, however there was no proof to back up Mr Trump’s extraordinary claims. He also tweeted it wouldn’t be the first time the POTUS put out “wild accusations that are untethered to reality” including Mr Trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud and his leadership of the birther movement, which questioned whether Mr Obama was born in the US. Meanwhile, Mr Obama’s former press secretary Josh Earnest said presidents don’t have authority to unilaterally order the wire-tapping of American citizens. Mr Earnest accused Mr Trump of levelling the allegations to distract from the attention being given to campaign-season contacts by Trump aides with a Russian official, including campaign adviser Jeff Sessions, before he resigned from the Senate to become attorney general. Mr Obama’s spokesman Kevin Lewis said a “cardinal rule” of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered in Justice Department investigations, which are supposed to be conducted free of political influence. Mr Lewis said neither Obama nor any White House official had ever ordered surveillance on any US citizen. “Any suggestion otherwise is simply false,” he said. — with the Associated Press debra.killalea@news.com.au Leave a comment Add your comment to this story Show Comments Jump back to top Right now in finance 88Readers It’s your housing crisis, states tell feds 123Readers Shared equity: First home buyers able to co-purchase propert... 78Readers Commonwealth Bank, ANZ appear before parliamentary banking i... 59Readers Malcolm Turnbull responds to Pauline Hanson’s Muslim comment... 38Readers Donald Trump to leave Iraq off new travel ban order finance breaking news 11:03Credit card 'not best way to borrow': CBA 17:42ANZ favours reviews over royal commission 17:56Stocks to watch 17:35Takeovers Panel refuses probe on Macmahon 09:30Construction expands in February A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.Find out more about our policy and your choices, including how to opt-out.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE 5G takes big leap forward at MWC 17, but next generation networks remain far over the horizon Chris O'Brien@obrien March 5, 2017 3:10 PM Tags: 5G, mobile world congress, MWC 2017, top-stories This may be remembered as the year the telecommunications industry stopped squabbling over standards for next generation telecommunications networks and started to make 5G a reality. The announcements regarding 5G surged into a tidal wave this year at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. After several years of countries and companies making bland pledges to form committees to consider standards and partnerships to conduct research, the latest edition of the industry’s largest gathering was filled with concrete product announcements, pilot launches, and promises that the next revolution is at hand. It’s not. Despite the pervasive talk of 5G at MWC, and the need for every booth and product to hype it relentlessly, the reality is that it remains far over the horizon. The need to sort out technical issues, standards, and business models points to the roadblocks that still remain. For the near future, users can expect more evolution than revolution when it comes to wireless network speeds. “Many of you are wondering, ‘Why do we need 5G?’” said Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri in a keynote address. “‘Is it worth the billions that will be spent on it?’ Yes.” But in trying to temper expectations, he added: “It will not happen overnight. We believe that most carriers will want an evolutionary process that maximizes their current investment.” It’s easy to see why the notion of 5G gets the industry’s adrenaline pumping. The leap from 3G networks to 4G, with a top theoretical speed of 100 Mbps, was giant. But it would be nothing compared to 5G, which must provide a minimum of 20 Gbps and be capable of connecting 1 million devices within a square kilometer. This speed and density are almost unfathomable today. 5G is the technology that will allow us to control fields of robots with no latency and allow for roads filled almost exclusively with autonomous vehicles and skies filled continuously with unmanned drones. Not to mention all the developments that we can’t possibly imagine in a world where everything is connected all the time. Mats Granryd, director general of GSMA, the industry group that organizes MWC, predicted there would be 1 billion 5G connections by 2025. “Our industry is driving standards, business models, and public policy,” he said. “We’ll have self-driving cars reacting in milliseconds to make crucial decisions. Robots will interact with themselves and their environment.” But that number of connections is smaller than it sounds. It’s not clear in this case if GSMA is talking about people or machines. Still, getting even to that modest 1 billion will be a long and unpredictable road. That’s because telecom companies have a delicate balancing act ahead, in part because standards are not entirely settled. So whatever goes in the ground, they want to make sure it can be adapted if necessary. But more than that, many of these companies are still in the process of investing in 4G LTE, the current top speed. After almost a decade, 4G LTE is still only available in about 34 percent of the world, according to GSMA, which is a sign of just how long such changes take. In a report released last week, GSMA predicted that by 2020, 75 percent of the world’s population will be covered by 4G. Currently, about 23 percent of all mobile connections go over 4G, and the industry hopes that number will increase to more than 40 percent by 2020. That is the year the industry believes carriers will really start to deploy 5G. But even then, these companies don’t want to tear out all that 4G equipment that hasn’t even been paid for yet. Instead, as the Nokia chief suggested, they will want to evolve it to a kind of 4.5G with 1 Gbps speeds, and then maybe 3 Gbps. So expect to hear a lot about “gigabit wireless” in the coming years. Still, who wouldn’t want a 1 Gbps wireless connection, right? With those caveats in mind, however, the flurry of 5G announcements at MWC this week shows that the industry is clearly ready to start taking the next steps down this brave new wireless road. The 5G hype started in advance of the conference. The week before MWC, Qualcomm and Intel announced their respective progress toward building chipsets and modems capable of realizing the 5G dream. In its traditional keynote slot on Sunday, Samsung, along with its partners, made a series of announcements about 5G. Samsung announced a suite of 5G consumer products, including a 5G home router and radio. There was no word on when they would be available, but such gadgets are a critical piece of enabling a 5G world. There was even some talk that there might be a 5G phone by next year. On the same day, Nokia announced a technology bundle called “5G First” that’s aimed at telecom carriers. 5G First uses the industry specifications developed by the Verizon 5G Technology Forum ecosystem. The idea is to make it as quick and easy as possible for carriers to launch trials. Meanwhile, Ericsson announced collaboration on 5G trials, together with Qualcomm and NTT DOCOMO in Japan. Qualcomm is also working with Ericsson on a new 5G radio for Vodafone. “5G will enable operators to provide new use cases in areas such as the Internet of Things, automation and big data, and the ability to build new revenue streams with radically new business models,” Ulf Ewaldsson, senior vice president and chief strategy and technology officer, said in a statement. “To speed up commercialization of the global 3GPP 5G standard, we continuously work with leading operators and ecosystem players in 5G to enable global scale and drive the industry in one common direction.” Verizon will start a pilot to offer 5G to select customers in the first half of the year. AT&T will also launch 5G pilots this year. The goal of these announcements, and tests, is to encourage people to start developing applications for these networks. The estimated investment to build 5G will run will into the trillions of dollars over the next decade. The carriers want developers to be creating richer IoT uses, advanced video, and other robotic-related applications. And that’s another reason telecom companies are going to proceed with caution when it comes to 5G. The last thing they want to do is sink all that money into the ground and then have to wait other decade for someone to figure out how to use the bandwidth.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — On Saturday, Trump took to Twitter to accuse Obama of having his Trump Tower headquarters' "wires tapped" prior to the 2016 presidential election, describing this as the former administration's "new low." Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 4 марта 2017 г. ​The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! — Donald J.

As such, the Committee will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party’s campaign officials or surrogates, and we will continue to investigate this issue if the evidence warrants it," Nunes said, as quoted in a committee statement. © AP Photo/ Evan Vucci Former US Intel Chief Clapper Rejects Trump’s Wire-Tap ClaimsThe statement comes after Trump asked congressional intelligence committees to look into "politically motivated" investigations conducted by the previous administration in the run up to last year's election. The White House statement said this should be carried out as part of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the election. The Trump administration has been dogged by accusations of having links to the Russian government, which was accused last year of organizing damning leaks of Democratic Party emails that marred Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. ...

It’s that their promises are almost always lies. Take Foxconn, best known for having to put up suicide nets in its Chinese factories so that workers don’t throw themselves to their death while making your computers and phones. It has claimed it would build a big factory in Pennsylvania. Got itself lots of good press, workers in the Keystone State thought they would be able to work industrial jobs again. And then? But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. “It just seemed to fade to black” after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. In December, Pennsylvania’s economic development staff was still touting the $30 million factory that never was. What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. “I’m delivering on everything we promised,” Trump said last month during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. “People are saying they’ve never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency.” Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump’s election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, too, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have made an unusual display of loudly announcing their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump’s delight. “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said the day after the investment was revealed, “and probably more than one.” But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and what takes place on the ground can be huge — and frequently overlooked. But hey, I’m sure Trump is going to ensure accountability, right? We all know how much he values buying American! The Keystone XL Pipeline will not be subject to President Donald Trump’s executive order requiring infrastructure projects to be built with American steel, a White House spokeswoman said today. Trump signed the order calling for the Commerce Department to develop a plan for U.S. steel to be used in “all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired or expanded pipelines” inside the U.S. projects “to the maximum extent possible.” Of course. Because it’s all show. He doesn’t care about this at all. The proximate cause might be TransCanada’s NAFTA lawsuit against the U.S., but of course this sort of thing is in all sorts of trade agreements, as opposed to any workers’ rights being protected in them, so between this and the frequent lies of corporations on these issues, there’s no reason to believe that any meaningful infrastructure investment using American-made steel will actually materialize.

However from the local rubes’ perspective, these vaporware promises are less expensive than mega-stadium boondoggles.

A product of any complexity, even if it says “Made in the U.S.A.” on the label, is likely to be composed of parts that were made just about anywhere else _but_ the United States. Raw materials, the materials of construction like metals and plastics, mechanical and electronic components…there isn’t just a supply chain behind the manufacture of any device but an enormous supply TREE and what mere consumer can possibly hope to trace what countries of origin that tree spreads through? BTW this is also why the notion of “consumer choice” as the all-powerful corrective to unscrupulous or substandard manufacturers is such nonsense. If some product you buy is cheap and shoddy and dangerous, there’s every chance that the real guilty party is some supplier of parts whose name you don’t even know and supplies components to EVERY brand-name end-user product supplier you’re likely to find in shops.

Coil component maker buys copper wire. Foxconn buys transformer etc. Apple etc buys the Apple-designed and labeled product from Foxconn Then customer accepts traditional 30 day return to retailer, and the otherwise manufacturer (Apple, etc) warranty return.

How many of them will bother following up on any of this? If Trump and Fox News say that Trump is Making Great Deals to bring jobs here, then it’s happening (unless they live in one of the areas in question where it never materializes). Although it makes me wonder what these companies think they’ll be getting. If Trump doesn’t care about whether they’re honoring any PR promises about jobs, what makes them think he’ll honor anything he quietly promises them in return? Log in to Reply los says: March 5, 2017 at 3:19 pm PR promises As I’ve interpreted the PR that I’ve read, both Trump and corporation perform the publicized pretend-bargaining as only symbiotic PR. The corporation supposedly kisses Trump’s a**, but actually enjoys the nearly unpaid “patriotic” PR. It reminds of those street scams, wherein one con begins a conversation with the mark. A second con approaches and acts as if another random kindly stranger, with a story that corroborates with first con’s story. They are pretending to be independent sources of the same information.

The altcucks “follow up” in lockstep, exactly as they did when cuck-“news” fed the “starter” story. So, when cucknews is currently feeding nothing, altcucks either: a. followup with nothing. “In one ear; out the other.” or b. when there is marginally related topic, regurgitate the starter story or the most erroneous variation. Log in to Reply Davebo says: March 5, 2017 at 2:40 pm Good post but to be fair the suicide rate among Foxconn employees is well below the average for the Chinese population as a whole. From a workers standpoint, Foxconn is similar to other factory assembly jobs around the world. From a management standpoint… They can gear up and put 30,000 new employees online in less than 3 months. That’s not going to happen in the US or Europe. In other words, only a fool would think Foxconn is branching out to the US.

As I read a few years ago, Foxconn and less-knowns operate like instant company towns. Workers are almost migrant labor, drawn in from small towns and true rural. Log in to Reply jam says: March 5, 2017 at 3:37 pm Good post but to be fair the suicide rate among Foxconn employees is well below the average for the Chinese population as a whole. Yeah, when you make inaccurate comparisons lots of things seem reasonable. Foxconn employees are all employed (by definition) and much younger than the middle-aged and older people who commit most suicide in China (a pattern found worldwide). From a workers standpoint, Foxconn is similar to other factory assembly jobs around the world. Which is why they require employees to sign documents like: Should any injury or death arise for which Foxconn cannot be held accountable (including suicides and self-mutilation), I hereby agree to hand over the case to the company’s legal and regulatory procedures. I myself and my family members will not seek extra compensation above that required by the law so that the company’s reputation would not be ruined and its operation remains stable Log in to Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Each year, developers and aspiring game creators flock to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco like they are going to the well. It’s inspiring, and it widens their horizons. It has the same effect on me, as a game journalist. Each year, there are some unforgettable moments. And here are some that made an impression on me during the past week. #1ReasonToBe This session was, sadly, the only panel that I attended in full during the show. (GDC has become more about press events and game demo appointments and interviews for me, which is a little more corporate and less serendipitous for me). But I chose wisely in attending this session about diversity. Organized by Rami Ismail of Vlambeer, this session was about geographic diversity. Rasheed Abueideh started it out by saying he is from a place that doesn’t show up on Google Maps. What is it like if you come from a place where you do not want to put your name in a game’s credits? Abueideh said he is from Palestine, which he spelled P@L!$T!NE. “It has been suffering from occupation for 69 years,” he said. As he said that, I thought he was going to go into a political rant about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But he didn’t do that. He showed a sense of humor and humanity in his presentation, and that made it very moving. Above: An image from Palestine. Image Credit: Rasheed Abueideh “The Palestinian people love playing games,” he said. Then he showed a picture of giant, real slingshot, saying, “This is how we play Angry Birds.” He showed himself taking a selfie at a checkpoint where people were queued like cattle. He said, “This is Papers, Please,” referring to the award-winning game about a border control agent. But he added, “They don’t say please.” He said he wanted to make games early on but it was under very difficult conditions. He said the country doesn’t have access to 3G networks because “we don’t have permission.” There is no access to funding. He started a game division in his company, but it shut down for lack of money. No one comes to visit from the outside world to court developers. “We are isolated,” he said. “No one comes to us.” When the Gaza war broke out in 2014, Abueideh said he imagined what would happen if his kids were killed in that war. He said there were many such deaths in real life. His team banded together and made a game, Liyla & the Shadows of War. “How do we make games if we are living as survivors?” he said. Above: Liyla & The Shadows of War. Image Credit: Rasheed Abueideh They sent it to the app store, and it was rejected because it was based on a “political statement.” Apple is skittish about publishing anything that is controversial. There were some false reports that the game was made by the Islamic State. “By the way, I am not ISIS,” Abueideh said. He said this community, this industry, was amazing, and he got support from around the world. The game was eventually approved, and it got 700,000 downloads on both platforms. The title wasn’t particularly polished, but it made a point about children in war. When he told his father what he was doing, his father replied, “My son, you will end up in jail.” He said his wife was terrified as well. She said she advised him not to put his name on the game after he had worked on it for two years. “I am honored to be here, but I am not happy,” he said. Abueideh said his No. 1 reason to be in the game industry was to make games that could stop wars and stop more children from being killed. The game did go out with his name in the credits. He got a standing ovation. Politics at the game awards Above: Nina Freeman at the IGF Awards. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi In some ways, I was surprised that Abueideh was allowed to travel to the U.S. for the talk. President Donald Trump’s travel ban isn’t as sweeping as you might expect. You could say that politics has no place in a place like the GDC, which celebrates games. And that was the attitude that I found prevailed at the DICE Summit and DICE Awards. But at the Game Developers Choice Awards, Trump’s travel ban was fair game. Nina Freeman, a game developer and host of the Independent Games Festival Awards, drew her loudest applause of the night on Wednesday as she expressed sympathy for those “affected by the Muslim travel ban.” A number of game developers said they could no longer travel to the U.S. for the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco because of the travel ban. Thousands of people applauded in the audience. Behind me, one table stood up and shouted, “Fuck Trump,” over and over. Her outspoken comment was a contrast to the DICE Awards, where none of the recipients mentioned Trump or the travel ban. “I urge you to donate to the ACLU,” Freeman said. Were all of the developers against Trump? No. I had a two-hour conversation with a CEO who felt that the left was going to far in comparing Trump to Hitler, who was a terrorist of the first order before he took office. GDC Ambassador Award After Nina Freeman spoke, Mark DeLoura, the former White House adviser on digital media, received the Ambassador Award for his work making government and the wider population more aware of games and the good impact that can come from being a gamer or game developer. Above: Mark DeLoura, former White House adviser on digital media. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi DeLoura was an advocate for the understanding the game industry in the federal government, and he made it clear that he believes games can be a force for social good during his acceptance speech at the awards show. DeLoura said, “People at the White House knew me as the guy with the big fat Pikachu at my desk.” Among his accomplishments: He organized the first game jam at the White House. In his acceptance speech, DeLoura praised the diversity of skills and creative inspiration that drives game developers to create original works of art. He said praised how games help give voices to everyone, including “the voices of women, gay and transgender individuals, underrepresented minorities, veterans, the elderly, the homeless, and, of course, immigrants and refugees.” He admired games like 1979 Revolution, That Dragon Cancer, We are Chicago, Never Alone, and Paolo Pedercini’s great web games such as Unmanned. Yet so many of us are building our next shooter, our next 4X, our next match-three….And those are great games, we love those games, billions of people love those games. Bigly. Nobody loves them more than I do. It’s true. But if we think that games can be more, do more, have a broader impact – and we’ve seen great examples of that – isn’t it incumbent upon all of us, in this room, to drive that? If we don’t stand up for the rights of others, we’ll never hear their voices. If we don’t make games easier to build, we’ll never see the amazing innovation of people using them in new ways. If we don’t start by using our own voice… how can we possibly show others the way? By putting our own hearts out there. Our own passion out there. Taking risks.” These are difficult times for many. We have unique skills that we can use to help. How are you using your unique abilities — your superpowers, making games — to share with the world your perspective? How are you taking risks to use games in new ways? How are you helping raise the voices of others? If you do that, you will change things. You will change the world. Through games. So please. We need your expertise. We need your voice. Start today. Qualcomm’s VR headset prototype Above: Dean Takahashi tries out the Qualcomm VR headset at GDC 2017. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Yes, GDC wasn’t all about politics. It had cool technology as well. I saw Qualcomm’s prototype virtual reality headset with stand-alone wireless functionality. This headset, which Qualcomm vice president Tim Leland showed me and is intended for developers, had no wires connecting it to a PC. Rather, it had Wi-Fi built into a Snapdragon 820 processor. (The real version coming this year will use the more recent Snapdragon 835). That made it smaller and less bulky than existing headsets like the HTC Vive. And to reiterate, you don’t hook the headset to a PC. All of the processing power and wireless connectivity is built into what will be an ARM-based Snapdragon processor in the headset itself. It was battery-powered, but I didn’t get any details on the type or how long the battery lasts. It also had a somewhat-large bar in front of the eyes with a couple of sensors, as part of its inside-out sensing design. (Inside-out means the sensors are on the headset, not on devices set up around the room). Above: Tim Leland of Qualcomm’s shows off wireless VR headset. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Those sensors were able to detect my hands and the movements of my 10 fingers. It used controller-freehand tracking from Leap Motion. That meant I didn’t have to hold a touch controller in my hands. The headset ran Leap Motion’s demo software. With it, I was able to pick up and create blocks. I could toss them around, and look at my fingers in virtual reality. The resolution was good, though the tracking wasn’t absolutely precise. It was still a little hard to pick up objects, but mainly because I had no force feedback, or sense of touch, that told me when I had touched a block. The Leap Motion software has been integrated into Qualcomm’s reference design kit that other companies can take and put their brand names on, if they wish. Leland said hand-tracking is opitonal for other companies to include, but the sensor for it isn’t that expensive. It adds very little weight, and so including it is kind of a no brainer for hardware companies. The Qualcomm headset was smaller than Intel’s own prototype, dubbed Project Alloy. That device has the capability of a high-end laptop, with the ability to run VR apps at 90 frames per second. The Snapdragon 835 is also powerful, but I don’t know what kind of performance it will have. Qualcomm’s device was also much lighter, and not so heavy on the head. The developer headset had a four-megapixel (2560×1440) WQHD AMOLED display (two megapixels per eye) and six degrees of freedom (6DoF) motion tracking. It had two monochromatic, one mega pixel (1280×800) global shutter cameras. It had four gigabytes of LPDDR$ DRAM memory and 64 gigabytes of Flash UFS. It used wireless with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and USB3.1 type C (power). For audio, it had Qualcomm Aqstic audio codec (WCD9335), and for I/O it also had a trackpad on the right side of the headset. The best thing about this prototype is that it told me that the second generation of VR hardware isn’t so far away. That’s a good thing, because the first generation hasn’t gotten enough traction to sustain a large number of VR startups and game companies. Epic’s real-time reskinning of a race car Above: The Mill’s Blackbird is a car that can be reskinned with game animations. Image Credit: Epic Games Epic Games, visual creation company The Mill, and car maker Chevrolet showed a new tool for filmmakers that blends artificial reality and the real world. It was one more step on the way to a mixed reality where we can’t tell the difference between what is animated and what is real. The demo showed how Chevy and visual production firm The Mill used the Unreal game engine to blend an animated car in real-time into a video that will be part of a television advertising campaign. The film makes use of The Mill’s special adjustable car, dubbed the Blackbird. The race car has QR codes and markers that allow it to be used as a template for digital animations. It also has a 360-degree camera. Filmmakers shot video of a real car and the Blackbird racing on a mountain road. Then, in real-time, the animators covered the car with digital animations that transformed it into another sleek race car. As they shot the Blackbird, the filmmakers could see through a viewfinder what the finished animated car would look like in the scene. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney (who will be a speaker at our GamesBeat Summit 2017 event in May) said in an interview with GamesBeat that the creators used an advanced implementation of Epic’s Unreal Engine with The Mill’s proprietary virtual production toolkit, Mill Cyclops, to create a film that merges real-time visual effects and live-action storytelling. “This is a way to bring down the costs of animation,” Sweeney said. “Brands can’t always have a car on the set. Sometimes that’s due to security reasons. We had to find a way to visualize a car that wasn’t there. So we created a virtual car using the Blackbird. We used the Blackbird in shoots and then skinned it with a computer-generated car.” In the ad campaign, “The Human Race” is about a real-life car driver’s battle with an artificial intelligence being that drives a car without human control. The film features the 2017 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 in a heated race with the Chevrolet FNR autonomous concept car. “This sounded crazy, but we figured out how to do this in real-time,” said Kim Libreri, CTO, Epic Games, in an interview. “It’s real-time visual effects. We generate cars, composite them, and put them in a video. This looks like it went through months of post-production processing. In reality, it is rendered in real-time.” Sweeney said, “The question here is can your game engine produce pixels that match the real world.” The only physical vehicle filmed for “The Human Race” was the Mill Blackbird, a fully adjustable rig that enables filmmakers to insert any car model into any filed environment. Until now, computer-animated cars were added by visual effects artists in post-production, requiring days of rendering to produce high-quality imagery. During this shoot, however, live video feeds as well as positional data from the tracking system were fed directly into Unreal Engine. The Camaro was then rendered and composited seamlessly into the footage in real-time AR, allowing the directors to instantly see the final look and composition of each shot. Above: These cars have been reskinned in real-time. Image Credit: Epic Games The same real-time technology was used to create, alter and produce the short film, blurring the lines between production and post. The ability to create ‘final pixels’ in real time will ultimately change the way filmmakers create content and make critical decisions, Sweeney said. Alistair Thompson, executive vice president at The Mill, said at Epic’s event that his company created Blackbird because it couldn’t get access to a car that it needed to shoot a commercial. Chevy’s commercial creators, however, need to be able to see the animated car as they shoot a scene through a viewfinder. On stage, Epic, Chevy, and The Mill showed how they could present an animated car onscreen simultaneously as the Blackbird was being filmed in front of the crowd. Sweeney said, “This technology is changing the economics of entire industries.” Sweeney also showed how you could use virtual reality to design a game, from inside the game. The Unreal Engine VR editor is a full editing tool that lets you build an entire level of a game from inside virtual reality. It’s a bit like building a full game scene by snapping together Lego bricks and then twisting them into the right shape with your hands, the way a real artist does.

Gates on hovo to achieve infotech revolution Mr. Bill Gates connected with the best of Mumbai’s industrial elite to politely tell them the best of IT can only facilitate and not double up for a sensible business strategy. “First have a strategy. Also, the CEO should be a personal user of PC and have complete familiarity with the manifold uses of the gadget,” he added. Taking up the afternoon at Taj for a quick walk through the latest in IT, Mr. Gates said that a good telecom facility is a must for the country before it can be comfortable with modern Intel PCs and sophisticated Microsoft software.

Show Caption of Expand By Rachel Uranga, Southern California News Group | PUBLISHED: March 5, 2017 at 7:11 am | UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 8:15 am For decades, trucking has provided big-rig driver Frank Mora and his family a decent living. He doesn’t expect that will last forever. Most major truck manufacturers and several well-funded startups are busy testing automated or driver-free vehicles. Test models of cars that will shoosh passengers around town without a human at the wheel have attracted much media attention. But it’s apparent that when driverless vehicles hit the road for real, they’ll be driven by commerce, and that means trucks will likely lead the pack. Mora, whose family has been in the trucking business for three decades, said he can easily understand the appeal of a machine that can be run 24 hours a day, without forced breaks for rest and with less labor. The technology is already out there. From completely driverless big rigs to platooned trucks that could be manned by a single driver and eventually automated, the testing is underway. “Sure, as an owner I could save a lot of money on wages,” he said. “As to whether I think it’s safer, it’s too soon to tell. I am sure that there are … maneuvers that only humans can do.” Success for the technology could summon a seismic shift for California’s 218,000 truck and delivery drivers – 2.5 million across the nation – according to the latest count from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “This is not the far future,” said Xiao Yun Lu, a research engineer at Partners for Advanced Transportation Technology (PATH) at UC Berkeley. “This is the near future.” The economy churns on the goods truckers carry to markets, retail stores and, increasingly, directly to consumers. Many believe automation can make the business safer, cut operator costs and address intermittent shortages of truck drivers. “There is a very strong commercial motivation,” said Steven Shladover, a research engineer and manager at PATH. “(Trucks) are out there on the road all day and every day, unlike passenger vehicles which are parked 95 percent of the time. When people buy trucks, they are looking for a return on the investment.” For truckers like Mora, life will change. “There is nothing we can do to stop it or change it,” said 28-year-old driver Mora, who spent much of his childhood inside the cab of an 18-wheeler. “But with change, there is always opportunity.” Platoons lead the pack It’s already happening. . Otto, a subsidiary of Uber, tested an automated truck with a 120-mile beer run across Colorado last year. . Freightliner, a truck produced by Daimler Trucks North America, glided across the Hoover Dam in 2015. . Startup Starsky Robotics last week announced it is testing a kit for trucks that will allow big rigs to drive alone on highways, remotely controlled. While self-driving cars offer the prospect of making roads safer and reducing traffic, these hulking trucks promise commercial benefits that could hasten their development. “Platoons” could lead the pack. Volvo Trucks was one of six truck manufacturers that last year rolled out partially automated big rigs across Europe so regulators could test their ability to safely caravan. The testing went smoothly, but in Europe, as in the United States, regulators are still grappling with how to handle vehicles that soon won’t need humans. The technology, known as platooning, allows two or more cargo trucks to ride in tandem, talking to one another. It’s considered one of the lowest levels of automation, including some simple features already known to drivers of luxury vehicles, such as automated braking. Analysts believe platoons have the potential to come to market quicker because of fewer regulatory hurdles. Already several states have adopted legislation allowing variations. What’s the hurry? Savings. Platooned trucks drive tightly together, cutting as much as 20 percent in fuel costs, by some estimates. And one of trucking companies’ biggest expenses is what goes in the tank, according to an American Transportation Research Institute. Can these packs of trucks maneuver successfully without help from human hands? That’s one question Caltrans officials will be looking at when they oversee a federally backed test of a three-truck Volvo platoon, starting Wednesday. It will be the first time platoon driving will be tried in Southern California. The trial will focus on how safe these vehicles can be with other cars weaving in and out around them. “These trucks are not going to be taking away jobs,” said Aravind Kailas, a U.S.-based technology planner at Volvo. “It’s targeting safety to get on the road.” In the trials, drivers will sit behind the wheels of three 53-foot Volvo big-rig trucks. All will steer the vehicles, but the second and third driver won’t touch the gas or break pedal. The test will be similar to the drill staged in Rotterdam but with a much shorter route, along the 110 Freeway to the Port of Los Angeles, where hundreds of cargo-loading trucks stream in and out of daily. They will communicate through a complex system of radar, cameras and Wi-Fi. “What you are achieving when these trucks talk to one another is the ability to brake synchronously at the same time,” Kailas said. “If the first truck brakes, the second and third truck brake at the same time.” This won’t be a test for speed. None of the trucks will travel faster than 55 mph. “The No. 1 thing we want to show,” Kailas said, “is that this is a technology that is targeting safety,” Anxiety at the wheel “Everything is pretty much possible,” said Wokil Hayder, director of autonomous and automated driving for Volvo Trucks in Sweden, “but whether you want to do it is another thing.” As the technology barrels forward, some anxiety is evident among regulators and consumers alike. While a Consumer Technology Association poll found 70 percent of 2,001 people surveyed ready to test out an autonomous vehicle, a University of Michigan poll revealed less than 16 percent were willing to let the machines completely take over. California, where many of the startups pursuing the technology call home, has been slow to adopt autonomous vehicle regulations, while Michigan, home to the auto industry, has shot ahead. Headlines from last summer could stoke anxiety, too. The death of a man driving a Tesla Model S car in autopilot mode renewed concerns about the technology. After an investigation, U.S. regulators, however, found no evidence of defects. CEO Elon Musk, who operates a Tesla design center in Hawthorne as well as the SpaceX rocket-building facility, applauded the decision. What needs to happen before these vehicles are fully deployed is a “mind-set change,” Hayder said. Motorists may fear sharing the road with “heavy, long big trucks” without drivers. But the long-range goal is to make robot-powered trucks safer than their human-steered counterparts. “We have a huge opportunity,” said Marques McCammon, general manager for connected vehicle solutions at Wind River, a subsidiary of Intel that has been developing software for self-driving vehicles. Smart vehicles, with more electronic eyes than humans, will have a greater ability to sense obstacles or other danger. New, “smarter” road systems that communicate with vehicles could “change the paradigm,” he said. In 2015, 35,092 people died in car accidents, according to the National Highway Safety Transportation Administration. The agency estimates 94 percent of all accidents were caused by human error. “Think about what this could mean for safety alone,” McCammon said. How long? Experts disagree about just how long it will take to get driverless big rigs on the road and just how human-free they will ever be. Platooning, for example, is a long way from robots at the wheel. Shladover estimates it could be decades. “All the truck drivers are not going to lose their jobs,” he said, “and there are a lot of other crazy predictions floating around out there. A transportation system doesn’t change that quickly. It takes a long time for vehicle fleets to turn over. “Even when we got a government mandate that all new vehicles have to be equipped with seat belts, it took 11 years to get up to 90 percent of the vehicles (in compliance),” he added. But plenty of folks are more bullish. The head of Connecticut-based transportation and logistics company XPO told a conference of maritime professionals in Long Beach last week that he expects to see driver-free trucks “everywhere” in the next decade. And Noel Perry, an economist specializing in freight, said he expects to see driverless trucks come online in 10 years and for platooning to be operational by 2020. That could eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, with median pay about $40,000 for each, according to the Department of Labor. That notion doesn’t sit well with Sam Loesche, a lobbyist for the Teamsters union, which represents about 40,000 truck and delivery drivers nationwide. “You can never be in a situation where you automate jobs overnight and expect that to be the best interest of the country,” Loesche said. “I don’t think we have even seen technology that is proven and reliable. “These drivers are the face of business,” he said. “They interact on a day-to-day basis with customers and their relationship strengthens brands. I would say anyone who writes off the role of the working class in this country … does so at their own risk.” For Perry, the arrival of automated trucking is not a drama pitting jobs and families vs. a robotically enhanced bottom line. It’s simply where the business needs to be, he said. “It will mean trucking is cheaper and safer,” he said. Tags:  Self-driving cars Rachel Uranga, Southern California News Group Subscribe Today!

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 March 2017 by Military News NVIDIA Is a Bet on the Global Economy NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1080 GPU can power the latest video games and help doctors diagnose brain tumors. Image source: NVIDIA Corporation. NVIDIA ‚s(NASDAQ: NVDA) GeForce graphics cards have been its largest driver of growth in the past. Now, the same GPUs that have powered video games are being used by companies to process and analyze data. Companies are using deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to teach computers to learn a task without human aid. It’s a process that requires a massive amount of computation in real time, and the powerful GPUs are the only processors up to the task. A global economic opportunity The largest tech companies like Amazon.com , Microsoft , Alphabet , and Facebook  have used GPUs to process image and voice recognition. Demand for these applications has been the first phase of growth for NVIDIA’s data center segment. According to NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, the next phase of growth will come from companies spanning retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and life sciences, among others. Retailers are processing data with deep learning to better connect shoppers with an item they might want to buy. For example, Houzz — an online interior design company — has created a system that can recognize furniture and accessories from a photo and tell the person where to get those items for their home. If retailers can benefit from this technology, imagine what this will do for marketing. It will be harder than ever for consumers to avoid spending money as marketers use deep learning to know what you want before you want it. In healthcare, researchers running a computer system powered by NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1080 GPU are processing brain tumor tissue samples to help surgeons reduce the patient’s wait time for diagnosis. Typically during surgery, it takes 30 to 40 minutes for the surgeon to send the tissue sample to the lab for processing, but a new system using deep learning is helping to dramatically reduce the wait time to only three minutes. It’s still a work in process, but so far the system has a 90% accuracy rate over 30 samples. Deep learning and AI is also being used for robotics in manufacturing. Berkshire Hathaway ‚s ISCAR metalworking business is a good example of how manufacturers are using robotics and AI to run automated factories. NVIDIA’s Jetson TX1 developer board — a circuit board the size of a credit card — can process live data from sensors and cameras to make drones and robots smarter. In transportation, NVIDIA has recently announced partnerships with Volkswagen AG ‚s Audi and Daimler AG ‚s Mercedes-Benz to develop self-driving cars. Automakers will rollout self-driving cars this year that can partially drive by themselves, but will need human assistance. By 2020, more advanced levels of autonomy will be introduced where a car will be able to drive itself in all circumstances except conditions like severe weather. Autosuppliers such as Bosch and Germany’s ZF have also partnered with NVIDIA. ZF is one of the largest suppliers in the auto industry and the leading supplier to Europe’s trucking industry. ZF is using its own self-driving system — called ZF ProAI — based on the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 AI car computer. The ZF ProAI computer will launch in 2018 and will provide self-driving capability for commercial vehicles, such as forklifts and trucks, in the agriculture and mining industries. The GPU revolution NVIDIA likes to call the current rapid adoption of deep learning and AI a new industrial revolution. More specifically, we are in a GPU revolution. The graphics card is the new CPU as companies are using advanced computer systems and algorithms powered by GPUs to process massive amounts of data in real-time that a CPU cannot handle. As Intel  powered the PC revolution of the 1980s and 1990s, NVIDIA is powering the deep learning revolution. Recently, the NVIDIA segments that are benefiting from enterprise adoption of GPUs — automotive and data center — are showing high rates of growth, but these segments are still small as a percentage of NVIDIA’s total revenue.  The combined revenue of automotive and datacenter was 19% of NVIDIA’s total revenue over the last four quarters. The automotive segment has been growing anywhere from about 30% to 60% year over year, which is parallel to the gaming segment. In contrast, data center growth has been tripling year over year in the last two quarters. When we consider all the ways businesses are utilizing deep learning and AI across different sectors of the economy, NVIDIA may just be scratching the surface of its market opportunity. 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That’s largely because of their tradition of strong education and infrastructure. US News & World Report’s first ranking of the best states list in the top 10: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Washington State, Iowa, Utah, Maryland, Colorado and Vermont. (Connecticut was 12th, Maine 18th and Rhode Island 21st.)   The publication said: “Some states shine in health care. Some soar in education. Some excel in both – or in much more. The Best States ranking …draws on thousands of data points to measure how well states are performing for their citizens. In addition to health care and education, the metrics take into account a state’s economy, the opportunity it offers people, its roads, bridges, Internet and other infrastructure, its public safety and the integrity and health of state government.   “More weight was accorded to some state measures than others, based on a survey of what matters most to people. Health care and education were weighted most heavily. Then came the opportunity states offer their citizens, their crime & corrections and infrastructure. State economies followed closely in weighting, followed by measures of government administration. This explains why Massachusetts, ranking No. 1 in education and No. 2 in health care, occupies the overall No. 1 spot in the Best States rankings. And it explains why New Hampshire, ranking No. 1 in opportunity for its citizens, ranks No. 2 overall in the Best States rankings.’’   The low-tax (except for their regressive sales taxes) low-public-service Red States in the South generally did very poorly.   Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican and a very able executive who’s expected to run for re-election next year, said:            “We have a lot of really smart people, we have a lot of great schools. That has led to a whole series of terrific what I would call ‘ecosystems’ around technology and health care and finance and education. And you put it all together, and in this day and age, in this kind of global economy and global world we live in, it’s a terrific mix.” Of course, Massachusetts has had some great institutions since the 17th Century; it had a running start.   Mr. Baker will probably get some credit for the ranking, but the essentials of the Bay State’s health have been in place for a long time.  Governors and U.S. presidents have remarkably little impact on the economic health of their jurisdictions;  there are far too many variables.   As for New Hampshire, it has the overwash of wealth from the very rich Greater Boston area, the Granite State’s good public education, political integrity, local  and state civic-mindedness, a tradition of  having many well-run small and medium-size companies and industrial craftsmanship. And as  befits a state that is mostly suburban, exurban and rural,  lower taxes than Massachusetts’s.   US News folks did note that Massachusetts, despite of, or because of, its very low unemployment rate, had too little “affordable housing’’ (whatever that means exactly) and very wide income inequality. But the latter is due largely to the vast wealth collected by the senior execs and shareholders of very successful enterprises founded in, based in or with major operations in the Bay State and the large number of well paid  physicians, engineers, financial-services honchos and other very highly skilled professionals.   xxx   Governor Gina Raimondo Kudos to the Raimondo administration  and others involved in bringing Norwegian Airlines to T.F. Green Airport! The Federal Aviation Administration and others have long wanted Green to offer regular international flights, to, among other things, reduce congestion at Boston’s Logan International Airport. Certainly southeastern New England has the population density to support a major international airport.   The extension of the main runway to 8,700 feet due to be completed at year’s end should draw more international airlines since the longer runway means very long-haul airlines can use it.  Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut business should study how they can best benefit from Green’s expanded role in international travel.   xxx   Generations obviously flow into each other and we must be leery of over-generalizing. But Bruce Cannon Gibney is on to something when indicting the Baby Boom generation (1946-1964) for having all too many selfish, narcissistic, greedy uncivic-minded, myopic and, well, dishonest people. He makes his case in forthcoming book: A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America.   Consider the corruption in varying degrees of leading politicians and business leaders in the past 40 years as the Baby Boomers came to power. Look at their disinclination, compared to their parents, to participate in unpaid if admirable civic projects. You don’t hear very much anymore of “dollar-a-year men’’ who volunteer to take onerous but crucial public-sector jobs to address a crisis. Look at their using public office to line up gargantuan payoffs  later in the private sector.   You see many more rich Boomers plastering their names on buildings, be they at colleges, museums and hospitals, compared to their parents’ generation, for whom anonymous giving was much admired. From the Gospel of Matthew, in the New Testament: "Be careful not to do 'good works' in front of others. Don't do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.’’     You see something of the Baby Boomer culture in executive suites, not to mention the Oval Office. As Boomers started to take big jobs in public companies many started to display astonishing greed compared to their parents, and a disinclination to share corporate wealth with their underlings, whose inflation-adjusted wages generally have fallen over the era of Boomer hegemony. At the same time, insider trading and other Wall Street sleaze have flourished.   For whatever combination of reasons – be it that too many Boomers were cosseted as kids or whether the media came to excessively worship wealth and conspicuous consumption –arrogance and extreme greed came to characterize much of American business under the Baby Boomers. You have to go back to the Twenties and the Gilded Age of the late 19th and very early 20th centuries to see its like.   And consider many Boomers’ lack of interest in supporting government programs for the poor and other weak  groups and their generally successful push for lower taxes even as they fight any cuts in programs that benefit, or will soon benefit, them, especially Social Security and Medicare.  And look at the popularity of eliminating the federal estate tax as affluent Boomers’ parents started go to their reward. Or their debonair attitude toward the ever-deepening federal debt that goes with lower taxes and higher spending on programs that disproportionately favor the Boomers.   Glance at America’s crumbling infrastructure -- mostly due to a refusal to pay taxes commensurate with long-term public needs – is another monument of the Boomers, too many of whom are not societal builders but users.   And it’s curious that older Baby Boomers often get credit for promoting civil rights for racial minorities, women’s and gay rights associated with the ‘60s and early ‘70s, when the people who led these movements were from the so-called Greatest Generation and Silent Generation.   And while Steve Jobs and his Silicon Valley contemporaries did come up with some nifty inventions they can’t compare in long-term importance with those  developed by the generation before them – often with the help of federal programs. Semiconductors and Internet are examples.   It is true that many Boomers became avid foes of the Vietnam War – but mostly because they didn’t want to fight in it.   Let us hope that younger folks display more civic-mindedness and generosity than their parents. Or will they just disappear into social media?   xxx   President Donald Trump The uber-Baby Boomer President Trump’s speech Tuesday to Congress was, as showmanship, quite effective – especially of course to his base, many of whose members rarely read but (like the president) get most of their information from TV, and especially from the Republican Party outlet Fox News.  They loved Mr. Trump as a TV performer in the campaign  and on The Apprentice,  and his crazy inaugural address speech for  some of the same reasons. He does have charisma.But many other Americans, even some Democrats, found it unexpectedly soothing.   Mr. Trump was under control and even appeared statesmanlike from time to time Tuesday. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Democrat, summed it up: “He gives  an ordinary speech, and by not embarrassing the country over the course of an hour, people are astonished.’’   The major problem was a minor one  to many in today’s post-literate, visuals-and-sound-obsessed world): lack of real content.   And the address was filled with contradictions, magical thinking, outright lies and assertions based on half (or less) truths. In other words, basic Donald Trump, but with a softer tone and calming blue tie.   The best and most plausible programmatic thing in the speech was his push for a big national infrastructure plan, although as with all his promises, he presented no clear way of paying for it other than that it would be a public-private program. (He might look at Pennsylvania’s  highly successful public-private infrastructure-rebuilding programs as a partial model.)   Just a couple of examples of his dishonesty, his “massive middle class tax cut” would actually be a massive tax cut for the rich, not the middle class. And he complained about how overtaxed the U.S. allegedly is but in  fact the Organization for Economic Cooperation puts America near the bottom of the 34 industrialized nations for tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. The OECD ranks the U.S. 31st, well behind the very prosperous nations of Germany, the U.K., and Denmark.  And the global accounting firm KPMG ranks the U.S. as the 6th "tax friendliest" country in the world.   Americans, like most people, don't like to pay taxes; many would rather the country borrow instead; perhaps they’re assuming that they won’t be around to pay the piper. Mr. Trump, of course, is at Olympic levels when it comes to avoiding taxes himself. (By the way, to reduce corruption involving campaign donations and corporate lobbyists,  and to  boost business efficiency, I favor getting rid of the corporate income tax entirely and hiking the personal income tax rate to make up for the lost revenue. In the end, people pay taxes, not inorganic things called ‘’businesses’’.)   The major reason that America’s infrastructure is so crummy is that Americans don’t want to pay for it.  Not that long ago, in the ‘50s and ‘60s, they accepted that they had to pay for it. Anyway, in this era of magical economic thinking, I suppose that we’ll make repairs by borrowing another trillion. Pay as you go is just so retro.   Mr. Trump also complained that “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force’’ – with the implication, of course, that somehow Barack Obama is to blame. But this huge number includes many millions of elderly retired people, college students and others who don’t want to, and/or can’t, work!   And then there was  the misleading stuff in the phrase: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, SoftBank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.”   These decisions were made before Mr. Trump’s unlikely election.   For many, perhaps most of Donald Trump’s followers, his lies make no difference. So far, he has maintained a very successful cult of personality.  Presumably some sort of crisis – economic, foreign, whatever --  could explode that. But not for a while. And the stock market, as in the summer of 1929, keeps rising….   Speaking of lies: Atty. Gen Jeff Sessions’s now-exposed falsehood, told under oath, that he had no meetings with Russian officials during the campaign means he should resign immediately.  His “recusal’ from the case is not enough. Russian president/dictator/murderer, kleptocrat Vladimir Putin, it is now clear, worked hard  with the help of Trump people to get Donald Trump elected president. But then, as Donald Trump Jr. noted back in 2008:    “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our (the Trump Organization’s) assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."   And no to Republicans cynically misquoting Barack Obama as saying that the Russians had no effect on the election. He said that so far we know, the Russians didn’t get into voting machines and other mechanical and administrative aspects of the election. As polls and other evidence show, the Niagara of negative stuff about Hillary Clinton produced by the Russian/Wikileaks/Trump collaborative clearly lost her the election. (I wrote in Jim Webb’s name  on the ballot myself.)   xxx   Gov. Charlie Baker is now looking again at closing the broken, one-mile link in the Northeast rail corridor between South and North stations in  downtown Boston that prevents connectivity between commuter rail systems and interrupts Amtrak service. I hope that he sees this as a priority. Closing the link would ultimately help most New Englanders. This was a dream of former Gov. Michael Dukakis, but fiscal and political pressures blocked the way.   xxx   Superman Building Providence’s Industrial Trust Building (aka the Superman Building) might be best used for design studios for Providence’s big art and design community on the first few floors over the ground floor (which could have restaurants and shops), and then apartments and condos and then a restaurant near the top. If none of these soon become economically plausible, then tear the damn thing down; it’s starting to fall apart. The building is probably too clunky and outdated (with its step-backs) to lure  a big company.   xxx The Newport Open Space Partnership is very close to making public its “Open Space Master Plan,” which the Newport Daily News says is the “first citywide open space planning effort since [legendary landscape architect} Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. published “Proposed Improvements for Newport,’’  in  1913. ‘’ Amazing that with all the changes in the City by the Sea in the past century that it has taken this long!   “It’s a high-quality planning document,” Scott Wheeler, the city’s arborist and supervisor of buildings, ground and parks, told the paper. “It will be invaluable as a helpful guide to much of what we do. It has already helped us.” Good news for one of the most interesting and colorful cities in America.   Related Slideshow: The 50 Greatest Living Rhode Islanders Prev Next #50 Richard Grosvenor  Painter Born in France, educated at Harvard, Grosvenor has been the head of the art department at St. George’s for decades.  A brilliant water colorist, Grosvenor was selected by the White House Historical Society to paint a scene of the White House for their bi-centennial calendar for the year 2000.

She was the first female partner at a major Providence law firm at a time when most law firms did not employ women attorneys. She was one of a small group of Tiverton residents who joined together in the early 1970's to oppose a proposal to build a major oil refinery.  The fight was so profound that it was featured in 1971 in Life Magazine and resulted in the founding of an organization that ultimately became Save the Bay. Again, Durfee the trail blazer. In the 1980’s she helped to clean up the aftermath at Rhode Housing after widespread corruption was found. In 1991, Governor Bruce Sundlun named her Director of the Department of Environmental Management and just three years later, he fired her. So she ran against him in the Democratic primary for Governor.  Prev Next #35 Ron Machtley  Politician and University President Rhode Islanders were first introduced to Ron Machtley in 1988 when he traveled around Rhode Island with a pig named Lester “Less" Pork to point out the wasteful spending of then-Congressman Fred St. Germain. Machtley upset the 28-year veteran and Chairman of the House Banking Committee to take the Congressional seat. In 1994, he was the odds-on-favorite to win the Governorship, but was upset in the GOP primary by Lincoln Almond, who went on to serve eight years as Governor. After his defeat, he was the surprise choice to serve as President of then-Bryant College. At first appearances it was a strange choice, but Machtley could not have turned out to be a better selection. Under his leadership, the college transformed to a University, with massive improvements in the University’s campus, an elevation to Division I Sports, and an overall improvement in Bryant’s academic position.  When he assumed office Bryant had a $1.7 million operating deficit and a tiny endowment. Today, the University’s endowment is nearing $200 million. Over the past 20 years, Bryant has become one of the most improved higher education institutions in America.

Food & Wine honored Al Forno for launching 'a new era of ambitious cooking in Providence [in 1980] with their thin-crusted grilled pizzas topped with superfresh ingredients.' The editors singled out Al Forno's Margarita Pizza (with house-made pomodoro, fresh herbs, two cheeses and extra virgin olive oil) as the signature item. John Mariani, the food writer for Esquire put the new restaurant, Al Forno, on the national map by naming it the best new restaurant in America. Other food and travel magazines followed and the recognition transformed Providence, and as a result other mid-sized cities. Al Forno put Providence on the food map and sparked many other creative and smart chefs.

As GoLocal previously reported, the domino effect of Snowden’s absconding with federal data bases exposed the deficiencies of Altegrity’s vetting process. He has become more active as a philanthropist and is listed by Forbes richest in Rhode Island.   Prev Next #4 Dennis Littky Educator Littky is a rebel, a disruptor, an innovator, a trouble maker, and an educator.  They made a movie about him, Newsweek has featured his schools, President Obama talks about his schools and Bill and Melinda Gates gave him millions to grow, refine and scale is model of disruption. In 2009, Littky defied all and created an alternative college and by 2015 the Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education approved College Unbound as a degree-granting postsecondary option in the state. In Rhode Island, The Met School celebrated its 20th Anniversary this past week. Thousands of students who would not have finished high school have graduated and moved on to college, business and beyond. There may be no more accomplished innovator than Littky.   Prev Next #3 Bill and David Belisle Coaches Bill and David Belisle may be the best high school and youth coaches in history. Going by the statistics, the record of twenty-six consecutive state hockey championship (1978 to 2003) and a total of 32 may be a record never to be matched. Bill Belisle (the father) has coached at Mount for 42 years and his son David has been his assistant for years. The younger Belisle made national headlines with his post game speech to the Little League team he was coaching was defeated in the Little League World Series. Twice their players have been selected #1 in the NHL Draft, countless others played in the NHL, and dozens played college hockey. There are movies and books on the exploits of Mount Hockey under the Belisles.  Photo courtesy of Dave Belisle Prev Next #2 Nick Benson Artist  There are few people in the world that are recognized as the very best in their craft, but Nick Benson of the John Stevens Shop in Newport is globally recognized as the best stone cutter in the world.  Founded in 1705, The John Stevens Shop specializes in the design and execution of one-of-a-kind inscriptions in stone — the MLK Memorial, FDR’s Four Freedoms Park, and the inscription for the John F. Kennedy Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery, to name a few.  Benson won a Genius Fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation, and was recently featured on CBS news. The John Stevens Shop is one of America’s longest continuously running businesses.   Prev Next #1 Viola Davis Actor Davis is one of the most accomplished actors in the United States. She is the winner of two Tony awards, an Emmy and a SAG award as well as being nominated for an Oscar.  With regards to her Emmy, she became the first African-American to win the Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2015. Amazingly, she did not earn her SAG card until she was 30 years old. Davis self-describes that she grew up in abject poverty in Central Falls and worked her way to Rhode Island College and now beyond but has been a constant force in helping Central Falls to recover from its bankruptcy and rebuilding its spirit. She is a leading fundraiser for a range of Rhode Island causes.  Davis is the embodiment of the Rhode Island spirit and a model of how to overcome the greatest challenges to reach greatness.   Prev #50 #49 #48 #47 #46 #45 #44 #43 #42 #41 #40 #39 #38 #37 #36 #35 #34 #33 #32 #31 #30 #29 #28 #27 #26 #25 #24 #23 #22 #21 #20 #19 #18 #17 #16 #15 #14 #13 #12 #11 #10 #9 #8 #7 #6 #5 #4 #3 #2 #1 Next       Related Articles Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Donald Trump’s Emails and Pearl Harbor Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Making Voting Dangerously Easy; RI Corruption; & Con-Men Clerics Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: RR, PC’s Diversity Issues, New 6-10 Connector Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Animal Rights, Electoral College, and RI’s Jobless Rate Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: “Maybe Beggars, Such as Providence, Can’t be Choosers” Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Bikes, Bush, and Merger Mega-Healthcare Collapse Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Trump and Clinton, Raimondo’s CA Developer, and Warren’s Greatness Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: 6-10 Corridor, Trump and Clinton and Fall Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Legalizing Marijuana, Green Power, and Howard Johnson Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Catholic Church, Wells Fargo, and Rabbi Gutterman Bob Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Raimondo Re-Election, Elorza and Panhandling, and Assage Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Clinton, Russian Hackers, and CVS Pressure Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Innovation Campuses; Pushing Against Panhandling Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: RI Jobs, Breitbart News and the Supreme Court Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Amtrak’s Blockage, Fall River’s Amazon, & Clintons in Watch Hill Thursday - GoLocal LIVE Features Interviews with Feroce, Chafee, Read and Whitcomb Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Time for a Bipartisan Carbon Tax & Boston Hate Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Crazy Consultants and Immigrants Pull Down Wages Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Unwed Mothers Crisis; Go Vocational; and Privatize Union Station Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Hyberbolic Job Claims and Traffic Tribunal Traumas Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Providence Bankruptcy and Worcester’s Resurgence Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Raimondo Luring Jobs at a Price Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Shrinking New England, TF Green Spark & Banking with Trump Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Worcester Growth and Mafia Boredom Robert Whitcomb’s Digital Diary: Deal Delirium, Garden City Going Condo? and Trump Organization   Enjoy this post?

(File photo by The Associated Press) By RACHEL URANGA / STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Graphics For decades, trucking has provided big-rig driver Frank Mora and his family a decent living. He doesn’t expect that will last forever. Most major truck manufacturers and several well-funded startups are busy testing automated or driver-free vehicles. Test models of cars that will shoosh passengers around town without a human at the wheel have attracted much media attention. But it’s apparent that when driverless vehicles hit the road for real, they’ll be driven by commerce, and that means trucks will likely lead the pack. Mora, whose family has been in the trucking business for three decades, said he can easily understand the appeal of a machine that can be run 24 hours a day, without forced breaks for rest and with less labor. The technology is already out there. From completely driverless big rigs to platooned trucks that could be manned by a single driver and eventually automated, the testing is underway. “Sure, as an owner I could save a lot of money on wages,” he said. “As to whether I think it’s safer, it’s too soon to tell. I am sure that there are ... maneuvers that only humans can do.” Success for the technology could summon a seismic shift for California’s 218,000 truck and delivery drivers — 2.5 million across the nation — according to the latest count from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “This is not the far future,” said Xiao Yun Lu, a research engineer at Partners for Advanced Transportation Technology (PATH) at UC Berkeley. “This is the near future.” The economy churns on the goods truckers carry to markets, retail stores and, increasingly, directly to consumers. Many believe automation can make the business safer, cut operator costs and address intermittent shortages of truck drivers. “There is a very strong commercial motivation,” said Steven Shladover, a research engineer and manager at PATH. “(Trucks) are out there on the road all day and every day, unlike passenger vehicles which are parked 95 percent of the time. When people buy trucks, they are looking for a return on the investment.” For truckers like Mora, life will change. “There is nothing we can do to stop it or change it,” said 28-year-old driver Mora, who spent much of his childhood inside the cab of an 18-wheeler. “But with change, there is always opportunity.” Platoons lead the pack It’s already happening. • Otto, a subsidiary of Uber, tested an automated truck with a 120-mile beer run across Colorado last year. • Freightliner, a truck produced by Daimler Trucks North America, glided across the Hoover Dam in 2015. • Startup Starsky Robotics last week announced it is testing a kit for trucks that will allow big rigs to drive alone on highways, remotely controlled. While self-driving cars offer the prospect of making roads safer and reducing traffic, these hulking trucks promise commercial benefits that could hasten their development. “Platoons” could lead the pack. Volvo Trucks was one of six truck manufacturers that last year rolled out partially automated big rigs across Europe so regulators could test their ability to safely caravan. The testing went smoothly, but in Europe, as in the United States, regulators are still grappling with how to handle vehicles that soon won’t need humans. The technology, known as platooning, allows two or more cargo trucks to ride in tandem, talking to one another. It’s considered one of the lowest levels of automation, including some simple features already known to drivers of luxury vehicles, such as automated braking. Analysts believe platoons have the potential to come to market quicker because of fewer regulatory hurdles. Already several states have adopted legislation allowing variations. What’s the hurry? Savings. Platooned trucks drive tightly together, cutting as much as 20 percent in fuel costs, by some estimates. And one of trucking companies’ biggest expenses is what goes in the tank, according to an American Transportation Research Institute. Can these packs of trucks maneuver successfully without help from human hands? That’s one question Caltrans officials will be looking at when they oversee a federally backed test of a three-truck Volvo platoon, starting Wednesday. It will be the first time platoon driving will be tried in Southern California. The trial will focus on how safe these vehicles can be with other cars weaving in and out around them. “These trucks are not going to be taking away jobs,” said Aravind Kailas, a U.S.-based technology planner at Volvo. “It’s targeting safety to get on the road.” In the trials, drivers will sit behind the wheels of three 53-foot Volvo big-rig trucks. All will steer the vehicles, but the second and third driver won’t touch the gas or break pedal. The test will be similar to the drill staged in Rotterdam but with a much shorter route, along the 110 Freeway to the Port of Los Angeles, where hundreds of cargo-loading trucks stream in and out of daily. They will communicate through a complex system of radar, cameras and Wi-Fi. “What you are achieving when these trucks talk to one another is the ability to brake synchronously at the same time,” Kailas said. “If the first truck brakes, the second and third truck brake at the same time.” This won’t be a test for speed. None of the trucks will travel faster than 55 mph. “The No. 1 thing we want to show,” Kailas said, “is that this is a technology that is targeting safety,” Anxiety at the wheel “Everything is pretty much possible,” said Wokil Hayder, director of autonomous and automated driving for Volvo Trucks in Sweden, “but whether you want to do it is another thing.” As the technology barrels forward, some anxiety is evident among regulators and consumers alike. While a Consumer Technology Association poll found 70 percent of 2,001 people surveyed ready to test out an autonomous vehicle, a University of Michigan poll revealed less than 16 percent were willing to let the machines completely take over. California, where many of the startups pursuing the technology call home, has been slow to adopt autonomous vehicle regulations, while Michigan, home to the auto industry, has shot ahead. Headlines from last summer could stoke anxiety, too. The death of a man driving a Tesla Model S car in autopilot mode renewed concerns about the technology. After an investigation, U.S. regulators, however, found no evidence of defects. CEO Elon Musk, who operates a Tesla design center in Hawthorne as well as the SpaceX rocket-building facility, applauded the decision. What needs to happen before these vehicles are fully deployed is a “mindset change,” Hayder said. Motorists may fear sharing the road with “heavy, long big trucks” without drivers. But the long-range goal is to make robot-powered trucks safer than their human-steered counterparts. “We have a huge opportunity,” said Marques McCammon, general manager for connected vehicle solutions at Wind River, a subsidiary of Intel that has been developing software for self-driving vehicles. Smart vehicles, with more electronic eyes than humans, will have a greater ability to sense obstacles or other danger. New, “smarter” road systems that communicate with vehicles could “change the paradigm,” he said. In 2015, 35,092 people died in car accidents, according to the National Highway Safety Transportation Administration. The agency estimates 94 percent of all accidents were caused by human error. “Think about what this could mean for safety alone,” McCammon said. How long? Experts disagree about just how long it will take to get driverless big rigs on the road and just how human-free they will ever be. Platooning, for example, is a long way from robots at the wheel. Shladover estimates it could be decades. “All the truck drivers are not going to lose their jobs,” he said, “and there are a lot of other crazy predictions floating around out there. A transportation system doesn’t change that quickly. It takes a long time for vehicle fleets to turn over. “Even when we got a government mandate that all new vehicles have to be equipped with seat belts, it took 11 years to get up to 90 percent of the vehicles (in compliance),” he added. But plenty of folks are more bullish. The head of Connecticut-based transportation and logistics company XPO told a conference of maritime professionals in Long Beach last week that he expects to see driver-free trucks “everywhere” in the next decade. And Noel Perry, an economist specializing in freight, said he expects to see driverless trucks come online in 10 years and for platooning to be operational by 2020. That could eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, with median pay about $40,000 for each, according to the Department of Labor. That notion doesn’t sit well with Sam Loesche, a lobbyist for the Teamsters union, which represents about 40,000 truck and delivery drivers nationwide. “You can never be in a situation where you automate jobs overnight and expect that to be the best interest of the country,” Loesche said. “I don’t think we have even seen technology that is proven and reliable. “These drivers are the face of business,” he said. “They interact on a day-to-day basis with customers and their relationship strengthens brands. I would say anyone who writes off the role of the working class in this country ... does so at their own risk.” For Perry, the arrival of automated trucking is not a drama pitting jobs and families vs. a robotically enhanced bottom line. It’s simply where the business needs to be, he said. “It will mean trucking is cheaper and safer,” he said. ruranga@scng.com @racheluranga on Twitter Related Links Uber to offer autonomous cars in next few weeks -- with human backups Google expands testing grounds for driverless cars to Texas Self-driving cars are just the beginning Focus: Driverless cars Will robot cars drive traffic congestion off a cliff?

Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Members of the powerhouse legal team Alliance Defending Freedom are criticizing the assertion of dozens of American companies, including some of its largest, that boys who believe they are girls should be allowed in girls’ restrooms and shower rooms during their high school years. “Big business shouldn’t be advocating for boys to share the girls’ locker rooms and showers – and vice versa – in our public schools, and yet that’s precisely what these 53 companies are doing,” said Kerri Kupec, legal counsel with ADF. The companies submitted a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of transgenderism in a case at the U.S. Supreme Court Thursday, Gloucester County School Board v. G.G. The student, Gavin Grimm, a girl, is insisting on using boys’ restrooms on the basis of her “gender identity.” “What they should be supporting is the bodily privacy and dignity of all students, instead of simply disregarding the rights and reasonable concerns of many students and parents,” said Kupec. Kupec noted the companies say in their brief that they “recognize that employees cannot work as effectively when they are worried about how their children are being treated at school.” But the companies, Kupec said, are “completely unconcerned about the dad who knows his daughter has to change for gym with a boy in her locker room.” “Worse, the companies would characterize that dad as having a ‘lack of any reasoned justification’ for his concerns, as the brief puts it, or as having a lower ‘level of enlightenment,’ as some activists have revealingly stated. The first duty of school districts is to protect the bodily privacy rights of all of the students who attend their schools and to respect the rights of parents who understandably don’t want their children exposed in intimate changing areas.” “Outlasting the Gay Revolution” spells out eight principles to help Americans with conservative moral values counter attacks on our freedoms of religion, speech and conscience by homosexual activists The companies urging the Supreme Court to open restrooms nationwide include Affirm, Airbnb, Amazon, Apple, Asana, Box, Codecademy, Credo Mobile, Dropbox, Ebay, Etsy, Fastly, Flipboard, Gap, General Assembly Space, GitHub, IBM, Intel, Kickstarter, Knotel, LinkedIn, Lyft, M Booth, MAC Cosmetics, Mapbox, Marin Software, Massachusetts Mutual, Microsoft, Mitchell Gold, MongoDB, NetApp, Next Fifteen, Nextdoor, Pandora, Paypal, Postmates, RetailMeNot, Salesforce, Shutterstock, Slack Tech, Spotify, OutCast Agency, WhiteWave Foods, Tumblr, Twilio, Twitter, Udacity and Warby Parker. The companies contended there is no “reasoned justification” to prevent Grimm using the restroom of her choice. “By discriminating against and harming amici’s transgender employees, customers and their families, the policy, and similar policies and statutes that may arise if the policy is permitted to stand, threatens amici’s diverse and inclusive workplaces and their bottom lines. In light of the lack of an reasoned justification for the policy, and because of the significant adverse effects on the transgender community and resultant harm to amici, amici respectfully urge the court to determine that transgender students are protected by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.” Critics of that argument have pointed out it assumes that in 1972, when Congress adopted the law, members of the U.S. House and Senate intended to allow boys to use girls’ restrooms. In the Supreme Court case, which originated in Virginia, Grimm, a female who identifies as a male, is battling the Gloucester school board for requiring her to use the girls’ facilities. Last month, President Trump withdrew an executive order by former President Barack Obama requiring public schools to allow students to use facilities according to their “perceived gender.” Mathew Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, which has fought some of the transgender bathroom cases, said the move was significant. “Removing this lawless directive from the Obama administration will do a lot to get the federal government off the backs of these local schools,” said Staver, who says the Obama order put girls in vulnerable situations with biological males. He says the backlash by liberals and the media is unreasonable, as if “there is something horrible” that Trump did. “Frankly, he’s just following the law. The law does not include gender identity, or sexual orientation, or gender expression – or whatever you want to say – to the non-discrimination categories,” said Staver. Staver noted that Congress has rejected such efforts to amend Title IX to expand the application of non-discrimination policies. He further stated that the authors of Title IX and the 1964 Civil Rights Act had no intention of extending such protections.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 March 2017 by Military News Cisco (CSCO) Expands Its IoT Offerings Thanks to Jasper Shutterstock photo Cisco Systems Inc. ‚s CSCO stock has been a consistent performer in the last 12 months. While the Zacks Computer – Networking  industry gained 27.6%, shares of this technology giant recorded marginally better returns of 27.7%. This trend can primarily be attributed to improving revenues from subscription services as well as robust demand in the telecom sector. Meanwhile, the company is focusing on expanding its Internet of Things (IoT) division, as per a recent announcement at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona. Based on its acquisition of Jasper Technologies in Mar 2016 Cisco is aiming at becoming a major IoT platform provider going forward. Notably, the platform has emerged as one of the biggest monetization assets for Cisco given the burgeoning demand for IoT. At MWC, Cisco announced that itwill now provide support for narrowband IoT low-power wide-area network (LPWAN), which has applications in the industrial IoT space. Moreover, the company inked a partnership with car-maker Honda and Bright Box, a European connected-car platform which will enable Jasper to breath life into Bright Box’s infotainment centers that come as a standard fitting in many of Honda’s European car models. It was also announced at the event that Cisco will collaborate with Samsung and Jupl (a health data startup) to develop a wearable device targeted at the elderly for health monitoring purposes. What Does this Mean for Cisco? As of today, on the verge of one year completion, Cisco’s IoT unit has witnessed a whopping surge of 157% in enterprise customer additions, 135% increase in the number of devices that are being managed and a 42% advance in adoptions for Jasper’s Control Center product. As per an IDC report, the IoT market is estimated to reach a massive $1.7 trillion by 2020 with nearly 30 billion connected „things.” Given the huge potential the sector has to offer, the time is ripe to carve a niche and that’s exactly what Cisco is doing right now. Not surprisingly then, there is stiff competition in the space with the presence of major players such as Alphabet’s Google GOOGL , Microsoft MSFT , IBM, Intel, Siemens and AT&T. However, with these announcements, Cisco looks poised to take on the competition head on which augurs well for the company in the long run. Cisco Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus Cisco Systems, Inc.

Who needs tech when you have me? Image: REX/Shutterstock By Lance Ulanoff2017-03-04 22:21:53 UTC Vice President Mike Pence’s embarrassing use of an AOL email account is just another painful reminder of something that should be crystal clear to everyone: this administration doesn’t understand or care a lick about technology. It’s an especially painful reality as we come off the high of an administration’s 8-year-love affair with technology and social media. They held Maker Fairs on the White House Lawn, for heaven’s sake. Former President Barack Obama personally fired a marshmallow canon during the White House science fair. Obama was so enthralled by technology and innovation that he made it a centerpiece of his 2013 State of the Union Address.  Can you even imagine Donald Trump mentioning 3D-printing? SEE ALSO: What one video game developer organization is doing to combat Trump’s immigration ban Donald Trump has what can only be characterized as an open antipathy toward technology and innovation. He rarely uses either of those words, and is so fixated on bringing back antiquated industries that rely on outmoded technology, he rarely casts his eyes forward. If ever. Trump sees technology as just another rhetorical weapon. In other words: only worth using when it can be aimed in an attack. He spent much of the past year railing against Hillary Clinton’s improper use of a personal email account, and the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee. Aside from appointing Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer, as his cyber security czar, and a terse, awkward December meeting with Tech CEOs, mentions of any form of technology and innovation have faded into the background.  We shouldn't be surprised. His very first speech as President of the United States made it clear that tech wasn't on the agenda. Trump’s inauguration speech was nearly tech-free, in fact. There was one mention of “technologies of tomorrow,” which is vague enough to mean nothing. In his more recent speech before a joint session of congress, there was definitely zero mentions of technology or innovation. Of course, you could fairly argue that few humans have used social media to greater effect than President Trump. He understands this narrow slice of technology, and embraces it. There's an argument to be made that it helped him win the highest office in the land.  On the other hand, his and his staff’s use of the platform borders on abuse. There are constant flubs, misspellings, and deletions—deletions of what should be part of public record. Dan Scavino, the President’s Director of Social Media, seems more interested in pumping up his boss and his policies than in creating a digital window to the administration. Trump’s policies are, to be charitable, anti-tech. There’s his FCC appointment which will probably kill Net Neutrality and squelch innovation by smaller startups that could get nudged out of site on a pay-to-play Internet And then there’s the HB-1 visa situation. Trump’s blanket attacks on immigration have thrown this pipeline for global tech talent into disarray. There was, during the congressional speech, just a hint that Trump may be turning around on this. “Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families—including immigrant families—enter the middle class.” It's just hard not to wish he'd come out and said something about attracting skilled workers to the U.S. He didn’t, and I don’t think he will. Instead, Trump will keep banging the drum loudly for the return of 19th and 20th-centruy industries like steel and, especially, coal.  Oddly, Trump can never acknowledge that the only way coal comes back is with more automation (technology), and fewer human employees. Then again, it's not exactly a winning message. Even if Trump weren’t anti-technology, his lack of interest in the subject is a blow to those who believe in innovation, and a bad example for young people who see a leader uninterested in breakthroughs, or the gadgets they love.  He’s not one of us. He’s the luddite dad who won’t use email, doesn’t get Snapchat, and keeps grousing about the death of 35 mm film. Things would be better if Trump were balanced, at least a little bit, by a Vice President who cared about the tech space.  Needless to say, that isn't Mike Pence, apparent AOL email fan and hack victim. Sure, his emails weren’t as highly sensitive as Hillary Clinton's (who, yes, should've known better), but some are sensitive enough that the current governor won’t just hand them over.  Maybe Trump talks so little about technology because he’s laser-focused on jump-starting the economy with infrastructure projects. And yes: Infrastructure's important. It can be a huge driver in the economy. But infrastructure projects of this century will rely on technology. Project managers may be carrying iPads or Surface Pros, not pen and paper. Architectural plans will be worked out on computer. Those buildings bridges, roads and tunnels will be modeled in 3D and walked through via VR long before the first layer of concrete is poured. Has Trump or Pence ever tried VR? I’m betting they haven’t. I bet they’ve never even seen AR.  The one bright spot: Trump has left the U.S. Digital Service, formed under Obama, pretty much alone. It's like a skunkworks, quietly operating as part of the Executive Office of the President (!) and still posting on its Medium Blog. The only reason it survives? Best guess is that Trump's budget proposal hasn't made it to Congress. Yet. In Trump’s first month in office, there was one big tech moment. Perhaps you remember it. Trump hosted Intel CEO Brain Krzanich at the White House in February. Krzanich was there to announce a $7 billion dollar investment in the company’s new Arizona fab. “Fab 42 is an investment in Intel, but also the U.S.’s future in innovation and leadership in the semiconductor industry,” he said.  After Krzanich spoke, Trump motioned toward the silicon wafer sample Krzanich brought with him. Trump:  Thank you, Brian.  And you have something over there.  Show a little bit about the new product. Krzanich:  This is an example of the wafer that will be built in Fab 42.  This is one of our newest 10-nanometer silicon wafers.  Seven-nanometers will be built in Fab 42.  And this is the future of computing. Trump:  That's great, thanks.  Do you have any questions for Brian?” It was clear Trump had no idea what that wafer is used for and, to be honest,  likely didn’t care. Trump was happy to have another CEO pay fealty to him, and show the world that he’s keeping jobs in America. Which is a good thing—but let's be real: Trump wouldn’t care if the jobs were at Intel or United State Steel. He just doesn’t care about technology.  BONUS: Behold, the Trump mask.

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 4, 2017 at 5:06PM NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1080 GPU can power the latest video games and help doctors diagnose brain tumors. Image source: NVIDIA Corporation.  NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GeForce graphics cards have been its largest driver of growth in the past. Now, the same GPUs that have powered video games are being used by companies to process and analyze data. Companies are using deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to teach computers to learn a task without human aid. It's a process that requires a massive amount of computation in real time, and the powerful GPUs are the only processors up to the task. A global economic opportunity The largest tech companies like Amazon.com, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Facebook have used GPUs to process image and voice recognition. Demand for these applications has been the first phase of growth for NVIDIA's data center segment. According to NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, the next phase of growth will come from companies spanning retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and life sciences, among others. Retailers are processing data with deep learning to better connect shoppers with an item they might want to buy. For example, Houzz -- an online interior design company -- has created a system that can recognize furniture and accessories from a photo and tell the person where to get those items for their home. If retailers can benefit from this technology, imagine what this will do for marketing. It will be harder than ever for consumers to avoid spending money as marketers use deep learning to know what you want before you want it. In healthcare, researchers running a computer system powered by NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1080 GPU are processing brain tumor tissue samples to help surgeons reduce the patient's wait time for diagnosis. Typically during surgery, it takes 30 to 40 minutes for the surgeon to send the tissue sample to the lab for processing, but a new system using deep learning is helping to dramatically reduce the wait time to only three minutes. It's still a work in process, but so far the system has a 90% accuracy rate over 30 samples. Deep learning and AI is also being used for robotics in manufacturing. Berkshire Hathaway's ISCAR metalworking business is a good example of how manufacturers are using robotics and AI to run automated factories. NVIDIA's Jetson TX1 developer board -- a circuit board the size of a credit card -- can process live data from sensors and cameras to make drones and robots smarter. In transportation, NVIDIA has recently announced partnerships with Volkswagen AG's Audi and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz to develop self-driving cars. Automakers will rollout self-driving cars this year that can partially drive by themselves, but will need human assistance. By 2020, more advanced levels of autonomy will be introduced where a car will be able to drive itself in all circumstances except conditions like severe weather. Autosuppliers such as Bosch and Germany's ZF have also partnered with NVIDIA. ZF is one of the largest suppliers in the auto industry and the leading supplier to Europe's trucking industry. ZF is using its own self-driving system -- called ZF ProAI -- based on the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 AI car computer. The ZF ProAI computer will launch in 2018 and will provide self-driving capability for commercial vehicles, such as forklifts and trucks, in the agriculture and mining industries. The GPU revolution NVIDIA likes to call the current rapid adoption of deep learning and AI a new industrial revolution. More specifically, we are in a GPU revolution. The graphics card is the new CPU as companies are using advanced computer systems and algorithms powered by GPUs to process massive amounts of data in real-time that a CPU cannot handle. As Intel powered the PC revolution of the 1980s and 1990s, NVIDIA is powering the deep learning revolution. Recently, the NVIDIA segments that are benefiting from enterprise adoption of GPUs -- automotive and data center -- are showing high rates of growth, but these segments are still small as a percentage of NVIDIA's total revenue.  The combined revenue of automotive and datacenter was 19% of NVIDIA's total revenue over the last four quarters. The automotive segment has been growing anywhere from about 30% to 60% year over year, which is parallel to the gaming segment. In contrast, data center growth has been tripling year over year in the last two quarters.   When we consider all the ways businesses are utilizing deep learning and AI across different sectors of the economy, NVIDIA may just be scratching the surface of its market opportunity.

Around 100,000 people come to Spain every February to wheel and deal, to meet and greet, to handle the latest smartphones, and to find out what next year's technologies will be. This year, we saw a slew of phones, tablets, and even laptops. While Samsung tried to crash the party by pre-announcing its Galaxy S8 event for March 29th, it didn't reduce the buzz on the show floor as LG, Huawei, and even BlackBerry announced their new flagships. After three days of pre-briefings and show floor wandering, we chose eight products that represent the best of what we saw. Here are our picks. LG G6 LG's refined, well-built G6 was the elegant star of the show. LG stepped away from the modular concept of last year's G5 to deliver what consumers really want: something waterproof, with great battery life and deep colors on the biggest screen you can comfortably use with just one hand. As we've been using the G6 this week, its wide-angle camera has come in handy over and over again to capture show floor vistas. The G6 is a no-nonsense, broad spectrum hit that clearly stands above the other phones at the show. Alcatel A5 LED Alcatel's A5 LED is the most fun phone we've seen in years. In a world dominated by similar slabs, the A5's pulsing, customizable LED back can become a music visualizer or be themed to match your wardrobe. Even better, the back is replaceable with a big boom box speaker or add-on battery, bringing last year's modular concept down to affordable phones. Where most sub-$200 phones look and feel a little dull, the A5 LED is all personality and thrill. Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 The S Pen is back! Samsung enlivened its Galaxy Tab line by bringing in its Wacom pen technology, making it a true Android-powered alternative to Apple's iPad Pro lineup. The Tab S3 amps up entertainment with quad speakers and boosts its overall specs to current levels, but its best feature is the pen. Samsung's solid build quality and balance of creative and entertainment features make this the best Android tablet we've seen in a long while. Huawei Watch 2Smartwatches are strugglers, but fitness trackers are doing well. Huawei shows an intelligent understanding of this trend with the Watch 2, which features continuous heart rate monitoring and special apps that help you design a customized training program. The Watch 2 is fully waterproof to the usual IP68 standard, and is running the latest Android Wear 2.0 with its standalone app store. It's a solid reintroduction for Google's Android-centric wearable line. Porsche Design Book One We didn't expect to see a high-end Surface Book competitor at Mobile World Congress, but we were impressed with Porsche Design's first venture into laptops. Starting at $2,495, the Book One shows off Intel's best technology in a sleek, all-metal Porsche Design body, with a Kaby Lake Core i7 and all the right ports: Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, USB-A, and microSD. Its swiveling, detachable, super-high-res screen delivers more flexibility in more modes than any other laptop out there. Porsche Design doesn't do broad product lines, and if you're going to have one laptop, this is a great statement to make. Staedtler Noris Digital for Samsung Tablets Most styli are round or slightly flattened pieces of plastic or metal. They have no soul. But Staedtler's new S Pen for Samsung's tablet line (and its Galaxy Note phones, if you have one) feels like a real pencil, with the classic hexagonal shape and waxy coating. The fine rubber tip has a better grip on the screen than plastic tips do, a little more like a traditional pencil's drag. It evokes analog feelings when you're creating digital art. Samsung Home Modem for Verizon Europeans at MWC (and T-Mobile's CTO ) don't understand why we're so excited about this, but anyone who has only one, overpriced option for home broadband in the US will get why Samsung's nondescript box is so thrilling. Home broadband competition in the US is moribund, and cable companies rule the day. Verizon and AT&T's upcoming pre-5G rollouts are the best bet to shake up that industry, lowering prices and improving competition. Putting this box on your windowsill will be the key to that new world. Motorola Moto Mod Concepts Motorola keeps showing that its detachable Moto Mod idea isn't just a fad, and it has committed to releasing a bunch of Mods over the course of this year. Here at the show, we got some ideas of how broad the Moto Mod functionality could get. There's one which adds Amazon Alexa to your phone, a glass wireless charging back, LED interactive back covers, a gamepad, a printer, a multi-SIM mod, and even a mod that turns your phone into a robot. While few of these seem to be close to being sold soon, we want to see all of them on the market. This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.

According to a market filing on Saturday, Mubadala sold shares worth $613.4m on the public market in the Nasdaq-listed multinational known for developing computer processors and related technologies. Mubadala said the sale equated to 45 million AMD shares – nearly a third of the UAE company’s 142 million shareholding. The company said it planned to hold the remaining 97 million shares it owns in AMD, meaning even after the sale it will remain its largest single shareholder. It is followed by the US-based asset management company BlackRock, which currently owns an 8.69 per cent stake. AMD, formerly known as Advanced Micro Devices, is the second largest supplier in the world of standard computer microprocessors after its main rival Intel. Mubadala first invested in AMD back in 2007. The company said that it had decided to realise some of its investment in the company and would use the cash for further opportunistic investment. Shares in AMD fell 7.09 per cent on Friday after falling 6.26 per cent on Thursday, marking a sharp dip at the end of a bull run for the stock which has continued since the end of last year and reached a 10-year high on Tuesday. Analysts put the decline down to a poor review of the company’s Ryzen 7 chip. "This is in line with our strategy, as a long-term investor, to monetise certain assets at a time of significant gain in value. We continue to believe strongly in AMD and remain a significant shareholder in the company," said Brian Lott, a spokesman at Mubadala Development Company. lbarnard@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Technology Electric car on 34,000km road trip recharges at Dubai International Review: Bose QC30 in-ear headphones are a sound choice Mubadala sells $600m-plus worth of shares in computer company AMD The two sides of Elon Musk are drawn from Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison MOST VIEWED Business | All Youngest Emirati female pilot flies A380 as Emirates turns attention to women – video Smaller Dubai malls feel the pinch of saturation as mega shopping centres dominate Tenders set to be issued for Abu Dhabi’s Midfield Terminal project The six key items on the Saudi economy’s to-do list for 2017, from expat fees to prepping Aramco UAE superyacht builder set to go even larger IEA warns of looming oil supply crunch as industry leaders gather in Houston Sheikh Hazza visits Midfield Terminal at Abu Dhabi Airport - in pictures Emaar chairman hopes for better year after tough 2016 for Dubai developer Al Futtaim targets rising retail demand with new mall in Jebel Ali area UAE growth could reach 4 per cent this year, says Minister of Economy More Most Viewed Youngest Emirati female pilot flies A380 as Emirates turns attention to women – video Major delays for Dubai commuters with up to ten road accidents reported It’s all too easy for teens to buy dokha in Dubai and Sharjah Two dead and 11 injured in Dubai crash The Debt Panel: Dubai aviation employee too stressed to eat or sleep over Dh170,000 debts Smaller Dubai malls feel the pinch of saturation as mega shopping centres dominate Exclusive: US Rapper Silento can fly out of Dubai after travel ban lifted Antonio Conte finds no weakness in N’Golo Kante as ‘focused’ Chelsea regain 10 point lead Qasr Al Hosn to open in 2018 after renovation work UAE weather: rain sweeps away and fog rolls in More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Fuel for Thought: Cheapest solar power in the world?

HIDESHOW NAVIGATION Top Stories Governor Senate Congress Harrisburg Features Search for: PA-13: Boyle Calls for Investigation Into Claims Russia is Blackmailing Trump Written by Nick Field, Managing Editor Congressman Brendan Boyle wants to get to the bottom of claims that Russia is blackmailing President-Elect Donald Trump. “If true, the intelligence report outlining allegations of Russia’s possession of compromising personal and financial information about President-elect Donald Trump is beyond unsettling and sheds great light on Mr. Trump’s oddly sympathetic approach to Russia and its meddling in our election, as determined by our intelligence community,” Rep. Boyle stated. “If substantiated or verified, I will call for a formal, bipartisan congressional investigation into these scandalous and disturbing allegations.” As reported by CNN, a two-page addendum on the matter was included in the latest briefing for President Obama, President-Elect Trump and Congressional leaders. The thirty-five page dossier, compiled by a former member of British Intelligence, was then released by Buzzfeed. While the information has not been verified, it has been deemed credible. While I know there are some salacious details in the Intel report, it's important people focus on the explosive charge re: Trump lawyer 1/2 — Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) January 11, 2017 If Intel report is true, it would be the most treacherous and criminal act in US political history. Congress must investigate immediately. — Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) January 11, 2017 This is NOT about R or D! I mean does anyone think this would ever be an issue with John McCain? Or Romney? Or both Bushes? Of course not. — Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) January 11, 2017 Boyle currently sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The 13th Congressional District represents Northeast Philadelphia and Southern Montgomery County.

Very corrupt, it won’t work. Cooked lying don at it again… Deplorable One says: January 12, 2017 at 5:11 pm Brendan is an A-Hole. He’s working off the Hillary talking points from October of 2016, as it is still Hill (liar)ry versus Trump, in re a lead-up to November 8. He backed Anti-Catholic Hillary. I thought Brendan was Catholic? But it is all irrelevant if your a democrat because your beholden to Socialist Brother Barry O. Oh, wasn’t scam-artist SETH KAPLAN (FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE SOMERTON CIVIC ASSOCIATION) a good buddy to the Boyle Brothers? Google old Seth to see how he scammed the good/kindly people of SOMERTON in a theft of services scam (that he used to rip off the Non-Profit). Maybe Seth did that because of Vladimer Putin? Nothing is the fault of a Democrat? tommyd says: January 12, 2017 at 3:38 pm Guzzardi – Everyone else is saying the man behind the dossier is Christopher Steele, a highly-regarded MI6 Russia expert who now runs Orbis Business Intelligence. Or used to. He is now in hiding since his identity was revealed. tommyd says: January 12, 2017 at 3:27 pm Hang on to your fantasies, Trumpers, they won’t last much longer. Parts of the dossier are being confirmed. Patrick says: January 12, 2017 at 2:54 pm HA HA HA!!! Little too eager there son. FAKE NEWS!!! bungy says: January 12, 2017 at 2:41 pm Piggy, your BACK.

Peggy says: January 12, 2017 at 2:11 pm Can President Obama sue the Donald for fake news about his birth certificate? Can Hillary sue the Donald for fake news about paying protestors to protest for Donald? Fake news – now where did that originate? Donald Trump. Hold on to your seats everyone we are in for a ride of your life and I do mean life. I have a question – who wants the Donald to take a Drug Test? I do! Robert Guzzardi says: January 12, 2017 at 1:37 pm The Sordid History of the Firm Behind the Trump-Russia Dossier Meet Fusion GPS. 7:15 AM, JAN 12, 2017 | By MARK HEMINGWAY Thursday’s New York Times has a report on how the highly suspicious dossier alleging that Donald Trump was compromised by Russian intelligence agents came into existence. Among the other interesting revelations was that the dubious opposition research report was put together by the research firm Fusion GPS: The story began in September 2015, when a wealthy Republican donor who strongly opposed Mr. Trump put up the money to hire a Washington research firm run by former journalists, Fusion GPS, to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate’s past scandals and weaknesses, according to a person familiar with the effort. The person described the opposition research work on condition of anonymity, citing the volatile nature of the story and the likelihood of future legal disputes. The identity of the donor is unclear. What’s interesting about this revelation is that Fusion GPS has an institutional reputation for doing shoddy and underhanded political work, and nearly all of it has been at the behest of Democrats looking to attack Republicans. In 2012, Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel did some blockbuster reporting on Fusion GPS’s alarming efforts to dig up dirt on donors to Mitt Romney and socially conservative causes: Robert Guzzardi says: January 12, 2017 at 1:18 pm Good idea.

The design group has other tech in its product portfolio such as the Huawei Mate 9 and this $3,000 sound bar, but the Book One, which was teased at Computex last year, is its first computer. It's also the world's first two-in-one to be both a detachable and a convertible. Detachables like Microsoft's Surface Book have removable keyboards that allow the screen to be used as a standalone tablet. In the case of the Book One, it's a 13.3-inch tablet with a 3,200x1,800-pixel resolution display with support for Windows Ink so you can write and draw on the screen. Porsche Design What the Surface Book can't do is stay attached to its keyboard and rotate up to 360 degrees on its hinges like a convertible such as the Lenovo Yoga line or Dell's two-in-one XPS 13. The Book One's clever cog-wheel hinges -- a design inspired by the transmission of a sports car -- allow the system to be quickly used as a tablet or a clamshell laptop or anything in between. Or you can just detach the screen entirely and use it as a tablet. Inside is a seventh-generation Intel Core i7-7500U processor, 16GB of RAM, and an Intel 512GB PCIe solid-state drive. Ports include three USB-C ports, one of which is Thunderbolt 3, and two full-size USB 3.0 ports. Plus, there's an infrared camera that lets you use Windows Hello to log on with facial recognition. There's even a magnetic holder on the right side of the tablet for its stylus. 7 Porsche Design's Book One is both a convertible and detachable 2-in-1 PC If you want a Book One, you'll only have to wait until April, when it will be available from Porsche Design stores and select retailers including NewEgg.com where you can preorder it now. The price is set at $2,495, which roughly converts to £2,000 or AU$3,250.

The ThinkPad E570 is so traditional it borders on retro. It will please laptop conservatives. If you need greater mobility, look elsewhere. Lenovo ThinkPad E570 at a glance: For: Configurable Latest processor Against: Heavy Large Build quality Maybe: No touch screen Removable battery Verdict: Mid-price large screen laptop. Will appeal to small business owners. Price: From NZ$1100. Review model NZ$1300. Website: Lenovo NZ By 2017 standards, the Lenovo ThinkPad E570 is bulky. The review model weighs 2.4Kg. It measures 376 by 262 by 34 mm at its widest, broadest and deepest. Part of the heft is because the case includes a large, bright 15.6-inch display and a DVD drive. There's a lot of plastic around the edge of the screen. Indeed, there's a lot of black plastic full stop. It's chunky and robust which adds protection but you'll need a backpack to move it. Another reason for the bulk is the battery and studs rise the base a few millimetres off a desktop. This gives breathing room so air can flow through vents. There's also a heavy-duty fan vent on the left side of the case too. Rough in places An E at the start of a product number indicates the E570 is from the lower-price ThinkPad range. That means you get a lower quality finish than you'd find on more expensive models. It's a little rough in places and the matt black plastic picks up smudges with a vengeance. The front of the lid doesn't sit flush with the bottom part of the computer. This makes it easier to open. The hinge has a small amount of give, but nothing to trouble anyone. While the case is not pretty, it does look like Lenovo made the computer to do business. If you like the red and black ThinkPad look, you'll be happy with the effect. Desktop replacement Given size and weight, you won't want to carry the E570 all the time. If portability is important get something else. It makes a fine desktop replacement that can travel at a pinch. A big case means there's room for a full-size keyboard and numeric keys. The layout takes getting used to. A week or two of reviewing was not enough time to master the keyboard idiosyncrasies. Among other things, having two backspace and one delete key in the top right corner is strange. Also odd is the off centre touchpad and the small space bar. TouchPad Because there's no touchscreen, you'll use the touchpad a lot. It's small by 2017 standards. The little red signature ThinkPad cursor joystick is some compensation. In practice the touchpad is erratic, that could be a Windows 10 driver problem. If you owned this computer and used it often, trackpad aside, all these things, would be no trouble after a few weeks. The lack of a keyboard backlight is disappointing. As already mentioned, there is no touchscreen. The display is 1366 by 768 HD format. There is a FHD 1920 by 1080 model that, at the moment, costs $100 more than the review computer. It comes with a faster processor and a better video card, that's a lot of extra value for $100. One minor worry about the display is that the default setting is 100 percent brilliance. While that's fine, there's nothing extra for when you need a boost. Video and everyday Windows apps work fine with the display. It's not state-of-the-art, but its good considering the price tag. Kaby Lake The review model has an Intel i5 7200U processor running at 2.5GHz. That's a Kaby Lake chip or the seventh generation of Core processors. Intel says they are faster than last year's processors, enough for users to notice. They are video optimised and should be more power efficient. Lenovo says you can get eight hours on a single charge. As always, the manufacturer's claim is pushing it. In practice, it works for a little over six hours before power supply nagging starts. Battery life isn't so vital in a computer that will sit on a desk most of the time. There's a DVD drive, which feels anachronistic, but will please many users. There are three USB ports — again, that pleases some users not others. Lenovo also includes HDMI, Ethernet, a multi-format card reader and an audio jack. Old fashioned Despite a state-of-the-art processor, the ThinkPad E570 is, in many ways, old-fashioned. It's been a long time since a review non-touch Windows PC with a hard drive instead of SSD has turned up here. The question is how the specification trade-offs work with value for money. The biggest downside is the quality of finish. You can find better-made computers at the same price, although they may not have the same mix of features. At first sight it looks as if Lenovo charges a premium for its 15.6 inch display. On a more positive note, you get a lot of processor performance for your money. It would be a good choice if you crunch numbers on a spreadsheet all day. It's clear the $1400 top of the line model with a Core i7 processor, higher resolution screen and better graphics card is better value. This is a promotional price and may not be available for long. You might want to swap the 1TB hard drive for a 256GB SSD, that would add around $170 to the list price. Not everyone prizes slim and light over big screens, full keyboards and processor power. The Lenovo ThinkPad E570 isn't for the kind of person who works from cafés or airport lounges. There are many who still want DVD drives. This will hit the spot for some demographics.

The U.S. is producing less air pollution, but smog levels are still rising in the western U.S. because of pollutants released in Asian countries that then drift over the Pacific Ocean. Researchers say their findings show the importance of a global approach to preserving air quality. http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/03/518323094/rise-in-smog-in-western-u-s-is-blamed-on-asias-air-pollution Omega-3 oils could tackle damage caused by air pollution, research shows.

Unusual weather in the Southwest could cause a nationwide salad shortage later this month. But thats just the tip of the iceberg (lettuce): Scientists say the weird weather is probably caused by climate change which means these sorts of problems are likely to happen again. The shortage, first reported by NPR, is the result of two separate phenomena in Arizonas Yuma County and Californias Salinas Valley https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/03/what-climate-change-has-to-do-with-the-price-of-your-lettuce/?utm_term=.1913d5d3480f Top Trump Advisers Are Split on Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The White House is fiercely divided over President Trumps campaign promise to cancel the Paris agreement, the 2015 accord that binds nearly every country to curb global warming, with more moderate voices maintaining that he should stick with the agreement despite his campaign pledge. Antarctic Sea Ice Sets Record Low, Providing Another Mystery for Scientists. Warming at the South Pole hits record high as sea ice shrinks, a departure from its record high only a few years ago.

Rain has replenished the states reservoirs, but groundwater remains depleted. After four ruinously dry years, California is now swimming in water. But by some measures, the state also remains immersed in its worst drought in 20 years. That strange situation is explained by the fact that there are multiple ways to gauge drought. https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-end-to-californias-drought-isnt-cut-and-dried-1488537007 The drought in Washington, D.C., is now just as bad as Californias.

They have a deep as a coordinator buddy name of Matt Patricia in New England whose awesome. He has. The best third down defense. And is that because of statistics it's because of the creativity. Now I'm sure coach Belichick comes and say hey I would like to do this I like to do that now. Here's your creative control.

BEIJING: Several decades ago, the returning Chinese students from overseas studies were mostly out of patriotism to revive the homeland, now they are back for opportunities to fully develop their potential. The reasons behind the back-flow vary. But they all derive from one simple fact: an ever-stronger China, both economically and culturally, is becoming increasingly charming. "I took only 3 minutes to make my final decision," said Zhang Ji, a Chinese returnee from Canada, while recalling the life-changing moment when he made up his mind to return to China to start up his own business. Zhang returned to China in 2009, bringing back a world-leading heart valve implantation system. After a 30-minute presentation, Zhang received an investment of 10 million yuan from domestic entrepreneurs, strong policy support of the local government as well as the green light from the authorities. But opportunities always coexist with challenges. The road to success back in the homeland is not all rosy. Dedicating himself to medical device innovation, research and development in China, Zhang found it hard to update his medical license in Canada in a timely manner, which means he has to give up his well-paid job there. In Canada, he could earn in five days what he gets paid in China in a month. Some of Zhang's friends didn't understand why he chose to return to China, saying he made a "silly" choice. But Zhang thought otherwise. "Yes, I quit an 'iron rice bowl' job, but I get an opportunity to fulfill my dreams, to start up my own business," Zhang said. Confident about the potential clinical and market value to be generated by his advanced technology, Zhang believes his business has a "boundless prospect." In contrast with Zhang's highly efficient "3-minute" decision-making, Li Peixiang took quite some time to make up his mind to go back to China. After all, Li had already made his mark in Canada's biological material industry after over 20 years of endeavor. His ABM company has been identified by the Canadian government as one of the five most promising companies in Vancouver. With a mindset of having a try, Li participated in the Nanjing "321 Talents Program" in late 2012. After being successfully recruited, Li soon received the investment and subsidies from the local government, and the expertise and insights in biological materials of many local officials and investors also impressed him much. After making the first step, Li started to build a bigger ambition for the years to come. He set up another new company in Zhenjiang, a city in the eastern Jiangsu Province. "I hope the company's sales achievement could reach 100 million yuan and be listed on the stock market in five years," Li said. "I can go home next month," said Cao Zuonan, an ecology graduate student at Germany's University of Tuebingen, while walking out of the supervisor's office joyfully. His graduation design program -- research on the experimental methodology of the nutrient in the Chinese Qinghai-Tibet Plateau soil -- has just been approved by his supervisor and he is about to return to China to collect soil samples. Cao, born in the 1990s, spent the first 18 years of his life in Xining city of Qinghai Province. He had always longed for the magnificent plateau in his hometown during his study in Germany. He made up his mind go to Germany for further studies when he was at college and then to return to China, because it is his unshakable faith to dedicate himself to environmental protection. "I have to be grateful! I have been thinking about how I can pay back to my parents, my fellow countrymen and the land that has brought me up since the start of my college time," said Cao passionately. Ding Xianfeng still relishes his decision of leaving the Silicon Valley to join Huawei. "If I did not quit the job of sensor system platform architect at Intel and returned to serve as director and chief scientist at Huawei's sensor lab, I would not become a leader in the world's sensor industry," said Ding proudly. Huawei, one of the top three research companies for mobile application sensors, enjoys an enormous competitive edge. "Compared to working in the United States, my influence on the development of the sensor industry in the world has grown hundreds of times ... I represent purchaser who needs sensors that worth 2 billion US dollars," Ding told Xinhua. Many returnees said they went back to China because of the "glass ceilings," meaning foreigners can never climb to the top of the ladder no matter how talented and hard-working they are. "Only when you are back in China can you make core strategies," said Ding repeatedly.

FourBridges is the only firm headquartered in Tennessee to make the Axial Advisor 100 list, which features "the buyside's most referred middle market banks and advisory firms." Axial's list is based on a nationwide survey that asked more than 1,000 private equity firms, strategic acquirers and family offices to name the advisers they trusted most when transacting in the middle market. "We're pleased that our work has been recognized on a national basis by the Axial survey, and we're honored to be listed among the ranks of other well-respected firms like Raymond James, Harris Williams and Houlihan Lokey," said Andy Stockett, managing director of FourBridges. Based in Chattanooga, FourBridges represents business owners who are thinking about selling their company, making an acquisition, or refinancing. Stockett said the firm is currently working on six engagements. Hhgregg to close 40 percent of stores Electronics retailer Hhgregg will close 40 percent of its stores as it works to stem the red ink and turn around slow sales. In addition to the 88 stores, the Indianapolis-based retailer is also closing distribution centers in Maryland, Florida and Pennsylvania, it said Thursday. HhGregg will keep open its Chattanooga store in East Brainerd, as company CEO Robert Riesbeck said the closing stores are unprofitable or located in areas that are no longer shopping destinations. "We feel strongly that the markets we will remain in are the right ones for our customers and our business model. Our team is dedicated to moving forward and being a profitable 132- store, multiregional chain where we will continue to be a dominant force in appliances, electronics and home furnishings," he said. The 88 stores are expected to close by mid-April, eliminating about 1,500 jobs, Hhgregg said. Hhgregg said last month it hired a financial adviser and investment banker to pursue a range of potential strategic and financial transactions to help it find ways to get back to profitability. The announcement came a month after Hhgregg reported a 22 percent drop in sales at stores open at least 14 months — mostly due to weak consumer electronics sales — during the quarter that ended in December. Mercedes recalls 1 million vehicles Mercedes is recalling about 1 million cars and SUVs worldwide because a starter part can overheat and cause fires. The recall covers certain C-Class, E-Class and CLA cars and GLA and GLC SUVs, all from 2015 through 2017, including nearly 308,000 in the U.S. The German automaker reported 51 fires worldwide, with about 30 in the United States. The company has no reports of any injuries. Mercedes said in U.S. government documents released Friday that if for some reason the engine and transmission won't turn over, a current limiter in the starter motor can overheat from repeated attempts to start the vehicles. That can cause the current limiter to overheat and melt nearby parts. Owners will be notified this month and again when replacement parts are available in July. It will take about an hour for dealers to install another fuse to prevent the problem. The repair will be done free of charge. Duke annual meeting to be conducted online CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The largest U.S. electric company says its annual shareholders meeting in May will be its first without a physical gathering, with all business conducted and questions answered only online. Duke Energy Corp. said Friday the live video webcast on May 4 will make the meeting accessible to 1 million shareholders worldwide. Dozens of companies including Hewlett- Packard and Intel have replaced in-person conclaves with virtual meetings. Advocates say they allow more shareholders to participate at lower cost. Critics say the format allows corporations to select the topics its executives want to address and scrub out tough questions. Duke Energy's shareholders meetings have long involved protests ranging from tea party groups to environmentalists. CEO Lynn Good faced tough questioning about a massive coal ash spill during the Charlotte utility's 2014 meeting.
