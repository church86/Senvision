China gets creative By Zhu Shenshen | December 19, 2016, Monday | Print Edition CHINA’S consumer electronics industry was awash with new ideas and many surprises in 2016. Domestic products appeared with unique designs and popular features, sending a clear signal that the market is shifting from “Made in China” to “Create in China.” Still, foreign manufacturers haven’t given up the ghost. Long queues awaited the new iPhone and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor elicited heavy promotion in China. US-based Apple and Qualcomm remain the two most profitable firms in the smartphone industry, even though China is the world’s biggest market and manufacturing base for the phones. It all reminds me of the computer industry in past decades, which was dominated by US-based Microsoft and Intel. Inclusion of Intel processors on computers once guided purchases as much as the names of the manufacturers themselves, such as Lenovo or Dell. China has begun to emerge as a manufacturer in its own right, with smartphone chips developed by Huawei, drones by DJI, selfie phones by Oppo and Vivo, smart accessories by Xiaomi and user-friendly TV by LeShi. Some of these homegrown products are even making a splash globally. On auction websites, consumers have to pay an extra 500-1,500 yuan (US$72-$217) to buy popular gadgets developed locally, such as Huawei’s Mate 9, DJI’s Mavic Pro and Xiaomi’s Mi Mix. All these products were sold out immediately after their debut. The IT website Verge called the information-technology component market in the southern city of Shenzhen “the world’s most amazing gadget creator.” That praise came after a visit to Huangqiangbei, which used to be a center for cheap copies of iPhones but now is a center of new ideas and original prototypes. Domestic brands that once relied on cheap prices and annoying advertising are now basing their strategies on well-designed, user-friendly devices to woo consumers. In my opinion, that bodes well for the future of the industry. Top Chinese dot-com firms like Qihoo 360 and Baidu also have expanded into hardware sectors, turning out products such as children’s smart watch with Qihoo 360 security features and Baidu’s prototype self-driving cars using data analysis and artificial intelligence. And no one can deny that LeShi’s content and interface advantages in the smart TV market are raising eyebrows, though the ambitious company’s expansion in smartphones and auto faces capital shortfalls. Some sectors, such as virtual reality and robotics, seem to have gotten ahead of themselves in 2016. They still lack truly innovative, popular products created in China, though they have attracted considerable venture capital investment and media headlines this year. I predict these technologies will first find their niche in industrial sectors before entering households. Here are some domestic innovations worth noting as the year draws to an end. XIAOMI gadgetry THIS wasn’t what could be called “the year of Xiaomi” because the company’s smartphone sales came in smaller than expected because of competition from Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. Still, I think Xiaomi maintains a noteworthy “empire” different from other smartphone brands. Its various gadgets range from routers to set-top boxes and wiring boards. It offers users reliable quality products at low prices, which can connect to smartphones with Xiaomi applications. Its set-top box has sold well both in China and the United States. In 2016, Xiaomi launched a concept smartphone called Mi Mix, with what has been called an “insane looking” full-screen design. People can already buy and use it, though the phone is still in limited production. Tipping point: Xiaomi products help people connect smart devices and offer content and services to households, rather than to individuals. Connected devices are expected to help Xiaomi gain market advantage and probably greater income in the future. Xiaomi is not basing its future only on Chinese smartphone sales. Instead, it has plans to play an important role in the connected “smart homes” of the future in China. Oppo & Vivo’s phones for selfie and music fans  OPPO and Vivo overtook Huawei and Xiaomi to become the best-selling mobile phone brands in China in the third quarter, according to research firm International Data Corp. Oppo and Vivo, both owned by Guangzhou-based BBK Electronics, surprised both the media and the information technology industry this year. They have opened thousands of stores in smaller towns and cities in the recent years, building up considerable market shares. Besides strong distribution networks, the companies have invested heavily in features that Apple and Samsung have yet to offer. The rapid battery-charging, powerful front camera for selfie fans and lossless-quality music playing on smartphones have attracted millions of young consumers. With their enhanced marketing positions, the firms have tended to technology research and development in the upstream chain. Oppo has co-developed a camera sensor with Sony, featuring faster focus and better performance in dark environments. Tipping point: Oppo and Vivo didn’t follow the trend of heavy reliance on the Internet to sell smartphones in the past two years. Rather, they focused on the ultimate demands of consumers for quality music and photography, according to Vivo Vice President Ni Xudong. Both companies also haven’t staged public events to reveal detailed sales figures and targets. Instead, they invite film stars, models and other celebrities to promote their products, which proved a hit with young consumers. DJI drones  DJI, the world’s top drone maker, opened its first flagship store in Shanghai two weeks ago, its fourth outlet after stores in Shenzhen, Seoul and Hong Kong. Long queues for DJI’s new foldable drone Mavic Pro reminded me the long queues in front of the Pudong Apple store for the Chinese debut of the iPhone 5 several years ago. Vice President Paul Xu said Shanghai is strategic for DJI because it is a market full of young, fashionable consumers who like new gadgets and technologies. DJI is expected to improve its domestic market revenue to 20 percent of income this year, which would be double that of 2015. Tipping point: DJI is often called the “Apple of the drone market.” It has developed its own flying balance and picture transmission technologies, and established global brand awareness. More importantly, it is aggressively looking forward with plans to expand in the domestic market and in industrial sectors, with products like its new drone for agricultural use, which I believe has great market potential in China. Huawei’s Kirin processor  HUAWEI aims to sell 140 million smartphones this year, up from 100 million units in 2015. They include popular models costing more than 3,000 yuan, which makes the company a competitive player in the high-end segment dominated by Samsung and Apple. The self-developed processor Kirin is used in Huawei models like the P9 and Mate 9, offering features like multi-task operation, image processing, battery management and support of virtual reality. Tipping point: Sales figures aside, Huawei is now one of a few handset firms in China to design mobile processors on its own, just like Samsung and Apple. Kirin takes its name from a Chinese legendary beast that symbolizes good luck and nobility.

Ground truths from two powerful women. By Michael Krigsman for Beyond IT Failure | December 18, 2016 -- 00:43 GMT (16:43 PST) | Topic: CXO Image from Istockphoto In part one of my conversation with Kim Stevenson and Adriana Karaboutis, we discussed the challenges and opportunities facing women in technology Also read: Women in technology: Advice from Intel and Biogen This second post offers advice from Andi and Kim on how CIOs can add value to their organizations. Both women have years of CIO experience; Kim was CIO at Intel and Andi worked in that role at Dell. Having been in the role and then left to take on business positions, they are each highly qualified to offer advice to CIOs. Kim is currently Chief Operating Officer for the Client, IoT and System Architecture Group at Intel and Adriana is Executive Vice President Technology, Business Solutions & Corporate Affairs at Biogen. Both women are on the boards of public companies. Once a CIO, always a CIO. — Kim Stevenson, Intel Among the themes we discussed, understanding the business and being able to communicate well are primary qualifications of a modern CIO. While perhaps an obvious point, there are degrees of sophistication and subtlety regarding understanding how the business operates, why leaders make decisions, and possessing the judgment to balance trade-offs among conflicting goals and objectives. CIOs are in a unique position to understand and collaborate with the business. Unlike colleagues in other departments, IT possesses a horizontal view that goes across virtually all areas of a company. Because all departments rely on shared resources and services, such as infrastructure and security, IT typically has relationships across every part of the company. "Seat at the table" is code for understanding the business: objectives, mission, and enablers. — Adriana Karaboutis, Biogen This unique, cross-sectional view creates the opportunity for CIOs to develop a unique understanding of how all parts of the business fit together. The video embedded above offers a view inside the minds of two successful business people who held CIO positions earlier in their careers. The have fought the battles and paid their dues.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Dec 17, 2016 at 5:31PM Image source: Getty Images. Looking at Micron Technology's (NASDAQ:MU) chart this year, it's hard to imagine anything could be wrong with the memory-chip specialist. Micron's stock has risen more than 40% so far in 2016, easily outpacing the Nasdaq's 8% return. However, since the end of the dot-com bubble sell-off around the start of 2003, a far more important long-term pattern has emerged that anyone considering investing in Micron ought to consider: MU data by YCharts. While more diversified semiconductor producers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have also underperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Micron shares have performed slightly worse than Intel while also proving far more volatile in the process. This boom-and-bust tendency in Micron stock makes it highly unappealing from a long-term investor's perspective. So here are two other semiconductor names investors could do well to consider in lieu of Micron. 1. Intel Though they share a common industry, Intel's and Micron's respective places within the semiconductor market give them little else in common. Intel dominates the market for PC and server microprocessors, the chips that serve as the "brains" for PCs and servers. In these markets, speed matters, and Intel's ability to consistently produce the fastest chips has allowed it to command premium prices for its chips. Over time, Intel's cushy margin structure allowed it to reinvest heavily in research-and-development and manufacturing innovations, thus extending its chips' competitive position. This self-reinforcing cycle has lead Intel to enjoy what many view as a moderate competitive advantage over rivals like Advanced Micro Devices. The difference in quality between Intel's and Micron's segments of the semiconductor market truly shines through when you compare their respective margin structures. For example, Intel's two core operating segments are each larger, more profitable, and more stable than Micron's entire revenue base, which relies almost exclusively on commodity-like memory chips. Moreover, Micron, which recently released its full-year fiscal 2016 earnings, generated $12.4 billion in sales this fiscal year. And though Intel will not release its FY 2016 report until early next year, Intel's 2015 operating profits topped $14 billion, more than Micron's entire sales this fiscal year. For this article's purposes, Intel's chief virtue is its lack of exposure to the low-margin memory-chip business. 2. Samsung Unlike Intel, Korean conglomerate Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) competes head-to-head against Micron in the memory-chip market to a meaningful degree. However, Samsung holds an advantage over Micron in that its memory business serves as a single piece of its many business segments, one that nicely complements its consumer-electronics businesses. Samsung's phones, tablets, wearables, and other devices require memory chips in order to store the code on which their software runs. Manufacturing its own memory, via its Samsung Foundry business, allows Samsung to reduce its reliance on third-party memory suppliers like Micron, while also lowering its component costs. Samsung's memory business is not just a profit center for the company, but also serves its overall strategy by allowing it to more effectively produce its electronics. Equally important, Samsung likely remains the market's largest memory-chip maker; Samsung not only builds its own chips, but also makes chips for third-party tech companies like. Especially in industries where the market sets prices, being the largest provider can provide some benefits over the competition. In that vein, Samsung's $29 billion in memory-chip sales in fiscal year 2015 more than doubled Micron's total sales this year. What's more, Samsung's massive Foundry business gives it the ability to more effectively compete for market share against stand-alone operators like Micron. However, I prefer Samsung (like Intel) over Micron for its diversification away from the memory-chip market, not its strong competitive stance within it. Foolish bottom line Each of the companies presented here was selected because it faces less exposure to the memory-chip business than Micron. As evidenced by Micron's performance this year, investors can profit immensely by investing in Micron under the right conditions. As in any commodity-esque business, though, times of weak pricing can cause wrenching losses for companies like Micron, which relies on memory-chip sales as its sole source of revenue. To be sure, Micron has done a nice job consolidating market share, which could help give it the ability to compete throughout the memory-chip price cycle. However, for long-term investors, plenty of other stocks in the semiconductor market offer less risk and more growth than Micron does today. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Moreover, Micron, which recently released its full-year fiscal 2016 earnings, generated $12.4 billion in sales this fiscal year. And though Intel will not release its FY 2016 report until early next year, Intel's 2015 operating profits topped $14 billion, more than Micron's entire sales this fiscal year. For this article's purposes, Intel's chief virtue is its lack of exposure to the low-margin memory-chip business. 2. Samsung Unlike Intel, Korean conglomerate Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) competes head-to-head against Micron in the memory-chip market to a meaningful degree. However, Samsung holds an advantage over Micron in that its memory business serves as a single piece of its many business segments, one that nicely complements its consumer-electronics businesses. Samsung's phones, tablets, wearables, and other devices require memory chips in order to store the code on which their software runs. Manufacturing its own memory, via its Samsung Foundry business, allows Samsung to reduce its reliance on third-party memory suppliers like Micron, while also lowering its component costs. Samsung's memory business is not just a profit center for the company, but also serves its overall strategy by allowing it to more effectively produce its electronics. Equally important, Samsung likely remains the market's largest memory-chip maker; Samsung not only builds its own chips, but also makes chips for third-party tech companies like. Especially in industries where the market sets prices, being the largest provider can provide some benefits over the competition. In that vein, Samsung's $29 billion in memory-chip sales in fiscal year 2015 more than doubled Micron's total sales this year. What's more, Samsung's massive Foundry business gives it the ability to more effectively compete for market share against stand-alone operators like Micron. However, I prefer Samsung (like Intel) over Micron for its diversification away from the memory-chip market, not its strong competitive stance within it. Foolish bottom line Each of the companies presented here was selected because it faces less exposure to the memory-chip business than Micron. As evidenced by Micron's performance this year, investors can profit immensely by investing in Micron under the right conditions. As in any commodity-esque business, though, times of weak pricing can cause wrenching losses for companies like Micron, which relies on memory-chip sales as its sole source of revenue. To be sure, Micron has done a nice job consolidating market share, which could help give it the ability to compete throughout the memory-chip price cycle. However, for long-term investors, plenty of other stocks in the semiconductor market offer less risk and more growth than Micron does today. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Google just launched a serious IoT platform under the Android Things brand. This could be a serious revenue driver for NXP, Intel, and Broadcom. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Dec 17, 2016 at 10:10AM The NXP PICO platform for Android Things, up close and personal. Image source: NXP. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division has released a slew of specialized Android versions. This week, the Android Things platform for devices under the Internet of Things umbrella made its first appearance. Investors in the semiconductor sector should pay attention, especially those who own shares of launch partners NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). What's new? Android Things started life under the code name "Brillo" back in the spring of 2015. From the start, this platform was designed to support sophisticated sensors and efficient wireless networking, all while requiring extremely low amounts of memory space and electric power. The Brillo project has now grown up, launching into an Android-branded market presence and a handful of Google-approved hardware systems. The first Android Things developer kits come from Broadcom (under the Raspberry Pi brand), Intel, and NXP. Google has vetted five specific system-on-a-module packages to work with the launch version of Android Things, and it will stand behind those hardware-software combinations with support services and officially approved plug-in attachments. These platforms are expected to form the core of actual IoT products running the Android Things software. Given Google's massive presence in the online business world, including Android's global domination of the smartphone market, this development channel seems likely to gain traction quickly. Being aboard the initial launch hardware should lead to large volumes of IoT chip sales as this platform matures. The contenders The five launch-date platforms cover a lot of ground. For example, the Intel Edison module cuts every corner it can. It has a slow dual-core Intel Atom processor, only supports limited amounts of RAM and permanent storage, and doesn't even come with a graphics processing unit. This is the one you'd want for a no-frills IoT device where low cost and minimal power consumption are the primary design goals. But Android Things also supports the high-end Intel Joule module. Armed with about six times the processing power of an Edison module, the latest and greatest WiFi technology, and a decent graphics chip to boot, this one would be a better choice for advanced processing tasks or a screen-equipped service kiosk. The Joule development board is available now for $337 per kit. An Edison kit will run you $48 today. These products are aimed at very different target markets and are priced accordingly. NXP takes the middle ground between Intel's extreme high-end and low-end options. The Argon and Pico boards come with the same NXP i.MX6UL processor, with similar mid-range amounts of memory and support for technology standards. The Pico costs a little bit more and comes with a couple of additional networking features. These boards cost roughly $60 apiece and fit comfortably into a potential mainstream space between Intel's radical outliers. NXP is aiming these boards at decidedly mid-range applications such as locks, thermostats, temperature sensors, and lighting systems. Finally, the Broadcom-powered Raspberry Pi 3 has been available to consumers since February, 2016. The board packs a respectable processing punch for just $42, but it's currently out of stock. The Google Things launch may have overwhelmed the Raspberry Pi supply chain temporarily -- a good sign for the long-term value of these hardware and software platforms. Image source: Getty Images. What's next? This is just an early salvo in a long war. Android Things does have the deck stacked in its favor, but it still must execute over the long haul in order to make a difference. The Android brand and the years of network security work that have gone into it will help, and some of the biggest semiconductor hardware suppliers are already involved. These are positive signs for the platform's long-term survival. On the other hand, Android Things is far from first out of the gate. Name a large technology business, and chances are that your pick is testing the waters with its own IoT platform. You could even argue that Google is late to the party. That's not good. So, there's is a lot of work left to do before crowning any winners. In the end, the IoT market is easily large enough to support several major platforms, each one burrowing into a specific niche.

The KVM & Xen Changes For Linux 4.10: Includes Intel GVT Work Written by Michael Larabel in Virtualization on 17 December 2016 at 02:49 PM EST. 4 Comments Earlier in the week the KVM and Xen updates were sent in for the Linux 4.10 kernel to add to the list of changes so far for Linux 4.10. On the KVM front within the x86 space there is now support for hiding nested VMX features from guest, nested VMX can now run Microsoft Hyper-V in a guest, there is support for more AVX512 extensions, and there is infrastructure support for virtual Intel GPUs. The Intel virtual GPU work on that front is exciting with the pieces finally coming together. Already in Linux 4.10 is the VFIO mediated device interface being used by Intel's GVT plus the needed prep work within the DRM driver. It looks like Intel's getting very close to having GVT be a mainline reality, but I think there still are some needed DRM patches that didn't land yet so it might not end up happening until Linux 4.11 for having Intel virtual GPU support within VMs. More of the Linux 4.10 KVM changes via this pull request. Then with the Xen pull request there are various fixes, including for ARM/ARM64, and a change of maintainership. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The chip is expected to best Intel's finest but for a fraction of the cost.  ( AMD ) Advertisement The AMD New Horizon event took place recently, and there, the company officially announced its newest desktop processor, RyZen. The new processor is based on the Zen architecture, and it is designed to bring faster performance to regular desktop users and gamers alike. The current line of AMD processors comes from the FX line, the most notable being the FX-8150. However, this line of processors isn't capable of competing with Intel in the enthusiast market, and as such, AMD has failed to compete greatly with the market leader. With RyZen, the company is hoping to break free and return to the days of the Athlon 64 where it had the upper hand over Intel. How Good Is RyZen? AMD CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, was very excited during the entire conference, as she spoke much about what RyZen is capable of and how it stacks up against similar Intel processors. "[W]e believe that there has been no innovation in desktops over at least the last five years," Su said. She's not wrong, as the performance gains have been small and unimpressive. Then again, we could blame AMD here, as Intel would have little reason to innovate in a meaningful way if the company had strong competition in the market. However, this could change soon, seeing as the processor is set to hit store shelves before the end of Q1 2017. "The 'Zen' core at the heart of our Ryzen processors is the result of focused execution and thousands of engineering hours designing and delivering a next-level experience for high-end PC and workstation users," said Su. "Ryzen processors with SenseMI technology represent the bold and determined spirit of innovation that drives everything we do at AMD." Now, when RyZen is released, AMD claims the main processor, which is designed for the high-end market, will compete neck and neck with the Intel Core i7-6900K. In the demo shown at the event, RyZen is rocking eight cores and 16 threads at a speed of 3.4 GHz. Unfortunately, AMD did not talk about the price, but seeing as the company has been consistently releasing cheaper products than Intel, we should expect the same to apply here. What About Gaming? AMD showed some live demonstration of RyZen when it comes down to video games, and it's quite impressive. If you're the type of person who loves to play video games and stream to Twitch TV or Beam at the same time, then RyZen might be right up your alley. Here's the thing: many streamers tend to use two computers. Basically, one computer for playing the game and the other for streaming and encoding. This could be the end of this major problem, and despite the demonstration, we'd rather see this in action with our own eyes. The Core i7-6700K was also shown doing the same thing, but it fails in this regard, as the game being streamed on Twitch TV was dropping frames all over the place. It should be noted that the Core i7-6700K was running at an overclocked frequency of 4.5GHz. Vega, Anything About That? Yes, but not much was shown, and that's a bit of a disappointment. The newest Star Wars: Battlefront was shown running in 4K. Apparently, the hardware the game was running on consists of RyZen and Vega in a single machine. No word on when Vega will hit the market, but at least we have an idea of when RyZen is coming. TAG AMD RyZen, Intel, Star Wars: Battlefront © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

AMD is expected to release the Ryzen in a groundbreaking event called the New Horizon Event, next week. If this was a decade ago, somebody would easily encourage Intel to hold their peace, AMD products are just a bluff.  But today, of all days, Intel has every reason to get worried. To begin with, almost 60% of computers that are entering the market today, run on the cheaper AMD CPUs. Secondly, the world is aware of the simple fact that AMD CPUs include an addition Radeon Graphics Chipset deep within their morphology. According to PC Gamer, big companies like Lenovo, HP and Microsoft are gloriously embracing AMD chipsets. So how do you convince such big corporations that are only interested in profits, to buy your less performing yet expensive products? As a matter of fact, from the look of things, Intel's next generation of processors have been left for high end computers like Macs and HP's Envy. But for cheap computers, in the mid and low prices, AMD is the way to go. Advertisement WCCFTech editors published a piece about a certain notable aspect that indicates how fast AMD is growing. The editors argued of how AMD's stock values skyrocketed almost overnight, after Lenovo announced how they will feature the latest AMD 7th generation APUs in their imminent laptops. The only threat to AMD's newly found glory is NVIDIA's long awaited GTX 1080 Ti, (Not really sure if they will call it that way.)  All the same, AMD is doing a fabulous job and if Intel doesn't go back on the drawing board and come up with something cheaper and performing to beat the Ryzen, they might as well let Apple acquire them. The world is really insisting on cheaper, efficient and proficient CPUs. The fact that AMD is selling its chips even to other markets like in gaming consoles, means that Intel is in a tight spot. The freshly launched PS4 Pro console is already throttling an AMD chip beneath its motherboard.

Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today After a long while, Intel may finally be facing tough competition this 2017 with AMD's Zen microarchitecture. Now identified with its new brand name, Ryzen, the Zen x86 core processor will be the first chip in the Summit Ridge desktop family that AMD will be focusing on in 2017. According to Trusted Reviews, the Ryzen processor will be unleashed as a 3.4GHz+ chip with eight cores (16 threads), 4 MB of L2 and 16 MB of L3 cache. With its power and features, the Ryzen chip is expected to take on Intel's super-expensive Haswell-E and Broadwell-E Core i7 enthusiast chips. Ryzen, according to AMD, is capable of doing 40 percent more work per clock cycle compared to the previous Excavator core generation. Amazingly, Ryzen is designed efficiently such that power consumption per cycle will remain the same as before. The Zen chip's performance boost is attributed to the new 14nm process. This allowed more transistors to fit onto a piece of silicon, leading to significant improvements in the chip's performance without risking increases in power consumption. The Ryzen chip also supports "Simultaneous Multi-Threading," which bears resemblance to Intel's Hyper-Threading technology. The new Zen architecture allows better distribution and multi-tasking. Although AMD has been generous in sharing details about the development of the Zen microarchitecture to the public, the company has yet to disclose the Ryzen's chip's "boost" speed (or maximum potential) and its price, according to PC World. With the impending launch of the Ryzen chip and the many subsequent products to be launched along the way, AMD's future has never looked as bright as it does at the moment. During AMD's special Ryzen live stream on Dec. 13, Chief Executive Lisa Su predicted a "very, very strong lineup" of motherboards, hardware partners, and system builders for their company. "2016 was a very strong year; we're very pleased with all the progress that we've made," Su said. "But with 2017, the best is truly yet to come," she added.

How the hot startup that stole Apple's thunder wound up in Silicon Valley's graveyard Tech Insider 12/18/2016 Steve Kovach © Provided by Business Insider Inc Eric Migicovsky For a moment, it looked like the story would have a happy ending. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 115.82 -0.91 -0.78% Intel Corp INTC ▼ 36.27 -0.39 -1.06% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% Quanta Computer Inc S/GDR QUCCF = 8.91 0.00 0.00% As struggling smartwatch maker Pebble discussed selling itself to Fitbit, a larger competitor in the wearable technology market, the chatter among the Pebble team was that they would continue working on their product under the wing of a new, more stable corporate parent. Fitbit’s co-founder James Park even visited Pebble’s offices and, following a brief introduction from Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky, talked reassuringly about how excited he was to welcome Pebble into the Fitbit family. But within a month it became apparent that Fitbit’s $40 million acquisition wasn’t a lifeline for Pebble, it was a fire sale. Choice assets and employees were cherry picked, the rest discarded. Most employees out of Pebble's staff of about 100 were laid off, their stock suddenly worthless. It was a sad ending for a company once seen as a brilliant example of Silicon Valley chutzpah, a scrappy startup that had forced tech giants like Apple, Samsung, and Google to play catch-up. But it also capped a tumultuous year of poor sales, supplier problems, failed acquisition talks, and a general lack of consumer interest in smartwatches, according to several sources that Business Insider spoke to.  And at a time when Silicon Valley is racing towards the next big thing, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars, the demise of Pebble is a stark reminder that even the most promising and buzzed about innovations don’t always survive the harsh realities of the marketplace. "By the time we got into late spring and june of this year, I was like, OK, it does not look good," one Pebbler insider said. "I didn't think we were going to make it to 2017. It was dragged out forever." Early success According to the sources Business Insider spoke to, the signs of trouble for Pebble began to appear early on, though they were often ignored among the excitement of a nascent smartwatch business that many believed would be as big as smartphones. Pebble burst on to the scene in 2012 after launching what was then the most successful Kickstarter campaign in history, raising $10.2 million to fund the production of the first smartwatch. Pebble proved there was interest in the wrist-worn gadgets, well before Apple introduced the Apple Watch and other big tech companies followed suit. The first Pebble launched in early 2013 to positive reviews. Although it appealed mainly to techies, the product was a solid first attempt at a modern smartwatch. The watch could display notifications like incoming texts and calendar alerts and run a bunch of apps ranging from ESPN to Evenote. Pebble continued to launch new products, including the Pebble Time, the first device with Pebble’s new take on a smartwatch operating system.© Provided by Business Insider Inc pebble 2 timeline os But things started getting hairy in 2015 when Apple, the world's largest technology company, released its long-awaited smartwatch.  Migicovsky was unfazed by the new competition, telling Business Insider shortly after the Apple Watch was announced that he wasn't worried Apple might cut into his sales. "I think it will drive a lot more interest and a lot more volume at Pebble."  The Apple Watch did initially boost interest in Pebble, as consumers viewed Pebble's product as a cheaper, more capable alternative. But sales eventually began to shrink, sources say. Apple's brand was so strong, recalls one insider, that it sucked up all the oxygen.  And Apple's decades of product-building experience gave it another big advantage. Sources familiar with Pebble's supply chain said the company had difficulty paying suppliers building the products in Taiwan throughout 2015, especially payments related to production of the Pebble Time Round. In some cases, these suppliers would call for payments on outstanding purchase orders and get no response from Pebble. Some of those outstanding orders still remained unpaid by the time Fitbit entered acquisition talks with Pebble. Some people close to the company also blamed Pebble's supply chain team for playing favorites, attempting to move a lot of production from Taiwan-based Quanta Computer to Compal Electronics. Pebble continued to raise money through Kickstarter, sales of current products, and other private sources. But it wasn't enough to fund the production of new products.   The expected wave of consumer demand for smartwatches never materialized; even Apple appeared to be having trouble convincing the world that a smartwatch — like the iPhone — was another must-have gadget. The market was not as big as everyone had hoped, and the market was getting crowded. Layoffs and deal talks When Pebble's head of sales sent an email to his team after the Black Friday/Cyber Monday holiday shopping weekend in 2015, there was no more ignoring the magnitude of the problem. Sales during the biggest shopping weekend of the year were down from the year before. If things didn't improve, the email warned ominously, adjustments would have to be made.  © Provided by Business Insider Inc Tim Cook Pebble's business never fully rebounded, and internal discussions began after the holiday shopping season about what changes needed to happen so that the company could survive. In March of 2016, Pebble laid off 25% of its staff, as Business Insider first reported. Pebble began searching for more outside investment or a possible buyer. One insider said they were asked to compile internal data about sales, which fueled speculation Pebble was trying to sell itself. By May of 2016, Migicosvky admitted to the staff that the company was trying to sell, but that a deal had recently fallen through. That deal turned out to be from chipmaker Intel, which wanted to buy Pebble for about $70 million. It's not clear why the deal fizzled, although it was Intel that ultimately walked away, not Pebble. (The Pebble side wanted the deal to happen.) One source close to Migicovsky said they were told that Intel's offer was initially higher than $70 million, but was lowered after due diligence. "Something rubbed him the wrong way and he was uncomfortable," the source close to Migicovsky said regarding the failed Intel deal. A high-profile collaboration with Japanese watchmaker Citizen also proved disappointing.  Pebble had hoped to learn from Citizen's expertise building and designing traditional watches. But throughout the development of the Time Round — a version of the Pebble watch with a circular screen that the two companies collaborated on — the Pebble team felt that Citizen lacked the technical chops in software and hardware development to be of much use, according to sources. Plus, Citizen typically took a lot longer to develop and launch products, often a year or more, which didn’t jibe with Pebble’s desire to push out new products faster. In the end, Pebble thought Citizen's designs were too thick and chunky and ultimately went with a design from internal Pebble employees. Pebble did pay Citizen about $50,000 for its work, according to one source with direct knowledge of the deal. Citizen did not respond to a request for comment. While TechCrunch reported that Citizen considered acquiring Pebble for roughly $740 million in 2015, no deal ever happened. One source directly familiar with Pebble's acquisition talks said Citizen never discussed buying Pebble, and accused someone of spreading a false rumor to TechCrunch. © Provided by Business Insider Inc pebble time round Facing the music Following the failed acquisition talks and the round of layoffs, Migicovsky leveled with his remaining employees late this spring. If they wanted to stay and see Pebble through to the end, their shares in the company would be doubled. If they wanted to cut their losses and leave, they would receive a severance package. While some took the buyout offer, most Pebble employees stuck with the company, hoping new products like the Pebble Time 2 watch and Pebble Core, a tiny device that lets you listen to Spotify music offline, would reinvigorate sales. In fact, Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core were on track for their launch at the beginning of 2017. As recently as a week before discussions with Fitbit began, Pebble employees were visiting their manufacturing partners in Asia and finalizing production plans for the new devices, sources say. In a  recent  interview with  Steven Levy of Backchannel , Migicovsky said  he he spent the summer months scrambling across the globe, trying unsuccessfully to raise money from private equity funds and other private investing groups.  Pebble was out of time and out of money. In October, at least one bank that gave  money to Pebble called in its loan, unconvinced Pebble would be able to raise more funding or sell enough product to solve its cash flow issues and debt to suppliers. Keep your resumes Once Migicovsky decided to sell the company, sources close to him say that his main goal was to find a buyer that would honor the consumers on Kickstarter who backed the Pebble Time 2 or Core — either by refunding their money or building the product.  Craig Barritt/Getty Images for AOL Inc. Fitbit turned out to be the only suitable buyer willing to do that. While the Time 2 and Core products have been canceled, Kickstarter backers will at least get their money back. Other aspects of the Fitbit deal have not unfolded as expected, however. The original deal discussions had Fitbit, which makes wearable products focused on health and fitness, acquiring all or most of Pebble, including the staff, several sources told Business Insider. But something changed as the deal was negotiated and Fitbit ended up buying only the software technology that runs Pebble's products and hiring certain employees.  One source speculated that Fitbit was worried about its stock price after delivering a disappointing sales forecast for the fourth quarter, which caused its stock to tank about 30%. Taking on all of Pebble could’ve looked extra risky to Fitbit investors. A Fitbit spokesperson declined to comment. On the day Fitbit’s team came to visit Pebble’s office about a month before the acquisition closed, many Pebble employees had concerns about what would happen to upcoming products. One source said Fitbit largely dodged those questions and that their true intentions didn’t come to light until they began interviewing Pebble employees. During the interviews, Fitbit quizzed Pebble employees on their roles at the company, but in the end Pebble employees learned there was no interest in the hardware team. Fitbit didn't even ask for resumes, according to one source, instead just pulling in their LinkedIn profiles. Once it became clear these interviews were going nowhere, Pebble hardware employees were encouraged to apply to open positions on Fitbit's website. By the time it was all over, most Pebble employees were sent home with severance packages. Many others took the Fitbit offer, and several former Pebble employees now list Fitbit as their employer on LinkedIn. As for Migicovsky, he'll be working at the startup incubator Y Combinator next year. Pebble's software may live on within Fitbit products, but it's now up to other companies to prove whether Pebble's pioneering product represents the future of computing or just an interesting footnote in history.

X99X Fatal1ty Killer / 3.1 + 5820k Overclock HELP!!! Thread: X99X Fatal1ty Killer / 3.1 + 5820k Overclock HELP!!! Tags: auto, cpu, freq, set, voltage TheThing said: 2 Weeks Ago X99X Fatal1ty Killer / 3.1 + 5820k Overclock HELP!!! Hi guys, I just assembled a new rig as follow: X99X Fatal1ty Killer / 3.1 5820K 16 GB G.Skill Ripjaws 4 - 3200 Mhz Samsung 950 PRO 512 Gb etc.etc. OS: Windows 10 PRO 64 I'm totally new to X99 boards and Intel -E cpus. I just tried to play a little with bios OC settings but I'm not sure at all about the meaning/effect of some of them. For ex. the System Agent is only mentioned as "Offset" setting while many MB (if not the large majority) simply allow the user choose the voltage freely. Also it seems to me that the bios do not display anywhere the System Agent actual (or starting)voltage. To begin with, I followed a suggestion found on the net: set the cpu multiplier to 45 and the vcore to 1.300 keeping all the other settings on auto. This way one can find out if his cpu is good or at least not bad with OC. Mine was able to boot and to load Windows. Some quick bench & stesstests (not hours) seemed to confirm that the system was stable. So, out of curiosity, I lowered the Vcore to 1.250: although I got in Windows and was able to do simple tasks (like running some programs, internet surfing, mail, etc.) the system was not fully stable under tests. It was also able to load Windows @4600 Mhz, same vcore.....of course even less stable. Then I tried to stabilize at least the 4500Mhz frequency, manipulating lot of settings (I got some info about them on the net) without any appreciable result. Here the settings that I manipulated in my attempts: Windows works in "performance mode" I left the ram to 2133 mhz, all settings on "auto" - BCLK Freq: left on "auto" , manually set to 100 (just to be sure) - Intel SpeedStep: basically always disabled. (I tried once, just to check every possibility, to keep it enabled....without any positive effect) - Long Duration Power Limit, Short DPL, Primary Plane Current Limit: tried both on "auto" and set 1000 for the tree of them ---> no apparent difference - Long Duration Mantained & CPUTJMax: always on "auto" - BCLK Spread Spectrum: I tried both enabled & disabled....does not seems to have much impact over stability - Filter PLL Freq: I tried "auto" & high but it does not have either positive or negative effect it seems....or at least I'm not able to evaluate it, same as BCLK Spectrum - System Agent Offset: basically Always on "auto". I tried a couple of time to set low values like 0.100/0.200 (range is 0.100-0.600) resulting in immediate system crash. - CPU Integrated VR Faults & CPU Integrated VR Efficiency: almost always disabled. Sometimes set on "auto" - CPU Input voltage: left on "auto", tried 1.900 & 1.950 ---> maybe a little better stability but nothing to talk about - CPU LLC: left on "auto", manually tried 1&3 without any visible benefits - CPU C State Support: almost always disabled. Tried once with enabled....no diffecence (apparently) - CPU Cache ratio ---> I left it on "auto", set it manually to 44, 42, 40, I also tried 38 - NO ADAPTIVE .....it seems to be ok only on "auto" that set it to 30x (definitely too low for 4500mhz CPU freq, I think) - CPU Cache voltage ---> left on auto, manually to: 1.200, 1.225 - NO ADAPTIVE .....here too, anything but "auto" seems to worsening the stability - CPU Vcore: I tried to rise a little bit (to 1.275) - NO ADAPTIVE, but still unstable under tests - DRAM Voltage, Activating Power Supply, PCH PLL Voltage, CPU I/O voltage, ME Voltage, PCH Voltage ----> all of them always on "auto" Here my hopes, for which I need your help: 1) I'd like to manage to stabilize the 4.500 mhz freq @ 1.250 Vcore if possible, because I feel that it can be done somehow (i.e. an OC expert could do it, probably). 2) I would like to know better which settings are really relevant and how to manage them in order to achieve the best freq @ the lowest Vcore possible. 3) I would like to know if I need to manually set some of the setting that I left Always on "auto" (like PCH PLL, CPU I/O voltages,etc. - see above) Finally, I'd like to know if I need to enable some "obscure" settings like Filter PLL Freq, CPU LCC, BCLK Spread Spectrum and under what conditions (ex. over xxx mhz cpu freq or over zzz vcore/cache voltage) The main problem * seems * to be stabilize the cache @ freq higher than nominal: I failed to do it and can be the very cause of the system instability. Thanks in advance for any help, tip, suggestion!!! :-) Last edited by TheThing; 2 Weeks Ago at 05:51 AM.   Log in Register Full Site Top Powered by vBulletin® Copyright © 2017 vBulletin Solutions, Inc.

 How the hot startup that stole Apple's thunder wound up in Silicon Valley's graveyard Steve Kovach Dec. 17, 2016, 8:00 AM 107,545 facebook linkedin twitter email print Eric Migicovsky Craig Barritt/Getty Images for AOL Inc. For a moment, it looked like the story would have a happy ending. As struggling smartwatch maker Pebble discussed selling itself to Fitbit, a larger competitor in the wearable technology market, the chatter among the Pebble team was that they would continue working on their product under the wing of a new, more stable corporate parent. Fitbit’s co-founder James Park even visited Pebble’s offices and, following a brief introduction from Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky, talked reassuringly about how excited he was to welcome Pebble into the Fitbit family. But within a month it became apparent that Fitbit’s $40 million acquisition wasn’t a lifeline for Pebble, it was a fire sale. Choice assets and employees were cherry picked, the rest discarded. Most employees out of Pebble's staff of about 100 were laid off, their stock suddenly worthless. It was a sad ending for a company once seen as a brilliant example of Silicon Valley chutzpah, a scrappy startup that had forced tech giants like Apple, Samsung, and Google to play catch-up. But it also capped a tumultuous year of poor sales, supplier problems, failed acquisition talks, and a general lack of consumer interest in smartwatches, according to several sources that Business Insider spoke to.  "By the time we got into late spring and june of this year, I was like, OK, it does not look good," one Pebble insider said. "I didn't think we were going to make it to 2017. It was dragged out forever." At a time when Silicon Valley is racing towards the next big thing, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars, the demise of Pebble is a stark reminder that even the most promising and buzzed about innovations don’t always survive the harsh realities of the marketplace. Early success According to the sources Business Insider spoke to, the signs of trouble for Pebble began to appear early on, though they were often ignored among the excitement of a nascent smartwatch business that many believed would be as big as smartphones. Pebble burst on to the scene in 2012 after launching what was then the most successful Kickstarter campaign in history, raising $10.2 million to fund the production of the first smartwatch. Pebble proved there was interest in the wrist-worn gadgets, well before Apple introduced the Apple Watch and other big tech companies followed suit. The first Pebble launched in early 2013 to positive reviews. Although it appealed mainly to techies, the product was a solid first attempt at a modern smartwatch. The watch could display notifications like incoming texts and calendar alerts and run a bunch of apps ranging from ESPN to Evernote. Pebble continued to launch new products, including the Pebble Time, the first device with Pebble’s new take on a smartwatch operating system. Antonio Villas-Boas/Tech Insider But things started getting hairy in 2015 when Apple, the world's largest technology company, released its long-awaited smartwatch.  Migicovsky was unfazed by the new competition, telling Business Insider shortly after the Apple Watch was announced that he wasn't worried Apple might cut into his sales. "I think it will drive a lot more interest and a lot more volume at Pebble."  The Apple Watch did initially boost interest in Pebble, as consumers viewed Pebble's product as a cheaper, more capable alternative. But sales eventually began to shrink, sources say. Apple's brand was so strong, recalls one insider, that it sucked up all the oxygen.  And Apple's decades of product-building experience gave it another big advantage. Sources familiar with Pebble's supply chain said the company had difficulty paying suppliers building the products in Taiwan throughout 2015, especially payments related to production of the Pebble Time Round. In some cases, these suppliers would call for payments on outstanding purchase orders and get no response from Pebble. Some of those outstanding orders still remained unpaid by the time Fitbit entered acquisition talks with Pebble. Some people close to the company also blamed Pebble's supply chain team for playing favorites, attempting to move a lot of production from Taiwan-based Quanta Computer to Compal Electronics. Pebble continued to raise money through Kickstarter, sales of current products, and other private sources. But it wasn't enough to fund the production of new products.   The expected wave of consumer demand for smartwatches never materialized; even Apple appeared to be having trouble convincing the world that a smartwatch — like the iPhone — was another must-have gadget. The market was not as big as everyone had hoped, and the market was getting crowded. Layoffs and deal talks When Pebble's head of sales sent an email to his team after the Black Friday/Cyber Monday holiday shopping weekend in 2015, there was no more ignoring the magnitude of the problem. Sales during the biggest shopping weekend of the year were down from the year before. If things didn't improve, the email warned ominously, adjustments would have to be made.  Apple CEO Tim Cook unveils the Apple Watch Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Pebble's business never fully rebounded, and internal discussions began after the holiday shopping season about what changes needed to happen so that the company could survive. In March of 2016, Pebble laid off 25% of its staff, as Business Insider first reported. Pebble began searching for more outside investment or a possible buyer. One insider said they were asked to compile internal data about sales, which fueled speculation Pebble was trying to sell itself. By May of 2016, Migicosvky admitted to the staff that the company was trying to sell, but that a deal had recently fallen through. That deal turned out to be from chipmaker Intel, which wanted to buy Pebble for about $70 million. It's not clear why the deal fizzled, although it was Intel that ultimately walked away, not Pebble. (The Pebble side wanted the deal to happen.) One source close to Migicovsky said they were told that Intel's offer was initially higher than $70 million, but was lowered after due diligence. "Something rubbed him the wrong way and he was uncomfortable," the source close to Migicovsky said regarding the failed Intel deal. A high-profile collaboration with Japanese watchmaker Citizen also proved disappointing.  Pebble had hoped to learn from Citizen's expertise building and designing traditional watches. But throughout the development of the Time Round — a version of the Pebble watch with a circular screen that the two companies collaborated on — the Pebble team felt that Citizen lacked the technical chops in software and hardware development to be of much use, according to sources. Plus, Citizen typically took a lot longer to develop and launch products, often a year or more, which didn’t jibe with Pebble’s desire to push out new products faster. In the end, Pebble thought Citizen's designs were too thick and chunky and ultimately went with a design from internal Pebble employees. Pebble did pay Citizen about $50,000 for its work, according to one source with direct knowledge of the deal. Citizen did not respond to a request for comment. While TechCrunch reported that Citizen considered acquiring Pebble for roughly $740 million in 2015, no deal ever happened. One source directly familiar with Pebble's acquisition talks said Citizen never discussed buying Pebble, and accused someone of spreading a false rumor to TechCrunch. The Pebble Time Round, which was designed with help from Citizen. Antonio Villas-Boas/Tech Insider Facing the music Following the failed acquisition talks and the round of layoffs, Migicovsky leveled with his remaining employees late this spring. If they wanted to stay and see Pebble through to the end, their shares in the company would be doubled. If they wanted to cut their losses and leave, they would receive a severance package. While some took the buyout offer, most Pebble employees stuck with the company, hoping new products like the Pebble Time 2 watch and Pebble Core, a tiny device that lets you listen to Spotify music offline, would reinvigorate sales. In fact, Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core were on track for their launch at the beginning of 2017. As recently as a week before discussions with Fitbit began, Pebble employees were visiting their manufacturing partners in Asia and finalizing production plans for the new devices, sources say. In a  recent  interview with  Steven Levy of Backchannel , Migicovsky said  he spent the summer months scrambling across the globe, trying unsuccessfully to raise money from private equity funds and other private investing groups.  Pebble was out of time and out of money. In October, at least one bank that gave  money to Pebble called in its loan, unconvinced Pebble would be able to raise more funding or sell enough product to solve its cash flow issues and debt to suppliers. Keep your resumes Once Migicovsky decided to sell the company, sources close to him say that his main goal was to find a buyer that would honor the consumers on Kickstarter who backed the Pebble Time 2 or Core — either by refunding their money or building the product.  The Pebble Core was canceled following Fitbit's acquisition. Pebble Fitbit turned out to be the only suitable buyer willing to do that. While the Time 2 and Core products have been canceled, Kickstarter backers will at least get their money back. Other aspects of the Fitbit deal have not unfolded as expected, however. The original deal discussions had Fitbit, which makes wearable products focused on health and fitness, acquiring all or most of Pebble, including the staff, several sources told Business Insider. But something changed as the deal was negotiated and Fitbit ended up buying only the software technology that runs Pebble's products and hiring certain employees.  One source speculated that Fitbit was worried about its stock price after delivering a disappointing sales forecast for the fourth quarter, which caused its stock to tank about 30%. Taking on all of Pebble could’ve looked extra risky to Fitbit investors. A Fitbit spokesperson declined to comment. On the day Fitbit’s team came to visit Pebble’s office about a month before the acquisition closed, many Pebble employees had concerns about what would happen to upcoming products. One source said Fitbit largely dodged those questions and that their true intentions didn’t come to light until they began interviewing Pebble employees. During the interviews, Fitbit quizzed Pebble employees on their roles at the company, but in the end Pebble employees learned there was no interest in the hardware team. Fitbit didn't even ask for resumes, according to one source, instead just pulling in their LinkedIn profiles. Once it became clear these interviews were going nowhere, Pebble hardware employees were encouraged to apply to open positions on Fitbit's website. By the time it was all over, most Pebble employees were sent home with severance packages. Many others took the Fitbit offer, and several former Pebble employees now list Fitbit as their employer on LinkedIn. As for Migicovsky, he'll be working at the startup incubator Y Combinator next year. Pebble's software may live on within Fitbit products, but it's now up to other companies to prove whether Pebble's pioneering product represents the future of computing or just an interesting footnote in history.

And we are all the time headed towards more multithreaded applications (slowly yes, but still heading). These gametests really show it very well. In games where single threaded performance is the limiting factor, this I5 is even fastest of tested processors. But when game actually has a lot of cpu load which gets spread on multiple threads, it simply chokes. I find it very risky invest to go for such "low" thread counts when investing into new cpu, that you expect to last next couple of years, when already we have games that don't work optimally with 4C/8T cpu. I really would have wished that Intel would have scrapped their current I3 lineup and made 4C/4T their new low tier. I very much think I'm not the only one hoping that.     Dygaza View Public Profile Find all posts by Dygaza   (#9) EdKiefer Maha Guru   Videocard: MSI 970 Gaming 4G Processor: 3570k Mainboard: Asus P8Z77V pro Memory: DDR3 1600 Soundcard: PSU: Corsair XT650 12-17-2016, 14:00 | posts: 1,149 Hi Hilbert I have to disagree with your comment that there has been no IPC changes since sandy bridge. Sure from haswell up there not much change and for sure from broadwell to skylake, it is the same, but from sandy to ivy bridge and from ivy to haswell there "about" 10% on each step. example the CPU-Z single core test ,I can run 4.4ghz and only get 1909 so I am not close to anything 6xxx+. At 4200 i only get 1823 so far from 2135. So while I agree last few not much in IPC, there has been in past after Sandy bridge, not huge but small increase. Anyway, good to see it OC a little better.

SMT should be available on ALL their CPU's no matter what. Their product distribution for consumers should look like: Core i3 - Low Power = 2C/4T perf/w optimized, locked multiplier Core i3 K - Performance = 2C/4T higher boost + unlocked Core i5 - Low Power - 4C/8T perf/w optimized, locked Core i5 K - Performance = 4C/8T higher boost + unlocked Core i7 - Low(er) Power - 6C/12T perf/w, locked Core i7 K - Performance = 6C/12T or 8C/16T unlocked Core i7 X - Performance = 10C/20T unlocked, fastest thing you can buy Current distribution doesn't make any sense anymore after all these years of "the same" BOOO Intel. Doesn't matter how good or bad Zen will be, I will buy one just to clear this stale air coming from Intel.     wavetrex View Public Profile Find all posts by wavetrex   (#11) Hilbert Hagedoorn Don Vito Corleone     Videocard: AMD | NVIDIA Processor: Core i7 5960K Mainboard: X99 Memory: 16GB Soundcard: X-Fi - GigaWorks 7.1 PSU: 1200 Watt 12-17-2016, 14:27 | posts: 27,196 | Location: Guru3D testlab Quote: Originally Posted by EdKiefer Hi Hilbert I have to disagree with your comment that there has been no IPC changes since sandy bridge.

I think in these days Hyper Threading or SMT should be a standard feature on all Core i5 quad core CPUs and the mainstream Core i7s should have minimum 6 cores with SMT enabled. Due to Intel's greed consumers are unable to satisfy their performance requirements. Due to lack of substantial performance upgrade for the same price people won't upgrade their PCs every few years which was the case till 5 years ago.

I mean who in the right mind would upgrade their Sandy i5/i7 to Kaby i5/i7? That's just a waste. Only upgrade path would something like X99 and 5820k or 6850k. Cannonlake will again change nothing in that regard, maybe Coffee Lake.

Since "Bench" marketing optimizes lastest generations is better see real world comparisons were Intel does'nt get more than 5% uplit generation x generation If this continúes AMD will get Kabylake IPC in less than 2 year with Zen+     Amx85 View Public Profile Find all posts by Amx85   (#18) BlueRay Member Guru     Videocard: GTX970 Processor: i5 2500k Mainboard: Gigabyte Memory: 8GB Soundcard: PSU: Corsair AX750 12-17-2016, 15:16 | posts: 87 Giving so much money for the same product when you already own an i5/i7 Sandy and onwards is just money toss in the trash can. It's a shame. It's the same product with just few cherries on top and a higher price. Only Ryzen can be a real upgrade unless AMD screw this a la Bulldozer style. I hope they won't.     BlueRay View Public Profile Find all posts by BlueRay   (#19) EdKiefer Maha Guru   Videocard: MSI 970 Gaming 4G Processor: 3570k Mainboard: Asus P8Z77V pro Memory: DDR3 1600 Soundcard: PSU: Corsair XT650 12-17-2016, 15:20 | posts: 1,149 The problem is most general purpose app don't need a lot of core for general stuff (web browser, email, excel etc ). So if they did go i5= 4/8threads and moved i7 to 6/12, they still need clock speed per core or system doesn't feel responsive. For power users and workstation type work (photoshop, 3d rendering , vidio etc) then it shows and paysoff. Now if they can keep core freq up even on 6 or 8 core thats when it will be mainstream type cpu IMO. We are probably getting close to this, maybe 10nm will bring it closer.     EdKiefer View Public Profile Find all posts by EdKiefer   (#20) EdKiefer Maha Guru   Videocard: MSI 970 Gaming 4G Processor: 3570k Mainboard: Asus P8Z77V pro Memory: DDR3 1600 Soundcard: PSU: Corsair XT650 12-17-2016, 15:39 | posts: 1,149 Quote: Originally Posted by Amx85 Since "Bench" marketing optimizes lastest generations is better see real world comparisons were Intel does'nt get more than 5% uplit generation x generation If this continúes AMD will get Kabylake IPC in less than 2 year with Zen+ How's that, you really think AMD will have another new cpu architecture so fast ? Even if they do good with Zen there R/D is slow, I bet it be another 3-4yrs before we see next one, if it does good. Now that doesn't say there won't be newer ones out but just there be very similar to Zen for a while IMO.     EdKiefer View Public Profile Find all posts by EdKiefer   (#21) rsouzadk Newbie   Videocard: GTX 1070 G1 Gaming Processor: 6600k @ 4.7GHz Mainboard: ASRock Z170 Extreme6 Memory: 32GB DDR4 Vengeance Led Soundcard: onboard PSU: Corsair HX650 12-17-2016, 15:46 | posts: 7 Waiting for ZEN.

It may not last. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Dec 17, 2016 at 8:06AM Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have soared a staggering 280% year to date. The company is still unprofitable, but investors are betting that AMD is on the verge of a historic turnaround. Polaris, AMD's mainstream-oriented GPU, launched earlier this year, producing growth in the company's core business after a long streak of disappointing results. AMD is set to re-enter the high-end GPU market next year with Vega, and its Ryzen CPU, formerly known as Zen, will look to challenge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) during the first quarter. AMD data by YCharts. AMD has also seen some momentum in an area that has been so far dominated by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Alphabet's Google announced last month that it planned to install both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs into its data centers, offering them as part of its cloud platform. While NVIDIA's products are already available through most of the major cloud-computing vendors, AMD has been slower out of the gate, making the Google deal a significant win for the company. Radeon Instinct, a new line of graphics cards aimed at machine learning set to launch in 2017, will put AMD in the running to power artificial intelligence workloads. With such a large gain in such a short period of time, investors are right to ask: Can it last? If everything goes right for AMD next year, the stock could be in for further gains. But it won't take much going wrong for 2017 to be a bad year for the stock, even if it's a relatively good year for the company. Here are three reasons AMD stock could fall next year. Image source: Advanced Micro Devices. An optimistic valuation Looking at AMD's stock chart tells a story of extreme optimism followed by disappointment. Shares of AMD have spiked before, in the early 2000s and again around 2006, only to collapse when the company failed to deliver. The company's current market capitalization isn't yet at an all-time high, but it's at the highest level in nearly a decade. AMD Operating Income (Annual) data by YCharts. In AMD's best year in the past 10, the company managed to earn a net income of about $500 million. The market is currently valuing AMD at around 20 times that number. In other words, investors are not only betting that AMD will make a comeback, but that its profits will soar to record levels. That's a bold bet for a company that has a long history of disappointing investors. This time could be different. AMD has a semi-custom business that's producing profits for the company, and it appears that Ryzen could give Intel a run for its money. But if the bull case doesn't unfold exactly as expected, a major correction could sting investors next year. Beating NVIDIA won't be easy Polaris produced some growth for AMD, with its computing and graphics segment revenue jumping 11% year over year during the third quarter. But NVIDIA stole the show, registering 63% growth in its gaming segment, driven by its new Pascal graphics cards. Both companies benefited from strong demand for graphics cards during the quarter, but NVIDIA claimed a bigger piece of the pie. Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform, collects hardware data from its users, and the most recent results suggest that NVIDIA's dominance isn't going away. The only Polaris graphics card to register on the survey is the RX 480, which claimed just 0.37% of Steam users in November. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's GTX 1080, 1070, and 1060, all higher-end cards launched around the same time, were being used by 0.86%, 1.59%, and 1.53% of users, respectively. AMD plans to launch more powerful graphics cards based on its upcoming Vega GPU next year, hoping to challenge NVIDIA in the high-margin high end of the market. AMD is certainly in a better competitive position today than it was in a year ago, but Polaris hasn't been the runaway success that the company needed it to be. Vega will need to be a home run. If it's not, AMD investors could be in for a rough ride next year. Ryzen could disappoint AMD recently provided details on Ryzen, its upcoming line of CPUs formerly known as Zen. Ryzen processors for desktops are expected to be available during the first quarter of 2017, with notebook variants coming during the second half. The company demonstrated that an eight-core version of Ryzen matched or beat Intel's i7 6900K in a few tasks, including image rendering and video transcoding. Ryzen comes with some new features, including improved prefetching driven by learning algorithms meant to minimize bottlenecks, and a refined boost system that allows clock speeds to be adjusted. It's built on a 14-nanometer FinFET process, meaning that the manufacturing gap between AMD and Intel is at its narrowest in years. If Ryzen is competitive on a performance-per-dollar basis with Intel's chips, AMD could gain a meaningful amount of market share. The only benchmarks we've seen so far have been from AMD, and at this point we know nothing about the more mainstream versions of Ryzen or the pricing. Ryzen needs to offer a compelling value proposition to compel Intel users to switch, and we won't know if that's the case until third-party benchmarks and pricing details surface. Even with Ryzen looking like it's going to be a competitive product, anything short of significant market share gains for AMD could send the stock tumbling.

While laptops of this size and weight inevitably end up sacrificing power for portability, the HP Spectre brings us the best of both worlds, packing an Intel-Core i7 (or i5) processor along with up to 8GB of RAM in its slender, solidly built body, making it one of the most balanced laptops in terms of power, portability and design. While the machine inevitably suffers from some of the same issues prevalent in many other ultra-thin laptops -- namely with heat management and battery life -- the experience I had with it was superb, and I'll gladly recommend this machine to anyone looking for a Windows laptop. Design Outwardly, the Spectre trades in HP's usual brand of bland, minimalist design for an elegant gold-and-black aesthetic that makes the device feel like something James Bond would use (that the Spectre shares the same name as 2015's feature film makes this analogy feel even more appropriate). Made mostly from what seems to be a mixture of aluminium and carbon fibre, the Spectre's body looks and feels appropriately solid, unlike many other plastic-made laptops of this size, which I'm fairly sure can be broken in half over my knee. This is further reinforced by the device's tight screen hinges, keeping the screen firmly in place even when moved around. In my experience, ultra-thin laptops of the Spectre's class tend to have looser, even wobbly screen hinges that feel like they could snap apart from the slightest pressure, which makes the Spectre's solid hinges even more significant. With a thickness of 1.4cm and a weight of roughly one kilogramme, the Spectre's portability is unparalleled, even though the difference in weight and thickness is practically unnoticeable next to similarly sized competitors at this stage. The Spectre's 13.3-inch screen is still only capable of displaying up to 1920x1080 full-HD resolutions, compared with the Apple MacBook's 2560x1600. That said, the Spectre's UWVA BrightView WLED-backlit screen is more than up to almost any task you want it to do, providing a crisp, vibrant image in any lighting. The speakers aren't exactly loud (and I've had them inexplicably cease to function completely on more than one occasion), but other than that, the device is great at media playback. Another pleasant feature of the device is its keyboard, which, while still quite shallow (an unavoidable concession), features decently sized and spaced keys that make typing much easier than one would expect on a device this small. Likewise, the trackpad of the device also works without a hitch, and it's made from a tactile plastic that gives a more precise feel when using it to control the cursor. The trackpad and keyboard are good enough to somewhat make up for the device's lack of traditional USB ports to support an external mouse and keyboard, traded in for two USB-C ports on the back (three, if you count the charging dock). HP was considerate enough to provide its users with multiple USB-C converters in the box (including one each of USB, HDMI, LAN and VGA), so it probably isn't as bad as many other USB-C exclusive machines (looking at you, new MacBooks). Function While most smaller laptops tend to come with the less powerful (while generating less heat) Intel-Core M processor, the HP Spectre pulls out all the stops, coming with an Intel-Core i7 processor, and the results are apparent. Booting up the machine and running various programs and games on it is as smooth as can be, with minimal stuttering or performance dips even after a relatively long period of use. That said, the Spectre isn't without its flaws. While the jump from the Core M to the Core i7 processors did wonders for the device's power, the Spectre's thin frame isn't exactly great at expelling the extra heat generated when engaging its more powerful specs. Much like many other laptops of its class, the Spectre can quickly heat up to levels that would make it uncomfortable to place on your lap, especially when running taxing apps or programs that require the device's full power. Letting the device rest for a while solves this problem rather quickly, though. Furthermore, the machine partially dispenses heat through its keyboard, so even users who place the machine on a solid surface will still feel the heat emanating from it. It's not going to burn your fingerprints off anytime soon, but it's a strange quirk that I found amusing at best and mildly annoying at worst. In the testing process, I was able to run smaller games like Minecraft at high-to-maximum settings, while more substantial games will generally get up to about mid-high settings and still run decently. That said, the heat generated while running many of these games will probably discourage many users from using the Spectre for gaming. This is especially true when you consider how taxing these programs can be on the battery, which seems to provide a mere two-and-a-half to three hours of heavy use, at best. Leaving the device on standby can prolong the battery life to a few days; but all in all, the battery is still one of the device's main weak points, though general users who don't regularly run especially taxing programs won't have to deal with this quite as much. Verdict With a price point just shy of 70,000 baht, the HP Spectre is definitely a tempting choice for anyone looking for a Windows alternative to the MacBook (which will most likely retail at similar prices). While the heat problems and poor battery life aren't exactly insignificant, the sheer portability, design and specifications of the device make it one of the most balanced machines in terms of portability and power, and an interesting buy all the same.

AMD MxGPU Virtualization For The AMDGPU Driver Written by Michael Larabel in AMD on 18 December 2016 at 07:38 AM EST. 17 Comments Well this weekend is exciting for AMDGPU users and open-source AMD fans. Yesterday was the news we published about Valve looking to improve AMDGPU/RADV for their Vulkan-based VR experience while the latest is work from AMD that implements GPU virtualization support within the AMDGPU driver. NVIDIA has been working on their own vGPU support for their binary driver, Intel's GVT is coming together in mainline, and now AMD has joined the party with publishing some patches for their DRM driver. The patches by AMD's Xiangliang Yu work to implement CSA and KIQ along with mailbox communication with the GPU hypervisor. CSA is the Context Save Area. KIQ in this context is the Kernel Interface Queue, as described in one of the patches, "KIQ is queue-memory based initialization method: setup KIQ queue firstly, then send command to KIQ to setup other queues, without accessing registers. For virtualization, need KIQ to access virtual function registers when running on guest mode." This AMD GPU virtualization support is initially implemented for Tonga and Fiji hardware. This AMD virtualization code is for implementing their virtualization support they advertise under the MxGPU branding. AMD announced their first hardware-virtualized GPU products at the beginning of 2016 while finally we are seeing this MxGPU support come for AMDGPU, but too late for Linux 4.10. Their MxGPU virtualization is described in more detail via this press release. The code is initially going to be disabled at compile-time via hiding behind the DRM_AMD_MXGPU Kconfig switch. The DRM_AMD_MXGPU description, "This adds AMD GPU virtualization driver and wires it up into the amdgpu drivers. User can load the driver in guest OS and run graphics applications on AMD hardware in guest mode." The 23 patches add over two thousand lines of code to the kernel and can be found for now via amd-gfx. 17 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Page 1 of 7. 21 Comments With 2016 soon drawing to an end, it's time for all of my year-end recaps now of Linux drivers that I have been doing for the past 12 years. Today are benchmarks of a wide assortment of AMD graphics cards on both R600g and RadeonSI Gallium3D drivers when using Mesa 13.1-dev + LLVM 4.0 SVN and the Linux 4.9 kernel for providing a bleeding-edge look at the open-source AMD Linux graphics performance across hardware going from the Radeon HD 4890 series all the way up through the RX 480 and R9 Fury hardware. Here's a fun look at the OpenGL driver performance across this range of GPUs. This comparison wouldn't be possible with Radeon Software / AMDGPU-PRO, but thanks to the open-source driver stack not going legacy and continuing to work fine on the latest mainline kernels and xorg-server releases, it's still possible to compare the OpenGL performance of the HD 4890 to say the RX Polaris cards. AMD developers rarely touch this old hardware support these days, but the code remains open as part of the mainline Linux kernel and Mesa trees with any open-source developers free to contribute to them. All tests were done atop Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 when using the Linux 4.9.0 kernel and Mesa 13.1-dev via the Padoka PPA as of this week. But before getting to the performance numbers, it's worth mentioning some of the driver improvements over the course of 2016. In 2016, RadeonSI (along with Intel i965) finally hit OpenGL 4.5 compliance! They jumped ahead greatly with their OpenGL 4 support this year plus support for other GL extensions not yet part of a released version. Now at the end of 2016, most new Linux games are running with RadeonSI Gallium3D without problems -- aside from some games still being plagued by performance issues until RadeonSI has an OpenGL shader cache and various other optimizations. This year in Mesa there have also been a number of OpenGL performance optimizations, there was launch-day Radeon RX 480 Polaris support, experimental GCN 1.0 support for AMDGPU, and a wealth of other improvements to the open-source AMD Linux driver stack that I've written about in dozens of Phoronix articles over the course of 2016. But on the down side, unfortunately this year didn't see the merging of DAL/DC code for providing HDMI 2.0, HDMI/DP audio, and other display features. As mentioned already there also still isn't an OpenGL shader cache for RadeonSI, the open-source OpenCL stack is still in poor shape until ROCm is further along, and for select workloads the AMDGPU-PRO driver remains faster. Also unfortunate is that AMD hasn't yet open-sourced their Vulkan driver, leading to the the separate RADV driver effort by the community. The Radeon cards I had available for testing included the Radeon HD 4890, HD 5830, HD 6870, HD 6950, HD 7750, HD 7950, R7 260X, R9 270X, R9 285, R7 370, RX 460, RX 470, RX 480, and R9 Fury. On the FirePro side I was also able to test the V8750 and V8800 as additional data points. The selection of cards used for testing were all that I had available, those that were working properly (i.e. having to leave out the Radeon R9 290), and the cards that weren't busy in rack-mounted systems. All of them that were available for testing but then needing to cut off the testing with the Radeon HD 4890 as the HD 4850/4870 weren't running stable in some of these modern OpenGL tests.

Twitter Facebook ARM tackles server compatibility issues with Allinea acquisition Software compatibility has been a big problem for ARM adoption in servers and supercomputers, but the acquisition may help Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 17 December, 2016 03:44 - - - - print email Comments ARM has a big problem -- it rules in smartphones and tablets but hasn't broken into servers and supercomputers. ARM servers are devalued partly because many applications don't work with the chips. But ARM has acquired Allinea Software with the hope of partially resolving the compatibility issue. Allinea provides software development, debugging, and porting tools, which should make it easier for people to write applications for ARM-based servers and supercomputers. The acquisition will "provide a channel to thousands of developers using supercomputers and give us better first-hand knowledge of the issues being addressed as software is ported to new ARM-based systems," Javier Orensanz, general manager of the development solutions group at ARM, said in a blog entry. The development tools will also be used for ARM chips in deep-learning systems, which require large-scale server deployments for analytics. ARM's competition will come from deep-learning and HPC software tools offered by Intel, Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, and more recently, AMD. ARM designs chips and licenses them to third-party chipmakers like Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Intel. The company is aggressively chasing markets like supercomputing and IoT and is in the process of being acquired by Softbank for US$32.4 billion. Fujitsu is making the first ARM-based supercomputer called Post-K, scheduled to be deployed in Japan by 2020. The supercomputer will have 64-bit chips based on a new microarchitecture called ARMv8-A Scalable Vector Extension, which has vector processing abilities for complex calculations. With the Allinea deal, ARM realized its software weakness and is acting on it. It is acquiring customers and a shortcut to get more developers to write applications for ARM processors. Allinea tools are used by many organizations with some of the fastest computers in the world using other chip architectures. Allinea's team will become a part of the ARM's HPC development solutions team. ARM's acquisition won't affect Allinea's product roadmap. ARM did not reveal how much it paid for Allinea Software.

John Naughton Obviously it’s impossible to say exactly what drew Silicon Valley’s finest to Trump Tower, but power and money may have something to do with it Donald Trump’s meeting with technology bosses last week. Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Images Sunday 18 December 2016 04.00 EST Last modified on Sunday 18 December 2016 04.02 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close On Wednesday, a curious spectacle could be observed in New York. A swarm of tech billionaires arrived in their private jets and were whisked to Trump Tower, the Louis XV pastiche that is the residence of Trumplethinskin, as the tech journalist Kara Swisher calls the president-elect. The roll call of assembled tech moguls ran as follows: Satya Natella and Brad Smith (Microsoft), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Larry Page and Eric Schmidt (Alphabet, Google’s holding company), Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook), Tim Cook (Apple), Elon Musk (Tesla), Ginni Rometty (IBM), Safra Catz (Oracle), Chuck Robbins (Cisco), Alex Karp (Palantir) and Brian Krzanich (Intel). Apart from their vast wealth and an aversion to paying tax, what linked these notables? Answer: a deep loathing of Trumplethinskin. Yet when he issued the summons to his preposterous “summit” they all came running. Why? In order to implement any of his proposed policies on border control, Trump will need a database. A very large database For the answer, we need to delve into the darker recesses of human nature. First of all, there was naked fear. During the election campaign, Trumplethinskin had made no secret of his contempt for the tech companies. He castigated Apple, for example, for not caving in to the FBI’s demand that it unlock the San Bernardino killer’s iPhone and for manufacturing the phone in China rather than in the US. He accused Amazon of abusing its monopoly power. And so on. But it wasn’t the abuse that spooked the tech crowd as much as his demonstration of what he could achieve with a single tweet. At 1:26pm on 12 December his tweet “The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th” instantly wiped $4bn off the value of Lockheed Martin, the lead manufacturer of the $100m-a-pop warplane. If he can do that to an aerospace manufacturer, what could he do to the tech companies? In seeking an explanation for the abject obeisance of the tech moguls on Wednesday, we should also not underestimate the aphrodisiac effect of power. Trumplethinskin may be a repellent demagogue (and we know from off-the-record conversations reported by Swisher – the ultimate tech insider – that that’s how the Silicon Valley crowd see him), but on 20 January he will be president and proximity to power has a funny effect on many people. It causes them to lose their marbles, their judgment and sometimes their principles. So it was in New York on Wednesday when the assembled titans fawned on their host in his blinged-up lair. Thirdly, there is that old staple – greed. There is money to be made out of President Trumplethinskin. One of the first letters he received upon winning the election came IBM chief executive Rometty. “Dear Mr President-elect,” it gushed, “last Tuesday night you spoke about bringing the country together to build a better future and the opportunity to harness the creative talent of people for the benefit of all. I know that you are committed to help America’s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people. I am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help realise the aspiration you articulated… I do so as the leader of the nation’s largest technology employer. Permit me to offer a few suggestions.” These included “data analytics, data centre consolidation and the use of cloud technologies” to cut government costs. Facebook Twitter Pinterest 3 million ‘criminal’ immigrants to be deported, says Donald Trump This is interesting for two reasons. First, Trumplethinskin isn’t any old chief executive but a president-elect who comes to power after a campaign that was laced with racism and promises of action against a particular ethnic/religious group: Muslims. In order to implement any of his proposed policies towards illegal immigrants, border control, etc, he will need a database. A very large database. So who will build it for him? The federal government? Given his contempt for the civil service, that seems unlikely. So it will be outsourced to tech companies and the question becomes: will they do it? In this respect, the IBM chief’s letter might turn out to be an inspired pitch for business. After all, the company could be said to have a track record in this line of business. Way back in the 1930s, its German subsidiary was the outfit that provided the Hollerith tabulating machines that were a cornerstone of the murder machine that ran the Holocaust. For the avoidance of doubt, this is not to say that IBM was responsible for the Holocaust or that Trumplethinskin is a genocidal maniac – just that, to update a 1970s feminist phrase, the technological has suddenly become political. Very political. So how will Silicon Valley respond when the next presidential summons comes? Stay tuned.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS I chose MacBook Pro with Touch Bar over Surface Book By Joe Wilcox Published 3 weeks ago 69 Comments Tweet Water smacked the windshield -- a torrent of heavy droplets -- as my wife struggled to feed money into the tollbooth machine. Pelting rain is uncommon during November in San Diego, but we had purpose for driving 36 km through the downpour to Chula Vista and the Otay Ranch Apple Store, where I had never been before. The shop was the only one around that had the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in stock. Eleven days earlier, Nov. 15, 2016, I received the 13.3-inch model that was ordered on October 27th. While first impressions were wow, the laptop felt slow compared to my previous MBP, and the battery drained in about half the time as specs stated. I worried that Apple produced a defective unit. No store in the area had the smaller laptop in stock, should I want to take advantage of the 14-day return policy. Deadline approached, so I considered as alternative my first 15-incher in more than a decade, tempted in part by quad-core processor and discreet graphics. If Not One, The Other Fast-forward to the present, briefly: In recent days I've seen some stories about shorter-than-expected MBP battery life; customers complain. Hardware is suspected (when isn't it in click-bait news stories). Following a fresh macOS Sierra install on the 13.3-inch laptop and transferring my wife's settings and software from an older MBP, battery life is workday-long-plus. Perhaps the computer had bad factory-installed image or, more likely, despite my sleuthing around for a culprit, something in my setup sucked CPU cycles and energy. (I did investigate!) So if your new MacBook Pro burns the candle quick, check the wick! Returning to weltering November 26th, I stood over the larger MacBook Pro, in awe and despair. The thing felt fast -- almost mind-reading AI-fashion, anticipating keystrokes before I made them. But the screen was huge. Even 13.3 inches is larger than my preference; gimme a laptop that's easily grab-and-go. But the longer time I spent touching and adjusting, perhaps 45 minutes, the more comfortable the laptop became. Decision: Understanding that the computer could be returned within 14 days and recognizing replacement MBP 13 order wouldn't ship, according to Apple Store online, for 4 weeks or more, I made the purchase. My initial angst dissipated within hours after returning home and setting up MBP 15. I have no regrets. Size Matters The 13.3-inch MacBook Pro I had ordered from Apple Store online was a custom config: 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. The laptop replaced my early 2015 model, with 3.1GHz Core i7 chip, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD. My college student daughter accepted the hand-me-down, replacing her somewhat banged and scratched 2013 Apple laptop, with 2.6GHz Core i5 processor, 8GB memory, 256GB SSD. I was surprised how the newer laptop seemed slower than the old. Granted, the comparison was i5 and i7, but also different generation Intel processors. If not MBP 15, I was ready to return the 13.3-incher for refund. Considering how much I had already spent on the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro, a few extra hundred for a lot more computer wasn't a mental (or budgetary) stretch. But I would never spend so much without first experiencing the thing. Understanding: I would return the smaller notebook for refund. Hence, the rainy road trip. Config: 2.7GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 2GB Radeon Pro 455 graphics, 512GB SSD. The CPU is quad-core, and the difference is quite noticeable compared to MBP 13's dual-core processor. This beauty is a multi-tasking maven like nothing groped by my grubby paws. This also marks the most money I have spent on a laptop. Ever. The custom-configured 13-incher totaled $2,199,  and the larger $2,799. Why MBP? By now you must wonder: "Why?" Well, it ain't for the Touch Bar, which isn't as useless as I expected. The brighter (500-nit), more color accurate screen checks one box.  More significantly, I've pined for Apple's butterfly keyboard since its debut on the 12-inch MacBook, which is way, way underpowered for my daily computing requirements. MBP 15 doesn't disappoint. Typing experience on the second-generation butterfly is absolutely fantastic. While the keys are noisy, they deliver great feel and responsiveness. But in choosing to spend so much more, I also opted for other benefits: greater default, native screen resolution (2880 by 1800); quad-core processor; discreet graphics; and expansive, capable touchpad, among them. Features are meaningless without benefits, and I have some in mind. In late October, I fully returned to work after a forced summer sabbatical related to eye surgery that lets me wear glasses to read but frees me from them for distance. I’m ready to write, write, write, and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar feels -- figuratively -- like the tool to do just that. I am doing more photography and video production, and producing a podcast. I need a laptop that can keep up with several projects open and ongoing simultaneously, without stutters and stops that interrupt my workflow and more importantly disrupt my attention. I'm an older writer now, and interruption can leave a crater where my creative flow was. The bigger screen, and even physical size, better suit my needs than the 13.3-incher. How strange; I thank Apple's supply shortages for putting me in position to challenge my preconceptions and go larger when the market trend is smaller laptops. The other mental barrier: Cost, as I couldn't have ever proactively conceived spending so much on a laptop -- and, honestly, wouldn't if not for bent-up desire to produce content following the summer sabbatical. I feel happy typing on the new MBP, for its dazzling beauty and also for how the Touch Bar contextually changes depending on application or what I’m doing. (You’ll have to wait for my full review for more on the feature.) Joy is a benefit often overlooked by high-tech product designers. Scratching the Surface Surely other laptops could do as much for the same cost, or even less. Yup, I seriously considered Surface Book, about which Microsoft's Brian Hall raved two days ago: "The innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro -- especially among professionals -- is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface". He then linked to PC Mag story "Why I Left macOS for a Surface Book", which begins "The Mac is in trouble". Sascha Segan's experience with the butterfly keyboard differs from mine: "I just couldn't get with the super-flat keyboards. I pound out words all day, and getting rid of almost all the throw on the keys was pretty much a deal breaker". As I writer, I understand the sentiment but, as previously mentioned, have much different experience than does the PC Mag analyst. There is much to like about Surface Book, which I see as the only meaningful competitor to either size MacBook Pro. The design is delightful eye candy, and the 3:2 screen ratio is much better suited to writing and researching content in a web browser (MBP is 16:10). Maximum resolution of the gorgeous 13.5-inch screen, which is fully touch-capable: 3000 by 2000 (MBP 13 is 2560 by 1600 and 2880 by 1800 for the larger). Touch is a bonus if you need it, then there is the stylus. I'm a terrible artist and handwriter. I started using a typewriter at age 14 -- during the mid-1970s -- because my penmanship is so terrible. As such, the stylus has little appeal, while the touchscreen is a nice-to-have that I learned from using Chromebook Pixel and other Windows laptops isn't a necessity. For me. As a middle-aged typist writer, keyboard matters much, and the MBP Touch Bar promises to expand what my fingers can do across the plane where they are constantly active. If I were another person, with different priorities and (artistic) capabilities, Surface Book might be the thing. Apple offers one port-type on new MacBook Pros: USB Type-C (aka Thunderbolt 3), whereas Microsoft serves up the smorgasbord of connection options most people will want. Sixth-generation Intel Core chips are standard from both companies. Cost Comparisons Surface Book pricing is similar or close between comparable configurations for either size MBP. That is when I purchased either. Microsoft is sale crazy during the holidays (don't ever expect deals from Apple). For example: $1999 for MBP 13 or SB with Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Of course, Microsoft serves up stylus and touchscreen instead of Apple's tiny Touch Bar -- and the display converts into a tablet (that is too large for my tastes). With i7 chip and double the RAM: $2,499 for the Apple and $2,699 for the Microsoft, but currently discounted to $2,299. While screen sizes mis-match, here's Surface Book with Performance Base compared to MBP 15: Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD -- both for $2,799. SB has touchscreen and stylus, but the MacBook Pro packs quad-core processor. For my needs, speed, professional graphics, and bigger screen matter more. And something else that strangely is the opposite of Sascha Segan's deal-breaker: I find typing on the Surface Book keyboard troubling in manner similar to his complaints about MacBook Pro's butterfly; there's too much travel. Ha! Hey, this is why companies can compete: Different priorities and tastes among potential users. Fanboys, don't get into a pissing match about which is better. Because both matter right now, and Microsoft gets good bang from the competition between them. Earlier today I asked Stephen Baker, NPD vice president and primary hardware analyst, about MacBook Pro and Surface Book sales. They are "key parts of the turnaround in the consumer PC market in terms of pointing it in a more premium direction", he says. "While they aren’t the share leaders, the advertising being spent and the marketing have helped lift all the Windows boats—and it of course hasn’t hurt that all the Windows brands have stepped up their premium product development". Wrapping up, the best laptop is the one with the benefits that matter most to you. That's how I came to choose 15.4-inch MacBook Pro -- and love it. Hehe. Who knows, maybe in an alternate universe, heavy rains led my wife and I to drive to closer-distance Fashion Valley Mall, where there is Microsoft Store, inside which an irresistible Surface Book offer hypnotized me.

Voke, a virtual reality company recently acquired by Intel, installed equipment in Houston's NRG Stadium on Saturday ahead of the game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. It will offer in-game and postgame highlights through its Voke VR mobile app, compatible with a Samsung Gear VR headset and several Samsung phones. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., partnered with the National Football League earlier this month to capture virtual reality snapshots of four games during the final weeks of the season. It shot games in Jacksonville and Tampa Bay earlier this month and will finish in Seattle when the Seahawks face the San Francisco 49ers on Jan. 1. To show game highlights, the company placed four cameras in the end zones and on the sidelines. The cameras hold 12 lenses each, positioned like six sets of eyes on the edge of a rounded platform, allowing viewers to switch between vantage points. "It gives them the choice of where they want to be on the field," said Voke CEO and co-founder Jay Jayaram. Texans season-ticket holder Jorge Esparza doesn't have much need for virtual highlights at this point - he hasn't missed a home game in four years, he said. But if he couldn't make one, he would consider using the technology to catch what he missed. "That would be cool," he said. Voke first tested its virtual reality technology in Houston during the NCAA Final Four championship game played at NRG Stadium in April. The company collaborated with Oculus, another virtual reality company, to create a 180-degree live stream. Eventually, the company hopes to cover more live events, Jayaram said. He added that he expects more venues to use the technology next year as sporting leagues become more confident in its appeal. "This is not just a flash in the pan," he said. Ken Hicks, a Houston barber and Texans season-ticket holder, has a virtual reality headset that he hasn't yet used. That would change if he had the chance to watch game highlights regularly, he said. "I'd do it in a minute," Hicks said. "It would feel like I was in the game." Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS I chose MacBook Pro with Touch Bar over Surface Book By Joe Wilcox Published 3 weeks ago 69 Comments Tweet Water smacked the windshield -- a torrent of heavy droplets -- as my wife struggled to feed money into the tollbooth machine. Pelting rain is uncommon during November in San Diego, but we had purpose for driving 36 km through the downpour to Chula Vista and the Otay Ranch Apple Store, where I had never been before. The shop was the only one around that had the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in stock. Eleven days earlier, Nov. 15, 2016, I received the 13.3-inch model that was ordered on October 27th. While first impressions were wow, the laptop felt slow compared to my previous MBP, and the battery drained in about half the time as specs stated. I worried that Apple produced a defective unit. No store in the area had the smaller laptop in stock, should I want to take advantage of the 14-day return policy. Deadline approached, so I considered as alternative my first 15-incher in more than a decade, tempted in part by quad-core processor and discreet graphics. If Not One, The Other Fast-forward to the present, briefly: In recent days I've seen some stories about shorter-than-expected MBP battery life; customers complain. Hardware is suspected (when isn't it in click-bait news stories). Following a fresh macOS Sierra install on the 13.3-inch laptop and transferring my wife's settings and software from an older MBP, battery life is workday-long-plus. Perhaps the computer had bad factory-installed image or, more likely, despite my sleuthing around for a culprit, something in my setup sucked CPU cycles and energy. (I did investigate!) So if your new MacBook Pro burns the candle quick, check the wick! Returning to weltering November 26th, I stood over the larger MacBook Pro, in awe and despair. The thing felt fast -- almost mind-reading AI-fashion, anticipating keystrokes before I made them. But the screen was huge. Even 13.3 inches is larger than my preference; gimme a laptop that's easily grab-and-go. But the longer time I spent touching and adjusting, perhaps 45 minutes, the more comfortable the laptop became. Decision: Understanding that the computer could be returned within 14 days and recognizing replacement MBP 13 order wouldn't ship, according to Apple Store online, for 4 weeks or more, I made the purchase. My initial angst dissipated within hours after returning home and setting up MBP 15. I have no regrets. Size Matters The 13.3-inch MacBook Pro I had ordered from Apple Store online was a custom config: 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. The laptop replaced my early 2015 model, with 3.1GHz Core i7 chip, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD. My college student daughter accepted the hand-me-down, replacing her somewhat banged and scratched 2013 Apple laptop, with 2.6GHz Core i5 processor, 8GB memory, 256GB SSD. I was surprised how the newer laptop seemed slower than the old. Granted, the comparison was i5 and i7, but also different generation Intel processors. If not MBP 15, I was ready to return the 13.3-incher for refund. Considering how much I had already spent on the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro, a few extra hundred for a lot more computer wasn't a mental (or budgetary) stretch. But I would never spend so much without first experiencing the thing. Understanding: I would return the smaller notebook for refund. Hence, the rainy road trip. Config: 2.7GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 2GB Radeon Pro 455 graphics, 512GB SSD. The CPU is quad-core, and the difference is quite noticeable compared to MBP 13's dual-core processor. This beauty is a multi-tasking maven like nothing groped by my grubby paws. This also marks the most money I have spent on a laptop. Ever. The custom-configured 13-incher totaled $2,199,  and the larger $2,799. Why MBP? By now you must wonder: "Why?" Well, it ain't for the Touch Bar, which isn't as useless as I expected. The brighter (500-nit), more color accurate screen checks one box.  More significantly, I've pined for Apple's butterfly keyboard since its debut on the 12-inch MacBook, which is way, way underpowered for my daily computing requirements. MBP 15 doesn't disappoint. Typing experience on the second-generation butterfly is absolutely fantastic. While the keys are noisy, they deliver great feel and responsiveness. But in choosing to spend so much more, I also opted for other benefits: greater default, native screen resolution (2880 by 1800); quad-core processor; discreet graphics; and expansive, capable touchpad, among them. Features are meaningless without benefits, and I have some in mind. In late October, I fully returned to work after a forced summer sabbatical related to eye surgery that lets me wear glasses to read but frees me from them for distance. I’m ready to write, write, write, and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar feels -- figuratively -- like the tool to do just that. I am doing more photography and video production, and producing a podcast. I need a laptop that can keep up with several projects open and ongoing simultaneously, without stutters and stops that interrupt my workflow and more importantly disrupt my attention. I'm an older writer now, and interruption can leave a crater where my creative flow was. The bigger screen, and even physical size, better suit my needs than the 13.3-incher. How strange; I thank Apple's supply shortages for putting me in position to challenge my preconceptions and go larger when the market trend is smaller laptops. The other mental barrier: Cost, as I couldn't have ever proactively conceived spending so much on a laptop -- and, honestly, wouldn't if not for bent-up desire to produce content following the summer sabbatical. I feel happy typing on the new MBP, for its dazzling beauty and also for how the Touch Bar contextually changes depending on application or what I’m doing. (You’ll have to wait for my full review for more on the feature.) Joy is a benefit often overlooked by high-tech product designers. Scratching the Surface Surely other laptops could do as much for the same cost, or even less. Yup, I seriously considered Surface Book, about which Microsoft's Brian Hall raved two days ago: "The innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro -- especially among professionals -- is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface". He then linked to PC Mag story "Why I Left macOS for a Surface Book", which begins "The Mac is in trouble". Sascha Segan's experience with the butterfly keyboard differs from mine: "I just couldn't get with the super-flat keyboards. I pound out words all day, and getting rid of almost all the throw on the keys was pretty much a deal breaker". As I writer, I understand the sentiment but, as previously mentioned, have much different experience than does the PC Mag analyst. There is much to like about Surface Book, which I see as the only meaningful competitor to either size MacBook Pro. The design is delightful eye candy, and the 3:2 screen ratio is much better suited to writing and researching content in a web browser (MBP is 16:10). Maximum resolution of the gorgeous 13.5-inch screen, which is fully touch-capable: 3000 by 2000 (MBP 13 is 2560 by 1600 and 2880 by 1800 for the larger). Touch is a bonus if you need it, then there is the stylus. I'm a terrible artist and handwriter. I started using a typewriter at age 14 -- during the mid-1970s -- because my penmanship is so terrible. As such, the stylus has little appeal, while the touchscreen is a nice-to-have that I learned from using Chromebook Pixel and other Windows laptops isn't a necessity. For me. As a middle-aged typist writer, keyboard matters much, and the MBP Touch Bar promises to expand what my fingers can do across the plane where they are constantly active. If I were another person, with different priorities and (artistic) capabilities, Surface Book might be the thing. Apple offers one port-type on new MacBook Pros: USB Type-C (aka Thunderbolt 3), whereas Microsoft serves up the smorgasbord of connection options most people will want. Sixth-generation Intel Core chips are standard from both companies. Cost Comparisons Surface Book pricing is similar or close between comparable configurations for either size MBP. That is when I purchased either. Microsoft is sale crazy during the holidays (don't ever expect deals from Apple). For example: $1999 for MBP 13 or SB with Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Of course, Microsoft serves up stylus and touchscreen instead of Apple's tiny Touch Bar -- and the display converts into a tablet (that is too large for my tastes). With i7 chip and double the RAM: $2,499 for the Apple and $2,699 for the Microsoft, but currently discounted to $2,299. While screen sizes mis-match, here's Surface Book with Performance Base compared to MBP 15: Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD -- both for $2,799. SB has touchscreen and stylus, but the MacBook Pro packs quad-core processor. For my needs, speed, professional graphics, and bigger screen matter more. And something else that strangely is the opposite of Sascha Segan's deal-breaker: I find typing on the Surface Book keyboard troubling in manner similar to his complaints about MacBook Pro's butterfly; there's too much travel.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Ethan Baron. Updated December 17, 2016 7:42AM SHARE ALSO SEE Artificial Intelligence Innovation Silicon Valley Siri Digital Assistant Self-Driving Car Bots Alexa Virtually everywhere you look, Bay Area tech businesses are running into walls. Smartphones were revolutionary and lucrative, but the U.S. market is saturated, and Apple's iPhone sales have fallen for three quarters. The "app economy" has matured, with more people using existing apps than downloading new ones. And Facebook, which has filled users' news feeds with so many ads it can barely add more, is predicting its revenue growth will slump next year. Silicon Valley needs its next big thing, a focus for the concentrated brain power and innovation infrastructure that have made this region the world leader in transformative technology. Just as the valley's mobile era is peaking, the next frontier of growth and innovation has arrived: It's Siri in an Apple iPhone, Alexa in an Amazon Echo, the software brain in Google's self-driving cars, Amazon's product recommendations and, someday, maybe the robot surgeon that saves your life. It's artificial intelligence, software that can "learn" and "think," the latest revolution in tech. "It's going to be embedded in everything," said startup guru Steve Blank, an adjunct professor at Stanford. "We've been talking about artificial intelligence for 30 years, maybe longer, in Silicon Valley. It's only in the last five years, or maybe even the last two years, that this stuff has become useful." Achievements that were "unthinkable only a few years ago" are being made possible by artificial intelligence, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post. "The last 10 years have been about building a world that is mobile-first, turning our phones into remote controls for our lives," Pichai said. "But in the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first." Experts say AI will play an increasingly large role in our lives, transforming how we work, how we live -- and even, perhaps, whether we work or whether we live. Inclusion of AI into virtually every area of computing -- and life -- will bring both progress and upheaval to the Bay Area tech industry, Blank said. "The valley has gone through waves of innovation," Blank said. "We were the semiconductor valley, then we were the PC valley, then we were the web 1.0 valley. Each of those waves was built on a new set of technology and created a whole new set of companies." Already, entire new industries are arising from AI technology, while robot-aided manufacturing surges, opening up opportunities in nearly every area of business, said Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. "It's going to be completely transformative, but at the same time it's going to take time," he said. Major industry players are betting big on "bots," interactive virtual assistants that learn from user inputs. Among the ever-expanding bot army we find Siri and Alexa, Google's Assistant and the many "chatbots" created by companies to facilitate customer transactions, such as Taco Bell's "TacoBot" which understands spoken language to take customer orders via smartphones. "People are suckers for a more efficient way to do things," Etzioni said. "We will see rapid advances in the usefulness of bots." As consumers see AI creep into their devices, the technology is also beginning to play an increasingly expansive role in business. Amazon and Google both offer AI-powered services that can be applied to the data that firms store on those companies' storage clouds. On Wednesday, the Washington Post announced it will use Amazon's AI-based "Polly" text-to-speech software -- which can produce 47 different voices and convert 24 languages -- to create audio versions of articles. And in September, San Francisco's Salesforce unveiled "Einstein," artificially intelligent software that can ingest all of a client company's data and offer solutions for a given problem, such as predicting which sales leads are likely to pan out. Pursuit of AI technology has fueled acquisitions, with established firms globally buying almost 140 AI-focused companies since 2011 -- with 40 deals last year alone -- according to market research firm CB Insights. Intel has rapidly built up its AI offerings through the purchase of Saffron, Movidius and Nervana, which Intel CEO Brian Krzanich referred to in a blog post as "leading-edge accelerants required for the growth and widespread adoption of AI." Although AI has been around since the 1950s, its trajectory started angling upward with the advent of "big data," the enormous information sets made possible by storage technology, large-scale data collection and advances in computing power. This year AI got a poster boy, of sorts. Google's AlphaGo AI software ingested 30 million moves from world-class games of Go, the ancient Chinese strategy board game, and laid waste to 18-time world champion Lee Sedol in three straight games. Teaching software to play games advances technology that can be applied to more serious endeavors. On Tuesday, another Google division, Verily, published results of its successful use of an AI image-analysis algorithm to identify a diabetes-related eye disorder. Verily in 2015 announced a partnership with Johnson & Johnson to develop AI-guided surgical robots, an enterprise spun off into Mountain View-based Verb Surgical. The startup has 200 engineers, some from Verily, working on the software and devices, training the AI by having it "watch" videos from hundreds of surgeries. AI's burgeoning ability to make and learn from decisions is accelerating its impact, said UC Berkeley computer sciences professor Sergey Levine. It is decision-making that sets sophisticated AI programs apart from pattern-recognition AI software, which gets trained to perform tasks on a specific data set, as with photo-identification processes, but then remains "static" without learning on its own, he said. "That's the part that's going to change," Levine said. "It's going to be something that continuously interacts with the environment it's deployed in, and continuously improves itself through its own experience." AI-based products such as household-chores robots or self-driving cars can be networked together, so that what each device learns can be applied across all the devices through "collective learning," Levine said. He foresees "systems that interact with humans using natural language." As AI improves and spreads, it will increasingly replace human labor, taking on tasks and jobs previously done by people, experts say. "I'm very worried about jobs," Etzioni said. "Of all the concerns that float around about AI, AI and jobs is the one to focus on." Lisa Spelman, vice president of Intel's data center group, takes a more optimistic view, noting that AI-powered image recognition, for example, has created many jobs for software engineers. "I see this as similar to many other innovation cycles and technological transformations where there has been that concern," she said. "In the end, it has turned into more opportunities, just different ones." © 2017 San Jose Mercury News syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Ruff is the Director of Western Digital’s Open Source Office. She has been at the center of some of the major technology disruptions in the past 25 years. She enjoys the intersection of business, community, and technology and brings that perspective to everything she does. She first glimpsed the power of open source while at SGI in the '90s and has been building bridges between hardware developers and the open source community ever since. » More about me Learn how you can contribute Open source diversity efforts gain momentum in 2016 Efforts to increase diversity in open source aren't new, but they are starting to show positive results. We look at the 2016 landscape. Posted 16 Dec 2016 Nithya RuffFeed 19up Image by :  Internet Archive Book Images. Modified by Opensource.com. CC BY-SA 4.0 If software is pervasive, shouldn't the people building it be from everywhere and represent different voices? The broadly accepted answer is yes, that we need a diverse set of developers and technologists to build the new digital world. Further, when you look at communities that thrive, they are those that evolve and grow and bring in new voices and perspectives. Because much of the software innovation happening today involves open source software, the open source community can be an entry point for new people in technology roles. This means that the open source community must evolve to stay relevant. There has never been a better time for the open source community to welcome new community members from under-represented groups than now, and the community is rising to the challenge. Efforts to increase diversity in open source are showing results, so let's look at a few examples: 1. Foundations and organizations are increasing outreach efforts. Over the past few years, new foundations have been created to support open source projects. For example, multiple projects fall under the umbrellas of big foundations, such as the Linux Foundation and OpenStack Foundation. Besides being a home for projects, foundations are embracing their roles in curating and sharing best practices, creating on-ramps, and supporting new people in project communities. The Linux Foundation and OpenStack Foundation provide scholarships, travel assistance, training, mentorships, childcare, affinity groups, and more as part of their events and services. (I'm involved in the Linux Foundation-sponsored Women in Open Source events and the Women of OpenStack [WOO] group.) Since the WOO group started in 2014, more women have been attending and speaking at OpenStack-related events and contributing to OpenStack projects. More than 11% of attendees at both LinuxCon North America and OpenStack Summit in Austin in 2016 were women. The Linux Foundation, in partnership with the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), is developing inclusive speaker orientation course for events to ensure that all speakers go through training in what it means to be inclusive. Many tech organizations are addressing the role their company cultures and policies play in increasing diversity. For example, Google launched its Summer of Code program in 2005, and Red Hat launched its Women in Open Source award in 2015. By 2016, many organizations and events were regularly sponsoring networking opportunities for women, such as the LinuxCon North America Women in Open Source Lunch, sponsored by Intel; and the Women's Leadership Community Luncheon at Red Hat's annual summit. 2. Mentorships, scholarship programs, and training are scaling. Software Freedom Conservancy's Outreachy, which was founded in 2010, provides internships to women and members of under-represented groups through mentors and work experience on a specific project. Contributions from Outreachy interns is impressive: The Outreachy organization ranked #9 for kernel contributions in Linux 4.4 and #6 for Linux 4.6 releases. Read the 2016 Kernel Internship Report (PDF) for more detail. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is another successful initiative that has been matching students to open source projects and volunteer mentors for more than a decade. More than 1,200 students and 178 organizations participated in GSoC 2016. Hopefully the success of these programs will help inspire more mentorship programs in 2017. In 2016, annual Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) attracted around 15,000 from more than 80 countries. The GHC annual Open Source Day is an all-day hackathon that brings attendees together to network, contribute to good causes, and build their GitHub profiles in a safe environment. 3. Conferences are improving diversity among speakers and attendees. Conferences such as OSCON, LinuxCon, PyCon, SCaLE, and OpenStack Summit play a big role in showcasing and supporting diversity. The impact of seeing women and under-represented minorities on stage and hearing new perspectives is powerful in changing our perception of who is part of the open source community. O'Reilly's OSCON is showing noticeable improvement in the diversity of its speakers and talks. I spoke with Rachel Roumeliotis, Strategic Content Director and OSCON Chair for O'Reilly about how OSCON raises the bar every year to showcase amazing new voices. She says organizers actively seek out new voices and perspectives, and they want to reflect the changing community and perhaps project what it could look like. (Read Opensource.com's OSCON article collection for examples.) Conferences are also investing in the next generation of programmers and contributors through dedicated co-located events. One great example of this is SCALE: The Next Generation, a track hosted at the Southern California Linux Expo, an annual community event. I love how SCaLE helps teach kids about programming and technology. Young community members, such as Keila Banks, Justin King, and Schuyler St. Leger, have spoken at this event. Often the kids at conferences have relatives working in technology who are highly involved in encouraging and championing young people. Keila, for example, is the daughter of Phillip Banks, one of the SCaLE event organizers. She got her start speaking at SCALE when she was 11, and she gave a keynote at OSCON in 2014, at the ripe old age of 13. When I talked to Keila, she found programming to be as natural as other subjects at school, and she loves the Python language, including its community. Young people are learning open source technical skills from programming, animation, video editing, digital drawing, and picture editing, and conferences are rapidly embracing and catering to this new generation of community members. 4. The data confirms progress. Without data, determining whether we are making progress is difficult. We need to measure the percent of contributions from women and members of under-represented groups, learn about projects successfully attracting and retaining a diverse group of contributors, and then share what we learn across projects. Spain-based Bitergia's Chief Data Officer Daniel Izquierdo took the initiative to do this for OpenStack and for the Linux kernel and shared the results in 2016. (Read Rikki Endsley's recent interview with Daniel, Analyzing gender diversity in the OpenStack community.) Bitergia plans to do gather diversity metrics for Apache Software Foundation projects in the near future. The data Bitergia has been collecting on the diversity of contributions and community growth over time shows trending in the right direction. We still need a new way to measure the overall health of an open source project, which means that, in addition to measuring the number of contributors, downloads, and issues resolved, we should track how diverse communities are and how welcoming they are to new contributors. These measurements could help us recognize projects that have great on-boarding and retention practices and that have built diverse and vibrant communities. Learn more about Bitergia's work in gender diversity metrics on their blog. 5. The definition of 'contributions' is expanding, and on-boarding is improving. Historically non-code-related open source contributions haven't been recognized as contributions. Measuring code contributions and code reviews has been easier than measuring other types of contributions, such as documentation, marketing, legal representation, and graphic design. Increasingly open source projects and organizations are recognizing, encouraging, valuing, and supporting contributions in all areas of the open source ecosystem, and they are making it easier for new contributors to join communities. GitHub has become the tool of choice for internal development in companies changing their culture to be collaborative and agile. I asked Brandon Keepers, head of open source at GitHub, about their initiatives. He explained that GitHub launched a survey to help them understand their changing community and its needs. His team is also working to provide best practice frameworks for project leaders to help them run better projects, which includes sample codes of conduct and README templates. 6. Allies are taking more active roles in improving diversity. From its beginning, the Ada Initiative founders recognized the roles male allies play in increasing diversity in technology. The organization was formed in 2011 by Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner and worked on making technical conferences harassment-free, providing training on how to overcome impostor syndrome, and provided practical skills training for male allies. Many men want to support diversity efforts and create a more inclusive culture, but may not know how to help. The Ada Initiative and NCWIT skills training are examples of practical approaches to showing male allies how they can support gender equality and build inclusive cultures. What will 2017 bring? As 2016 comes to a close, we're seeing real progress in how we welcome new people and encourage them to stay in the open source community, but there is still much to be done.

 Tech titans are meeting with Trump today Rob Price Dec. 14, 2016, 4:29 AM 10,786 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook is one of the expected attendees. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Some of the most powerful and high-profile leaders from the technology industry are scheduled to meet with US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday. The meeting has the potential to be a tense affair: Silicon Valley was overwhelmingly opposed to the Republican president-elect before the election, and during the campaign he repeatedly railed against the business practices of the industry. The discussion is likely to centre on jobs and immigration — issues on which the tech community and Trump seem likely to clash. The meeting, due to be held at Trump Tower in New York, has a star-studded guest list: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt from Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Tesla's Elon Musk, IBM's Ginni Rometty, and Brian Krzanich from Intel are among the attendees, according to a roundup from The New York Times. (Sidenote: Jack Dorsey, the cofounder and CEO of Twitter — a social network beloved by Trump — was not invited.) It's all about jobs A key issue on the table will be jobs and immigration. Silicon Valley is heavily reliant on immigrant workers, hiring engineers and other employees from all over the world — but Trump ran his campaign in opposition to immigration, promising to build a wall along America's southern border and to halt Muslim immigration altogether. Trump has been critical of the H-1B skilled-worker visa program, which the tech industry uses heavily, saying in a statement in March: "I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions." Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has expressed concern that there are too many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley. The attendees will be hoping that Trump is prepared to be more pragmatic about the issue than his rhetoric on the campaign trail might have suggested. The tech industry and Trump do not get along Several of the attendees at the meeting have previously been the subject of Trump's ire. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly went after Bezos, the Amazon CEO who also owns The Washington Post, which aggressively reported on Trump during the campaign. President-elect Donald Trump. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Trump said Bezos had "a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much," while Bezos countered that Trump's strategy of targeting the news media "erodes democracy." (Bezos later promised to keep an "open mind" after Trump's election.) Trump attacked Apple over its refusal to help unlock an iPhone for the FBI in February, asking, "Who do they think they are?" and calling for a boycott. He has also targeted the company for building its iPhones in China. One of Trump's few backers in Silicon Valley is Peter Thiel, the Paypal cofounder turned billionaire investor and Facebook board member. Thiel supported Trump's candidacy, speaking at the Republican National Convention in the summer. He now sits on the president-elect's transition team, and he helped organise Wednesday's meeting. In November, Trump sat down for a similar off-the-record meeting with media executives. It was reportedly an awkward affair, with Trump attacking the assembled execs over their coverage of his campaign and their failure to anticipate his victory. Business Insider will bring you more on Wednesday's meeting as it happens. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

The data, sourced from the Firefox Telemetry system, is aggregated and anonymized then published on the report website. While I’m sure that data is helpful to developers, it also provides a detailed look at the current state of the dwindling PC market (among those that use Firefox, anyway). To say that it’s sad would be an understatement. According to the latest data, Intel processors are found in 86 percent of machines although nearly 70 percent of processors only have two physical cores and clock speeds are most commonly in the 2.3GHz to 2.69GHz range. As for memory, a third of all users only have 4GB of RAM with 2GB being the next most common amount (in 18.74 percent of systems). At this point, it should come as little surprise that the majority of PCs – 44.86 percent – are running Windows 7. Microsoft’s latest OS is only found on 25.67 percent of machines while Windows XP, an operating system released more than 15 years ago, accounts for 10.36 percent of the share. The predominant display resolution, meanwhile, is 1,366 x 768 with Intel-branded (integrated) GPUs being the most popular. The data may be difficult for hardware enthusiasts to process but it’s very much a reality. With consumers now utilizing smartphones and tablets as their primary devices, there is little reason for them to spend money on a new PC.

Marsha Blackburn: Russia Did Not Influence Election (AP) By Todd Beamon   |   Friday, 16 Dec 2016 07:34 PM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    President Barack Obama said Friday that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee — but "I don't think you can blame Russia for the outcome of the election," Rep. Marsha Blackburn said. "We're not talking about the outcome of the election," the Tennessee Republican, an adviser to President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, told Wolf Blitzer on CNN. "We're talking about the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's G-mail account. "What we do know is that there was a hack — and let's leave it to the House and Senate Intel committees to decide exactly who was behind what. "We know Russia is a bad actor," Blackburn added. "We know they're not an honest actor many times. "My hope is now that we're going to see some legislation passed through Congress that will put some more tools in place that both the public sector and the private sector need in dealing with these hits." Blackburn denied that the Republican Party was being "dismissive" in denying Russia's role in the hackings. "I don't think anyone is being dismissive," she told Blitzer. "No one that I have visited with, talked with or spoken with regarding this issue has been dismissive of the Russians and their intentions. "They are quite concerned about the increase in propaganda that they have out there, not only in the U.S., but also the global marketplace. "You have to get in behind this situation and address it."

Not this time. Hillary Clinton's victory in the popular — but not the electoral — vote and uncertainty about Donald Trump have generated unusual interest in an event that is usually a political footnote. Under the Constitution and federal law, the real presidential election takes place this year on Dec. 19, when presidential electors meet in the 50 state capitols and Washington, DC. As the electors vote, many say they have been besieged by phone calls and e-mails. One already elector resigned. Another said he won't vote as his state did. And electors in three states went to court seeking authority to vote as they please. Related: Drama-Filled Electoral College Vote a Fitting Ending to 2016 Election Meanwhile, a petition targeting "conscientious electors" has nearly 5 million signatures. Martin Sheen, who played a president on The West Wing, and a cadre of other actors have a YouTube appeal to electors asking them give them to Hillary Clinton or anyone else other than Donald Trump. Filmmaker Michael Moore published an impassioned plea to the Electoral College's GOP members "to vote your conscience" and has vowed to pay the fines of electors who are penalized by their states for not keeping the pledge to vote for Trump.

As Arizonans went to the polls Nov. 8, 49 percent of them may have thought they were voting for Donald Trump and Mike Pence, but they actually elected Bruce Ash, Walter Begay, and 10 other people.

It takes 270 votes to win because the 12th Amendment requires a candidate to get a majority. As the president of the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden will preside over the joint session and announce the results. It sometimes happens that a vice president ends up announcing his own defeat. It happened to Richard Nixon in 1960, reading the votes for John F. Kennedy, and most recently to Al Gore in 2000, declaring the votes for George W. Bush. This year, members of a group calling itself The Electors Trust, including Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, say they've been contacted by dozens of electors seeking legal advice. Many are asking, must they vote as their states did? Related: Why We Have the Electoral College A total of 29 states have laws that bind the electors, requiring them to cast their votes for whichever candidate won that state's popular vote. But the laws are weak, providing only nominal penalties. The Supreme Court ruled in 1952 that states do not violate the Constitution when they require electors to pledge that they will abide by the popular vote. But the justices have never said whether it is constitutional to enforce those pledges. Courts in Colorado and Washington state have rejected pleas from electors to be released from requirements to vote as their states did, although the electors in Colorado appealed the lower court ruling, according to The Associated Press. The state Supreme Court will have until Monday at noon, when electors cast their ballots, to decide. In California, a federal judge held a hearing on Friday morning on a similar request from an elector, Vinzenz Koller, who said he cannot vote for Hillary Clinton. Elsewhere, Christopher Suprun, a Texas paramedic, said he will not vote for the candidate who won his state's election. "Donald Trump lacks the foreign policy experience and demeanor needed to be commander in chief," he wrote in a New York Times op-ed. Another Republican elector from Texas, Art Sisneros, resigned in late November. A vote for Trump "would bring dishonor to God," he said. Eighteen actors and other artists, including Martin Sheen and Debra Messing, urged Republican electors in a video that went viral to "go down in the books as an American hero" and vote for anyone other than Trump. In a letter to James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, 68 presidential electors from 17 states asked for a briefing on why the U.S. believes Russia was behind cyberattacks intended to influence the election. However the intelligence community said it will not discuss the Russian hacks until a review ordered by President Obama is completed in January. On Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said they won't brief Electors or Congress until the review is done. Related: U.S. Officials: Putin Personally Involved in U.S. Election Hack While the electors are generating an usual amount of attention, it is unlikely to have much effect. Republican officials say party lawyers have been in contact with the 306 Republican electors and believe only a few may vote for someone other than Donald Trump. A survey by the AP reached a similar result. After interviewing 330 of the 538 electors, the AP found "widespread Democratic aggravation with the electoral process but little expectation that the hustle of anti-Trump maneuvering can derail him." Asked during a Friday news conference about the fairness of the electoral college, President Obama stopped short of saying it should be phased out but called the system "a vestige, or a carryover, from an earlier vision of how our federal government was going to work." "There are some structures in our political system as envisioned by the Founders that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats," he said.

Neowin Login Sign up News Features Forums Deals More Subscribe Store Chat on IRC Send Tip Write for Neowin About Us Advertising Facebook Twitter Follow @neowinfeed Google+ 7 Days: A week of Microsoft updates, more Yahoo hoohah, and Apple Watch wah-wah-waaahhh By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · Dec 17, 2016 with 0 comments 7 Days is a weekly roundup of the Editors' picks of what's been happening in the world of technology - written with a dash of humor, a hint of exasperation, and an endless supply of (Irish) coffee. Christmas is just a week away, but if you were expecting things to slow down across the tech industry with the festive break approaching, you couldn't have been more wrong. This will be the last edition of 7 Days for the year, but there's plenty to get through, so let's get on with it! Our journey this week begins with another massive security disaster for Yahoo. In September, the firm admitted to a data breach that occurred in 2014, which compromised the data of over 500 million users. This week, it confessed to another breach, affecting up to one billion accounts - and it looks like Verizon is now thinking of abandoning its $4.83 billion Yahoo acquisition as a result. Note-taking platform Evernote got itself into a dreadful mess of a very different kind on Wednesday, as details emerged of its new privacy policy, allowing some of its employees to read users' notes. Unsurprisingly, many users were furious about this, and it didn't take long for the company to reverse course and issue an apology. Microsoft co-founder and celebrated philanthropist Bill Gates launched a $1 billion fund to stimulate research and development of clean energy technology. The fund is also being backed by other investors that include Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Europe is taking on America's GPS and Russia's GLONASS satellite navigation systems with its own Galileo system, which went live this week. Galileo promises even greater accuracy than existing systems, and will be compatible with many newer smartphones via a software update. Last week, Nokia heralded the return of its brand to mobile devices, announcing that new Android smartphones are on the way. The first Nokia-branded handset to emerge from its new partnership was unveiled on Tuesday... but it's not an Android device. Back in October, Apple unexpectedly announced the delay of its "magical" AirPods, the new wireless earbuds that no-one asked for, but which it decided to launch as a result of its unwelcome decision to remove the headphone jack from its newest iPhones. On Tuesday, the company finally opened pre-orders for the AirPods, priced at $159. If you lose one of your AirPods - and let's face it, you probably will - Apple will charge you $69 for a replacement. For some similarly magical/stupid reason, Apple won't be launching its new BeatsX wireless headphones - which it announced in September - until February. On the software side of things, it's been a busy week for Apple, with plenty of updates released: iOS 10.2 rolls out, including new TV app and delicious bacon emoji iOS 10.2.1, macOS 10.12.3 and tvOS 10.1.1 betas available for developers iOS 10.2.1 and macOS 10.12.3 Public Betas released Apple also rolled out the general release of tvOS 10.1 and watchOS 3.1.1 on Monday. However, it soon pulled watchOS 3.1.1 after widespread reports that the update was permanently bricking Apple Watches. Oh dear. In September, Google delayed the launch of Android Wear 2.0 until next year. On Tuesday, it released its fourth Developer Preview of the new smartwatch OS, bringing a wide range of improvements and new features. Intriguingly, Google also bought Cronologics, the company that launched the first smartwatch with support for Amazon's Alexa digital assistant. Originally developed as 'Project Brillo', Google announced the launch of its Internet of Things platform this week. Appropriately named 'Android Things', it also released its first Developer Preview, promising regular updates, security fixes and patches. Rarely does a week go by without details of some ghastly new security issue being highlighted on Android devices. This week, it emerged that a load of Android handsets - including two from Lenovo were found to have trojans embedded in their firmware. While Google has already released Android 7.1.1 Nougat, most manufacturers haven't even started to upgrade their devices to Android 7.0. Some have, though, while others are testing their Nougat updates; here are the latest arrivals: Android 7.0 begins rolling out to the Moto G4 and G4 Plus (no, seriously, this time) Sony expands Nougat rollout to Xperia X and Xperia X Compact OnePlus releases new Android 7.0 preview - but only for the OnePlus 3 OnePlus 3T gets OxygenOS 3.5.4 update... based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow Huawei launched a new Android 'concept' phone, the Honor Magic, designed to help the company "pre-evaluate uncertain future technologies". Curiously, the device has some pretty conventional specs, although it does include some interesting and distinctive features, but rumors that it would have a curved-edge display proved to be unfounded. Meanwhile, it looks like Samsung will be going all-in on curved displays with its next Galaxy flagship. A report claims that the Galaxy S8 will only be offered with a dual-curved screen, with no 'conventional' flat display option. Last week, Verizon foolishly stated that it had no plans to release an update to block network access for the Galaxy Note7, despite its US carrier rivals stating that they would do so. Verizon said that it didn't want to prevent users from making calls during the holiday season or in an emergency situation - even though Samsung's fiery flagship has already been responsible for creating emergency situations, leading to its ban from all flights in the US. This week, Verizon finally saw sense and reversed its position. Let's hope Samsung's future flagships don't have similar overheating problems, or things could get very uncomfortable while wearing its new Gear VR 2 headset, which the company confirmed this week. Samsung is also working on a mixed-reality 'holographic' headset, similar to Microsoft's HoloLens. You can now ask Google to play Netflix videos and search through your Photos, thanks to a new update available for its voice-activated Home speaker hub. But Google's plans to build its own self-driving cars have reached the end of the road - for now, at least. Google's parent firm Alphabet has suspended development of its own purpose-built autonomous vehicles, and has instead spun off its efforts into a separate company, Waymo, which will develop self-driving technology for use by other manufacturers. Dozens of technology firms of all sizes have signed a pledge against the creation of a database of Muslim Americans, proposed by US President-elect Donald Trump. Microsoft made a public statement on the matter too, saying that such a database would be discriminatory, and against its values, and that it "wouldn't do any work to build a registry of Muslim Americans." Microsoft's struggles in the mobile space have been well documented - and with its global smartphone market share dropping to 0.4%, you might well be wondering if the company even plans to show up at the next Mobile World Congress. Don't worry, though - Microsoft will "do great things" at MWC 2017. Coship voiced serious concerns about the future of Windows 10 Mobile in October, and questioned the value of continuing to invest in the platform. It said that it would crowdfund its next Windows phone to gauge the level of public interest in its devices - but that crowdfunding campaign ended today with just 30 backers worldwide, reaching only 2.6% of its $100,000 goal. Microsoft added the two newest Windows 10 Mobile flagships - the Alcatel IDOL 4S and HP Elite x3 - to its Windows Device Recovery Tool on Monday, raising some interesting questions. It included a reference to an "Open Market" version of the IDOL 4S, a device that is currently available exclusively on T-Mobile in the US. Alcatel later confirmed that the handset will be made available in "various markets in Europe". The release notes also mentioned an "Elite x3 Telstra" model, hinting at a variant of the device locked to Australian carrier Telstra. However, HP confirmed to Neowin that it refers to an unlocked Australian model of the phone with compatibility for Telstra's network. The Elite x3 is now available with a chunky discount in the US. Microsoft has cut $150 (19%) off its price, as well as slashing the Lumia 950 XL's price by $200 (40%), reducing it to $299. Over in the UK, Surface Book and Pro 4 buyers can now get 10% off, as well as a free Xbox One S, from the Microsoft Store. Another UK retailer is offering the same deal, along with 10% off many other premium Windows 10 PCs, including a free three-year guarantee. Back in the US, Microsoft has launched its Holiday Super Sale, offering huge savings on its Surface devices, along with discounts and freebies on the Xbox One S, up to $1,100 off Windows 10 PCs, and lots more deals on wearable devices, drones, speakers, mice, keyboards, monitors, and more. On Monday, Microsoft announced launch plans for its new Surface Book with Performance Base in eight new markets. Microsoft also declared its Surface Hub collaboration device a resounding success, revealing some interesting details about sales, and announcing a new 'Try-and-Buy' program for companies thinking about making a purchase. Chinese manufacturer Chuwi revealed its new Windows 10 LapBook, with a 14.1-inch display and Intel's new Apollo Lake processors. The company told Neowin that it expects the device to launch for under $300. And it looks like fellow Chinese firm Xiaomi may be preparing to launch a Windows 10 version of its new 9.7-inch Mi Pad 3 tablet, with an Intel Core m3 processor and 8GB RAM. This week was Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, which meant there were plenty of updates available: Windows 10 build 14393.576 for PC and Mobile (Version 1607 / Anniversary Update) Windows 10 build 10586.713 for PC (Version 1511 / November Update) Windows 10 build 10240.17202 for PC (Version 1507 / original GA release branch) Six critical security flaws patched in Windows, Internet Explorer, Edge and Office However, one update recently pushed to Windows 10 PCs caused more harm than good, disrupting DHCP functionality, and preventing systems from connecting to networks. However, Microsoft has since issued a fix to resolve that problem. Microsoft released Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14986 to PCs in the Slow ring, just one week after its Fast ring rollout. ISOs for build 14986 will be coming next week - but Microsoft has confirmed that there won't be any more preview builds until 2017. On Tuesday, Microsoft revealed the Cortana Skills Kit and Devices SDK - a major announcement. Third-parties will now be able to connect with the digital assistant more easily, greatly expanding its usefulness, while the Devices SDK will allow manufacturers to bring Cortana to their own hardware. One of the first devices to be powered by Cortana was teased in a video this week; a high-end speaker built by Harman Kardon, coming next year. Cortana, Bing, and other Microsoft services will continue to benefit from HERE location data, after the two companies signed a multi-year agreement, which will include real-time traffic information and live public transit data in Bing Maps. Microsoft's Edge browser will begin blocking Flash content by default with the arrival of the Windows 10 Creators Update next year. However, a security researcher discovered a bug within Edge's SmartScreen feature, which could allow scammers to create legitimate-looking warning messages and block reputable websites. There were a few problems for Microsoft's Skype Preview app earlier this week too, as many users reported that the app was crashing on start-up - but Microsoft fixed the issue a day later. The company is now looking to the future of its communications platform, and - like it or not - Skype's future will be filled with bots, bots, and more bots. On Android, the future may well be Skype Mingo, which is now available as an alpha release. The new app aims to be a single communications hub, including support for native calling, SMS and contacts management. Meanwhile, on iOS, Microsoft updated Skype to clear unseen messages from the notification panel after the app is opened, along with various other features. A new fly-out menu is being tested for OneDrive, offering an improved user experience. The first public beta of Adobe XD also arrived on Windows 10 - but despite being a UWP app, it's not being offered through the Windows Store. Microsoft announced this week that it's bringing Dolby Atmos audio support to its Xbox One consoles and Windows 10 PCs next year. And Microsoft rolled out a new update to the Xbox One and Xbox One S this week, bringing dramatic improvements in download speeds, better performance with wireless controllers, and enhancements to background downloads and audio. After passing the 300-game milestone last week, Microsoft added six more Xbox 360 titles to the list of those playable on the Xbox One on Thursday. Just in time for the final festive shopping frenzy, Microsoft has slashed $50 off its Xbox One S bundles, reducing them to as little as $249. If you buy from the Microsoft Store, you'll also get an additional free game, plus a $30 gift code. Minecraft's expanding universe is growing again this month as Microsoft is releasing the Fallout Mash-Up Pack for console versions of the blocky world-building game. Nintendo sold almost 200,000 of its coveted NES Classic consoles in the US alone last month. But if you were one of those who wanted the new NES but couldn't get your hands on one, this $59 console might just satisfy your retro desires. If you're already quivering with excitement at the thought of buying Nintendo's new console, there's some good news for you... if you're in North America. The company will be giving people the opportunity to try out its new Switch console in multiple cities before its launch. But of course, Nintendo's biggest news this week was the release of its new mobile game on iOS, Super Mario Run. The game shot straight to the top of the App Store charts within just a few hours of its release - but don't worry, Android fans; it'll be coming to you next year as well. As for Windows phone users... well, just keep praying for a miracle. Our odyssey across the tech world this week - and this year - is drawing to a close, but before I head off to deck the halls, don some gay apparel, and drink a gallon of eggnog, let me first share the extraordinary sight of Android 7.1 Nougat running on the Nokia Lumia 520 and Lumia 525 Windows phones. You can check out the full videos here. Miracles do happen, after all. But our journey ends in Japan, where a company has created a device that can project a holographic companion for lonely people, misanthropes, or those who have had enough of their families over the stress-inducing festive season. Happy holidays! Bonus content Before I disappear to gorge myself on Christmas pudding, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Vlad Dudau thoroughly tested the new flagship OnePlus 3T in his review - and... well, let's just say he was pretty impressed it with it. Vlad also published a mini-review of the dodocool foldable Bluetooth headphones, and given that they cost just $18, they certainly sound pretty good - especially considering that he consistently got over eight hours of audio playback from them before the battery ran out. Apple's $159 AirPods can only manage five! Our readers can also get a 20% discount - click through to the review to pick up your code! Robbie Khan reviewed the Mpow multimedia projector, a low-cost solution with 1080p video support and 1200 lumens of brightness. There's a lot to like about the device, including its range of input sources, and its well-featured remote, but there's certainly room for improvement. Neowin readers can also enjoy a 10% discount when buying one - you'll find the discount in the review, so check it out! And finally, if you're still looking for the ideal gifts for the tech-lovers in your life this Christmas, Rich Woods put together a very handy Holiday Shopping Guide. There are some great suggestions in there! 7 Days will be taking a break for the holiday season, but it'll be back in 2017. Don't worry, though - Neowin will still be keeping you covered on all the official news, updates, and insights from around the world of technology over the festive period, so stay tuned!

Lifestyle Tech Apple employees break their vow of secrecy to describe the best — and worst — things about working for Apple Jim Edwards, Business Insider Sunday 18 December 2016 15:46 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech Apple chief executive Tim Cook unveils the latest Macbook Pro range during an event at the Apple Headquarters in Cupertino, California EPA Apple has a strict code of secrecy that it expects all employees to live by. Anyone who breaks it is fired.  Unsurprisingly, employees rarely speak publicly about what it is like to work there.  Luckily, there are several Quora threads written by former and current employees devoted to answering questions about life inside the Fruit Company. We put some highlights together with info we got from our own sources, and reports elsewhere.  Their comments reveal how employees are prepared to pull all-nighters at a moment's notice, how their trash is monitored by security, and how much they enjoy working with the best. ↓↓↓ New interns get a box that contains the following hardcore message: (Quora) From Christina Quan, Apple software development intern. If Apple rejects your internship application, forget about trying again. Apple has software that prevents would-be interns from applying twice. So if you're rejected, that's it. According to Mac Consultant Frank Lazar: "Apple is such a golden opportunity for interns that it can be extremely choosy about who gets to play in their circular sandbox. They look for interns with amazing talent, and in their view, if you failed to show evidence of talent the first time around, a little experience somewhere else isn’t going to change anything." "We don't waste time with the dumb." UX designer Luis Abreu had a grueling job interview process in a failed attempt to get into Apple. He described it on his blog: "3 screening calls, 5 FaceTime interviews, a trip to Cupertino for 5 two-person interviews lasting a whole day and a lunch at the newest Café Macs. In the end, I got a shallow no." During one interview he was told, “We don’t waste time with the dumb.” Once you get in, "it's a tough place to be if you're more than 20 pounds overweight." Anonymous: "There are a lot more fit and good looking people at Apple, than otherwise. It's actually pretty ridiculous. Almost everyone is really athletic: many people do triathlons, bike races, and marathon. It's a tough place to be if you're more than 20 pounds overweight, but then again, it can also be that extra push you need to get in shape. I know of people who've lost 60 pounds and are no longer pre-diabetic because they started going cycling with their coworkers over lunch." "Trash bins were monitored." Tim Su wrote this list describing secrecy at Apple:  - code names for every product - no one referred to products any other way - team members who are also on "special" teams don't tell their coworkers what they do - black curtains and frosted windows - trash bins were monitored "Guys in the developer group had to show up for meetings at 4:00am." David Graham, former writer at Apple: "I remember when bleary-eyed guys in the developer group had to show up for meetings at 4:00am to allow for time-zone differences around the world. They had to do it every day, and I’m sure it disrupted their personal lives." "Apple employees don't just use Macs — they use really buggy Macs, often with really buggy apps." Brent Royal-Gordon, code writer: "Internally, most devices are running test builds of all the software on them, often updating every couple of weeks with the very latest code from the engineering teams. So Apple employees don't just use Macs—they use really buggy Macs, often with really buggy apps. People on the iOS teams often use really buggy iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches, too. This ensures that the company catches a lot of bugs before anyone on the outside ever sees the software." Apple products are built in factories that run on ... Microsoft Windows. In 2014, CEO Tim Cook tweeted a photo of an Apple factory in Asia he had visited. The manufacturing line was run using screens that clearly showed Microsoft's Windows operating system. That is no surprise: Certain industrial CNC milling programs only run on Windows. In the stores, there is a lot of clapping. Renee Morales, former Apple Store Specialist: "There will be a lot of clapping. As a new hire you'll get ‘clapped in.’ At the end of every shift meeting there's clapping. When someone quits, on their last day they get ‘clapped out’. Sometimes just for kicks to make a little kid feel good you'll clap. ….there's just a lot of clapping." You might get death threats from customers whose devices break down. An Apple store worker told Business Insider: "I have had death threats before. I had someone, I can’t even remember why — it may have been an out-of-warranty fix — who told me that because we wouldn’t repair it for free that they would wait outside until I finished work to run me down with their car." You will have to learn Apple's weird internal secret culture — quickly. Wei Sun, Data Science / Software Engineering: "Almost everything will be at least slightly different from your previous job. If you’re an engineer, there are custom internal tools, unusual practices, and odd office culture norms — even more so than is typical at other companies. Questions should be asked as often as possible during your first month; don’t be afraid to ask." "Furthermore, since secrecy is so important at Apple, different teams’ cultures had a chance to become incredibly different from each other. When working in cross-functional projects, take the time to learn about the other teams’ preferred communication styles and other peculiarities. This will save you a lot of time." Apple controls what you talk about with your spouse. Justin Maxwell was a user interface designer: "The measures that Apple takes to protect its creative and intellectual environment are unparalleled in the valley, and it's been a disappointing experience since leaving there. Apple's security policy extends to blogs, to speaking engagements, to what we talk about with our spouses. Most people get it and respect it. The ones who don't -- the ones who need to put Apple under their name so they can get a speaking gig at SxSW -- are kindly ushered to move on." "If I was still at Apple, I would not be responding to this question, nor would I feel wronged for not being able to." Apple makes grammar and punctuation changes in its internal documents in order to track leaks. After Business Insider obtained a couple of leaked memos from retail chief Angela Ahrendts, the company began making changes to its internal communications to help it figure out where the leaks came from. It now sends differently worded memos to different sections of the company in hopes of tracking leaks back to the source when those memos are quoted in the media. "It's not the place for children." Anonymous: "It's an older demographic working there, not the 24-year old MBAs, most seem to be late 30's to 40's, super smart but with real life experience, too. There aren't any Nerf guns or any of that crap, just people past all that and at the top of their game. It's not the place for children." "I've been in meetings at 4pm where a dozen people decide we are going to all work all night that night." Anonymous: "Apple comes first.  Not to say you can't have some personal life or even a pretty normal one, but when stuff gets crazy, work comes first ahead of all else. I've been in meetings at 4pm where a dozen people decide we are going to all work all night that night in the office on a problem.  No discussion about 'hey, I have to pick up my kids' or 'let me call home first' - everyone nods and agrees, no hesitation." "You are in the office every day unless you are sick or dead." Anonymous: "No work from home. The company culture wants everyone face to face every day and they are very up-front and clear about it. You are in the office every day unless you are sick or dead. Nobody watches what time you are in every day but telecommute is something they very vocally say is not and will not be part of the culture." They will email you in hospital. Former Apple employee Ben Farrell wrote a lengthy, detailed blog post explaining the reasons he quit the company: "In recent weeks I contracted a nasty incapacitating mosquito born virus and was hospitalised for a short time. However, rather than receiving support, I was emailed a presentation to my hospital bed with a note that it needed to be completed ‘urgently’. Even on the very morning of my wedding I was still being harassed by phone and email to send a report someone had lost." Sunday is a work day. Don Melton was the former director of internet technologies. He did a podcast in which he described Apple's insane work schedule: "Sunday is a work night for everybody at Apple because it’s the exec meeting the next day. So you had your phone out there, you were sitting in front of your computer, it didn’t matter if your favorite show was on." Some hiring managers discriminate against older employees. There is a great story about JK Scheinberg in the New York Times:  Scheinberg was "the engineer at Apple who led the effort that moved the Mac to Intel processors. A little restless after retiring in 2008, at 54, he figured he'd be a great fit for a position at an Apple store Genius Bar, despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview. 'On the way out, all three of the interviewers singled me out and said, "We'll be in touch,"' he said. 'I never heard back.'" "I'd scare the engineer by telling them how bad things would be if anyone inside or outside knew what I was going to ask them to do." Simon Woodside, program manager in Core OS: "Having all these secrets was difficult from my perspective. I couldn't really engage in idle banter with my colleagues for fear of slipping something out." "... I'd scare the engineer by telling them how bad things would be if anyone inside or outside knew what I was going to ask them to do. They would verify with their director, and hopefully be able to fix the relevant problem. We'd slip them some PC hardware if needed or preferably use Virtual PC or the like to be more inconspicuous. They certainly couldn't tell their co-workers about this work." "Personally, I didn't talk either ... my close friends and family knew I was working on some secret project but they didn't find out what until Steve himself made the announcement. Apple had total control of the message. The secrecy paid off big time for the company." There is a serious risk of burnout. Steve Fenwick, hardware engineer: "You don’t work at Apple unless you are seriously motivated to work there. The ones who are there for a check, or stock, are the ones who burn out first and fastest." You will meet a LOT of different people with very different backgrounds. Rodrigo Estrada Gil, former maps engineer: "In my office there is a sports photographer, a documentary filmmaker, a pole dancer, a folk musician, engineers, translators, QA testers, a nurse, a forklift driver, advertising creatives, videogame testers, a trance producer, marketing people, a screenwriter, a documentary producer, ex-housewives, a Pink Floyd cover band singer, a pole dancer, a biologist, a theoretical physicist, a costumier, etc." “On a regular basis you either get positive feedback or are told to stop doing stupid s--t.” Andrew Borovsky, a former Apple designer: Every week, the highest-level execs review every aspect of Apple's business, Fortune reported: “From a design perspective, having every junior- level designer getting direct executive-level feedback is killer,” says Andrew Borovsky, a former Apple designer who now runs 80/20, a New York design shop. “On a regular basis you either get positive feedback or are told to stop doing stupid s--t.” Borovsky now works at CADRE. Folks who work in Apple's stores are so poorly paid they often cannot afford to buy the products they sell. An anonymous store worker told Business Insider: "I had a friend who worked there who absolutely loved the products and would go into his overdraft, go into debt, to buy the latest Apple product. It is crazy. One of the managers had to leave because his landlord wouldn’t renew his lease. He had to leave the store because he couldn’t afford to even move into a new studio flat on an Apple Manager salary. I think he went back to live with his parents. He was in his late 30s. Maybe 40." Ariel Maislos: Stay paranoid and keep running. The former CEO of Flash memory company Anobit, which was acquired by Apple, told ZDNet: "They say that Intel is full of paranoids, but at Apple, 'they' really are after you."  "At Apple, you have to run ahead just to stay in place, and there are very high expectations of everyone. Apple expects everything you do to be amazing." "Paranoid management, disrespect, constant tension, and long hours." Anonymous: "Generally speaking it is a pressure cooker and all communication is one directional (guess which way that is)."  "... Paranoid management, disrespect, constant tension, and long hours sum up most of the real culture in operations ... Most of the people in SDM (supply demand management) see it as something they need to suck up for a few painful years after b-school so they can move on to a better gig with the Apple brand on their resume. Like the investment banking of tech." "... Work here at your own risk.  On the upside, cafe food is pretty good and dress is casual." Andrew Guan, Apple China: It can be like a cult. "I don't know what the internal culture is like in the States, [but] in China, it's pretty insane. Imagine, on the quarter meeting, manager stand on the table and shouting 'WHO ARE YOU!' All the employees raise their hands over the head and answer 'WE ARE APPLE!'" Austin Meyer: Working at Apple is like being at war. A fun war. Meyer told this story, as published on Macrumors: "Being at Apple is almost like what I imagine it would be like to be inside of Boeing during World-War 2: Everything is running at 100% throttle, with knowledge that we are running at 100% of our abilities, and that is enough to guarantee the best product, and guarantee success in the final outcome, but nothing less than a 100% delivery is acceptable. Apple is fighting a War against Microsoft, with a clearly FAR superior product, but with the very clear knowledge that it is a FUN war to fight, that they are clearly WINNING, but that they can NOT slip up even the slightest bit if they want to have ultimate success." Brandon Carson, contractor: "Your work is peer-vetted." "They desire and demand a collaborative atmosphere. Your work is peer-vetted -- we had to present our work to the team and take feedback." "At first I found this a bit disruptive, cause I'm used to working on my own projects in a silo, but at the end of the day, the collaboration ensured a better product. And the work didn't progress too far without checks and balances." "More companies need to operate like that internally." "All the maple surfaces in all the retail stores are harvested at one particular time of the year in Canada so they all look the same." Richard Francis, formerly of Intel, who worked on a project with Apple says on Quora: "The brand is guarded with a zeal that borders on zealous obsession. For instance - I heard (unconfirmed) that all the maple surfaces in all the retail stores are harvested at one particular time of the year in Canada so they all look the same." Back when Tim Cook was only the COO, he gave this explanation for Apple's secrecy: “Well, that is a part of the magic of Apple. And I don’t want to let anybody know our magic because I don’t want anybody copying it,” Fortune reported. Apple used to sell this T-shirt at its HQ campus store.

The organizations need to deploy more comprehensive, secure and reliable security technologies.

The regulations promise to reduce energy consumed by computers by about one-third, saving power customers about $373 million in utility bills by 2027, and figure to have effects far beyond California. Computers and computer monitors in the state use an estimated 5,610 gigawatt-hours of electricity, representing up to 3 percent of residential electricity use and 7 percent of commercial use. “Such efficiency improvements are good for consumers, good for the electric system, good for the environment and frankly good for the green credentials of the manufacturers,” said Andrew McAllister, a commission member who helped guide the new rules through a four-year process of consultations with industry that culminated in Wednesday’s 5–0 vote in Sacramento. The first of the new standards will start Jan. 1, 2018, to be completed in stages by July 1, 2021. One of the rules’ chief targets is desktop computers, which use about four times as much power as a typical laptop or notebook computer. Sometimes called “energy vampires” by efficiency experts, desktops are switched on 77 percent of the time but sit idle for 61 percent of those minutes, according to a recent study from a research team at the University of California, Irvine. Under the new rules, desktops must reduce how much power they draw by about 30 percent when idle by the beginning of 2019 and nearly 50 percent by mid-2021. Most computer monitors will also be affected, with the new rules establishing thresholds for the amount of power a monitor or display can consume even when they are in sleep mode. The standards also apply to laptops, but it’s estimated that about three-quarters of notebook computers on the market already meet the requirements. By 2021, the commission estimates, the new rules will make each desktop about $14 more expensive, but consumers would save more than $55 over five years in reduced energy bills. Monitors will cost about $5 more but are expected to lead to $30 in savings over seven years, the commission said. It said laptops will cost about $1 more, but that energy savings in four years will be more than $2. The Consumer Federation of America praised the regulations and said the cost savings more than make up for the increase in prices. “Believe me, the average consumer who can barely get 2 percent on his CD today, that’s a pretty … good investment,” Mark Cooper, the federation’s director of research, said in a teleconference after the commission passed the rules. Representatives from Intel Corp. and HP Inc. also took part in the teleconference, with HP environmental compliance manager Paul Ford calling the energy limits “ambitious but achievable.” The California Energy Commission has emphasized that manufacturers will have flexibility to meet the standards. The rules apply only to computers in California, but the state’s share of the computer market is so formidable — California by itself accounts for 25 million computer monitors, 23 million laptops and 21 million desktops — the new standards almost certainly will have ripple effects. “It will have a global impact and significantly change the way future energy-efficient desktops and all-in-one computers are designed and manufactured,” said Andrea Deveau, vice president of state policy and politics for TechNet, a trade group whose members include Cisco Systems and Microsoft among its members. But Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank based in Los Angeles, questioned the commission’s cost savings estimates and said consumers already have a built-in incentive to buy energy-efficient computers: keeping their utility bills low. “It’s always easy to say, ‘Hey, this is a really cheap way for people to save a lot of money,’ but for some reason, (consumers) just aren’t doing it,” Moore said. “So we, the energy commission, being all wise and powerful here in Sacramento, can make this happen for them. Because we know as the energy commission, we know far more about computer markets than dumb old computer makers, much less dumb old computer consumers.” The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, worked closely with the commission to develop the new standards. Pierre Delforge, the group’s director of high-tech-sector energy efficiency, said the savings estimates are “relatively conservative” and that rules will lead to huge reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, helping California meet its aggressive climate goals. By California Energy Commission estimates, the efficiency standards will save 2,332 gigawatt-hours per year — the equivalent of the power used by households in San Francisco and San Luis Obispo counties combined.

Pulled out the plug, opened side door to see that my card was burned for no good reason. Warranty expired a year ago I believe. My computer still works fine once I took it out (IGPU, now I've tried Pci-e back up card and it works just fine), so I wonder why did it burn out with light gaming? I clean dust regularly, it wasn't dusty and it wasn't overheating, temps were around 70 to 80 c depending on games I play, haven't overclocked or overvolted the card, it has been ruining on stock from day one. So, with my limited knowledge of electronics I have no clue if this card could be saved somehow, what do you think, is it possible to fix even though the PCB has burned deep from the looks of it?

You know, the sad thing is that I've bought it for gaming, but since I lack time to game I pretty much game on average about 1.5-2h/day, imo that is really light usage for few years and I can't believe it crapped out on me. I have an old GTX 280 as a back up card, I've been torturing it for hours now just to see if my PSU killed my GPU but so far everything is fine and voltages are stable, will leave it for another 5 or 6 hours to run but its most likely just 7970 decided to die on me. I found out that someone else with the same card had the same happen to him/her: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrac..._morning_fire/ It's possible that Gigabyte messed something up in design or something of that sort, has anyone else experienced same or similar problem?     Vicious-Deeds View Public Profile Find all posts by Vicious-Deeds   (#4) sykozis Ancient Guru     Videocard: XFX RX 470 Processor: Core i5 6600K Mainboard: MSI Z170A Gaming Pro Memory: Corsair DDR4-2666 Soundcard: Creative SB-Z PSU: Corsair CX750M 12-18-2016, 18:03 | posts: 19,702 | Location: US East Coast From the looks of it, repairing that card is unlikely.     sykozis View Public Profile Find all posts by sykozis     (#5) Extraordinary Ancient Guru     Videocard: EVGA GTX980 SC ACX2.0 4GB Processor: FX-8350 @ 4.8GHz / H100i Mainboard: ASUS Crosshair V Formula Memory: 12GB 2133 G.Skill Soundcard: Creative SB1040 7.1 PSU: Corsair RM1000 12-18-2016, 18:13 | posts: 16,460 | Location: 127.0.0.1 I agree with Sykosis, too much looks damaged to repair (without a huge amount of effort and time, sourcing the right parts, which may or may not work), time to upgrade IMO     Extraordinary View Public Profile Find all posts by Extraordinary   (#6) Vicious-Deeds Master Guru     Videocard: Radeon HD 7970 3gb Processor: Intel I5-2500K @ 4.0GHz Mainboard: Z68X-UD3h-B3 Memory: 12GB DDR3 Kingston Soundcard: PSU: Cooler Master rs-850-esba 12-18-2016, 18:47 | posts: 317 Yeah, its probably not worth bothering with it, its most likely beyond repair... A friend of mine is offering me Gainward GTX 670 Phantom for $100, though I haven't used nVidia since mx440 lol, and looking at benchmarks its about the same as 7970 if not little stronger. Maybe its wrong forum to ask about nvidia card in Radeon forums, but is it ok card, no problems, defects, etc.? In any case, thanks for responding, its much appreciated.     Vicious-Deeds View Public Profile Find all posts by Vicious-Deeds   (#7) vase Maha Guru     Videocard: - Processor: - Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: - 12-18-2016, 18:49 | posts: 1,359 | Location: #1 http://www.3dmark.com/fs/8257155 the part i circled in is the voltage reference ic, which is 99% the cause of the issue here. it stabilizes voltage/current independently from temps and power input/+draw. the components that are integrated downstream of this IC are affected of course. so either: - internally related - 1) the IC itself was faulty - externally related - 2) you had voltage(=current) spikes in the supplying main circuit (PSU) that strained the IC with out of spec numbers (most probable) 3) your card had a high power limit set and "asked" for more current than the IC could handle. (did you have the power limit manually adjusted?) of course it can be a combination of 1) + 2) or 1) + 3) as well. its a little sad to lose a card over that component. but repairing it still will need you to identify the damaged capacitors/resistors, remove them and the voltage reference, search for exact replacements, clean the circuit board of residue, resolder the new components. way too much effort especially considering not everyone has the tools... if you're an etech guy... sure go for it. although keep in mind the possibility that not all damage may be visible. leaving you with endless trial and error which parts have been affected additionally to the burnt ones. what you SHOULD do in any case though would be measuring your 8pin pcie rails of your PSU under medium gaming load (just as when the problem occurred). because an old faulty PSU (if that was the reason) will render your next new GPU useless again, just a question of time. the coolermaster is by the way known to have a relatively high standard deviation in its line regulation functionality. just as a sidenote.

I still have my GTX 280 torture testing (though the card is messed up, shows some little artifacts in 3d, but I use it for testing purpose and as just in case card because in 2D it works fine, dont care if it burns or dies). Anyways, I managed to find multimeter and I measured 2x6 pins for PCI-E, it shows aprox. 12.12v and 12.11 (it fluctuates by 0.01-0.02v up and down) under full load, that should be great I guess, not sure how stronger 7970 is but I dont think its pulling that many more amps then 280. In HW monitor for 12V it says 12.122V value and 12.120V as minimum (12.172V as maximum). Ive bought this PSU because I've read few reviews on it and found out that it was pretty solid unit with CWT OEM stuff inside, I think there was review on JonnyGuru where he tested it heavily and it passed pretty much everything, and it was on sale so I said why not. But yeah, CM PSU's arent that great mostly. About power limit, if you mean through Afterburner manually adjusting it then yeah, that and Fan speed I manually adjusted, fan speed to more aggressive settings to keep GPU cooler and Power Limit to 125 because it kept dropping to 85 which affected my FPS (instant drop in FPS when Power Limit drops). I had no clue that raising it can kill something, damn... I also have APC UPS unit rated at 2000W, even if there was current spike that should've protected my components, but who knows what the hell happened here.

I had no clue that raising it can kill something, damn... if everything is in order a raised power limit should be fine. just... when push comes to shove... it can be a deciding factor, amongst other preconditions that have to be present of course. again in general, raising power limit (inside the software boundaries, i guess thats +25% - 50% depending on tool ?!) in a perfectly stable system with healthy components is not a problem. if you raised it higher than your software slider offers to (for example through BIOS mods) then it's another story though...

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 18, 2016December 18, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Better Buy: NVIDIA Corporation vs. Broadcom Image Source: Getty Images. As we hurdle toward the finish line, 2016 will go down as a uniquely active year in the semiconductor market. Spurred on by the onset of several generational tech trends — the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and the like — major semiconductor companies have gone on a buying spree to prepare them to cash-in on this growth. Two such names that sit smack dab in the middle of these growth markets are NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , whose shares have handily outperformed their benchmark over the past five years. AVGO data by YCharts . Both NIVIDIA and Broadcom are attractive in their own right, but which semiconductor stock is the better buy today? In this article, we’ll run both stocks through a three-part gauntlet to see if one is more deserving of investors’ attention. 1. Financial fortitude The first prism through which we’ll analyze these semiconductor stocks is the strength of their balance sheets. Though their investment theses lie in their revenue and profit growth stories, investors need to understand a given company’s financial strength in any investment scenario. In looking at NVIDIA and Broadcom, though, both companies appear fine for the most part. A few important distinctions emerge, however. Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio NVIDIA $6.6 billion $2.9 billion $7.4 billion 4.1x Broadcom $2.0 billion $15.0 billion $3.4 billion 2.3x Data Source: NVIDIA & Broadcom Investor Relations, Yahoo! Finance. To get this out of the way, NVIDIA is the clear winner in every category here. NVIDIA has more cash and liquid assets on hand, carries less debt, and generates more cash flow from its core business. There’s really no way around this or disputing it. However, the important nuance in comparing the two companies is that Broadcom’s financial position isn’t a negative either, especially given the company’s intelligent acquisition strategy (see Part 2 below). Simply stated, Broadcom, along with its pre-merger counterpart Avago, has been one of the most prolific acquirers of semiconductor companies, a part of the broader trend of rapid consolidation we’ve seen within the chip industry. In fact, Avago funded part of last year’s transformational merger with Broadcom by issuing $9 billion in fresh debt. The combined company is undeniably stronger as a result of the Broadcom-Avago merger and other recent acquisitions, so Broadcom’s current debt burden is most appropriately viewed as the cost of the company’s transformation into a company poised to dominate the Internet of Things chip market in coming years. Winner: NVIDIA. 2.  Durable competitive advantages Unlike the above section, it’s far harder to determine which company holds stronger competitive advantages. Simply said, both companies are enviably positioned to dominate their markets for years to come. Broadcom’s area of focus is connectivity. The company operates four reporting segments — wired infrastructure, wireless communication, enterprise storage, and industrial and other — that help make our increasingly connected world tick. Its chips appear in smartphones, cellular base stations, Internet of Things devices like smart appliances, data centers, and more. The company’s semiconductors touch multiple points of the connectivity value chain, as well, which is fantastic news given the unprecedented growth opportunity the IoT presents. According to Ericsson , the number of IoT connected devices is set to grow from 4.2 billion to 14.2 billion by 2021, and Broadcom’s offerings will be selling directly into this trend from a place of market leadership. As such, there’s little doubt that investors should love Broadcom’s competitive stance at present. As enviable as Broadcom’s competitive positioning is, though, graphics chip leader NVIDIA’s competitive advantages are every bit as compelling. Akin to Intel ‘s dominance of the CPU microprocessors that power PCs, NVIDIA is the undeniable leader in the high-end graphics chips that lie at the heart of growth markets like self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In fact, NVIDIA’s chips power the budding AI or cloud platforms for Amazon , Facebook , Alphabet , IBM , and Microsoft . Its chips also underpin the self-driving car efforts of Tesla , Audi , Baidu , and many more. It’s for this reason that analysts see NVIDIA’s earnings per share compounding at a 28% annual clip over the next five years, and there’s a legitimate case to be made that Wall Street still underappreciates NVIDIA’s growth story. Winner: Tie. 3.  Valuation When it comes to valuation, the case becomes somewhat more clear cut. As you can see below, NVIDIA is priced for meaningful growth, deservedly so as we learned from the section above. However, Broadcom’s valuation multiple is more appealing, though a bit harder to gain a sense of as the result of some merger-related accounting. Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio EV/EBITDA NVIDIA 63.0x 35.8x 25.9x Broadcom 15.7x 12.5x 16.3x Data Source: S&P CapIQ. In the past three quarters, Broadcom has booked $1.5 billion in non-cash merger-related charges, which has artificially depressed its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings. In backing those charges out, the company’s normalized earnings per share for 2016 come to $10.84 per share, a very reasonable price for a company with Broadcom’s positive growth outlook. Winner: Broadcom. Putting it all together Both NVIDIA and Broadcom sit at the middle of some of the most important growth markets in tech today. As such, each company should experience impressive sales and profit growth in the coming years. If we’re splitting hairs here, you can make a plausible case that Broadcom’s lower valuation makes it the better bet. However, the more important big-picture takeaway is that both NVIDIA and Broadcom are fantastic options for investors looking to participate in the next wave of semiconductor market growth. 10 stocks we like better than Broadcom When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Taken from an online presentation by Civiq, the company that makes them, this shows a user looking at an interactive screen featuring a message from Mayor Carlos Gimenez. The kiosks show digital advertising as well as information a government wants to share with residents, including transit schedules. Civiq i By Douglas Hanks dhanks@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Digital ads could spread across Miami-Dade bus stops under a deal to install high-tech kiosks with Wi-Fi hot spots throughout the county’s transit system. The company behind New York’s celebrated transformation of old pay phones into high-tech digital way stations has negotiated a 15-year deal with Miami-Dade officials to install up to 300 of the kiosks at bus stops and Metrorail stations across the county. Civiq also would take over the transit system’s current Wi-Fi network on all of its trains, expanding the service to all buses at no charge. The Massachusetts company pays for the equipment and operating expenses through digital advertising on the kiosks, and sees enough profit potential in Miami-Dade that it has pledged to spend $20 million in the county to get started. This is the concept of creating this seamless canopy of connectivity in a city. Brad Gleeson, Civiq’s chief commercial officer Executives tout the kiosks as a no-cost way for local governments to bring interactive information stations to their streets and transit centers — as well as an opportunity to use the equipment’s sensors to track everything from litter to gunshots to traffic. “We call it the civic mobility experience. This is the concept of creating this seamless canopy of connectivity in a city,” Brad Gleeson, Civiq’s chief commercial officer, said in a presentation posted on the company’s website this month. The kiosks “make a city more aware and more efficient.” The kiosks themselves provide free Wi-Fi service within 200 feet, offering people waiting for a bus the chance to use the internet without tapping into their phone’s data plan. Critics see the Civiq arrangement as a way to circumvent county restrictions on digital ads, which are strictly regulated and the bane of public-space activists. “It’s pure visual pollution,” said Peter Ehrlich, a founder of Scenic Miami, a group that fights digital billboards. Dusty Melton, a Miami-Dade lobbyist who has urged strict enforcement of the county’s sign ordinance, said Civiq’s digital kiosks could be considered roadside ads if installed at bus stops. “This contract appears, quite clearly, to be in blatant violation of the county’s very own sign code,” Melton said. Along with a requirement that digital signs be limited to properties larger than 10 acres, Melton noted the current law requires the electronic ads only advertise things available on the property with the sign itself. Bus-stop screens, he said, would seem to violate the rules “in hundreds of locations.” This contract appears, quite clearly, to be in blatant violation of the county’s very own sign code. Lobbyist Dusty Melton Civiq executives were not available for interviews. A mock-up of a kiosk included in the draft contract shows it would stand about 9 feet tall, with a 55-inch screen — on the larger end of the scale for most big-screen televisions. A mock-up of the device in Gleeson’s presentation features an image of Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez on the main touch screen, with readouts on county weather and transit information below. Alice Bravo, Miami-Dade’s transportation director, said at a recent committee meeting that county staff did not feel the county’s signage rules applied because the kiosks’ screens are designed for pedestrians. “These are small, isolated screens,” she said. “They’re not designed for viewing by vehicular traffic.” Bravo and other administrators negotiated the no-bid Civiq deal under a provision in county law that allows marketing arrangements to be signed without soliciting other proposals. No Civiq executives registered to lobby county officials during the talks, avoiding a step that can draw public attention to a potential deal. The kiosks themselves provide free Wi-Fi service within 200 feet, offering people waiting for a bus the chance to use the internet without tapping into their phone’s data plan. Gimenez recommended the Civiq contract in a Dec. 14 memo, and it won unanimous approval from the County Commission’s Transit committee on Wednesday. The deal, which includes revenue-sharing for the county from ad sales, is now awaiting a final vote before the 13-member Commission. Bravo said the talks spun out of Miami’s annual eMerge Americas technology conference, which Civiq executives attended. The company is in the midst of replacing New York’s 7,500 pay phones with the smart kiosks. They offer gigabit Wi-Fi, significantly faster than most networks, along with charging stations for cellphones, a button that automatically connects with a 911 operator, free phone calls from Vonage, and an interactive screen showing public announcements and information on city services. Civiq is pitching its services to local governments across the country, but a company publicist said the closest example to Miami at the moment is New York. Miami-Dade has the 14th largest transit system in the country, and the proposed deal gives Civiq the ability to install at least 150 stations in the county’s more than 40 rail stations and in a tiny portion of its more than 8,000 bus stops. Civiq would need local permission to install them at stops within city limits, a key barrier given the appeal of high-traffic areas in Miami and Miami Beach to advertisers. In its online presentation, an executive with Civiq’s kiosk partner, Intel, described the use of cameras on advertising displays that can track a viewer’s gaze for interest and customize displays to match a passerby’s niche. “If a woman is looking at a screen,” Intel’s Karthik Murugan said, “you don’t want to show men’s clothing.” Murugan also said three-dimensional cameras in the devices can help decipher whether an advertiser’s message is connecting. Along with “gaze tracking,” new technology allows emotion detection. “Are they happy? Are they frustrated with the content that’s being shown?” Murugan said. “The 3-D camera will help with that analysis.” The Massachusetts company pays for the equipment and operating expenses through digital advertising on the kiosks, and sees enough profit potential in Miami-Dade that it has pledged to spend $20 million in the county to get started. The presentation also said Civiq raises revenue from cellular companies that can utilize the kiosks for help in boosting phone reception. Taking over Miami-Dade’s existing free Wi-Fi network in all trains and some buses could prove lucrative, too. Bravo said Civiq would have the ability to inject advertising into a Wi-Fi system that’s currently ad-free. But while ads may come to transit’s Wi-Fi offerings, Civiq would also expand the service beyond the roughly 200 buses that have it now to the entire 850-vehicle fleet. And Miami-Dade could stop paying Wi-Fi providers for the current service, since Civiq would pick up the tab. Gimenez’s Dec. 14 memo said the 15-year deal would save Miami-Dade about $2 million in existing costs, with the county collecting between 3 and 4 percent of Civiq’s ad revenue (and up to 5 percent if the deal is renewed). Bravo said a central advantage comes from the convenience a high-tech kiosk can provide transit users — especially new passengers who aren’t familiar with how the system works. “We’re looking for things that help improve access to transit, that help improve the reliability of transit,” she said. “I think that’s how we get more and more people to take public transit.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Miami-Dade County Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:10 Coconut Grove’s one-of-a-kind King Mango Strut didn’t disappoint in 2016.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Dec 17, 2016 at 1:45PM Image Source: Getty Images. As we hurdle toward the finish line, 2016 will go down as a uniquely active year in the semiconductor market. Spurred on by the onset of several generational tech trends -- the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and the like -- major semiconductor companies have gone on a buying spree to prepare them to cash-in on this growth. Two such names that sit smack dab in the middle of these growth markets are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), whose shares have handily outperformed their benchmark over the past five years. AVGO data by YCharts. Both NIVIDIA and Broadcom are attractive in their own right, but which semiconductor stock is the better buy today? In this article, we'll run both stocks through a three-part gauntlet to see if one is more deserving of investors' attention.  1. Financial fortitude The first prism through which we'll analyze these semiconductor stocks is the strength of their balance sheets. Though their investment theses lie in their revenue and profit growth stories, investors need to understand a given company's financial strength in any investment scenario. In looking at NVIDIA and Broadcom, though, both companies appear fine for the most part. A few important distinctions emerge, however. Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio NVIDIA $6.6 billion $2.9 billion $7.4 billion 4.1x Broadcom $2.0 billion $15.0 billion $3.4 billion 2.3x Data Source: NVIDIA & Broadcom Investor Relations, Yahoo! Finance. To get this out of the way, NVIDIA is the clear winner in every category here. NVIDIA has more cash and liquid assets on hand, carries less debt, and generates more cash flow from its core business. There's really no way around this or disputing it. However, the important nuance in comparing the two companies is that Broadcom's financial position isn't a negative either, especially given the company's intelligent acquisition strategy (see Part 2 below). Simply stated, Broadcom, along with its pre-merger counterpart Avago, has been one of the most prolific acquirers of semiconductor companies, a part of the broader trend of rapid consolidation we've seen within the chip industry. In fact, Avago funded part of last year's transformational merger with Broadcom by issuing $9 billion in fresh debt. The combined company is undeniably stronger as a result of the Broadcom-Avago merger and other recent acquisitions, so Broadcom's current debt burden is most appropriately viewed as the cost of the company's transformation into a company poised to dominate the Internet of Things chip market in coming years. Winner: NVIDIA. 2.  Durable competitive advantages Unlike the above section, it's far harder to determine which company holds stronger competitive advantages. Simply said, both companies are enviably positioned to dominate their markets for years to come. Broadcom's area of focus is connectivity. The company operates four reporting segments -- wired infrastructure, wireless communication, enterprise storage, and industrial and other -- that help make our increasingly connected world tick. Its chips appear in smartphones, cellular base stations, Internet of Things devices like smart appliances, data centers, and more. The company's semiconductors touch multiple points of the connectivity value chain, as well, which is fantastic news given the unprecedented growth opportunity the IoT presents. According to Ericsson, the number of IoT connected devices is set to grow from 4.2 billion to 14.2 billion by 2021, and Broadcom's offerings will be selling directly into this trend from a place of market leadership. As such, there's little doubt that investors should love Broadcom's competitive stance at present. As enviable as Broadcom's competitive positioning is, though, graphics chip leader NVIDIA's competitive advantages are every bit as compelling. Akin to Intel's dominance of the CPU microprocessors that power PCs, NVIDIA is the undeniable leader in the high-end graphics chips that lie at the heart of growth markets like self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In fact, NVIDIA's chips power the budding AI or cloud platforms for Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, IBM, and Microsoft. Its chips also underpin the self-driving car efforts of Tesla, Audi, Baidu, and many more. It's for this reason that analysts see NVIDIA's earnings per share compounding at a 28% annual clip over the next five years, and there's a legitimate case to be made that Wall Street still underappreciates NVIDIA's growth story. Winner: Tie. 3.  Valuation When it comes to valuation, the case becomes somewhat more clear cut. As you can see below, NVIDIA is priced for meaningful growth, deservedly so as we learned from the section above. However, Broadcom's valuation multiple is more appealing, though a bit harder to gain a sense of as the result of some merger-related accounting. Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio EV/EBITDA NVIDIA 63.0x 35.8x 25.9x Broadcom 15.7x 12.5x 16.3x Data Source: S&P CapIQ. In the past three quarters, Broadcom has booked $1.5 billion in non-cash merger-related charges, which has artificially depressed its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings. In backing those charges out, the company's normalized earnings per share for 2016 come to $10.84 per share, a very reasonable price for a company with Broadcom's positive growth outlook. Winner: Broadcom. Putting it all together Both NVIDIA and Broadcom sit at the middle of some of the most important growth markets in tech today. As such, each company should experience impressive sales and profit growth in the coming years. If we're splitting hairs here, you can make a plausible case that Broadcom's lower valuation makes it the better bet. However, the more important big-picture takeaway is that both NVIDIA and Broadcom are fantastic options for investors looking to participate in the next wave of semiconductor market growth.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 9:30 AM, December 17, 2016 OTTAWA - Canadian marijuana firms, facing potential limits on advertising for recreational pot, are selling health food products and cultivating a lifestyle image to win customers in an anticipated multibillion dollar market. Canada is set to become the first G7 country to legalize recreational marijuana nationally when it introduces legislation next spring. Medical marijuana is already legal. If the government incorporates an expert panel's recommendations, outlined on Tuesday, it could strictly limit advertising and require plain packaging on products. That means companies will need to be creative to set themselves apart from the competition, with the advantage going to those who have already established a name, said Aaron Salz, founder of Stoic Advisory Inc, a cannabis advisory firm. "If you've been able to build a brand presence ahead of potentially more restrictive rules on advertising, you're going to have a leg up." Alternatives could include sponsoring events or companies putting their name on products other than cannabis, he said. Medical marijuana producer Peace Naturals has a line of food products, such as hemp hearts, sold in health food stores. It is a strategy that owner Cronos Group, which is changing its name from PharmaCan Capital Corp, might consider for its other brands, said Chief Executive Officer Michael Gorenstein. Gorenstein plans to use British Columbia-based In The Zone, which is licensed for medical marijuana cultivation, to appeal to the outdoor crowd when recreational use is legalized, with a focus on hiring like-minded employees to connect with customers. "If you build a culture and recruit a group of people that really represent what your brand is, you don't need to advertise," said Gorenstein. "The brand recognition will follow." Wholesaler Supreme Pharmaceuticals Inc is putting its focus on the quality of marijuana it grows. The end product is sold under other companies' names, but Supreme gets a producer's mark and is betting on customers recognizing where their marijuana came from and coming back for more. "A good analogy would be Intel chips," said Chief Executive John Fowler. "Whether you're buying an Apple or a Dell, you're looking for Intel inside as a mark of quality." Canopy Growth Corp, which operates Bedrocan and Tweed, plans to use the potential plain packaging to educate customers about the strength and strain of marijuana they are buying, said Chief Executive Bruce Linton. "We were not going to be using swirly, psychedelic colors," Linton said. "We're going to be using the chance to put the name 'Tweed' on the package." Executives said education through events or customer service will be key. It is a strategy Olivia Mannix, chief executive of Colorado-based cannabis marketing agency Cannabrand, recommends. "Be professional, that's really the best advice," said Mannix. "Have education and information behind your brand."

Global perspective. advertisement 20 states file suit against Mylan for price-fixing conspiracy Friday 16 December 2016 at 4:32 PM ET by Ram Eachambadi ©  WikiMedia (NLM) [JURIST] Attorneys general from 20 states filed an antitrust suit [complaint, PDF] on Thursday alleging price fixing conspiracy against drug giant Mylan NV [corporate website] and five other drugmakers. The complaint alleges that the anti-competitive practices of Mylan and the other companies led to artificially high prices for two generic drugs—doxycycline hyclate delayed release and glyburide. The former is an antibiotic used to treat severe acne while the latter is an oral diabetes medication. According to Pennsylvania Attorney General Bruce Beemer [official website] the states' investigations have "uncovered evidence of a broad, well-coordinated and long running series of conspiracies to fix prices." The complaint further alleges that the misconduct was carried out by senior drug company executives, and that the drug companies directly interacted with competitors [press release] at industry trade shows and customer conferences through e-mail, phone conversations and text messaging fully aware that their conduct was illegal. On the whole, the states allege that the companies violated the Sherman Act [text] and request that the court "enjoin the companies from engaging in illegal, anticompetitive behavior and for equitable relief, including substantial financial relief, to address the violations of law and restore competition." This complaint came a day after the US Department of Justice (DOJ) [official website] unsealed documents charging two former executives of Heritage Pharmaceuticals [corporate website] on similar grounds and in connection with the same two drugs. The DOJ investigation involves more than a dozen companies and additional charges are expected. Mylan has already admitted receiving a subpoena from the DOJ concerning doxycycline hyclate. There are a number of antitrust cases that are either ongoing currently or that have been adjudicated in recent months. Last month the US Supreme Court [official website] published an order [JURIST report] stating that it would no longer hear the appeal in two antitrust suits against Visa, Mastercard [official websites] and several banks concerning ATM fees. The suit alleged that the defendants, credit card companies and banks, conspired to keep the ATM charges high, hurting consumer and ensuring that independent ATM operators can not set lower ATM fees. Earlier the same month Google's Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kent Walker rejected EU allegations that the company has been engaging in anti-competitive practices contrary to EU law. At about the same time Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) [official websites] raised concerns in a letter [JURIST report] to the Federal Trade Commission [official website] about Mylan NV's potential violation of antitrust laws. The two senators then claimed that Mylan NV may have engaged in exclusionary conduct and exclusive contracting when they entered into contracts with schools that barred the schools from purchasing EpiPen from any of their competitors. In October Advocate General Nils Wahl of the European Court of Justice [official website] issued an opinion [JURIST report] in favor of Intel in the dispute over a €1.06 billion EU antitrust fine imposed for anti-competitive behavior. In September the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit [official website] ruled [JURIST report] Monday that American Express (Amex) [corporate website] can enforce rules that ban merchants accepting its credit cards from directing customers to its competitors' cards. The court reversed a lower court's determination that Amex's agreements with merchants impermissibly restrained trade in violation of antitrust laws.
