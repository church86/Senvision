Dell Precision 5520 Is World’s Thinnest and Lightest 15” Notebook with Ubuntu GO The mobile workstation is now available for pre-order Jan 18, 2017 22:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Well, that didn't take too long, as Dell's Barton George announced today, January 18, 2017, the availability for pre-order of the second mobile workstation from the recently unveiled Precision line powered by Ubuntu Linux. The Dell Precision 5520 mobile workstation is now available for pre-order, and you can choose to get it pre-loaded with the long-term supported Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) operating system. Dell Precision 5520 is the second mobile workstation from Dell to be powered by Canonical's Ubuntu OS after Dell Precision 3520. The company says on the product's page that Dell Precision 5520 is the world’s thinnest, lightest, and smallest 15.6-inch mobile workstation that features 7th Gen Intel Core or Intel Xeon processors and a PremierColor 4K InfinityEdge display that comes in UltraSharp Full HD (1920x1080) or UltraSharp Ultra HD (3840x2160) variants. Full technical specifications of Dell Precision 5520 The first thing you need to know about this mobile workstation from Dell is that it's fully configurable. When accessing Dell's online store to pre-order one, you'll need to press on the "Customize & Buy" button on the right side of the screen. There, you can choose from a multitude of options and additional components. For example, Dell Precision 5520 can boast an Intel Core i5-7300HQ (Quad Core 2.50GHz, 3.50GHz Turbo, 6MB 45W, with Intel HD Graphics 630), Intel Core i5-7440HQ (Quad Core 2.80GHz, 3.80GHz Turbo, 6MB 45W, with Intel HD Graphics 630), or Intel Core i7-7820HQ (Quad Core 2.90GHz, 3.90GHz Turbo, 8MB 45W, with Intel HD Graphics 630) processor. For an extra $322 USD you can also have it shipped with an Intel Core Xeon E3-1505M v6 (Quad Core Xeon 3.00GHz, 4.00GHz Turbo, 8MB 45W, with Intel HD Graphics 630 processor, and the laptop supports up to 32GB of DDR4 SDRAM memory running at 2400MHz. You can also add a Nvidia Quadro M1200 graphics card with 4GB GDDR5 memory for $70 USD. For the display screen, there are only two options, mentioned above. Both of them offer a wide view, anti-glare, LED-backlit panel with Dell's Premium Panel Guarantee, but the Ultra HD one also features touch display. A multitude of HDD and SSD options allow you to have up to 2TB of storage on your new Dell Precision 5520 mobile workstation. On the connectivity side, the notebook comes with either a Dell Wireless 1820 card offering 802.11ac Dual-Band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 or an Intel Wi-Fi Link 8265 card sporting 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2. Thunderbolt 3, two USB 3.0, and one HDMI port are also available, along with a memory card reader, headphone jack, and a power adapter port. Included in the price there's a 3-cell (56Wh) Lithium Ion battery, but you can choose to have your brand-new Dell Precision 5520 laptop shipped with 6-cell (97Wh) Lithium Ion battery for the same price. Both options come with ExpressCharge support and a 130 Watt AC adapter (4.5mm barrel). To subtract  $101.50 USD from the initial price, we recommend choosing the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) operating system instead of Microsoft Windows 10 (default). Dell Precision 5520 weighs only 3.93lbs (1.78kg) and is now available for pre-order worldwide and will ship in 11-14 business days. The best price you can pay for a new Dell Precision 5520 mobile workstation right now appears to be $1,297.50 USD, but keep in mind that more powerful models are coming February 28 in the US, namely Dell Precision 7520 and Dell Precision 7720 mobile workstations, and Dell Precision 5720 all-in-one PC on April 6, also in the US, and then worldwide. Woohoo! As of today the @ubuntu based @dell Precision 5520 mobile workstation is available to order! https://t.co/zFOJYYQh5F #projectsputnik — Barton George (@barton808) January 18, 2017 #Dell Precision 5520#Ubuntu 16.04 LTS#mobile workstation#Dell laptop#Linux laptop subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news You Can Now Have All the Essential Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS Flavors on a Single ISO - Exclusive Canonical to Remove Old Unity 7 Scopes from Ubuntu Because They're Not Secure Mycroft AI Intelligent Personal Assistant Now Available as a Raspberry Pi Image Epiphany Browser to Add New "Copy Image" Context Menu Item, Support IDN URLs Huawei Watch 2 With Cellular Connectivity Reportedly Coming Next Month Padoka or Oibaf PPA for Ubuntu Gaming?

Microsoft also released a series of Surface Pro 4 updates; however, we're still waiting on a changelog for that one. Update: The Surface Pro 4 changelog is now live.

Next on deck is the 32-core server chip code-named Naples, which will ship in the coming months. Naples doesn't have an official name yet, but the expectations are high. While Ryzen is set up for success in PCs, it's a different story for Naples, which has to take on Intel's juiced-up Xeon chips, which are used in most servers today. AMD is trying to drum up excitement for Naples, which will be released in the first half of this year. It's promoting Naples using the same tactic as it did for Ryzen -- by talking about the performance benefits of the Zen CPU. The Zen CPU core in Naples will provide the same performance benefits as in the Ryzen chips. AMD claims a 40 percent improvement in instructions per cycle, an important metric to measure CPU performance, compared to the company's previous Excavator architecture. Naples is notable for its high 32-core count, more than Intel's Xeon chips, which have up to 24 cores. The Intel Xeon Phi supercomputing chip has up to 72 cores, but it isn't targeted at mainstream socketed servers. A higher core count matters as servers can do more, Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager at AMD, said in a blog entry this week. More data is moving into the cloud, which is putting more strain on servers in data centers. More cores will add processing power to help servers respond quickly to search requests, recognize images, and process uploaded videos faster. A server with a single CPU will be able to do as much as a current two-socket server, Norrod said. AMD will come out with more Zen-based server chips with lower core counts, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. A bulk of the servers today use quad-core chips, and the actual market for 32-core Naples will be limited. The server market is dominated by two-socket servers, while Intel's 24-core chips go into a four- and eight-socket servers, which are used by companies like financial institutions that need a lot of horsepower. "Intel has used Xeon to bleed the market" by forcing people to buy two-socket servers, and AMD could change that trend, McGregor said. AMD will also pack in new memory bandwidth technology, which will boost server performance and possibly give it an edge over Xeon, McGregor said. It's not clear what the technology will be, but it could be based on technology from Gen-Z, a consortium that is developing a high-speed throughput for use inside and outside servers. AMD has surprised Intel in the server market in the past, only to self destruct. In 2003, it came out with the first 64-bit x86 server chip called Opteron, and Intel had to scramble to catch up. AMD lost the lead with its Opteron chips based on the Bulldozer architecture, which underperformed and were rejected by server makers. The company killed whatever server market presence it had with another fateful decision to switch architectures. In 2013, AMD took the radical decision to put x86 on the backburner and reboot its server strategy around ARM architecture. AMD believed the power-efficient ARM chips would ultimately replace x86 in servers and have a 20 percent market share by 2017, but that hasn't happened. AMD shipped its first ARM server chips early last year, but ARM chips are virtually non-existent in servers today, though the promise remains. Realizing its mistake, AMD reversed course, moving away from ARM for servers and switching back to x86 with Zen chips. In the meantime, Intel took advantage of AMD's missteps and steadily rolled out new Xeon chips that supported the latest technologies. Intel now holds more than a 90 percent market share in server processors. AMD has a big challenge with 32-core Naples. Companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are building mega data centers with servers based on Xeon. Those companies have software stacks tuned closely to the processing, I/O, power, and throughput specifications of Xeon chips, and it could be tough for AMD to break into large accounts. But AMD's Naples is the first legitimate x86 challenger to Xeon in years. Google, Facebook, and Amazon could use AMD's chip as leverage to get better chip prices from Intel. Xeon chips are expensive, and the margins make them highly profitable products for Intel. Companies won't make a switch to AMD overnight; it could take a year or more to ensure applications work on the new chips. But the competition is good, and AMD has nowhere to go but up in the server market, McGregor said. AMD also has some technologies that could work to its advantage. It has mulled pairing a Zen server chip with its Vega GPU, which could be useful for tasks like machine learning. The company has also released a GPU targeted at machine learning called Radeon Instinct, but that's effort is targeted toward Nvidia's Tesla GPU, which dominates data centers. Server wins for Naples are already coming AMD's way. The company is also chasing the Chinese server market -- which is growing fast -- by licensing its Zen design to THATIC (Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co.), a joint venture between AMD and a consortium of public and private Chinese companies.

Next on deck is the 32-core server chip code-named Naples, which will ship in the coming months. Naples doesn't have an official name yet, but the expectations are high. While Ryzen is set up for success in PCs, it's a different story for Naples, which has to take on Intel's juiced-up Xeon chips, which are used in most servers today. AMD is trying to drum up excitement for Naples, which will be released in the first half of this year. It's promoting Naples using the same tactic as it did for Ryzen -- by talking about the performance benefits of the Zen CPU. The Zen CPU core in Naples will provide the same performance benefits as in the Ryzen chips. AMD claims a 40 percent improvement in instructions per cycle, an important metric to measure CPU performance, compared to the company's previous Excavator architecture. Naples is notable for its high 32-core count, more than Intel's Xeon chips, which have up to 24 cores. The Intel Xeon Phi supercomputing chip has up to 72 cores, but it isn't targeted at mainstream socketed servers. A higher core count matters as servers can do more, Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager at AMD, said in a blog entry this week. More data is moving into the cloud, which is putting more strain on servers in data centers. More cores will add processing power to help servers respond quickly to search requests, recognize images, and process uploaded videos faster. A server with a single CPU will be able to do as much as a current two-socket server, Norrod said. AMD will come out with more Zen-based server chips with lower core counts, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. A bulk of the servers today use quad-core chips, and the actual market for 32-core Naples will be limited. The server market is dominated by two-socket servers, while Intel's 24-core chips go into a four- and eight-socket servers, which are used by companies like financial institutions that need a lot of horsepower. "Intel has used Xeon to bleed the market" by forcing people to buy two-socket servers, and AMD could change that trend, McGregor said. AMD will also pack in new memory bandwidth technology, which will boost server performance and possibly give it an edge over Xeon, McGregor said. It's not clear what the technology will be, but it could be based on technology from Gen-Z, a consortium that is developing a high-speed throughput for use inside and outside servers.
