Dell Precision 5520 Is World’s Thinnest and Lightest 15” Notebook with Ubuntu GO The mobile workstation is now available for pre-order Jan 18, 2017 22:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Well, that didn't take too long, as Dell's Barton George announced today, January 18, 2017, the availability for pre-order of the second mobile workstation from the recently unveiled Precision line powered by Ubuntu Linux. The Dell Precision 5520 mobile workstation is now available for pre-order, and you can choose to get it pre-loaded with the long-term supported Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) operating system. Dell Precision 5520 is the second mobile workstation from Dell to be powered by Canonical's Ubuntu OS after Dell Precision 3520. The company says on the product's page that Dell Precision 5520 is the world’s thinnest, lightest, and smallest 15.6-inch mobile workstation that features 7th Gen Intel Core or Intel Xeon processors and a PremierColor 4K InfinityEdge display that comes in UltraSharp Full HD (1920x1080) or UltraSharp Ultra HD (3840x2160) variants. Full technical specifications of Dell Precision 5520 The first thing you need to know about this mobile workstation from Dell is that it's fully configurable. When accessing Dell's online store to pre-order one, you'll need to press on the "Customize & Buy" button on the right side of the screen. There, you can choose from a multitude of options and additional components. For example, Dell Precision 5520 can boast an Intel Core i5-7300HQ (Quad Core 2.50GHz, 3.50GHz Turbo, 6MB 45W, with Intel HD Graphics 630), Intel Core i5-7440HQ (Quad Core 2.80GHz, 3.80GHz Turbo, 6MB 45W, with Intel HD Graphics 630), or Intel Core i7-7820HQ (Quad Core 2.90GHz, 3.90GHz Turbo, 8MB 45W, with Intel HD Graphics 630) processor. For an extra $322 USD you can also have it shipped with an Intel Core Xeon E3-1505M v6 (Quad Core Xeon 3.00GHz, 4.00GHz Turbo, 8MB 45W, with Intel HD Graphics 630 processor, and the laptop supports up to 32GB of DDR4 SDRAM memory running at 2400MHz. You can also add a Nvidia Quadro M1200 graphics card with 4GB GDDR5 memory for $70 USD. For the display screen, there are only two options, mentioned above. Both of them offer a wide view, anti-glare, LED-backlit panel with Dell's Premium Panel Guarantee, but the Ultra HD one also features touch display. A multitude of HDD and SSD options allow you to have up to 2TB of storage on your new Dell Precision 5520 mobile workstation. On the connectivity side, the notebook comes with either a Dell Wireless 1820 card offering 802.11ac Dual-Band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 or an Intel Wi-Fi Link 8265 card sporting 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2. Thunderbolt 3, two USB 3.0, and one HDMI port are also available, along with a memory card reader, headphone jack, and a power adapter port. Included in the price there's a 3-cell (56Wh) Lithium Ion battery, but you can choose to have your brand-new Dell Precision 5520 laptop shipped with 6-cell (97Wh) Lithium Ion battery for the same price. Both options come with ExpressCharge support and a 130 Watt AC adapter (4.5mm barrel). To subtract  $101.50 USD from the initial price, we recommend choosing the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) operating system instead of Microsoft Windows 10 (default). Dell Precision 5520 weighs only 3.93lbs (1.78kg) and is now available for pre-order worldwide and will ship in 11-14 business days. The best price you can pay for a new Dell Precision 5520 mobile workstation right now appears to be $1,297.50 USD, but keep in mind that more powerful models are coming February 28 in the US, namely Dell Precision 7520 and Dell Precision 7720 mobile workstations, and Dell Precision 5720 all-in-one PC on April 6, also in the US, and then worldwide. Woohoo! As of today the @ubuntu based @dell Precision 5520 mobile workstation is available to order! https://t.co/zFOJYYQh5F #projectsputnik — Barton George (@barton808) January 18, 2017 #Dell Precision 5520#Ubuntu 16.04 LTS#mobile workstation#Dell laptop#Linux laptop subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news You Can Now Have All the Essential Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS Flavors on a Single ISO - Exclusive Canonical to Remove Old Unity 7 Scopes from Ubuntu Because They're Not Secure Mycroft AI Intelligent Personal Assistant Now Available as a Raspberry Pi Image Epiphany Browser to Add New "Copy Image" Context Menu Item, Support IDN URLs iCloud Activation Lock Gets Removed from Apple's Website Mozilla Firefox 51.0.1 and Thunderbird 45.7 Land in All Supported Ubuntu OSes Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast Let’s Chat: With or Without an Antivirus in Windows 10?

Microsoft also released a series of Surface Pro 4 updates; however, we're still waiting on a changelog for that one. Update: The Surface Pro 4 changelog is now live.

Next on deck is the 32-core server chip code-named Naples, which will ship in the coming months. Naples doesn't have an official name yet, but the expectations are high. While Ryzen is set up for success in PCs, it's a different story for Naples, which has to take on Intel's juiced-up Xeon chips, which are used in most servers today. AMD is trying to drum up excitement for Naples, which will be released in the first half of this year. It's promoting Naples using the same tactic as it did for Ryzen -- by talking about the performance benefits of the Zen CPU. The Zen CPU core in Naples will provide the same performance benefits as in the Ryzen chips. AMD claims a 40 percent improvement in instructions per cycle, an important metric to measure CPU performance, compared to the company's previous Excavator architecture. Naples is notable for its high 32-core count, more than Intel's Xeon chips, which have up to 24 cores. The Intel Xeon Phi supercomputing chip has up to 72 cores, but it isn't targeted at mainstream socketed servers. A higher core count matters as servers can do more, Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager at AMD, said in a blog entry this week. More data is moving into the cloud, which is putting more strain on servers in data centers. More cores will add processing power to help servers respond quickly to search requests, recognize images, and process uploaded videos faster. A server with a single CPU will be able to do as much as a current two-socket server, Norrod said. AMD will come out with more Zen-based server chips with lower core counts, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. A bulk of the servers today use quad-core chips, and the actual market for 32-core Naples will be limited. The server market is dominated by two-socket servers, while Intel's 24-core chips go into a four- and eight-socket servers, which are used by companies like financial institutions that need a lot of horsepower. "Intel has used Xeon to bleed the market" by forcing people to buy two-socket servers, and AMD could change that trend, McGregor said. AMD will also pack in new memory bandwidth technology, which will boost server performance and possibly give it an edge over Xeon, McGregor said. It's not clear what the technology will be, but it could be based on technology from Gen-Z, a consortium that is developing a high-speed throughput for use inside and outside servers. AMD has surprised Intel in the server market in the past, only to self destruct. In 2003, it came out with the first 64-bit x86 server chip called Opteron, and Intel had to scramble to catch up. AMD lost the lead with its Opteron chips based on the Bulldozer architecture, which underperformed and were rejected by server makers. The company killed whatever server market presence it had with another fateful decision to switch architectures. In 2013, AMD took the radical decision to put x86 on the backburner and reboot its server strategy around ARM architecture. AMD believed the power-efficient ARM chips would ultimately replace x86 in servers and have a 20 percent market share by 2017, but that hasn't happened. AMD shipped its first ARM server chips early last year, but ARM chips are virtually non-existent in servers today, though the promise remains. Realizing its mistake, AMD reversed course, moving away from ARM for servers and switching back to x86 with Zen chips. In the meantime, Intel took advantage of AMD's missteps and steadily rolled out new Xeon chips that supported the latest technologies. Intel now holds more than a 90 percent market share in server processors. AMD has a big challenge with 32-core Naples. Companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are building mega data centers with servers based on Xeon. Those companies have software stacks tuned closely to the processing, I/O, power, and throughput specifications of Xeon chips, and it could be tough for AMD to break into large accounts. But AMD's Naples is the first legitimate x86 challenger to Xeon in years. Google, Facebook, and Amazon could use AMD's chip as leverage to get better chip prices from Intel. Xeon chips are expensive, and the margins make them highly profitable products for Intel. Companies won't make a switch to AMD overnight; it could take a year or more to ensure applications work on the new chips. But the competition is good, and AMD has nowhere to go but up in the server market, McGregor said. AMD also has some technologies that could work to its advantage. It has mulled pairing a Zen server chip with its Vega GPU, which could be useful for tasks like machine learning. The company has also released a GPU targeted at machine learning called Radeon Instinct, but that's effort is targeted toward Nvidia's Tesla GPU, which dominates data centers. Server wins for Naples are already coming AMD's way. The company is also chasing the Chinese server market -- which is growing fast -- by licensing its Zen design to THATIC (Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co.), a joint venture between AMD and a consortium of public and private Chinese companies.

Next on deck is the 32-core server chip code-named Naples, which will ship in the coming months. Naples doesn't have an official name yet, but the expectations are high. While Ryzen is set up for success in PCs, it's a different story for Naples, which has to take on Intel's juiced-up Xeon chips, which are used in most servers today. AMD is trying to drum up excitement for Naples, which will be released in the first half of this year. It's promoting Naples using the same tactic as it did for Ryzen -- by talking about the performance benefits of the Zen CPU. The Zen CPU core in Naples will provide the same performance benefits as in the Ryzen chips. AMD claims a 40 percent improvement in instructions per cycle, an important metric to measure CPU performance, compared to the company's previous Excavator architecture. Naples is notable for its high 32-core count, more than Intel's Xeon chips, which have up to 24 cores. The Intel Xeon Phi supercomputing chip has up to 72 cores, but it isn't targeted at mainstream socketed servers. A higher core count matters as servers can do more, Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager at AMD, said in a blog entry this week. More data is moving into the cloud, which is putting more strain on servers in data centers. More cores will add processing power to help servers respond quickly to search requests, recognize images, and process uploaded videos faster. A server with a single CPU will be able to do as much as a current two-socket server, Norrod said. AMD will come out with more Zen-based server chips with lower core counts, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. A bulk of the servers today use quad-core chips, and the actual market for 32-core Naples will be limited. The server market is dominated by two-socket servers, while Intel's 24-core chips go into a four- and eight-socket servers, which are used by companies like financial institutions that need a lot of horsepower. "Intel has used Xeon to bleed the market" by forcing people to buy two-socket servers, and AMD could change that trend, McGregor said. AMD will also pack in new memory bandwidth technology, which will boost server performance and possibly give it an edge over Xeon, McGregor said. It's not clear what the technology will be, but it could be based on technology from Gen-Z, a consortium that is developing a high-speed throughput for use inside and outside servers.

Page 1 of 3. 28 Comments With this week Clear Linux now being able to run Steam, I was excited to see how this performance-minded Linux distribution out of Intel's Open-Source Technology Center would compare to other more popular Linux distributions when it comes to Intel Linux gaming performance. Here are some benchmarks of this traditionally workstation/server-oriented Intel Linux distribution running some Steam Linux games. For those that haven't read our past articles with Clear Linux benchmarks, it tends to perform very well for a variety of reasons. Delivering the best Linux performance possible on Intel hardware is one of their driving forces and include features like aggressive CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS by default, using CPUFreq over P-State for CPU frequency scaling, building software packages with function multi-versioning to support both older and newer processors, selectively choosing Clang vs. GCC compilers for each package based upon the performance, carrying some out-of-tree patches, and various other optimizations/tweaks as outlined at ClearLinux.org. It took a while for Steam to work on Clear Linux due to the variety of 32-bit libraries depended upon by Steam. Unfortunately, only Intel graphics benchmarks for this comparison as that's all that is supported by Clear Linux at this time: the open-source Radeon and Nouveau drivers aren't even built on Clear Linux. If you haven't looked at our past Intel OpenGL benchmarks using Clear Linux, here's a sampling of the non-Steam Linux gaming performance: The magnitude of the performance differences vary, but overall on a variety of Intel graphics hardware from multiple generations we routinely see Clear Linux at the top due to their quick updating of new driver releases paired with their fine-tuned optimizations. Clear Linux is a rolling-release distribution and in its shape tested (v12760) it shipped with the Linux 4.9 kernel, Xfce 4.12 desktop, xf86-video-modesetting DDX, Mesa 17.0-devel, Vulkan, and X.Org Server 1.19.1. Fedora 25's Xfce spin was tested to avoid the overhead of (X)Wayland when testing Fedora 25 with GNOME as well as to more closely mirror the desktop configuration of Clear Linux. This Fedora 25 stock configuration with all stable updates had Linux 4.9., Xfce 4.12, xf86-video-modeseting, X.Org Server 1.19.0, and Mesa 13.0.3. OpenSUSE Tumbleweed was tested too, this rolling-release distribution was on Linux 4.9, KDE Plasma 5, Mesa 13.0.3, X.Org Server 1.19.0, and was also the only distribution tested that used xf86-video-intel rather than xf86-video-modesetting as the default. Ubuntu 16.10 was the last distribution tested with the stock Linux 4.8 kernel, Mesa 12.0.3, and X.Org Server 1.18.4. Additionally, a secondary run of Ubuntu 16.10 was done when using the Ubuntu Mainline Kernel PPA and Padoka PPA. This updated stack brought Ubuntu 16.10 to the Linux 4.10 kernel and Mesa 17.0-devel, providing the newest packages of any of the distributions tested albeit in an unofficial manner. Unless otherwise stated, all distributions were tested at their defaults in order to allow these tests to be reproducible and done in an out-of-the-box manner as seen by the majority of desktop Linux users. I had attempted to test SteamOS Beta too, but it's current configuration didn't support the latest-generation Intel graphics and thus was only running on LLVMpipe with its default packages. Also, I had installed Antergos 17.1-Rolling on the system, but due to its library handling, my test scripts wouldn't work there with Steam. The same system was used throughout testing and consisted of an Intel Core i5 7600K, ASUS PRIME Z270-P, 2 x 8GB DDR4-2400MHz memory, Samsung 950 PRO 256GB NVMe SSD, and Kabylake GT2 HD Graphics 630. All of these OpenGL and Vulkan Steam Linux benchmarks were done in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

EY CEO weighs in    Wednesday, 18 Jan 2017 | 4:20 AM ET | 01:39 As shoppers spend more of their dollars online, the store is taking a cue from the web. At the National Retail Federation's annual convention in New York City this week, technology firms offered a peek at what consumers can expect to see in the stores of the future. While some of these innovations are being tested in real-world environments, others are merely a glimpse at what could be possible down the road. In both cases, they provide hints at the ways retailers are hoping to bring excitement back into their stores. "They view this as, I have to take a risk to save my business," Jim Prewitt, vice president of JDA Software's retail industry strategy, told CNBC. One of the buzziest technologies shown looks to satisfy customers' craving for more unique merchandise. The partnership between Intel and Shima Seiki, a company that makes knitting machines for factories, allows consumers to customize their own apparel and have it created on the spot. Krystina Gustafson | CNBC Shima Seiki and Intel partnered for an on-demand knitting machine that creates custom designs in 45 minutes. By first designing a sweater or pair of pants on a screen powered by Intel, the creation is knitted in just 45 minutes. Ministry of Supply, a Boston-based clothing line, is installing the technology so that shoppers can design custom-knit blazers. Joe Jensen, general manager of Intel's retail solutions division, said the technology could also be used to swiftly restock a product that sold out, as it eliminates the need for overseas shipping. "If you end up selling a model of sweater that goes really [fast], you can keep making it here," he said. Along with on-demand production, virtual and augmented reality were two major themes at the show. Firms demonstrated how these technologies could be used to merchandise shelves, or help shoppers envision themselves in a certain dress. Gap showcased the app it's been working on with Google, DressingRoom by Gap. The augmented reality app allows customers to select one of five body types, and see how the brand's merchandise would fit on their frame. Though the technology is still in early stages, it will be available at the end of the month for people who have Google's Tango on their mobile devices. Given recent news about Amazon Go, several firms that were showcasing technologies aimed at eliminating checkout were getting attention. In May, an Irish technology firm called Everseen will launch 0Line at Ireland's largest retailer. Like Amazon Go, the technology uses a network of cameras and sensors to track which items customers grab. As shoppers are about to leave the store, they'll receive a receipt on their phone. They'll then click a red or green button indicating whether the order tally is correct. "People want to get in and get out fast," Alan O'Herlihy, founder of Everseen, told CNBC. Skip, a phone app that lets customers skip the checkout, was back at Microsoft's booth. That technology allows customers to scan their groceries as they go, and pay through their device. Shoppers are then subject to an audit as they exit the store (similar to Costco). Skip is being tested by regional grocery store Macey's, out of Utah. Robots and Chatbot communication systems were also of interest. Pepper, a humanoid robot created by Softbank that uses software from JDA Labs, can sense when a shopper walks up. Pepper asks the customer what they need help with, can notify them if a store has an item in their size, and if not, refer them to the nearest location that does. Pepper is still in the research and development phase. Krystina Gustafson | CNBC Pepper, a humanoid robot created by JDA Labs and Softbank, helps shoppers with customer service requests. In a nod to the internet's ever-changing prices, several vendors showcased technologies that bring dynamic pricing into the real world. Powershelf, a system powered by Microsoft, uses sensors to detect what inventory is on the shelf. Then, if a store is out of Gatorade Fruit Punch, for example, the shelf can automatically lower the price on the brand's orange and lemon-lime flavors, since customers didn't have all the options available. Whole Foods uses this technology at 40 of its stores.

On January 18, Microsoft announced Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture is available in the Azure Marketplace. Clear Linux OS is free, open-source Linux distribution built for cloud and data center environments that is tuned to maximize performance of Intel systems. read this ​Microsoft's love affair with Linux deepens After testing the waters for years, Microsoft has launched its first service, Azure Cloud Switch, that's based on Linux. Read More Microsoft currently supports a number of Linux distributions on Azure, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, Oracle Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, and openSUSE. Last year, company officials said nearly one out of three virtual machines on Azure are running Linux, rather than Windows Server. Microsoft is making Clear Linux available as a bare-bones virtual machine; a container image that supports the Docker container runtime; and a sample solution image with open source tools for developing machine-learning applications. Speaking of Linux, in case you missed it, SUSE is now providing a tutorial for running openSUSE Leap 42.2 on the Windows Subsystem for Linux that is built into Windows 10 as of the Anniversary Update. Microsoft currently officially supports running Ubuntu and Bash natively on Windows 10. SUSE's distribution, as well as Fedora, can run but are not officially supported by Microsoft at this time.

There has been a mini explosion of computing formats in recent years. It started with the Raspberry Pi, then desktop PCs started getting smaller to the point where Intel launched the NUC, and then the Compute Stick, and most recently the Compute Card became a thing. Then last year we got the NexDock, which offered a 14-inch screen, keyboard, and battery in a laptop format. It was only $119 because you add the computing component separately using a smartphone, Raspberry Pi, or Compute Stick to create a fully-functional laptop. And now we're getting the new NexDock, which adds support for the Intel Compute Card. The one issue with the original NexDock was that any device you added to act as the brains of the machine didn't actually fit inside the casing. Even a Raspberry Pi had to sit on the back of the display. However, with the introduction of the Compute Card that changes. Intel designed the Compute Card to slot inside other devices, just like a credit card. It measures just 95-by-55-by-5mm and inside you'll find a 7th Gen Intel Core vPro processor along with all the other components required to run this tiny PC. All you need is peripherals and power. Related The Best Laptops of 2017 The Best Laptops of 2017 The new NexDock is being designed with an integrated slot where the Compute Card will sit. Once slotted inside, you effectively have a working laptop without any wires or devices connected externally. When it comes time to upgrade, you simply remove the Compute Card and insert a new one (assuming Intel keeps making them). Support will remain for connecting other devices including a Raspberry Pi and smartphones to provide the computing power. The new NexDock also functions as a tablet by detaching the keyboard and using the touchscreen for input instead. NexDock is aiming to launch simultaneously with the Intel Compute Card in mid-2017. Let's hope they manage to maintain the $119 price point of the original NexDock, too.

Historically, moving to larger wafers was a critical way that foundries and fabs cut prices and improved yields. Historically, companies like Intel led the charge on wafer size, but there’s always been a very long tail. Currently, some 23 firms have 300mm fabs in production, while 58 companies still operate 200mm fabs. 450mm wafers were meant to further extend the cost savings of 300mm wafers, but high costs and uncertain rollouts appear to have doomed the endeavor. Several years ago, Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, TSMC, and IBM collectively launched the Global 450 Consortium (G450C) in partnership with The Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) at SUNY Polytechnic Institute (SUNY Poly). This collaboration was a $4.8 billion-dollar endeavor (over five years) to develop tools, work with suppliers on 450mm ecosystem development, and to create appropriate infrastructure for the future deployment of 450mm wafers. This was no small task — larger wafers means different tools, and tool costs are a substantial reason why process nodes are becoming more expensive over time. EUV tools and lithography equipment, for example, are significantly more expensive than traditional 193nm ArF lasers. According to a recent report in the Times-Union, two of the five companies involved in the G450C are pulling out after the end of the five-year program. Graph and data by ICInsights. A report from IC Insights published in October 2016 sheds some additional light on this situation. While 300mm wafers are more popular than 200mm wafers in terms of total production capacity, they are also limited to specific areas of the market. DRAM, NAND flash, image sensors, power management devices, CPUs, GPUs, and other high volume technologies are typically built on 300mm wafers. 200mm wafers are used for smaller runs, where lower total volumes are expected. We’ve discussed before how TSMC makes a significant percentage of its income using nodes that haven’t been cutting-edge in a decade or more. Many of these older nodes are paired with older equipment to keep them cost-effective and minimize the purchase of new hardware. Intel’s estimated wafer costs, when it still expected 450mm wafers to be A Thing. There are several intrinsic advantages to using larger wafers. If the foundry can keep its wafers-per-hour production rate on 450mm wafers close to its 300mm wafer production rate, it can produce vastly more chips per hour. This helps reduce costs, provided that the semiconductor economy is healthy and the foundry utilization rate is high. Being able to build more chips per hour can also allow older lines to be shut down, saving on factory costs. Larger wafers mean that large-die processors don’t cost as much area around the edges of the wafer and reduce overall waste as a result. The graph above shows Intel’s estimated wafer costs over time, and illustrates why the company was anxious to move to 450mm wafers over the long term. If the shift had been successful, Intel’s long-term roadmap for Atom processors might have taken a different path, since 450mm wafers would have allowed the company to reduce its per-die Atom cost and likely compete more effectively against TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries (at least, until those firms rolled their own 450mm wafers). With multiple companies pulling out of G450C and no clear roadmap for the technology, it seems safe to conclude that 450mm wafers are pretty much dead. Pilot programs have ended, firms are still focused on ramping up 300mm wafers at various foundries, and no semiconductor firm we’re aware of is still championing 450mm wafer research or deployment. High costs and machine replacements appear to have nuked any argument for superior cost savings in the long term or improving wafer utilization.

It’s important to see just how much we’re advancing when it comes to data delivery, new types of devices connecting into the data center, and how it’s impacting your business. Converged systems are powerful platforms that took the industry by storm when introduced. With built-in automation, high-density architecture, and high-performance chassis, converged systems help architect a very robust cloud and storage environment. The idea is to create unparalleled density and allow for resources to be delivered as effectively as possible. Furthermore, industry trends show the pace of converged systems adoption will only continue to grow. According to a recent Gartner report, hyper-converged integrated systems will represent over 35% of total integrated system market revenue by 2019. Consider this – in a recent Dell EMC | Intel survey looking at the most modern data center trends, we see exactly why so many organizations are deploying hyperconverged and converged infrastructure systems. The number #1 response for hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), for example, is to help reduce overall data center space, with 55% of respondents indicating that it’s their main concern. From there, another 30% are hoping for both better density for virtualization as well as reduced deployment risk. There are very real reasons we’re seeing this level of growth. Converged Infrastructure Enables Enterprise Scalability. With converged infrastructure (CI) you see the integration of core resources and delivery technologies. These are no longer segmented systems sitting in silos within your data center. Because of this tight integration, administrators can quickly deploy more infrastructure to support business use-cases. Most of all, this level of rapid scale helps organizations properly utilize resources as they are delivered to applications, desktops and users. We’ll touch on this later – but CI is deployed in efficient (validated) building blocks. You can effectively forecast your level of scale as your business needs grow. Enabling Greater Amounts of Density. A great way to create better ROI and reduce space is to efficiently place more users on less gear. CI gives users this option by combining key resources into one management plane. With converged infrastructure – you create a mechanism which can host apps, desktops, and a variety of other use-related use-cases. This means you can support more users while still reducing your overall data center footprint. In working with CI, you’re not just placing more users onto an infrastructure. With VDI and virtualization, you’re removing legacy end-points and providing even better user experiences than before. Today’s CI architectures combine best-of-breed systems to handle more users, while still optimizing user experiences. Reducing Deployment Risk and Size. Converged infrastructure is deployed in pre-validated blocks of architecture which are referenced and tested to work with a variety of deployment scenarios. This means that organizations are working with technologies that have been tested and verified to work in their specific use-case. This helps reduce deployment complexity, significantly lowers the risk of making a mistake, and ensuring that the piece of architecture you have not only deploys properly – but can also scale. Risk is the factor that often slows down critical deployments or puts the brakes on great IT projects. With CI, you mitigate that risk with validated designs for your specific IT and business needs. This means the environment is sized, configured, and oftentimes validated before it even goes in your ecosystem. Saving on Data Center Real-Estate. When working with modern converged infrastructure solutions, you absolutely create new levels of scale and density; along with making the environment easier to deploy. An added benefit surrounds new IT initiatives around reducing data center footprints. CI allows you to remove legacy infrastructure to enable greater amounts of IT flexibility. Remember, with this reclaimed space, you’re capable of optimizing cooling requirements, power needs, and even management. Finally, CI can be deployed in a wide variety of sizes. This means you can support larger as well as smaller (branch) data center locations. Instead of just putting in some heterogenous gear at a branch location, smaller CI nodes can integrate with the overall infrastructure while still keeping the footprint small. New types of converged systems are helping define the next-generation data center. Organizations looking to create cloud-scale ecosystems must look to convergence to help them evolve. These kinds of systems help manage resources, reduce IT costs, and help create real competitive advantages for the business.

Anytime. Anywhere. Intel Invests in IoT Retail Platform for a Smart Shopping Experience PUBLISHED: JANUARY 18 2017 After engulfing our daily lives with smart assistants, tech giants are now gunning for retail stores to enhance the shopping experience. Intel is today introducing a new Retail platform to help make Amazon Go-like stores ubiquitous. Thus, it also plans to pump nearly $100 million into the betterment of the retail industry in the next five years. To reinvent and deliver a hi-tech shopping experience, Intel is taking the wraps off its Responsive Retail Platform (or RRP). The platform is described by the chipmaker as a service that fosters the creation and spread of flexible and scalable solutions across the stores. The primary aim of this service is to collate different in-store technologies and bring them together onto a single platform. This will make it easy for the chipmaker to develop and deploy Internet of Things (IoT) services. The RRP platform will enable shopping complexes to install a variety of IoT hardware devices, sensors, and other data-centric tools in the stores. These devices will collect data and push them to the cloud for analyzing customer behavior and providing the retailer with detailed information. The company believes that their new hardware+software suite will enable the store to improve inventory management and checkout experience. It will also work on personalizing the experience for each of its users. Speaking at the launch of the same, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich [pictured above] says, "With technology like robots and artificial intelligence to free up employees, every aspect of the store and supply chain will allow retail employees to better focus on the customer and improve the stores performance. "We're developing technologies that will help transform the shopping experience in the near future. By bringing together virtual reality and the power of data, well help create the store of the future one that is smart, responsive, connected and secure. "Further, Intel is planning to spread its in-store technologies to as many avenues as possible. And to make this a reality, it is investing a hefty $100 million into the retail industry over the next five years. And the retail platform is just one piece of the larger IoT-powered puzzle being put together by the chipmaker. This investment supports Intel's wider efforts to integrate IoT and other technologies like virtual reality and robotics into retail operations." At NRFs Retail Big Show*, the company has also shown off their first autonomous shelf auditing and analytics robot called Simbe Robotics Tally. This solution is aimed at taking over the management roles of store representatives and keeping shelves stocked with right products and correct price tags. These robots are expected to work alongside humans and operate during store hours without causing a hindrance. *The National Retail Federation had NRF Retail's BIG Show 2017 running January 15-17 in New York City at the Jacob Javits Convention Center, with 35,000 attendees at the expo and conference. © 2017 Law & Industry Daily under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Use Technology To Boost Cashflow Next Article > How Entrepreneurs Use Technology To Boost Cashflow By Emma Sheppard PUBLISHED: JANUARY 23 2017 For time-poor entrepreneurs, technology can really improve a business’s efficiency by automating as many administrative tasks as possible. This is particularly important when it comes to chasing those all-too-common late payments. As business coach Ali Golds put it: "Gone are the days of having to use Excel spreadsheets and paper to record expenses and invoices. Accounting software packages can now be fully integrated with your bank account and, at the press of a button, can update you on who owes what and when it was due." Paul Haydock, co-founder of DueCourse, recommends solutions Xero and Sage One: "If you are using cloud accounting to send your invoices, these have inbuilt automated credit control in the form of automated emails to your customers when the invoice is becoming due (and then overdue, etc.)." Set Parameters Asking clients to pay by direct debit can really help when it comes to being paid on time. Chartered accountant Charlie Carne likes using GoCardless rather than going through banks. "It's very easy to set up -- it'll take you 10 minutes -- and cheap (no more than £2 [US $2.50] per transaction). You can even link GoCardless to QuickBooks so that, as soon as you send an invoice to your client, the payment collection process starts automatically and will be paid on the date you specify. No more debt-chasing." ZooRiot founder Jessica Zoo said that her cashflow has benefited enormously from the rules she’s established using technology. "I have all my invoices sent to one email address, which is picked up by a super-efficient virtual assistant team. The most important part is setting the right due date -- we have 30 day payment terms. We now always know what's outstanding and I've switched doing payroll and accounts from once a month -- hefty and bad for cashflow -- to once a week, which takes two hours. [Setting rules] is the best thing that's ever happened to my cashflow." Track Everything Accurately The panel agreed that having a good understanding of your finances is crucial for entrepreneurs. Technology solutions can help track the money flowing in and out of the business, and identify where savings could be made. Dr. Paul Swift, from the Carbon Trust, says smart meters give entrepreneurs a near real-time projection of their electricity and gas costs, and help future forecasting. "The goal is to try and predict your energy costs based on known factors," he said. "[And] an energy audit by a reputable firm will give you a costed list of ways you can reduce energy consumption." Don't be afraid to hire someone to help, Golds added. "At any point in time a business owner should be able to say how much money is in their account and how much they're owed. If you're not confident … hire someone who is. It's not a sign of failure, it's a sensible move. Run frequent financial reports and look at whether you can start invoicing for goods sooner and/or paying later for supplies to give you a cushion." If you do find yourself short, Haydock said there are a number of innovative invoice solutions that can help bridge the gap. Sean Drake, founder of The Wealth Project Holdings, also suggested speaking to investors who might be interested in helping your business grow. Boost Sales Zoo also advised one reader who asked about online tools to help boost sales. She admitted some entrepreneurs may have reservations because of the commission taken by better-known platforms per sale, but says it's worth it for the confidence they inspire among your customers: "PayPal is trusted, you can pay by credit card, it always works -- [and] they have a great set of analytics tools. "We are starting to see great results [from Facebook Store, too] and Fulfillment by Amazon is a great way to sell your goods without the headache." Golds also recommended Pipedrive to keep track of leads, targets and goals, but emphasizes that successful e-commerce starts with a great website: "Make sure that it's looking good, [with] lots of interesting, up-to-date and relevant content, and ways for potential clients to engage with you." Don't Forget the Human Touch While technology can certainly help entrepreneurs get a handle on cashflow, our panel agreed that the power of human contact could not be underestimated. Erik Fairbairn, serial entrepreneur and founder of POD Point said: "Good collection is a process -- check they are happy with your work, invoice them immediately, confirm receipt and acceptance of your invoice, etc. Explain you are a small business and your lifeblood is the correct payment of invoices. If they can't pay, ask why. Give them a little bit of flexibility, but be firm." And if you can't do the chasing yourself, there are others who can step in for you. Philip King, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Credit Management said: “There are many solicitors [attorneys] who will chase for you and only charge based on results. They have the expertise and the resources leaving you free to concentrate on more important things and clients." Fairbairn added: "Most people don't want to cause you trouble -- explain what is going on, explain why cash is so important to you and generally people will be open to paying you a bit early or letting you pay a bit late. Over-communicate with everyone when cash is tight. If you get your cash right, everything else follows." © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

 Intel introduces platform for retailer IoT BI Intelligence Jan. 18, 2017, 10:11 AM 1,222 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also THE IoT 101 REPORT: Your essential guide to the Internet of Things THE INTERNET OF THINGS 2017 REPORT: How the IoT is improving lives to transform the world Qualcomm and Verizon team up for new IoT modules This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Intel recently unveiled a new platform for retailers designed to enhance the in-store experience, committing $100 million in investment in retail solutions over the next five years, according to ZDNet. Announced by CEO Brian Krzanich at the National Retail Federation conference, the platform is known as the Responsive Retail Platform (RRP). The news may shed some light on Intel’s overall IoT strategy as well as the benefits of IoT solutions in the retail space, and how this emerging market might shape up. The RRP is a common set of sensors, software kits, and other hardware solutions for the in-store experience. Intel’s goal with the platform is to enhance inventory processing speeds, give feedback on purchases and what they might indicate about certain buyers, and, above all, personalize the shopping experience. Intel continues to diversify its offerings within the IoT, and this news is only the latest indication of that strategy. In addition to this new platform for retailers, the company has two other units that specialize in the IoT: The IoT Group, which designs chips for various connected devices. This group, while not the largest or most financially successful business unit within Intel, continues to grow steadily along with overall demand for IoT solutions. The Automated Driving Group, which was carved out of the IoT Group last year and is solely focused on crafting solutions for self-driving cars, specifically designing microprocessors for the vehicles. Intel is not unique in pursuing this strategy in the IoT; Verizon is pursuing a similar wide strategy, as highlighted by a recent agreement with Qualcomm on new IoT modules. Similarly, Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors (Qualcomm acquired NXP this past fall), appear set to design microchips for a wide variety of use cases within the IoT. But this news also points to the benefits of the IoT in retail and indicates where the leading players may come from. IoT solutions in the retail space can lead to numerous benefits, both for consumers who want a more personalized buying experience and for retailers who want their back-end operations streamlined. Since the RRP appears able to accomplish both these goals, this could mean there's room for Intel and others to provide solutions like this moving forward. The Internet of Things (IoT) is disrupting businesses, governments, and consumers and transforming how they interact with the world. Companies are going to spend almost $5 trillion on the IoT in the next five years — and the proliferation of connected devices and massive increase in data has started an analytical revolution. To gain insight into this emerging trend, BI Intelligence conducted an exclusive Global IoT Executive Survey on the impact of the IoT on companies around the world. The study included over 500 respondents from a wide array of industries, including manufacturing, technology, and finance, with significant numbers of C-suite and director-level respondents.  Peter Newman, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has conducted an exclusive study with in-depth research into the field and created a detailed report on the IoT that describes the components that make up IoT ecosystem. We size the IoT market in terms of device installations and investment through 2021. And we examine the importance of IoT providers, the challenges they face, and what they do with the data they collect. Finally, we take a look at the opportunities, challenges, and barriers related to mass adoption of IoT devices among consumers, governments, and enterprises. Here are some key takeaways from the report: We project that there will be a total of 22.5 billion IoT devices in 2021, up from 6.6 billion in 2016. We forecast there will be $4.8 trillion in aggregate IoT investment between 2016 and 2021. It highlights the opinions and experiences of IoT decision-makers on topics that include: drivers for adoption; major challenges and pain points; stages of adoption, deployment, and maturity of IoT implementations; investment in and utilization of devices, platforms, and services; the decision-making process; and forward- looking plans. In full, the report: Provides a primer on the basics of the IoT ecosystem Offers forecasts for the IoT moving forward and highlights areas of interest in the coming years Looks at who is and is not adopting the IoT, and why Highlights drivers and challenges facing companies implementing IoT solutions To get your copy of this invaluable guide to the IoT, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.

(see Table 1). The top 25 semiconductor vendors' combined revenue increased by 7.9 percent compared with 2015, and accounted for 75.9 percent of the market. "After a poor start to the year, characterized by inventory burn-off, the second half of 2016 was fueled by inventory replenishment and improved demand and pricing," said Adriana Blanco, senior research analyst at Gartner. "Overall, semiconductor revenue for the second half of the year was much stronger than the first half, reflecting the strengthening memory market and continued inventory replenishment, as well as inventory build for both the iPhone 7 and the holiday season." Intel remained in the top spot, reaching a quarter of a century as the No. 1 semiconductor vendor, with 15.9 percent market share. Samsung Electronics maintained the No. 2 position for the 15th year with 11.8 percent of the market. Broadcom Ltd. was the best performer in the top 25, climbing 11 places to reach the fifth position after the Avago Technologies acquisition of Broadcom Corporation. Table 1.

"Wireless revenue grew 9.6 percent and continued to be driven by smartphones and the exposure to the memory markets, where conditions were much more favorable than the overall memory market, in part because of strong bit content growth, and also improved performance of other device categories, including ASICs and nonoptical sensors. Compute revenue, on the other hand, declined 8.3 percent, as it continues to be dragged down by a sluggish PC and tablet market and exposure to the memory segment." The memory market in 2016 started with the DRAM and NAND markets in oversupply and pricing declining. By the middle of the year, both markets moved into undersupply, and pricing increased strongly. The NAND flash market, in particular, had a turbulent start in 2016, plagued by oversupply conditions, but deep shortages and increasing prices during the second half of 2016 spurred growth. In terms of macroeconomic factors during 2016, the euro was relatively stable compared with the U.S. dollar, whereas the yen strengthened significantly. The U.K. Brexit decision in June 2016 had no significant effect on the global semiconductor market, although equipment demand in the U.K. was hit by higher pricing as a result of a weakening sterling.

Experimenting With Virtual GPU Support On Linux 4.10 + Libvirt Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 18 January 2017 at 07:40 AM EST. 15 Comments With the Linux 4.10 kernel having initial but limited Intel Graphics Virtualization Tech support, you can begin playing with the experimental virtual GPU support using the upstream kernel and libvirt. Gerd Hoffmann has written a blog post about making use of this upstream virtual GPU (vGPU) support for Intel hardware with Linux 4.10's new features. Among the Linux 4.10 work were necessary KVM changes, the VFIO mediated device interface, and the initial Intel DRM changes. But more Intel DRM changes for better supporting GVT/vGPU capabilities will be coming to a future kernel release. If you are at all interested in potentially making use of Intel GPU support within a virtual machine, see Gerd's post on setting up the virtual GPU support to learn more about these new open-source GPU virtualization capabilities. Concurrently, Radeon developers are also working on AMDGPU MxGPU virtualization support for landing in a future kernel release though that will be primarily focused on their high-end workstation/professional hardware. 15 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The new 2-in-1 NexDock, estimated for launch around mid-2017, will support the recently announced slot-in Intel Compute Card, among other devices. NexDock is one of Intel's regional partners for the Intel Compute Card and the next gen NexDock will be "the first docking unit that supports the Intel Compute Cards in 2-in-1 laptop form," asserts the hardware developer. As with the previous model, the new NexDock will continue to support devices such as Windows 10 smartphones with Continuum feature, Raspberry Pi, plus other modern devices with a USB-C port. Intel's Compute Cards will fit into a specially designed slot on the right edge of the new NexDock, as you can see in the pictures throughout this article. Remember the Compute Card can measures just 95 x 55 x 5mm but can pack a 7th Gen Intel Core vPro processor. To allay any worries about cooling/throttling, the NexDock's slot for Compute Card will feature active cooling. If you like the NexDock idea you will be happy to hear that the firm behind these devices plans to continue its paradigm shifting push to separate processor & OS from displays. The firm hopes to thus reduce electronic waste and be behind longer lasting computers. As well as this newly announced NexDock 2-in-1, the hardware maker says that it plans to produce more NexDocks in a variety of screen sizes and form factors. As mentioned in the intro, the NexDock 2-in-1 laptop dock for Intel Compute Card will launch mid-2017. The previous NexDock costs about $150 to the general public but the IndieGogo project backers got them quite a bit cheaper. The specs of the new NexDock (other than a "HD display at the minimum") haven't yet been divulged.

IIRC, the biggest pitfall of the original was the outrageously poor screen resolution however I'm struggling to find this specification on their website. If they can create a genuinely modular system like the ones displayed on their site, and do it with good quality components and overall construction, then they could be onto something. Seems as though they will need to get to gen2 or 3 before it does anything other than raise some eyebrows.

Intel wants its new Compute Card to be the dockable brain of future devices, including smart appliances. NexDock, the people behind a more or less successful crowdfunded device of the same name, is taking that brain and putting it inside its next ambitious project, which, unsurprisingly, is another NexDock. The NexDock tried to give fulfillment to Microsoft’s promise of Continuum, providing a portable desktop that Windows 10 Mobile devices can connect to, transforming phone into laptop. It is really nothing but a “dumb” laptop, with display, Bluetooth keyboard with trackpad, battery, speakers, and a few ports. In short, it’s a laptop that needs a brain, and NexDock wants the Intel Compute Card to be that brain. The idea of a computer on a single board is nothing new really, but unlike something like Raspberry Pi, the Compute Card comes in a more or less ready to use and polished case that you simply slip into a port, specially designed for the card of course, and you’re good to go. The Compute Card naturally has the processor and the GPU but also combines RAM, storage, and even Wi-Fi. All it really needs are input and output peripherals, which NexDock is only too happy to provide. At least that’s the theory. Execution, however, will be a different story. Although promising and very successfully funded, NexDock’s fulfillment was beset by tragedy (a fire at a production plant) and delays. Backers have also complained of less than stellar quality in the final product. The NexDock itself wasn’t exactly that high on the spec list, even with its already bare hardware. The 14-inch screen, in particular, was particularly dismal at an HD resolution. Hardware issues here and there also marred what should have been an otherwise successful run. NexDock, however, is now official an Intel “regional partner” for the Compute Card, which raises the stakes even higher. NexDock hasn’t yet divulged any of its hardware plans, but the mention of an HD screen is already worrying. Still, it has a lot of time to think about its future, as it doesn’t plan to launch its new crowdfunding campaign until the Compute Card itself launches around mid-2017.

Although OPS has been used mainly for digital signage, Quanmax thinks the concept of OPS standard modularization has more applications beyond digital signage. OPS applications can extend to industrial panel PC Quanmax further pointed out by applying the OPS concept to different application scenarios, OPS compliant monitors can integrate with OPS compliant modules to make industrial panel PC for use in public areas such as airports, stations, department stores and banks to provide infotainment services. This way, OPS applications can expand beyond the originally intended digital signage scenario. Based on the aforementioned idea, Quanmax leveraged its R&D capability in embedded industrial PCs and launched OPS compliant modules in a development model similar to its competitors. Available products include the OPS-100 Series, OPS-1000 Series as well as OPS-2002 and OPS-2050 based on 6th generation Intel Skylake processors. Quanmax has also introduced the MoniQ OPS compliant monitors, including MoniQ-1500/1700/1900/2150 models, with the numbers indicating the display size. These displays can be combined with OPS compliant modules to become panel PCs. Quanmax indicated that introducing OPS to industrial panel PCs brings the benefits of easier maintenance and upgrade as regular panel PCs are not usually placed on desks but are embedded into walls or mounted at special locations. Users are less willing to dismount the panel PC for maintenance or upgrade purposes because this may cause damage to the decoration and wiring. OPS enables the possibility of pluggable/replaceable monitor so the screen can easily be detached from the computer to lower the complexity of maintenance and upgrade work. System integrators (SI) responsible for providing warranty services can also reduce operation costs. OPS compliant products support 4K display, the highest resolution in the industry Regardless of the brands, it is not easy for products compliant with the industry-wide OPS standard to have differentiating spec but they commonly have certain good quality features to provide positive user experiences. For example, all of Quanmax's OPS compliant products support the highest 4K resolution currently available (4000 horizontal pixels; commonly 3840x2160 and 4096×2160 pixels). It is human nature to constantly demand higher quality visual enjoyment. When the mainstream spec progresses to 4K, people will no longer accept Full HD quality. Particularly as screen size gets larger, resolution becomes more important. For example, when banks or department stores use panel PCs to display commercials and provide information search or other interactive services, they will not be happy to see coarse and blurred images on low-resolution displays. Therefore, businesses that run commercials demand 4K quality and all aspects including content, software, display and player have to support 4K display. Quanmax designs its product size with considerations for most infotainment application scenarios where the distance between the user and the screen falls in the range from 20 cm to 30 cm. For this distance, 16:9 wide screens will provide more visual comfort. For other common applications, standard 4:3 or 5:4 screens are more suitable. Quanmax has made available MoniQ-1500/1700/1900 with standard 4:3 or 5:4 screens and MoniQ-2150 with 16:9 wide screens, all of which support 10-point touch control, regardless of size. For customers with special needs for screen sizes other than those provided or even special considerations for frame material, color and water-proof characteristics, Quanmax provides utmost flexibility in custom designs based on individual customer requirement. With the introduction of the MoniQ Series, Quanmax is able to penetrate into diverse application markets beyond industrial automation, including airports, stations, hospitals, banks, hotels, department stores, shopping malls, exhibition venues and even outdoor locations. Opportunities are widespread, opening up a new "Blue Ocean" market for Quanmax. For detailed spec of MoniQ Series, please visit http://www.quanmax.com/site/products/infotainment/ops-fla....

Photos Videos Topics Live SL 170/5 (19.5) - SA 169/5 (20) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Republic Day 2017 Kaabil Raees Donald Trump Bigg Boss 10 Home Sci/Tech Apple may offer 32GB of RAM, Intel Kaby Lake processors in upcoming MacBook Pros Shares5 Wed, 18 Jan 2017-10:24am , Mumbai , AFP According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has a MacBook Pro refresh planned for later this year! Apple is expected to upgrade its 13" and 15" MacBook Pro laptops, released last fall, by the end of 2017. Rumors already point to the arrival of Intel's latest-generation microprocessors (Kaby Lake), freshly unveiled at the CES technology show in Las Vegas (USA), accompanied by a boost in RAM. According to a research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, reported by a host of tech news sites, Apple has finally decided to use Intel's latest processors in its MacBook Pro computers. When the laptops launched in November 2016, Apple surprised observers by using Intel's seventh-generation Core processors, already at large in top-of-the-range PCs from HP, Lenovo, Acer and Dell. The new processors are expected to be joined by more RAM, with up to 32GB for the 15" MacBook Pro, double the current maximum. However, this MacBook Pro update isn't expected before fall 2017. As a result, the firm's 12" MacBook is likely to be the first of the brand's notebooks to get a new Intel Kaby Lake chip, expected from Q2 2017. The laptop could also get up to 16GB of RAM, up from the current 8GB. The current-generation MacBook Pro is the slimmest and most lightweight model ever made by Apple. It stands out from competitors with the new "Touch Bar" of touch-sensitive controls replacing the traditional row of function keys. This Retina-quality multi-touch strip adapts its functions in relation to the program being used, offering quick and easy touchscreen access to the main functions of Finder, Mail, Safari, Photos, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X or third-party applications. The 13" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar technology starts at $1,799, rising to $2,399 for the 15" model. With top-spec components, the MacBook Pro can cost up to $4,799. A 13" model with no Touch Bar is available for $1,499. The previous-gen 13" model is still available to buy for $1,299, with the older 15" model at $1,999.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 17, 2017 at 8:41PM On January 26, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will report its financial results and provide financial guidance for the coming quarter and, likely, the entirety of 2017. Although the company is planning to host its financial analyst day shortly thereafter, on February 9, during which the company will go into deeper dives into each of its business units, there are still several questions I'd like to hear answered during the company's upcoming earnings call. Here are three. Will the memory business be profitable this year? Over the course of 2016, Intel's non-volatile memory business -- which builds and sells products based mainly on NAND flash and will soon begin shipping products based on its 3D XPoint technology -- has lost a bunch of money. A NAND flash-based solid-state drive. Image source: Intel.  The losses Intel has racked up here during the first three quarters of 2016 are $453 million, with more losses likely on the way during the fourth quarter. I'd like to see Intel management answer the following question: When will the memory business stop losing money and begin turning an operating profit? Indeed, if Intel just brought this business up to break even, it would add $453 million in operating profit. To put this into perspective, current estimates peg Intel's operating profit for 2016 at roughly $16.3 billion. An additional $453 million would represent approximately 2.8% operating profit growth alone, all else equal. A move into solid profitability would help even more. Update on manufacturing technology It has been a while since Intel has updated investors on its chip manufacturing technologies, and some information about the strategy and recent developments on the earnings call would be most welcome. A wafer of chips manufactured in Intel's 14nm-plus technology. Image source: Intel.  I'd like to see the company provide some insight into its manufacturing strategy for both personal computer products as well as its data center products. What manufacturing technologies does the company intend to use for what product lines/segments over the next couple of years? Some preliminary insight on the earnings call followed by a deeper dive at the company's investor meeting would be quite reasonable.  Data center growth rate? For a while now, Intel's publicly stated long-term growth rate expectations for its Data Center Group (DCG), the company's second largest business unit by revenue, is 15%. However, the company is expected to miss this target in 2016 because of a slowdown in sales of enterprise servers. Image source: Intel.  Since Intel is likely going to give its revenue growth forecast for 2017 on the call, it would be helpful if the company also provided its growth expectations for DCG in 2017 and, if it has changed, over the next five years or so. Then, during the company's investor meeting in February, Intel can go into more of the details, such as growth rate by sub-segment within the data center segment (enterprise servers, cloud, networking, and so on). It could also go into more detail on operating margin expectations, and its view of the competitive landscape longer term. There are definitely some things best saved for the investor meeting since earnings calls are generally about an hour long, but getting the expected long-term DCG growth rate out there as soon as possible -- if it has changed -- would be a good thing.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Although the company is planning to host its financial analyst day shortly thereafter, on February 9, during which the company will go into deeper dives into each of its business units, there are still several questions I'd like to hear answered during the company's upcoming earnings call. Here are three. Will the memory business be profitable this year? Over the course of 2016, Intel's non-volatile memory business -- which builds and sells products based mainly on NAND flash and will soon begin shipping products based on its 3D XPoint technology -- has lost a bunch of money. A NAND flash-based solid-state drive. Image source: Intel.  The losses Intel has racked up here during the first three quarters of 2016 are $453 million, with more losses likely on the way during the fourth quarter. I'd like to see Intel management answer the following question: When will the memory business stop losing money and begin turning an operating profit? Indeed, if Intel just brought this business up to break even, it would add $453 million in operating profit. To put this into perspective, current estimates peg Intel's operating profit for 2016 at roughly $16.3 billion. An additional $453 million would represent approximately 2.8% operating profit growth alone, all else equal. A move into solid profitability would help even more. Update on manufacturing technology It has been a while since Intel has updated investors on its chip manufacturing technologies, and some information about the strategy and recent developments on the earnings call would be most welcome. A wafer of chips manufactured in Intel's 14nm-plus technology. Image source: Intel.  I'd like to see the company provide some insight into its manufacturing strategy for both personal computer products as well as its data center products. What manufacturing technologies does the company intend to use for what product lines/segments over the next couple of years? Some preliminary insight on the earnings call followed by a deeper dive at the company's investor meeting would be quite reasonable.  Data center growth rate? For a while now, Intel's publicly stated long-term growth rate expectations for its Data Center Group (DCG), the company's second largest business unit by revenue, is 15%. However, the company is expected to miss this target in 2016 because of a slowdown in sales of enterprise servers. Image source: Intel.  Since Intel is likely going to give its revenue growth forecast for 2017 on the call, it would be helpful if the company also provided its growth expectations for DCG in 2017 and, if it has changed, over the next five years or so. Then, during the company's investor meeting in February, Intel can go into more of the details, such as growth rate by sub-segment within the data center segment (enterprise servers, cloud, networking, and so on). It could also go into more detail on operating margin expectations, and its view of the competitive landscape longer term. There are definitely some things best saved for the investor meeting since earnings calls are generally about an hour long, but getting the expected long-term DCG growth rate out there as soon as possible -- if it has changed -- would be a good thing.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Rumours already point to the arrival of Intel’s latest-generation microprocessors (Kaby Lake), freshly unveiled at the CES technology show in Las Vegas (USA), accompanied by a boost in RAM. According to a research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, reported by a host of tech news sites, Apple has finally decided to use Intel’s latest processors in its MacBook Pro computers. When the laptops launched in November 2016, Apple surprised observers by using Intel’s seventh-generation Core processors, already at large in top-of-the-range PCs from HP, Lenovo, Acer and Dell. The new processors are expected to be joined by more RAM, with up to 32GB for the 15” MacBook Pro, double the current maximum. However, this MacBook Pro update isn’t expected before fall 2017. As a result, the firm’s 12” MacBook is likely to be the first of the brand’s notebooks to get a new Intel Kaby Lake chip, expected from Q2 2017. The laptop could also get up to 16GB of RAM, up from the current 8GB. The current-generation MacBook Pro is the slimmest and most lightweight model ever made by Apple. It stands out from competitors with the new “Touch Bar” of touch-sensitive controls replacing the traditional row of function keys. This Retina-quality multi-touch strip adapts its functions in relation to the program being used, offering quick and easy touchscreen access to the main functions of Finder, Mail, Safari, Photos, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X or third-party applications. The 13” MacBook Pro with Touch Bar technology starts at US$1,799 (RM8028.04), rising to US$2,399 for the 15” model. With top-spec components, the MacBook Pro can cost up to US$4,799. A 13” model with no Touch Bar is available for US$1,499. The previous-gen 13” model is still available to buy for US$1,299, with the older 15” model at US$1,999. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week New wave of robots set to deliver the goods Google, Facebook reflect tech dismay on Trump immigration order Battle of the digital butlers: Alexa takes on Siri (VIDEO) Apple joins group devoted to keeping AI nice In move to Facebook, Barra leaves unfinished expansion at Xiaomi Samsung confirms battery defects caused Note 7 fires (VIDEO) Samsung Galaxy S8 rumours: Smaller case, more screen real estate Zuckerberg says Facebook hired ex-Xiaomi VP Barra as new VR head Panasonic launches washing machine for curry stains in India How fat do cameras make you look?

By Patrick Kulp2017-01-17 22:28:09 UTC A wave of new technology is set to reinvent the way people shop in stores, and Intel wants to be at the center of it. The chip giant announced the launch of a new platform for brick-and-mortar retailers this week that will tie together a set of software systems, sensors and other tech aimed at streamlining and improving store operations. SEE ALSO: Amazon just teased the future of in-store shopping The web of connected gadgets will let companies more closely track inventory, collect data on shopper habits and eventually personalize offerings much like their online counterparts already do. Intel plans to invest $100 million in the project over the next five years. During the unveiling, which took place at a retail trade show in New York on Monday, the company also showed off a robot called Tally, a tower-shaped gadget designed to roam store aisles and collect inventory data. The automated store clerk is produced by Simbe Robotics, but Intel touted it as an example of a technology that might eventually tap into the company's web of devices.  The computer company also assembled a mock version of a Levi's store display to demonstrate how ceiling sensors could provide real-time information on the stock and location of various sizes and styles of jeans.   One of the biggest advantages online retailers have over their brick-and-mortar counterparts is a wealth of customer data with which they can tailor individual product suggestions and arrange virtual storefronts and promotions around shopping habits. But thanks to advancements in internet-of-things technology and artificial intelligence, these capabilities will soon be just as possible in physical stores. "At Intel, we believe that increasingly retailers will be separated by those who have data and use it to grow and optimize the shopping experience, and those who don’t and make their decisions based on 'experience' and subjective observations," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in an editorial accompanying the announcement at a retail trade show in New York. This coming revolution has not escaped the notice of e-commerce behemoth Amazon, which recently teased its own take on a physical retail store with Amazon Go, which incorporates much of the same tech plus more radical features like self-checkout via app. By contrast, Krzanich stressed that Intel's automated technology is intended to assist rather than replace employees, according ZDNet's report.

If well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is to be believed, the Cupertino-based company is now reportedly planning to update all of its MacBook laptops with seventh-generation Intel Core 'Kaby Lake' processors from Intel. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has suggested in an investor note that apart from the updated processors across MacBook Pro models, the 15-inch variant of the laptop will also get a 32GB RAM option, as per a report by 9to5Mac. Kuo says that the first MacBook to receive Kaby Lake treatment will be the 12-inch MacBook laptop, mass production of which will start in Q2 this year. He added that a 16GB RAM variant is also expected to be added for the laptop. The production of 13-inch and 15-inch variants of MacBook Pro laptops (equipped with Kaby Lake processors) has been tipped to start from Q3 this year. Further, Kuo says that the 15-inch MacBook Pro is expected to receive a 32GB RAM variant. The KGI analyst says that this laptop will receive desktop memory in order to aim for high-end users. Interestingly, Phil Schiller, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing at Apple, justified in October last year that the maximum of 16GB RAM option enables the laptop to offer better battery life. Kuo says that Apple is expected to grow in terms of shipments during 2017 and slow start to the year has been mostly because of production delays as the demand for the Touch Bar variant of MacBook Pro is "better than expected," as per the report. However, the 13-inch variant of MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar has underperformed and is likely to see a price-cut from the company, Kuo reportedly pointed out.

Plus a Note on CPU Scaling 1k Facebook Twitter Reddit RSS Comments Launched over a decade ago, the 65nm Core 2 Extreme QX6700 was Intel's first quad-core desktop processor. Though its ridiculous asking price of $1,000 ensured few would take the plunge, even with four unlocked cores operating at 2.67GHz, it was the fastest CPU money could buy back in 2006. Fortunately, it was only a few months later when enthusiasts were blessed with the Core 2 Quad Q6600, another Kentsfield-based quad-core chip that sold for a less absurd $530. Although the part was locked at a frequency of 2.4GHz, we were still able to overclock via the front side bus back then, allowing us to boost the Q6600 from its stock 2.4GHz operating frequency to well over 3GHz! By no surprise, it quickly became one of Intel's most popular enthusiast-grade processors of all time. Released about 10 years ago, we thought it would be interesting to see how the Q6600 holds up in 2017 while playing today's games on modern GPUs. In other words, what would happen if you paired a trusty old PC with a GeForce GTX 1060 or GTX 1070. We'll also throw in a Haswell dual-core Pentium, a Skylake Core i3, a Sandy Bridge Core i5 and the mighty Core i7-6700K. All CPUs will be benchmarked using the two Pascal graphics processors to establish some comparisons. Quite a load is going to be placed on these aging processors as we test some of the most CPU-intensive games released in the last year to see if the Q6600 can cope with such a burden. Test System Specs Kentsfield System Specs Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 (2.4 GHz) Gigabyte EP45-UD3P 8GB DDR2-800 RAM GeForce GTX 1060 GeForce GTX 1070 Samsung SSD 850 Pro 2TB SilverStone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Sandy Bridge System Specs Intel Core i5-2500K (3.3 - 3.7 GHz) Asrock Z77 Extreme4 16GB DDR3-2400 RAM GeForce GTX 1060 GeForce GTX 1070 Samsung SSD 850 Pro 2TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Skylake System Specs Intel Core i7-6700K (4.0 - 4.2 GHz) Intel Core i3-6100 (3.70GHz) Asrock Z170 Gaming K6+ 32GB DDR4-3200 RAM GeForce GTX 1060 GeForce GTX 1070 Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Haswell System Specs Intel Pentium G3470 (3.6 GHz) Asrock Z97 Extreme4+ 16GB DDR3-2400 RAM GeForce GTX 1060 GeForce GTX 1070 Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Benchmarks: Battlefield 1, Overwatch The Core 2 Quad Q6600 really struggled in Battlefield 1, delivering just 26fps on average at 1080p with the GeForce GTX 1060 handling the rendering. Worse still, stuttering was a massive issue and we often saw the average frame rate cut in half as the system halted. Even overclocking the Q6600 to 3.1GHz didn't get it out of trouble as minimum frame rates still dipped into the teens. Intel's fourth-generation budget Pentium processor did a better job, though it wasn't exactly smooth either. However, the now six-year-old Core i5-2500K kept its cool, delivering slightly better performance than the Skylake Core i3-6100 processor. With an average of 69fps and a minimum of 58fps we were quite impressed with the 2500K and when paired with the mid-range GTX 1060, it wasn't a great deal slower than the 6700K. Jumping up to the GeForce GTX 1070 allowed the 6700K to distance itself from the 2500K. That said, the 2500K was now noticeably better than Core i3-6100 when comparing the minimum frame rates. Again, the Pentium G3470 was able to brush aside the Core 2 Quad Q6600, at least when comparing the minimum frame rates. Again the Q6600 was unable to provide playable performance, even with the GTX 1070, due to excessive stuttering. Our Overwatch benchmark is a 'bot test' with two teams maxed out using bots. This is a rather CPU-intensive test that uses all eight threads of the 6700K. As a result, the Q6600 once again suffers massive frame dips with the GeForce GTX 1060. The regularity of the frame stuttering isn't actually as severe as what was seen in Battlefield 1, despite being greater in relation of the average frame rate. Still, using the ultra-quality settings at 1080p the Q6600 wouldn't allow the GTX 1060 to deliver playable performance. Increasing the rendering power with the GTX 1070 didn't improve performance when using the Core 2 Quad Q6600, the same unplayable performance was experienced. The Pentium G3470 on the other hand was able to deliver 60fps and only occasionally we did notice any kind of stuttering, but it was minor.

Congatec followed upon its earlier announcement of a Conga-TC175 COM Express Compact Type 6 module with a larger, 125 x 95mm Basic Type 6 module called the Conga-TS175. Both COMs support Intel’s latest 7th Generation “Kaby Lake” line of 14nm processors. Conga-TS175 (click image to enlarge) Other COM Express Basic entries include Advantech’s SOM-5898 and MSC’s MSC C6B-KLH. Like these competitors, the Conga-TS175 is designed for quad- and dual-core EQ and E Series Kaby Lake Core and Xeon E3 SoCs. These are faster, but less power efficient than the dual-core Intel Core U models that made up the bulk of the supported CPUs on the Compact sized Conga TC175. The high-end Core chip here is the Core i7-7820EQ, a quad-core 3.0/3.7GHz CPU with 8MB cache and a 45/35W TDP. Congatec similarly supports the ability to configure the TDP of selected EQ and Xeon chips. (For the full list of chip options, click on either the Advantech or MSC links above.) As with the Conga-TC175, but unlike the SOM-5898 and MSC C6B-KLH modules, the Conga-TS175 is said to support Intel Optane memory on carrier boards via PCIe 3.0. This faster, RAM-like alternative to NAND solid state drives uses 3D XPoint technology to offer low 10µs latency, or about a thousand times lower than that of standard HDDs, while handling the same sized data packets. Intel Optane won’t be available for several months, however. As you might expect, the larger Conga-TS175 has a similar, but slightly more extensive feature set compared to the Conga-TC175. Like the vast majority of Kaby Lake products we’ve seen, the Conga-TS175 supports up to 32GB of speedy DDR4 (2400 MT/s) delivered via a dual channel memory controller. There’s an onboard Intel i219-LM GbE Controller with AMT 11.6 support, as well as 8x PCIe Gen 3 lanes and 4x SATA 3.0 interfaces. Unlike the Conga-TC175, there’s also a PEG x16 Gen 3 expansion interface. Conga-TS175 block diagram (click image to enlarge) Triple displays are enabled with the dual DDI/TMDS interfaces (DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 1.4a), as well as eDP 1.3 and dual-channel, 24-bit LVDS. Options include a VGA port and a Conga-LDVI daughter-board that converts LVDS to DVI-D. The Conga-TS175 supports 4x USB 3.0 and 8x USB 2.0 ports, all with XHCI (eXtensible Host Controller Interface) technology. Additional I/O includes LPC and I2C buses, 2x UARTs, and HD audio. The Congatec Board Controller provides features like a watchdog and power loss controls. There’s also ACPI 4.0 power management with battery support, as well as optional TPM security. This commercial temperature (0 to 60°C) module is available with optional passive, active, and heatspreader cooling solutions. The Conga-TS175 runs Fedora 24, Ubuntu, SUSE, RHEL, and Yocto Project 2.2 Linux distributions, as well as Chromium 2. There is also support for VxWorks and 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. Congatec’s existing Conga-TEVAL carrier board is available as an option.   Further information No pricing or availability information was provided for the Conga-TS175. More information may be found in Congatec’s Conga-TS175 announcement and product page.   Related posts: Intel's Kaby Lake arrives on COM Express Compact at up… COM Express modules build on Intel's Kaby Lake Kaby Lake board lineup includes a Mini-ITX SBC and two COMs COM Express Type 7 module has dual 10GbE and 32 PCIe lanes Mini Apollo Lake module takes the heat — and the cold ﻿COM Express "server on module" taps Skylake… Pico-ITX and Thin Mini-ITX SBCs run Linux on Apollo Lake Tiny COM Express Mini module is first to tap Braswell Intel NUC mini-PCs set sail on Kaby Lake Mini-ITX board runs Linux on AMD Steppe Eagle SoCs (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Ryan Parker, a marketing director for Intel, says the Intel Responsive Retail Platform (RRP) is an effort by Intel to create what amounts to a reference architecture for Internet of Things (IoT) applications in the retail sector. It includes the hardware, software, application programming interfaces (APIs), RFID tag technology and sensors required, says Parker. The goal, says Parker, is to give retailers more control over inventory management. “Inventory is a billion-dollar problem,” says Parker. Parker says Intel envisions a world where retailers take advantage of the IoT to more efficiently manage inventory by knowing the precise location of each item in the supply chain at any given moment. As part of that effort, Intel at the NRF conference this week demonstrated Tally, a robot developed by Simbe Robotics, that can be used to more efficiently manage inventory inside a retail store. To help achieve its goal, Intel this week also pledged to invest over $100 million over the next five years in technologies aimed at the retail sector. Intel RRP is a component of a larger series of IoT initiatives that Intel is investing in as part of an effort to expand the number of use cases for its processors. Naturally, it remains to be seen just how much of the retail supply chain can be automated. But one thing that is for certain is that robots are about to play a bigger role, not just in the warehouse, but on the shop floor.

The chipmaker is launching its Responsive Retail Platform (RRP), a set of technologies that will change retail shopping, Intel announced Monday. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich revealed the new platform at NRF 2017. RRP will bring retail hardware, software, APIs and sensors together, Intel says. “The platform will take retail to the next era of highly efficient and personalized shopping, and intelligently lead businesses into the future,” Intel said in a statement. What Intel’s Responsive Retail Platform Does RRP collects multiple data streams to link digital and physical environments, Krzanich explained in an editorial. The platform aids with inventory tracking and provides insights on buying habits and personalizes shopping. “It provides in-the-moment information about what customers are buying, what they want and how to manage inventory so it arrives just in time for customers to take it home,” Krzanich said. Intel hopes the platform will lower costs and increase sales for retailers.

Rumors already point to the arrival of Intel's latest-generation microprocessors (Kaby Lake), freshly unveiled at the CES technology show in Las Vegas (USA), accompanied by a boost in RAM. According to a research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, reported by a host of tech news sites, Apple has finally decided to use Intel's latest processors in its MacBook Pro computers. When the laptops launched in November 2016, Apple surprised observers by using Intel's seventh-generation Core processors, already at large in top-of-the-range PCs from HP, Lenovo, Acer and Dell. The new processors are expected to be joined by more RAM, with up to 32GB for the 15" MacBook Pro, double the current maximum. However, this MacBook Pro update isn't expected before fall 2017. As a result, the firm's 12" MacBook is likely to be the first of the brand's notebooks to get a new Intel Kaby Lake chip, expected from Q2 2017. The laptop could also get up to 16GB of RAM, up from the current 8GB. The current-generation MacBook Pro is the slimmest and most lightweight model ever made by Apple. It stands out from competitors with the new "Touch Bar" of touch-sensitive controls replacing the traditional row of function keys. This Retina-quality multi-touch strip adapts its functions in relation to the program being used, offering quick and easy touchscreen access to the main functions of Finder, Mail, Safari, Photos, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X or third-party applications. The 13" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar technology starts at $1,799, rising to $2,399 for the 15" model. With top-spec components, the MacBook Pro can cost up to $4,799.

It will be integrated with Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors, the report was made by a notable industry analyst. The news also kickstarts further speculations that the new upcoming MacBook Pro models this year will be much stronger than 2016’s. The latest MacBook pro models from 2016 are powered by Intel’s Skylake processors and feature 16GB of RAM. Although 16GB of RAM are above most computer standards, a number of users have complained that 16GB of RAM is still not enough. This is especially since it has been pointed out that high-end laptops, such as the MacBook, should have more RAM. Kabylake Cultofmac reports that Apple had decided to cut RAM on the MacBook Pro to 16GB because an increase in RAM would consume much more power from the system. This would further reduce the battery life of the laptops. However, it appears that the next line of MacBook Pro models is aiming to address the RAM issue. Ming-Chi Kuo, KGI Securities analyst, has revealed that Apple has big plans this 2017. He detailed that Apple will be integrating the new Kaby Lake CPUs to the upcoming models of MacBook pros. In addition, the new MacBook pros will also sport 32GB of RAM that consumers have been searching for since last year. Kuo also reveals that the upcoming MacBook Pro will innovate the laptop line. Kuo says that the 2017 version of the MacBook Pro will be “the most significantly redesigned product this year.” Kuo also shared that the Kaby Lake processors will not only grace the MacBook Pro product line. It appears Apple intends to also upgrade the 12-inch MacBook line to the Kaby Lake processor this 2017 as well. Kuo has yet to reveal any release dates for the much anticipated MacBook models this year. However, he is expecting that the 32GB RAM version of the MacBook should be arriving to the market during the second half of the year.

The company wants to connect and "transform" the retail industry using data and devices. The company outlined its five-year vision for retail this week, unveiling a new platform designed to bring together hardware, software, APIs and sensors from across the field. According to Intel, the system, called Responsive Retail Platform, will take retail "to the next era of highly efficient and personalised shopping." Intel is betting on data being the defining point of future retail experiences. To power the data revolution, it's developing new smart sensors that can collect information from shoppers. It explained how its technology can already detect misplaced items in stores and work out where they should be from the shop's inventory. The sensors can also pry into the minds of shoppers, identifying items that go into changing rooms but never make it to the till. So far, Intel doesn't seem to have a complete connected retail solution to demonstrate. However, it does have a variety of components that it's now linking together through Responsive Retail Platform. The field is another frontier for Intel, a company increasingly desperate to separate itself from its former focus on desktop processors and silicon. With developments in tech no longer emphasising raw processing power, Intel is having to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. After missing out on mobile, the company is aiming to be at the forefront of developments in machine learning, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. Retail stores are one area where these fields combine, making it an attractive investment to Intel. Intel plans to use bots to drive the next retail transformation Intel The company has announced it will spend $100 million on the retail industry over the next five years. According to Intel, this will enable retailers to unify their business, ranging from back-office stock taking to customer promotional campaigns. It will develop data-centric tools and new automated systems to help retail stores take control of their operations. "The retail platform collects multiple data streams to connect digital and physical environments," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. "With the goals of lowering costs and increasing sales, the platform helps optimally place inventory, deploy employees and other resources, and track inventory – through the supply chain to the store door. It provides in-the-moment information about what customers are buying, what they want and how to manage inventory so it arrives just in time for customers to take it home." Intel hasn't yet highlighted how its technology could directly aid the consumer. It's more focused on harvesting data for retailers, an approach that could dissatisfy customers. People aren't currently used to having every action they make in a store tracked and analysed. Intel and retailers that choose to use bots and sensors could face trust issues in convincing customers to keep shopping in their stores. Robots that know when you last purchased what you just put in your cart could be helpful to store managers but more concerning to individuals.

Axiomtek’s CAPA500 is the first 3.5-inch form-factor single board computer we’ve seen that supports Intel’s latest 7th Generation “Kaby Lake” processors. Kaby Lake is similar enough to the 6th Gen “Skylake” family, sharing 14nm fabrication, Intel Gen 9 Graphics, and other features, to enable the CAPA500 to support both 7th and 6th Gen Core i7/i5/i3 CPUs as long as they use an LGA1151 socket. Advantech’s Kaby Lake based AIMB-205 Mini-ITX board supports the same socket. The CAPA500 ships with an Intel H110 chipset, and a Q170 is optional. CAPA500, front and back (click images to enlarge) The 146 x 104mm CAPA500 is designed for IoT/M2M, industrial control, self-service terminals, digital signage, and retail/POS/kiosk displays. It supports extended -20 to 70°C temperatures under active thermal control. The board is very similar in design and feature set to the Intel 4th Gen Core “Haswell” based CAPA880 3.5-incher. No OS support is listed, but we’re confident it shares the CAPA880’s Linux and Windows support. Like the CAPA880, the CAPA500 features Axiomtek’s homegrown ZIO expansion connector. The multifunction ZIO connector integrates PCIe x1, USB, LPC, and SMBus expansion buses into a single connector. The CAPA500 is offered with four ZIO expansion module options: 4x COM; 1x mini-PCIe 2x COM; 32-bit DIO 2x COM, 2x GBE 2x isolated COM; 2x USB 3.0 You can load up to 16GB of DDR4-1867 RAM, and store data with an available SATA 3 port. A mini-PCIe slot features mSATA support. The SBC supports triple displays via HDMI, VGA, and LVDS interfaces. CAPA500 front and back detail views (click images to enlarge) The CAPA500 provides dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, along with 3x panel-side USB ports, and 3x USB 2.0 ports, one of which is on the coastline. Onboard interfaces include HD audio I/O, 8-bit DIO, the back-mounted ZIO connector, and a RS-232/422/485 port with +5V/+12V power.

Be in 10 Years? Will the mobile chipmaker’s investments in adjacent markets pay off over the next decade? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jan 16, 2017 at 8:52PM The last decade was a great one for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the largest mobile chipmaker in the world. Its mobile SoCs dominated the smartphone market and forced out rivals like Texas Instruments, Broadcom, and NVIDIA. Its massive patent portfolio bolstered its bottom line with high-margin royalties, which let it hike its dividend annually for 14 straight years. But the next decade could be tougher for Qualcomm, which faces stiff competition in mobile chips and regulatory pressure to lower its royalty rates. Let's take a closer look at how Qualcomm is addressing these challenges with new strategies, and where they might take the chipmaker over the next 10 years. Image source: Qualcomm. Pivoting away from mobile devices Qualcomm remains the 800-pound gorilla among mobile chipmakers, but it's been ceding market share to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from OEMs like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. Qualcomm's "best in breed" high-end Snapdragon chips are still used in many flagship Android devices, but it will likely keep losing market share due to the commoditization of the smartphone market and the growing importance of low-end and mid-range devices. To offset that slowdown, Qualcomm's QCT (chipmaking) division must diversify into adjacent markets. The first major adjacent market is the Internet of Things (IoT), which connects wearables, home automation devices, drones, cars, and other gadgets to the internet. Cisco expects the number of connected devices worldwide to double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion by 2020. Qualcomm is acquiring companies to expand its IoT portfolio. It bought IoT and automotive chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion in 2015, and plans to close its $47 billion purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) later this year. It's also promoting customized Snapdragon chipsets and boards for specific devices -- like Snapdragon Wear for wearables, Snapdragon Automotive for connected cars, and Snapdragon Flight for drones. Rising sales of these new chips could offset declines in mobile devices over the next decade. Declaring war on Intel Qualcomm kept Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) out of the mobile market as it licensed ARM's low-power CPU architecture as Intel stubbornly tried to adapt its PC and data center-based x86 architecture for mobile devices. Intel's x86 mobile chips never measured up to ARM-based ones in terms of power efficiency, and OEMs stuck with Qualcomm or other ARM licensees. But now Qualcomm is eyeing a big move into Intel's territory. Last December, Qualcomm and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that Windows 10 will fully support next-gen Snapdragon processors. Older apps developed for x86 processors will be usable via emulation, which represents a major threat to Intel's decades-long dominance of Windows PCs. Qualcomm also recently started sampling its first 10nm server processor with 48 cores -- double the core count of Intel's 14nm E7 Broadwell processors. If Microsoft starts making Windows Server compatible with Qualcomm's chips, Intel could gradually lose its near-monopoly in the server CPU market over the next few years. Beefing up its patent portfolio Qualcomm's QTL (patent licensing) unit, which generates the lion's share of its profits, takes a low single-digit cut of the wholesale price of every 3G/4G-enabled mobile device sold worldwide. That provided Qualcomm with stable bottom-line growth for years, but defiant regulators and OEMs are now protesting those royalties -- claiming that they make it nearly impossible to generate profits in the low-margin market of smartphones. Qualcomm was forced to lower its cut in China after being hit by a $975 million fine in 2015, and was recently hit by a similar $850 million fine in South Korea. These pressures will likely persist with the commoditization of the smartphone market. The only way out for Qualcomm is to beef up its patent portfolio with additional technologies through R&D or acquisitions. Qualcomm has already added thousands of patents via acquisitions, and the purchases of CSR and NXP will let it generate more royalties from various IoT devices. Where will Qualcomm be in 10 years? Qualcomm's next decade won't be as smooth as its previous one. It will likely shed more market share in mobile chipsets, and its licensing business will be continuously targeted by regulators or smartphone makers. But if Qualcomm's investments into adjacent markets pays off, it could steal market share from NVIDIA in connected cars, Ambarella in connected cameras and drones, and even Intel in PCs and data centers. If that happens, Qualcomm could become a much more diversified chipmaker over the next 10 years. Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's Board of Directors.

Credit: Intel More like this Shopping goes high tech (and hassle-free) with Intel tech Intel's new PC, IoT chief brings fresh ideas to the veteran chip maker What’s in store for tech in 2017 Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Intel wants to level the playing field between online retailers and brick and mortar shops by introducing IoT technologies into physical stores. Currently, online retailers have access to information on what sorts of merchandise consumers look at, what they purchase, and what they don't. Intel argues physical stores should have the same information.  In a Monday editorial on the company's site, Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich wrote: "At Intel, we believe that increasingly retailers will be separated by those who have data and use it to grow and optimize the shopping experience, and those who don’t and make their decisions based on 'experience' and subjective observations." The company is showcasing some of its IoT technologies at the National Retail Federation show in New York.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Now that Intel has officially launched its seventh generation Kaby Lake processors for desktop, Apple intends on using them. According to an investor note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the Cupertino company is planning to release a MacBook Pro update with Intel’s Kaby Lake chipset being the main focus. Kuo claims Apple’s 12-inch MacBook will be among the first computers to receive Kaby Lake, with mass production on the updated machine expected to kick off in Q2 of this year. But that’ll simply be a taste of what’s to come, according to Kuo. Production on updated 13-inch and 15-inch models is expected to kick off during Q3 of this year, with the inclusion of Intel’s Kaby Lake among the big new features. Apple recently introduced new laptops with Intel’s Skylake processors, improved graphics, and more. That’s not all Apple is also expected to introduce support for 32GB of RAM in the 15-inch model; the existing model is capped at 16GB of RAM, something Apple’s Phil Schiller was done to preserve battery. Finally, Apple may cut the price of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar because the machine hasn’t performed well among consumers, according to Kuo. That could be very good news for folks who don’t need the added functionality of the Touch Bar but don’t want to pay the high entry price of the new 13-inch model. Kuo is typically pretty accurate with his predictions, so we’ll see if he winds up being right as we approach the spring months, which is when Apple usually holds its first big event of the year.

Image: Intel. 6   17 Jan 2017 , 18:58 Highlighting the importance of data and smart and connected solutions in transforming the retail industry, Intel has unveiled Simbe Robotics Tally — the world’s first robotic autonomous shelf auditing and analytics solution for retail. The solution was unveiled at NRF 2017, an annual convention and expo in New York City on Monday. In his keynote, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich demonstrated how Tally works in concert with retail associates by arming them with information to ensure the store’s products are always stocked, in the right place and displaying the correct price tag. The robot operates safely during normal store hours alongside shoppers and employees and does not require any infrastructure changes to the store. Tally is powered by an Intel Core i7 processor-based Intel NUC and uses Intel RealSense cameras to help understand the world around it and navigate the store safely. Krzanich also introduced the Intel Responsive Retail Platform (Intel RRP) — a new platform that helps in creating flexible, scalable and innovative solutions. Intel plans to invest more than $100 million over the next five years in the retail industry that would support Intel’s efforts to integrate Internet of Things (Iot) and other technologies into retail.

Broadwell Vulkan Performance Also Up After Recent Mesa Git Work Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 17 January 2017 at 07:25 AM EST. Add A Comment Yesterday I published a number of OpenGL/Vulkan benchmarks from Mesa Git in Mesa Git Delivering Faster Intel Vulkan Performance, Closer To OpenGL Driver Speed. Those tests were with Skylake desktop graphics so for some follow-up reference tests I also fired up Mesa Git on an Intel Broadwell ultrabook. With the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, the Vulkan performance too goes up when using the fresh Mesa Git following the round of HiZ improvements last week. See the aforelinked article for more back information. Here are those numbers for reference. The i7-5600U isn't really great for gaming, but indeed the Mesa code from last week does boost this system's Broadwell performnace with Vulkan. And makes it a tiny bit faster than OpenGL with the i965 Mesa driver... More details via 1701166-RI-MESAGITTE00 on OpenBenchmarking.org and see yesterday's article for more information. Mesa 17.0 will be released as stable in February.

Intel has launched a new Internet of Things (IoT) retail platform, which intends to make shopping easier by tracking store inventory and responding to customer requirements in real time. The Intel Responsive Retail Platform (Intel RRP), which was unveiled at the National Retail Federation (NRF) show being held in New York, works to bring together retail hardware, software, APIs, and sensors in a standardised way. It gathers various data streams to connect digital and physical environments.  The platform features three components that include a sensor array, gateway to process sensor data and an open-source analytics platform on the cloud. The platform aims to reduce costs and increase sales. Intel said it helps optimally place inventory, deploy employees and other resources, and track inventory – through the supply chain to the store door. Intel is partnering with an ecosystem of retailers to deploy the platform, including Avery Dennison, ByReveal, Honeywell, Fujitsu, JDA, RetailNext, SAP and SATO. The chipmaker is also planning to invest more than $100m over the next five years in the retail industry to support its efforts to integrate aspects of IoT and other technologies like virtual reality and robotics to address needs ranging from inventory management to checkout. At the NRF show, Intel also demonstrated its robotic autonomous shelf auditing and analytics solution for shops. The solution, Simbe Robotics’ Tally, works in concert with retail associates by giving them with information to make sure that the store’s products are always stocked at the right place with correct price tag. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said: “With technology like robots and artificial intelligence to free up employees, every aspect of the store and supply chain will allow retail employees to better focus on the customer and improve the store’s performance. “We’re developing technologies that will help transform the shopping experience in the near future. By bringing together virtual reality and the power of data, we’ll help create the store of the future – one that is smart, responsive, connected and secure.” Tags Homepage News List Intel IoT Previous ArticleBaidu hires ex-Microsoft AI expert as new COO and group president Next ArticleRaspberry Pi bakes in more power for Compute Module 3 launch Most read Microsoft silences Brexit exit fears with ground-breaking cloud & digital skills programme James Nunns 26th January 2017 Oracle lodges EU complaint over Google’s privacy policy change Joe Clark 25th January 2017 More bad news for BT as BT mail service goes down Joe Clark 24th January 2017 Microsoft steals a lead over cloud productivity app rivals James Nunns 24th January 2017 Lloyds online banking hit by DDoS cyber attack Ellie Burns 23rd January 2017 Cloud and cognitive computing fails to save IBM from 19th quarter of declining revenue James Nunns 20th January 2017 MapR claims open source big data victory with patent award James Nunns 19th January 2017 Latest White Papers How Intel IT’s Integrated Analytics Platform Helps Sales and Marketing By Intel HPE Security Research – Cyber Risk Report 2016 By HPE Le stockage de demain By Kaminario Editor’s Pick Microsoft continues huge $1 billion annual cyber security investment Byomakesh Biswal 27th January 2017 How to keep data safe on Data Protection Day: From cyber insurance and GDPR, to cloud and encryption Ellie Burns 27th January 2017 Another senior IBM exec departs as cloud & POWER hardware undergo restructuring James Nunns 26th January 2017 MI6 Chief: Spy agency needs more women in technology, not more James Bonds Ellie Burns 26th January 2017 Smart City: the next step or privacy threat?

Intel GVT-G Starts Being Usable On Linux 4.10, But More Work Still Needed Written by Michael Larabel in Virtualization on 17 January 2017 at 06:24 AM EST. 2 Comments With the Linux 4.10 kernel there is initial mainline support for Intel GVT-G (Graphics Virtualization Technology) while it will become more usable in future updates. Gerd Hoffmann of Red Hat has commented on the current upstream state of GVT-G. With Linux 4.10, there is virtual GPU support via Intel's Graphics Virtualization Technology for Broadwell hardware and newer and it will work without any extra QEMU patches. However, currently it's limited to headless operation, so you won't get any native display support so just useful if you want to do compute with say Beignet or using x11vnc for remote display access. The display support for GVT still requires more changes to the Linux kernel that didn't make it for the 4.10 cycle. There will also be some QEMU patches needed too for the virtual display support. Those are for host requirements while Linux guests will need at least the Linux 4.8 kernel, but there may be some kernel releases not yet quite compatible. This state of GVT was shared this weekend on igvt-g.

The chip giant is launching a Responsive Retail Platform that creates a common set of sensors, software kits and other components for in-store tech. It promises to speed up inventory tracking, provide feedback on buying habits and personalize your shopping. Stores might not have to cobble together separate solutions or make their own -- they'd just have to turn to Intel and partners for everything they need. The company is also backing up its words with cold, hard cash. It's investing over $100 million into the retail industry over the next 5 years to help get the ball rolling. It's not certain just what a complete Intel solution looks like. However, the company is showcasing the kind of technology it wants to see. Simbe Robotics' Tally keeps tabs on store shelves, for instance, while ShopperMXTM HIVE gives retailers a virtual reality preview of store layouts. In short: if it's Intel-powered and pushes technological limits, there's a good chance the company is thinking about it. Intel probably isn't the first name you associate with retail, but it certainly has clear incentives to jump into this space with both feet. More than anything, it's a way to accelerate Intel's fledgling Internet of Things business -- someone has to design the sensors those stores will use. It also serves as one more hedge against a declining PC industry. It's hard to know if shops will welcome Intel with open arms, but something tells us that the company is willing to wait until people warm up to its presence.

Here's what you need to know about Kaby Lake release date, features, plus specs, models and prices, including the new Pentium chips which now have Hyper-threading. Kaby Lake is 'optimised' Skylake with a few new features By Jim Martin | 24 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Back at Computex 2016, Intel confirmed in its keynote that the 7th generation Core processors will launch later in the year. While that was true for laptops, enthusiasts have been kept waiting for the desktop chips. But Intel has now revealed more details on the desktop Kaby Lake release date and specs, including the new sub-£100 Pentium chips which, for the first time, get Hyper-threading. Intel Kaby Lake 7th gen Core processor release date The new Kaby Lake desktop processors are on sale now from Overclockers UK, Scan and other retailers. Rumour has it, via Benchlife, that Intel will launch Kaby Lake X (and Skylake X) chips in August at Gamescom 2017. There will reportedly be 10-, 8 -, 6- and 4 core models. Kaby Lake X will supposedly be the quad-core chip and will have a TDP of 112W and all chips will be marketed as the Core i7-7000 series processors. Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake specs and prices Here are the main specs of the new desktop Core i7 chips. Just three have been announced so far. They are all quad-core with Hyper-Threading. Model Core i7-7700K Core i7-7700 Core i7-7700T Price £339 £309 £309 TDP 91W 65W 35W Cores/Threads 4/8 4/8 4/8 Base Frequency 4.2GHz 3.6GHz 2.9GHz Boost Frequency 4.5GHz 4.2GHz 3.8GHz Unlocked Yes No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 8MB 8MB 8MB   Intel Core i5 Kaby Lake specs and prices Four seventh-gen Core i5 models have been announced (see table below), plus a further three chips with a ‘T’ suffix which denotes they use less power – they all have a 35W TDP. As the table shows, they’re all quad-core parts, but with no Hyper-Threading. Model Core i5-7600K Core i5-7600 Core i5-7500 Core i5-7400 Price £239 £219 £199 £189 TDP 91W 65W 65W 65W Cores/Threads 4/4 4/4 4/4 4/4 Base Frequency 3.8GHz 3.5GHz 3.4GHz 3.0GHz Boost Frequency 4.2GHz 4.1GHz 3.8GHz 3.5GHz Unlocked Yes No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 6MB 6MB 6MB 6MB These are the 35W 'T' models: Model Core i5-7600T Core i5-7500T Core i5-7400T Price £219 £199 £179 TDP 35W 35W 35W Cores/Threads 4/4 4/4 4/4 Base Frequency 2.8GHz 2.7GHz 2.4GHz Boost Frequency 3.7GHz 3.3GHz 3.0GHz Unlocked No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 6MB 6MB 6MB Intel Core i3 Kaby Lake specs and prices As with the Core i5 models, the Core i3 is also available as a ‘T’ model which has a 35W TDP. The Core i3 chips have no boost capability, so rely on high base frequency. They’re dual-core chips with Hyper-Threading. Note that the flagship model is unlocked, so Intel is catering to enthusiasts who want to overclock a more affordable chip. Unlike the Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition processor from 2014, the i3-7350K supports Hyper-Threading. Model Core i3-7350K Core i3-7320 Core i3-7300 Core i3-7100 Price £185 £159 £149 £119 TDP 60W 51W 51W 51W Cores/Threads 2/4 2/4 2/4 2/4 Base Frequency 4.2GHz 4.1GHz 4.0GHz 3.9GHz Boost Frequency N/A N/A N/A N/A Unlocked Yes No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 4MB 4MB 4MB 3MB Overall, there is a similar lineup of Kaby Lake processors to Skylake, so you’ll have a choice of an entry-level Core i3, right up to a 10-core Extreme Edition Core i7 (this hasn't launched yet). Prices are unlikely to vary much from the Skylake range, so there will be something to suit every budget. There are of course be laptop and mobile versions of the Kaby Lake desktop chips for everything from ultraportables to all-in-one PCs.   Intel Kaby Lake Pentium specs There are three new Pentium models, each also available in a low-power 'T' model. They support the new Kaby Lake features such as Intel Optane, 4K video and have DDR4 memory controllers. The big news is that they're the first Pentiums to get Hyper-threading, so while they're not true quad-core parts, they do get the performance advantage of being able to process four threads. Model Pentium G4620 Pentium G4600 Pentium G4560 Price £94.99 £83.99 £64.99 TDP 51W 51W 54W Cores/Threads 2/4 2/4 2/4 Base Frequency 3.7GHz 3.6GHz 3.5GHz Boost Frequency N/A N/A N/A Unlocked No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 610 Cache 3MB 3MB 3MB What is Kaby Lake? The 7th-gen Core processors are based on the same 14nm process as Skylake and its predecessor, Broadwell. Intel won’t make the move down to 10nm until the 8th-gen Cannonlake CPUs which are due to launch later in 2017. The original plan was to switch to 10nm back in 2015 but, because of manufacturing problems, it’s sticking with 14nm for Kaby Lake. This disrupts Intel’s Tick-Tock roadmap, since Kaby Lake should be a Tick – a new manufacturing process – but will instead be an ‘optimised’ version of Skylake (which is already an improved version of Broadwell). And that’s now Intel’s plan for the future: no more Tick-Tock, it’s now Process-Architecture-Optimisation. So when we finally get ‘Canonlake’, there will be two more generations based on the 10mm manufacturing process before a move to an even smaller one. Intel Kaby Lake 7th gen Core processor features Optane Memory So what’s new? Well, there’s the obvious performance improvement, but the new 200-series chipset supports Intel’s new Optane memory. This isn’t to be confused with Optane SSDs – it’s a brand new memory module which is designed to make a PC with a traditional mechanical hard drive feel more like one equipped with an SSD. Few details are yet known about Optane Memory, other than it uses 3D Crosspoint memory. Intel hasn’t yet said anything about capacities or prices. It has confirmed that Optane Memory modules won’t work in older Z170 boards, or with Skylake chips, though. These should be available to buy within the next six months. Better overclocking Kaby Lake chips have a 300MHz base frequency boost over the equivalent Skylake chips, but are also better for overclocking. For example, they will automatically adjust voltage to make a given base clock more stable. The second improvement is better control over Turbo Boost. When the chip has to process an AVX instruction it will downclock, then return to a higher clock for normal instructions. With faster clock speeds than Skylake at a given TDP, Kaby Lake is already around 25 percent quicker, but it remains to be see just how fast they will go. Early benchmarks show they are no faster than Skylake (when compared at the same clock speeds). The performance boost comes from using higher clock speeds than the equivalent Skylake chips. If you already have a PC with a 6th-gen Skylake chip, you won't see any better performance simply by upgrading to the equivalent Kaby Lake chip. But if you're still on a third, fourth or fifth-gen Core processor, it could well be a good time to upgrade. Better graphics Certain new U-series processors (which will appear in 2-in-1 laptop/tablet devices) have Iris Plus Graphics 640 GPUs integrated. Intel says this GPU is 65 percent faster than the equivalent Intel HD graphics system. It’s 40 percent faster for quick sync video, and is also capable of 4K video playback. Backwards compatible with 100-series chipsets Desktop Kaby Lake chips are compatible with the existing 100-series chipsets, so it’ll be an easy upgrade from Skylake, assuming manufacturers provide BIOS updates for the new chips. However, you will miss out on Optane Memory support (which we’re assured won’t be added to any 100-series boards) and possibly certain overclocking features.

But potential buyers in the region have safety concerns that could hold back widespread adoption. According to a December 2016 survey by Intel and Intuit, which asked internet users in Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan who owned or intended to buy a car if they would consider purchasing a so-called "driverless" car, interest was high. More than half (51%) of total respondents said they would consider buying one. Respondents in Taiwan were the most enthusiastic, with 80% saying they would contemplate owning a self-driving car, vs. Australia, where only 24% would consider it. Intel's survey is not the first to notice significant interest in autonomous vehicles among consumers in Asia-Pacific. In June 2015, for instance, an Arthur D. Little study of internet users' "acceptance" of such vehicles in select countries worldwide found that those in China, South Korea and Japan had the highest rates of approval. But even as consumers in Asia-Pacific indicate enthusiasm for the idea of self-driving vehicles, they still have concerns that could hold back adoption. In Intel's study, many expressed worries about issues like a lack of safety standards for driverless cars (79%), or had questions about how the cars might react when dealing with a situation for which they had not been programmed (76%). Although the road to success for self-driving cars in Asia-Pacific looks to be relatively traffic-free, marketers in the space would be wise to develop strategies to address consumers' concerns sooner rather than later. —Jeremy Kressmann New in eMarketer PRO This Week Report: Digital Video Advertising Best Practices 2017 Report: Worldwide Digital Video Viewers: eMarketer's Estimates for 2016–2020 Report: B2B Mobile Marketing and Advertising 2017 Not a PRO subscriber?

Image: Intel Window shopping is quickly becoming a thing of the past. To that end, Intel has debuted its IoT retail platform, driven by technologies such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. While the internet of things and data analysis have already entered the retail industry supply chain to some degree, the customer side of the business is yet to be radically transformed. That may be about to change. Intel has unveiled what it is calling the Responsive Retail Platform (RRP), an effort to fill major high street stores with sensors, robots and 3D printers. The robot takeover begins In an announcement at NRF 2017 – one of the largest retail conferences in the world – Intel explained that the RRP will connect all aspects of a store, from the items in the showroom to the stockroom. The basis of the platform will be Intel’s RFID sensors – though the company has said it will be extendable to third-party sensors, as well – to allow the tracking of inventory in stores, and to do things like gathering data for the shop owner on customer trends and tastes. Powering the sensors will be Intel’s established Core i7 processor, but the company has said that, depending on the results found during the initial roll-out, it could expand RRP to the more powerful Xeon processor. On-demand, in-store 3D knitting Also showcased at the launch was a robot that would do little to ease fears of a robot takeover of the workplace. An on-demand, in-store 3D knitting machine powered by Intel technology. Image: Intel Developed by Simbe Robotics, and driven by Intel hardware, Tally is one of the world’s first robotic autonomous shelf auditing and analytics solutions for retail, which roams a store telling the manager that products are always stocked, in the right place and displaying the correct price tag. Some other technologies making their debuts were on-demand, in-store 3D knitting; real-time, data-driven clothing; and interactive product displays to target customers more directly, whether that be in this reality, or a virtual one. During his on-stage address, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that the company plans to spend $100m on RPP over the course of the next five years. The company announced late last year that it plans to spend up to $250m on autonomous driving tech. “[Virtual reality] will help customers and retailers use data and analytics to maximise investment and impact in retail. It could be a game changer,” Krzanich said in a blog post. “With technology like robots and [artificial intelligence] to free up employees, every aspect of the store and supply chain will allow retail employees to better focus on the customer and improve the store’s performance.” Related: AI, retail, Intel, internet of things, employers Colm Gorey is a journalist with Siliconrepublic.com editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Machines Intel buys 15pc stake in Here to develop autonomous car mapping tech 4 Jan 201710 Shares Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Working at the leading edge of IoT Innovation for mobility and the internet of things The largest employer in northwest Ireland Machines How IoT intersects with everyday life, and the not-so everyday 22 Nov 201623 Shares Noel Murphy: How IoT can make the ordinary extraordinary 28 Nov 201610 Shares WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT FEATURED EMPLOYERS?

Be in 10 Years? Will the mobile chipmaker’s investments in adjacent markets pay off over the next decade? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jan 16, 2017 at 8:52PM The last decade was a great one for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the largest mobile chipmaker in the world. Its mobile SoCs dominated the smartphone market and forced out rivals like Texas Instruments, Broadcom, and NVIDIA. Its massive patent portfolio bolstered its bottom line with high-margin royalties, which let it hike its dividend annually for 14 straight years. But the next decade could be tougher for Qualcomm, which faces stiff competition in mobile chips and regulatory pressure to lower its royalty rates. Let's take a closer look at how Qualcomm is addressing these challenges with new strategies, and where they might take the chipmaker over the next 10 years. Image source: Qualcomm. Pivoting away from mobile devices Qualcomm remains the 800-pound gorilla among mobile chipmakers, but it's been ceding market share to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from OEMs like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. Qualcomm's "best in breed" high-end Snapdragon chips are still used in many flagship Android devices, but it will likely keep losing market share due to the commoditization of the smartphone market and the growing importance of low-end and mid-range devices. To offset that slowdown, Qualcomm's QCT (chipmaking) division must diversify into adjacent markets. The first major adjacent market is the Internet of Things (IoT), which connects wearables, home automation devices, drones, cars, and other gadgets to the internet. Cisco expects the number of connected devices worldwide to double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion by 2020. Qualcomm is acquiring companies to expand its IoT portfolio. It bought IoT and automotive chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion in 2015, and plans to close its $47 billion purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) later this year. It's also promoting customized Snapdragon chipsets and boards for specific devices -- like Snapdragon Wear for wearables, Snapdragon Automotive for connected cars, and Snapdragon Flight for drones. Rising sales of these new chips could offset declines in mobile devices over the next decade. Declaring war on Intel Qualcomm kept Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) out of the mobile market as it licensed ARM's low-power CPU architecture as Intel stubbornly tried to adapt its PC and data center-based x86 architecture for mobile devices. Intel's x86 mobile chips never measured up to ARM-based ones in terms of power efficiency, and OEMs stuck with Qualcomm or other ARM licensees. But now Qualcomm is eyeing a big move into Intel's territory. Last December, Qualcomm and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that Windows 10 will fully support next-gen Snapdragon processors. Older apps developed for x86 processors will be usable via emulation, which represents a major threat to Intel's decades-long dominance of Windows PCs. Qualcomm also recently started sampling its first 10nm server processor with 48 cores -- double the core count of Intel's 14nm E7 Broadwell processors. If Microsoft starts making Windows Server compatible with Qualcomm's chips, Intel could gradually lose its near-monopoly in the server CPU market over the next few years. Beefing up its patent portfolio Qualcomm's QTL (patent licensing) unit, which generates the lion's share of its profits, takes a low single-digit cut of the wholesale price of every 3G/4G-enabled mobile device sold worldwide. That provided Qualcomm with stable bottom-line growth for years, but defiant regulators and OEMs are now protesting those royalties -- claiming that they make it nearly impossible to generate profits in the low-margin market of smartphones. Qualcomm was forced to lower its cut in China after being hit by a $975 million fine in 2015, and was recently hit by a similar $850 million fine in South Korea. These pressures will likely persist with the commoditization of the smartphone market. The only way out for Qualcomm is to beef up its patent portfolio with additional technologies through R&D or acquisitions. Qualcomm has already added thousands of patents via acquisitions, and the purchases of CSR and NXP will let it generate more royalties from various IoT devices. Where will Qualcomm be in 10 years? Qualcomm's next decade won't be as smooth as its previous one. It will likely shed more market share in mobile chipsets, and its licensing business will be continuously targeted by regulators or smartphone makers. But if Qualcomm's investments into adjacent markets pays off, it could steal market share from NVIDIA in connected cars, Ambarella in connected cameras and drones, and even Intel in PCs and data centers. If that happens, Qualcomm could become a much more diversified chipmaker over the next 10 years. Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's Board of Directors.

Magdalena Petrova (IDG News Service) 17 January, 2017 11:47 - - - - print email Comments Intel wants to level the playing field between online retailers and brick and mortar shops by introducing IoT technologies into physical stores. Currently, online retailers have access to information on what sorts of merchandise consumers look at, what they purchase, and what they don't. And Intel argues physical stores should have the same information.  In a Monday editorial on the company's site, Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich wrote: "At Intel, we believe that increasingly retailers will be separated by those who have data and use it to grow and optimize the shopping experience, and those who don’t and make their decisions based on 'experience' and subjective observations." The company is showcasing some of its IoT technologies at the National Retail Federation show in New York.  6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

When mini-STX was shown by Intel last year as a different form factor focusing just on the processor rather than PCIe lanes, we saw the launch of several small-sized PCs, mainly for embedded functions, that could leverage a full desktop-class CPU and socket. As always with CPU-only products, some users request a little more graphics oomph, so insert ASRock’s new ‘micro-STX’ type of motherboard and mini-PC that uses MXM-type graphics. Unfortunately our trip to ASRock at CES was curtailed due to other meetings overrunning, but it was interesting to note that ASRock was at the show formally with a suite, rather than just casually taking coffee meetings the previous two years that I had been. So all our pictures in this piece are from the Small Form Factor Network, and many thanks to them. The mini-STX form factor is based around a 5-inch by 5-inch motherboard design, which gets you enough space for a socket, some memory and some IO. With this micro-STX motherboard, ASRock is clearly going at length to support more: the MXM module bay takes up the whole second half of the motherboard, and one key thing to note here is the socket area. On the left-hand side, where we would normally expect to see the IO, we have Intel’s recommended socket area marked. Normally this is left near-blank to account for coolers and such, but ASRock as engineered the rear IO right up to the socket itself, and using low profile IO ports to allow a cooler to fit. Because of the way mini-STX platforms work with few power phases, these are solely above the socket as not to interfere with to the left of the socket. On the front side of the board, the chipset is nowhere to be found. That’s because it is on the back, along with the CR2032 battery and three M.2 ports. Because of the chipset support, all three are PCIe 3.0 x4 capable, with spacing for 2260 and 2280 sized M.2 ports. For good measure, there’s also an M.2 WiFi port. Front functionality comes through a USB 3.0 Type-A, a USB 3.0 Type-C (ASRock in their sign claim this is USB 3.1 and Thunderbolt 3, however I cannot see an ASMedia ASM1142/ASM2142 nor an Alpine Ridge controller for this), and two audio jacks from the Realtek ALC283. The front uses an Intel I219-V gigabit Ethernet controller, two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, HDMI 2.0 port (via MCDP2000), a DisplayPort adaptor, a mini-DP port, and a DC-In jack. It’s worth noting that the specifications list also has two SATA ports on the description, but like the TB3 controller, I can’t see them on the pictures, front or rear. As a system, the 2.7-liter DeskMini GTX/RX will feature a Core i7-7700K using an Intel stock cooler (so don’t expect much in the way of overclocking), support for up to 16GB of DDR4-3200 SODIMM (not sure why it’s not 32GB, perhaps z-height?), a 128GB Samsung 961 M.2 SSD, and an MXM Type-B graphics card: either a GTX 1060 for the GTX model, or an AMD RX card for the RX version. The PSU is rated at 220W, which can limit options. Personally, I’d prefer a solid copper cooler on there for a Core i7, but a Core i5/i3 would do OK with the stock cooler. Prices and release date are unknown.

I hope it can be purchased separately... or if they (and others) will make more boards like this. The day of a million add-on cards are over for most, 1080s can be fit onto MXM size cards, lots of great M.2 SSD options, can get 1x16GB SO-DIMM sticks, power draw is low and can use external power bricks. Reply Samus - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link That's pretty cool, but I question the benefit of MXM over, say, a right-angle PCIe slot for a low-profile GPU. MXM is just too damn rare. The worst part is finding a heatsink for MXM cards when adding one to an OEM system since most cards are sold without them, and the designs are all super proprietary. Reply Valantar - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link MXM Allows for a full range of GPU choices (all the way to the GTX 1080). HHHL cards take up more space, and the biggest/best you can get there is either an RX 460 or a GTX 1050. That would be a far, far worse choice. Also, this might be one of the things that makes MXM cards more available to consumers. If nobody tries, they'll stay OEM only. Reply close - Thursday, January 19, 2017 - link The market for MXM just isn't here yet. And MXM cards were designed for severely z-height limited systems like laptops. Insisting on fitting that into a desktop with (relatively) plenty of head-room is a pointless exercise. And since MXM cards are designed with laptops in mind 99% of the time you'd be hard pressed to find one that's actually speced like a desktop card. Cooling limitations ensure that it will never behave like one even if it had the same specs. The sales for PCs are declining for years now and the segment for "really tiny but oh so powerful systems" is probably nowhere near the size needed to convince manufacturers to put out good and cheap MXM cards. So you're stuck with expensive modules that only run on some systems, that need custom cooling only useful in those particular systems and very limited upgrade options. And what's the real benefit of an MXM card when compared to something like the R9 Nano? Yeah, the Nano is a little larger by a couple of cm on each side but it shows there's little need to implement yet another standard in the PC space that would only fragment the market even more and drive prices up. You can simply optimize and shrink what you already have. There's no reason future generations of GPUs couldn't be fit onto PCIe cards and installed horizontally in a "micro" case without having to worry that the card will be useless outside of that very custom system. Reply Valantar - Thursday, January 19, 2017 - link 1) The R9 Nano uses HBM, which is how they got it that tiny. Are you saying SFF builds should be limited to HBM-equipped GPUs, or GPUs low-end enough to require very little space? That makes little sense to me. 2) Sure, MXM was designed for low Z-height. But it mainly was designed to take up less area than standard PCIe. Would it be possible to make "desktop only" MXM cards with slightly taller (and probably cheaper) power delivery components? Absolutely. And the "less area" thing is what matters here. Again, you can get a _fully specced_ GTX 1080 in MXM form - only limited by cooling. Sure, it won't OC as well as the desktop cards, but that really doesn't matter. 3) "99% of the time you'd be hard pressed to find one that's actually speced like a desktop card." No. The entire mobile GTX 10XX series is ~identical to their desktop counterparts, with minor optimizations for power savings. Heck, the 1070 has _more_ cores than the desktop version (albeit at lower clocks). Performance differences stem mainly from lack of proper cooling. Which would be a very solveable problem in a case like this. 4) Sales for PCs are declining, sure. Sales for gaming PCs in every single possible form factor is growing. Including tiny "console replacement" PCs. Reply close - Thursday, January 19, 2017 - link 1) The GTX 1080 is so good in mobile devices because it's a very efficient chip (performance per watt). Are you saying SFF builds should be limited to very efficient chips? Is this your argument? o_O How can limiting them to MXM boards sound better? MXM has virtually 0 availability for desktops right now and even for laptops it rarely met its purpose. How long do you think it will take for high end GPUs (GTX 1080 equivalent) to have HBM? How long before MXM becomes mainstream and affordable? 2) It's very possible to make a standard PCIe card much smaller. And that's exactly the point. Why work with yet another standard that's incompatible with almost everything in the desktop space right now? With PCIe you'll be able to move your tiny card in a full size PC should you want that. 3) Absolutely identical save for the lower clocks and the fact that TDP limitations will always force that chip to drop clocks even further when used in a thermally constrained environment (like a laptop or typical MXM cooling). Long story short there is no practical MXM implementation right now that can compete with a desktop card implementation because of its intrinsic limitations. 4) How many games are sold is irrelevant. I was talking about a discreet GPU market that becomes relatively small and then you go on and split it between two completely incompatible formats: PCIe and MXM. Every other format goes for universal standardization (at every layer) so why should graphic cards be an exception? Just for the sake of exotic hardware? There's a tradeoff to be made here and it might not be worth it when it comes at the price of compatibility. Memory modules and SSDs can be made even smaller but they're not for compatibility's sake. You have the wrong answers because you're asking the wrong questions. The first one should have been "why invest into building a whole new hardware ecosystem instead of optimizing the one you have?". Reply Valantar - Friday, January 20, 2017 - link 1) Yes. Or, well, I'm not arguing that they _should_ be, I'm simply pointing out that due to the laws of thermodynamics and/or current cooling technology, SFF builds _are_ limited to one of three things: low-power GPUs, very efficient GPUs, or some sort of water cooling implementation. I'd LOVE for my Fury X to fit in a tiny chassis (heck, I'm moving it into a custom loop in an ITX case some time this year). But it can't. Below a certain volume, displacing >250W of heat simply becomes impractical. 2) Sure. But that would drive costs up massively - after all, miniaturization is as much of a reason for the cost of MXM cards as scarcity. SFF costs more, and will always cost more. I for one am willing to pay somewhat of a premium for that. Also, MXM _is_ PCIe. Making a PCIe-to-MXM adapter in the case of proliferation of these cards would be no problem whatsoever. Gigabyte already has one in their BRIX UHD. This would make for _more_ standardization and interchangeability, not less - you could migrate the GPU from your laptop to your desktop, or vice versa. Upgrade either, or both. Keep, and reuse, a part that would previously go to waste. And so on. 3) Lower clocks? Only due to TDP limitations. Nvidia is quite flexible with this, but they don't want people to fry their laptops simply because they've heard that overclocking is cool af. In a case like this, with sufficient cooling, there's no reason for the board to deliver equivalent clocks to stock cards. Will the power delivery handle similar OCs to a full PCIe board? Probably not. But neither would the power delivery on your proposed tiny PCIe card. 4) Who mentioned games? I sure as f*ck didn't. Please read before you comment. I said gaming PCs. Gaming PC sales are _rising_. Sure, AIB GPU sales are droppiing off, because sales of low-end (think GT 730, Radeon R7 240) are tanking. Cards like that used to represent HUGE sales numbers (with near zero margins, but nvm), but are now being replaced by capable iGPUs. Sales of midrange and high-end GPUs are either stable or rising. Sales numbers for >$200 GPUs are massively up the last 5-10 years. And no, I'm not asking the wrong questions here. If anyone is, you are. I'm talking about _increasing_ compatiblity. MXM is currently irrelevant because the market for gaming laptops used to be tiny, and when laptop makers had to design the graphics card custom any way, they might as well integrate it onto the motherboard. This is no longer the case, although integration is still done to a large degree for the sake of miniaturization (as thin-and-light gaming laptops are very popular). Still, the popularization of good gaming laptops could quite easily reinvigorate the MXM standard. Also, of course, the MXM-SIG needs to step up its game. But, you might ask, how can MXM cards increase compatibility? That's pretty easy. -They can be adapted to PCIe with relatively simple, low-cost adapters (that can carry over between generations, unless you need new display outputs). As mentioned, see the Brix UHD. -They allow for standardized coolers. You keep arguing for compatibility, but ignore the fact that GPUs are a free-for-all when it comes to cooling solutions. I'd love to see you fit a high-end cooler from the previous generation to a current-gen card, even from the same maker. Not a chance. Want custom cooling? Great, you can replace that every upgrade too! The clusterf*ck that is GPU coolers would benefit greatly from standardized component placements. A market where GPU coolers can be chosen like CPU coolers can is a market I welcome with open arms. And yes, this can of course be done with standard PCIe cards. But there's no incentive to do so, as added components (bigger power delivery and such) is considered a value-add, and standardized component placements could jeopordize this. In the SFF space, the incentive is there, as there's limited room for huge coolers, and fitting the cooler to the case is a more pressing issue. -They increase interchangeability. A single card could feasibly fit both laptops, SFF PCs and regular desktop PCs. Also, the PCIe form factor standard places pretty severe limitations on how small you can make cards. -IO slot sizes are standardized, and not optional. You're stuck with either HH slots or FH slots, and both have bulky and awkward form factors and mounting mechanisms for SFF. This isn't surprising, since this aspect of the standard is made to be compatible with AGP, PCI, ISA (and so on) slots, with dimensions worked out in the 80s and early 90s meant for servers and full-tower desktops. -PCIe power delivery is big and clunky, and has no place in SFF PCs. Of course, power connectors are adaptable. But for SFF use, a smaller standard (with higher quality requirements to make up for a smaller connector) is pretty much necessary. And the answer to your last question is: Because the one we have is reaching its limits in a number of significant ways*. This _should_ prompt a re-think. But then again, dumb people kept using Windows XP for more than a decade. I guess you can't beat'em all. *With the caveat that this isn't a new hardware ecosystem, but rather a compatible, adaptable, optimized implementation of an already-open standard. Reply close - Tuesday, January 24, 2017 - link And here I was thinking the point couldn't have been made clearer. There's some dissonance in what you're saying. Like how expensive it is to shrink a PCIe card just a little while being able to maintain compatibility with every desktop out there but thinking that making an almost inexistent standard in the PC market popular with adaptors and reengineering everything on the market must somehow be dirt cheap... In tomorrow's feature: microMXM for USFF, EMXM for larger but not so large builds. Also microSODIMM, microATX power connector, micro USB headers, micro M.2 slot, micro screw holes, and why not... micro CPU socket. Some of there require almost 0 re-engineering so maybe breaking compatibility is a small price to pay to get a slightly smaller footprint. And I'm sure you could easily just buy some adapters to make these compatible with everything else. I mean why would it make sense to do this with GPUs but no other component? P.S. Yeah, not a completely new hardware ecosystem... just one that barely registers on any radar even in the laptop market let alone the desktop market where I think it exists exclusively in a handful of OEM builds. But hey, if it sounds cool and exotic why not. I remember having an Asus sk. 479 adapter for the desktop. The next big thing.

RELATEDExclusive Reign Season 4 Intel: Meet Mary’s New Suitors, Among Other Key Players — Plus: Who’s Being Recast? The CW on Wednesday released the first official promo for the period drama’s final season, which finds all three queens — Mary (Adelaide Kane), Catherine (Megan Follows) and Elizabeth (Rachel Skarsten) — confessing the many twisted sins that have gotten them where they are today. There’s talk of “many lovers” and “terrible things” and “Satan’s power” … and that’s just from Catherine! RELATEDThe CW Renews The Flash, Supernatural, Crazy Ex and 4 Others In addition to concluding the tale of Mary Queen of Scots, Reign‘s final season — premiering Friday, Feb. 10 at 9/8c — will also answer a number of our questions from last season’s big cliffhanger.

He died earlier this year in Silicon Valley after a long fight with Parkinson’s disease. When one of the most powerful people in the world encourages us to be paranoid, maybe we should listen. And Grove isn’t the only powerful person urging caution. Even the director of the FBI — the same official who recently paid hackers a million dollars to unlock a shooter’s iPhone — is encouraging everyone to cover their webcams. But you obey the law. What do you have to worry about? As the motto of the United Kingdom’s surveillance program reminds us, “If you’ve got nothing to hide, you’ve got nothing to fear.” Well, law-abiding citizens do have reason to fear. They do have reasons to secure their devices, their files, and their communications with loved ones. “If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged.” — Cardinal Richelieu in 1641 In this article, I will show you how you can protect yourself by leveraging state-of-the-art encryption. In a single sitting, you can make great strides toward securing your privacy. Common sense security for everyone To be clear, everything I recommend here is 100% free and 100% legal. If you bother locking your doors at night, you should bother using encryption. “Be prepared” — The Scout Motto Let’s get prepared. First, a couple definitions. When I use the term “attacker” I mean anyone trying to access your data whom you haven’t given express permission to — whether it’s a hacker, a corporation, or even a government. And when I use the terms “private” or “secure”, I mean reasonably so. The reality is that — as long as humans are involved — no system will ever be 100% private or 100% secure. As long as your phone, computers, and accounts are sufficiently protected, their contents will remain an “encrypted lump” and there’s not much anyone — regardless of how powerful they are — can do about it. Tip #1: Use two-factor authentication on your inbox Your inbox is the skeleton key to your life. If an attacker compromises it, they can not only read your emails, they can use it to reset your passwords for pretty much anything. This includes social media accounts and even bank accounts. The simplest thing you can do to dramatically improve your personal security is to turn on two-factor authentication on your inbox. Basically, two-factor authentication is a second layer of security when signing in. It usually involves receiving a text message with a special code whenever you sign into your account. Two-factor authentication substantially reduces the likelihood of your inbox getting hacked. If you use Gmail, you should activate two-factor auth here. Now. Seriously. I’ll still be here when you get back. Tip #2: Encrypt your hard drive Both Windows and MacOS have built-in full-disk encryption. You just need to turn it on. Tip #3: Turn on your phone’s password protection Thumbprint identification is better than nothing, but it’s often not enough. The fifth amendment (against self-incrimination) allows you to keep your password secret. But a court can compel you to unlock your phone with your thumbprint. Also, you can’t exactly change your thumbprint after an attacker gets ahold of it. An attacker will usually get 10 tries before your phone will completely lock them out. So if your 4-digit password is one of these common ones, change it. 1234

1010 Pro Tip: if you insist on enabling thumbprint identification for convenience’s sake, and are ever arrested, immediately power off your phone. When the authorities turn your phone back on, they won’t be able to unlock it without your password. Tip #4: Use different passwords for each service. Passwords are inherently insecure. Mark Zuckerberg used the password “dadada” on his LinkedIn account. Earlier this year, when hackers released 117 million email-password combinations, his was among them. Hackers were then able to use his email and password to gain access to his Twitter and Pinterest accounts. So don’t use the same password more than one place. Of course, remembering a ton of passwords is a hassle, so use a password manager. Tip #5: Send private text messages with Signal Signal is a popular messaging service that got a perfect score from theElectronic Frontier Foundation. You can do all the things you would normally do through text messages, like have group messages and send photos and videos. Except that everything’s encrypted. Signal is free, open source, and available in iOS and Android app stores. I was able to set it up and start messaging securely with friends and family in less than 5 minutes. Step #1: Install Signal Step #2: Invite friends to install it Step #3: Send messages Congratulations — you can now talk with your friends and family about whatever you want, and it will be practically impossible for anyone to spy on your conversation. You can also use Signal to make secure phone calls. Tip #6: Your browser’s incognito mode isn’t private enough Even if you use Chrome’s “Incognito Mode” or Firefox’s “Private Browsing”, the following parties will still be able to snoop in on your network activity: Internet service providers System administrators in charge of the network at your school, workplace, or wherever get online Google, or whoever made your browser Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, and other browsers are no more private. If you want reasonably private browsing (no system can ever be 100% secure), you should use Tor. Tip #7: Browse in private with Tor Tor stands for “The Onion Router” which is a reference to its use of many onion-like layers to mask network activity. It’s free, open source, and reasonably easy to use. Step #1: Download the Orbot Step #2: Download the Orfox browser Step #3: Open Orbot Step #4: Open Orfox Step #5: Verify it worked Visit check.torproject.org to verify everything worked. Congratulations — you can now use the internet with peace of mind that it would be extremely difficult for anyone to track you. Tip #8: Search in private If Tor isn’t convenient enough for you, you can at least search privately using DuckDuckGo, the search engine that doesn’t track you. DuckDuckGo doesn’t have all the thousands of engineer-years poured into its search engine that Google has, but it does have a shortcut to get encrypted Google searches when you need them. You just need to prefix your search with !google If you want to learn more about cryptography and information security, check out this deep yet accessible book: Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know Edit descriptionamzn.to Thank you for reading this privacy guide.

The company offers these drives in four capacities ranging from 128GB up to 1TB, but curiously launched them with the same 72 TBW endurance level for all versions. Those numbers were revised later on with figures as high as 576 TBW. TR has previously shown that most SSDs are capable of reliably writing data far past their specified endurance rating. Now, Chris Ramseyer over at Tom's Hardware decided to see what would happen if he pushed an Intel 600p 256GB drive to the bloody limit, and then shared the results with the world. In our testing, a now somewhat-ancient Intel 335 Series 240 GB SSD was able to write just over 700TB of random data before its internal monitors triggered autophagy. At the very end of its life, the drive went into a read-only state, and after a reboot, the data on it was completely inaccessible. For testing the 600p 256GB unit, Tom's used an even harsher torture test with non-stop 4K write operations. Bearing the difference in testing methods in mind, it's still a little surprising to see that the 600p that Tom's tested switched to read-only mode after less than 110TB of writes. On a brighter note, the data on the drive was recoverable even after the drive was unpowered for a full thirty days. The Intel 600p 256GB drive bears an endurance rating of 144 TBW, though that figure is almost certainly not derived from the extremely punishing methods used in Tom's testing. Ramseyer's report includes additional information about the drive's performance degradation nearing its time of death, as well as more general information about the SSD's error-checking and correction. The piece is an interesting read and well worth checking out.   Tags: Storage User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft announces the availability of Clear Linux OS on Azure 2 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Jan 18, 2017 at 17:52 GMT2 weeks ago Microsoft today announced the availability of Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture in Azure Marketplace. Clear Linux OS is an open source Linux distribution built for cloud and data center environments for maximum performance on Intel architecture. Microsoft is announcing the following today: A bare-bones VM, intended to serve as a starting point for those wanting to explore and build out a system with bundles of their choosing A container image that includes the popular Docker container runtime, and, A sample solution image for developing machine learning applications, pre-loaded with popular open source tools In addition to the performance features of Clear Linux, the DevOps teams will benefit from the stateless capabilities of Clear Linux in Azure. By separating the system defaults and distribution best practices from the user configuration, Clear Linux simplifies maintenance and deployment which becomes very important as infrastructure scales. “Our team is delighted to have worked with Intel since day one on this project, and to bring Clear Linux to Azure Marketplace and our customers as a result of that collaboration”, said KY Srinivasan from the Enterprise Open Source Team at Microsoft.

The new ZenBook 3 Deluxe UX490UA boasts with Intel’s latest Kaby Lake-U microprocessors, up to 16 GB of memory, up to 1 TB SSD along with an advanced audio sub-system, an updated keyboard and a fingerprint reader in a 12.9 mm-thick design that weighs around 1.1 kilograms (2.4 lbs). ASUS’ ZenBook is among the most popular families of ultra-thin laptops on the market today that competes against the likes of Apple's MacBook, Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 as well as the HP Spectre. The PCs come with fully-fledged Intel Core processors along with a choice of high-capacity SSDs as well as a rather decent spec list in general. As it appears, ASUS decided to improve ZenBook’s design further by adding a larger 14” display, a high-capacity 46 Wh battery, an advanced audio sub-system co-designed with Harman Kardon, a trusted platform module as well as two Thunderbolt 3 ports and a USB 3.1 Type-C port. The Deluxe version of the ZenBook 3 laptop weds business features with multimedia capabilities, style and expandability options: a rather rare combination. ASUS ZenBook 3 Deluxe UX490A at Glance   UX390UA-XH74-BL UX390UA-DH51-GR Display Resolution 1920×1080 Panel 14" IPS 178° viewing angles 100% sRGB Corning Gorilla Glass 5 SoC Intel Core i7-7500U 2C/4T, 2.7-3.5 GHz, 15W, Intel HD 620 Intel Core i5-7200U 2C/4T, 2.5-3.1 GHz, 15W, Intel HD 620 RAM 16 GB LPDDR3-2133 8 GB LPDDR3-2133 Storage 256 GB SATA SSD 512 GB NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD 1 TB NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD Camera VGA webcam Wireless 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.1 I/O ports 2 × Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.1 Type-C Audio 4 × Speakers (co-designed with Harman Kardon) 1 × TRRS 3.5-mm jack for headset Dimensions 329 × 216 × 12.9 mm Weight 1100 grams Battery 46 Wh OS Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Fingerprint Sensor Yes Finish Royal Blue Silver Gray Availability Available at ASUS Store and retailers ETA date unknown The ASUS ZenBook 3 Deluxe UX490UA is based on the Intel Core i5/i7 processor with integrated HD Graphics 620 and Microsoft’s Windows 10 Pro operating system. Different versions of the ZenBook 3 Deluxe UX490UA will be equipped with 8 or 16 GB of LPDDR3-2133 DRAM as well as up to 1 TB PCIe 3.0 x4 SSD. For connectivity, the laptop uses an 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 wireless module, has one USB 3.1 Type-C header (which is also used for charging) and is equipped with two Thunderbolt 3 ports that can work in DisplayPort 1.2 and USB 3.1 Gen 2 modes. The laptop can be connected to 4K displays, an external GPU and an external storage system, greatly expanding its capabilities. To ensure that the PC does not overheat or throttle, ASUS uses a new 3-mm thick cooling solution that it expects to be efficient enough for the CPU and the SSD. Like other high-end ZenBook laptops, the UX490UA comes in unibody enclosure made of an aluminum alloy that is said to be stronger compared to a standard aluminum alloy. To protect the display, the ZenBook 3 Deluxe uses Gorilla Glass 5 from Corning. Meanwhile, depending on configuration, the new ZenBook will come in a blue or a gray finish. It is worth noting that unlike some other Zenbook high-end models (such as the Zenbook Infinity), as far as we can tell, this device will not be touch screen enabled. ASUS did not announce pricing of its ZenBook 3 Deluxe UX490UA machines, but given that the PC will exist in multiple configurations, it will vary quite significantly. For example, ASUS’ ZenBook 3 non-Deluxe laptops are available for $1099 and $1599, depending on specs. Keep in mind that the Deluxe versions of ASUS products are naturally positioned above the rest, so expect the ZenBook 3 Deluxe to come at a premium.

Go wigle your dongles elsewhere asus, nice job on the frame and the specs, but turn your dongle elsewhere Reply TheTurboFool - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link What are you prattling on about? It has three ports, which is a pretty decent number, and USB-C is the future. Whether or not you like that fact doesn't change it. Give it a few years and we won't need anything else. The only time the dongles get ridiculous is when there's only one port. Reply Raniz - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link 1 USB-C and 2 ThunderBolt 3. I'd rather see 2 USB-C and 1 TB3 or even just 3 USB-C and no TB3. Reply PCTC2 - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link You do realize that Thunderbolt ports are compatible with USB-C, right? So you can use them as 3 USB-C, or any combination of the two. Reply edwpang - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link About to post the same, but I forgot my password, so... Reply fanofanand - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link Yes but nobody has any TB3 peripherals so you end up having to buy a dongle, which was the OP's complaint. Reply grant3 - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link Do you not realize that TB3 + USB-C use the exact same plugs? And that USB devices will operate when connected into a TB3 port? No need for dongles. You should read about the technology!! Reply eldakka - Thursday, January 19, 2017 - link Not necessarily. USB-C port is a port capable of supporting many standards, Thunderbolt, USB, DP, and others (in a special mode). A USB-C port CAN be: ONLY Thunderbolt-3 ONLY USB 3.1/3.0 ONLY DisplayPort ONLY none of the above OR it can be any combination of the above. So you can have a USB-C port that supports TB3 and DP, but not USB 3/3.1. Or USB and DP but not TB3. So unless the specification SPECIFICALLY state that the USB-C ports that support TB3 ALSO support USB, then there is no guarantee, nor expectation, that they also support USB. Type-A has been the standard in desktops and laptops for something like 20 years. There are an awful lot of USB-A devices around, I'd suspect most people have many times more USB-A devices in current use than USB-C. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't go USB-C, but it needs to be phased in. I mean, it's only been mainstream for a year, if that. Therefore for at least the next 2 years, I think it would only be sensible to include both USB-C and A-type ports on anything except the tiniest devices (e.g. tablets, phones). A 14" laptop at this point in the USB-C adoption cycle could have 2 Type-C and 2 type-A ports. The A ports don't even have to be 3.1 gen2, they could be 3.0. In a years time, make it 3 C and 1 A, and a year or 2 after that remove the remaining type-A, preferably replacing it with a type C. I think 3 USB ports (especially if at least 1 of them is going to be doing double-duty as a display-out) is too limiting for a 14" range laptop. Reply grant3 - Saturday, January 21, 2017 - link TB3 by definition supports USB 3.1 - Gen 2. It's in the specification. That is your "guarantee" that the TB3 ports support USB. Please stop spreading lies. Reply fanofanand - Wednesday, January 25, 2017 - link He wasn't spreading lies, he clearly states that TB3 CAN support USB. It's not automatic and a TB3 port is not identical to a USB-C, so maybe you should stop spreading lies.

Boffins flex ARM in 'first-of-its-kind' bonkers HPC rig £3m granted for 'emerging architectures' supercomputing mashup Met Office XC40 could be facing ARM replacement 18 Jan 2017 at 15:57, Chris Mellor A fellowship of four UK universities, along with HPC veteran Cray and the Met Office, have been handed £3m to build a 10,000+ ARM core supercomputer. The project could settle whether ARM-based supercomputers can beat Xeon ones on cost while offering the right performance. The scheme is called Isambard, after 19th century Brit engineering heavyweight Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was revealed by Prof Simon McIntosh-Smith, the leader of the effort, and professor of High Performance Computing at the University of Bristol, at the Barcelona-based Mont-Blanc conference on January 17. The theme of the conference, handily, was “ARM: On the road to HPC.” Four southwest UK universities – Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter – form the GW4 Alliance. It will work with what it calls two industry partners – Cray and the Met Office – to build the Isambard service and system, which will be hosted by the Met Office. They are receiving the £3m grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), which is the main funding agency for engineering and physical sciences research in the UK. In a press announcement McIntosh-Smith said, “Scientists have a growing choice of potential computer architectures to choose from, including new 64-bit ARM CPUs, graphics processors, and many-core CPUs from Intel. Choosing the best architecture for an application can be a difficult task, so the new Isambard GW4 Tier 2 HPC service aims to provide access to a wide range of the most promising emerging architectures, all using the same software stack." He added: "Isambard is a unique system that will enable direct ‘apples-to-apples’ comparisons across architectures, thus enabling UK scientists to better understand which architecture best suits their application.” Although this implies the Isambard service will have multiple compute hardware architectures, it appears that the installation will be mostly ARM-based. McIntosh-Smith told TOP500 News. “It’s one of, if not the first serious, large(ish)-scale ARMv8 64-bit production machines. And it’s the first time Cray has explicitly announced an ARMv8 product meant for more than just prototyping.” We might consider that the Bull Mont-Blanc system uses Cavium's Thunder X2 64-bit ARMv8-A server processor SoC (System-on-Chip). Cray may well do likewise with Isambard. The system specs: It will also feature some x86 CPUs, Knights Landing Xeon Phi co-processors, and NVIDIA P100 GPUs. Cray’s clustered CS400 (PDF) uses Xeon E52600-v4 CPUS and optionally supports Phi co-processors and NVIDIA Tesla GPUs plus FDR InfiniBand, QDR True Scale or Intel’s Omni-Path interconnects. Adrian Tate, director of Cray’s EMEA Research Lab, said Cray would build an Isambard centre of excellence: “We are excited to be a part of this important collaboration with GW4 and the Met Office as we work together to explore and evaluate diverse processing technologies within a unified architecture. By building a Centre of Excellence with GW4 and technology partners, we expect deep insights into application efficiency using new processing technologies, and we relish the opportunity to share these insights with the UK scientific community.” Isambard will offer a tier-2 HPC service to UK-based scientists. Paul Selwood, Manager for HPC Optimisation at the Met Office said: “This system will enable us … to accelerate insights into how our weather and climate models need to be adapted for these emerging CPU architectures.” In other words, the Met Office will see how Isambard performs running its weather and climate modelling software. That runs at the moment on an x86-based Cray XC40 supercomputer and Isambard may offer a cheaper alternative needing less electricity. Other Isambard service users will also be able to evaluate how their HPC jobs run on ARM hardware instead of the Cray x86 kit they currently use. The evaluation could reveal whether ARM CPUs need Phi-like co-processors and/or GPU help in computing the jobs currently run on Cray XC30, Xeon-CS400 and XC40 systems. Cray has not announced an ARM-based CS400 product initiative and we should not assume that it will. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 15 Comments More from The Register ARM buys HPC software specialist Allinea to help devs code good If Intel and IBM think HPC is a two-horse race, they need to think again 2 Comments Exascale HPC project pours Euro gravy into Mont-Blanc SoCing it to the ARM-powered nodes Fujitsu picks 64-bit ARM for Japan's monster 1,000-PFLOPS super ISC Sparc dumped in high-RISC maneuver? 58 Comments Fujitsu: Why we chose 64-bit ARM over SPARC for our exascale super Hot Chips Clue: When was the last time you heard nice things about SPARC Linux? 24 Comments Fujitsu's billion-dollar ARM supercomputer delayed by up to 2 years Japan's exascale Flagship 2020 looking more like Flagship 2022 after CPU design headaches 18 Comments HPE is creaming Dell in HPC Servers you right, says shrinker to bulked up big boy 3 Comments Whitepapers Accelerated Computing and the Democratization of Supercomputing This whitepaper provides an analysis on how accelerators like the NVIDIA Tesla P100 can lower data center cost by up to 50%.

The portfolio included six new gaming motherboards for the Intel Z270 chipset, new laptops, and a new graphics card: the Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G slated to hit store shelves soon. According to the specifications, the new card is overclocked right out of the box, offering two modes: Gaming and Overclocked. Here are the speeds for the graphics chip, the accompanying 8GB of on-board GDDR5X video memory, and also the reference GTX 1080 board just for comparison: GPU Memory Nvidia’s Reference Base Speed: 1,607MHz 10,000MHz Nvidia’s Reference Boost Speed: 1,733MHz N/A Gaming Mode Base Speed: 1,759MHz 10,206MHz Gaming Mode Boost Speed: 1,898MHz N/A Overclocked Mode Base Speed: 1,784MHz 10,400MHz Overclocked Mode Boost Speed: 1,936MHz N/A Now here are the remaining hardware specs of the new card: Architecture: Pascal Process technology: 16nm CUDA Cores: 2,560 Memory Bus: 256-bit Memory Bandwidth: 320GB per second Card Bus: PCI Express 3.0 x16 I/O Ports (Standard Mode): 1x Dual-Link DVI-D 3x DisplayPort 1.4 1x HDMI 2.0b I/O Ports (VR Mode): 3x DisplayPort 1.4 3x HDMI 2.0b Digital max resolution: 7,680 x 4,320 @ 60Hz Multi-view: 4 Recommended Power Supply: 500 watts with two 8-pin external connectors According to Gigabyte, the GTX 1080 Aorus Xtreme Edition 8G outperforms the GTX 1080 Founder’s Edition and the GTX 980Ti reference card in three popular PC games.

Along with heat pipes, a large copper base plate resides on the front of the card to dissipate most of the heat away from the graphics chip and on-board memory via direct contact. Another large copper plate resides on the back to pull heat away from the back of the graphics chip. On the lighting front, the card has an illuminated Aorus logo on the side, an illuminated logo on the back, and four stripes converging to the Aorus logo residing over the middle cooling fan. Configurable through Gigabyte’s free software, users can choose the right colors to match the system’s overall color scheme, and select from five lighting effects consisting of Cycling, Consistent, Flash, Dual Flash, and Breathing. The card also includes an Aorus VR Link component, which Gigabyte boasts as the only output technology currently on the market that supports four display combinations for virtual reality without the need for an additional adapter. Aorus VR Link adds two HDMI ports to the side of the card, enabling the following video output configurations: Setup 1 Setup 2 Setup 3 Setup 4 VR Headset (HDMI) VR Headset (HDMI) VR Headset (HDMI) VR Headset (HDMI) DisplayPort HDMI HDMI HDMI DisplayPort HDMI DisplayPort DisplayPort DisplayPort Right now, there’s no official word on availability and pricing, but the company is expected to launch the card in February for somewhere around $800 here in the United States. The card will come with a 4-year warranty that must be activated by registering the card online.

By Mary-Ann Russon January 18, 2017 14:38 GMT Did Qualcomm help to get rid of the WiMax wireless standard? FTC bosses seem to think so in a lawsuit over anticompetitive practicesReuters The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is suing Qualcomm for alleged unfair patent licensing policies that harmed competitors by illegally forcing them out of the market. The semiconductor manufacturer is also in trouble for entering into exclusive deals with Apple, such as allegedly bribing it not to make a WiMax iPhone. WiMax was a wireless technology that was meant to be used to build 4G networks. It was first formally defined as a standard in 2001 and was heavily backed by semiconductor manufacturer Intel and infrastructure provider Cisco. WiMax was designed to provide 30-40Mbps mobile data speeds, and eventually in 2011 the standard was updated to provide speeds of up to 1Gbps. Initially WiMax did really well – mobile operators in 148 countries were deploying fixed line and mobile networks using the technology by October 2010, but then from 2011 onwards, there was a sharp decline in WiMax usage. Even though WiMax networks were already in existence and it offered fast mobile data speeds, it became much cheaper for mobile operators to upgrade their 3G networks, rather than building a whole new network using WiMax, which used a new type of technology that could be used to provide broadband internet as well as mobile internet. Although having WiMax would mean that mobile operators could then offer both mobile internet and regular broadband services as a sort of "universal internet", they wouldn't be able to compete with low prices offered by existing DSL and cable broadband providers, so mobile operators decided to pick the cheaper option to get to 4G. Suddenly operators all over the world were switching to back an alternative 4G technology called LTE instead, and WiMax's popularity fell even further when no WiMax smartphones appeared on the market. No WiMax phones meant no consumers were using it to access mobile internet – they were still using the old 3G networks, which were fast running out of bandwidth. Qualcomm asked Apple not to make WiMAX iPhones A rare example of a WiMax device - an Airstream 1200 USB ModemBijay chaurasia / Wikimedia Commons This is where Qualcomm comes in. The semiconductor manufacturer was strongly opposed to WiMax, and according to the FTC, may have actively helped to kill off the standard by convincing Apple, the biggest smartphone manufacturer in the world, not to build phones that worked on the standard. "Apple has negotiated with Qualcomm in an effort to reduce the royalty burden that Apple bears through its contract manufacturers. As a result of these negotiations, Apple entered into agreements with Qualcomm in 2007, 2011, and 2013," the FTC's lawyers write in the redacted complaint. "Under a 2007 agreement, Qualcomm agreed to rebate to Apple royalties that Qualcomm received from Apple's contract manufacturers in excess of a specified per-handset cap. Qualcomm's payment obligations were conditioned upon, among other things, Apple not selling or licensing a handset implementing the WiMax standard, a prospective fourth-generation cellular standard championed by Intel and opposed by Qualcomm." The FTC also claims that Qualcomm made life incredibly difficult for other processor manufacturers by persuading Apple to sign an agreement ensuring that Apple only put Qualcomm chips into its products over a five-year period from 2011 to 2016. Bullying "no licence, no chips" policy The FTC complaint references Qualcomm's 'no licence, no chips' policy. Smartphone manufacturers need baseband processors in order to build smartphones, because the chip is the core of smartphones that control all its functions. However, it seems that if a manufacturer wanted Qualcomm to sell it the chips, it would also have to agree to purchase expensive licences for patents relating to established mobile standards. Forcing people to buy things they don't need in order to get something they do want is a violation of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) licensing terms set out by the FTC. However Apple agreed to sign the agreement because Qualcomm promised to give it a discount on the licence royalties. If Apple decided anytime in the five-year period to use another manufacturer's chips in its products instead, then the agreement meant Apple would have to back pay Qualcomm the full value of the licence payments from October 2011 onwards. "Several former competitors of Qualcomm have sold off or shuttered their baseband processor businesses, unable to achieve the sales volumes and margins needed to sustain a viable business...if Qualcomm's remaining competitors were to exit the business as a result of Qualcomm's anticompetitive conduct, this would have a significant adverse impact on competition in baseband processor markets and on innovation," FTC concludes, asking the court to stop Qualcomm from engaging in any further unlawful conduct. "Enhanced innovation in mobile technologies would offer substantial consumer benefits, especially as these technologies expand to new applications, including extending mobile connectivity to consumer appliances, vehicles, buildings, and other products (the 'Internet of Things'). By suppressing innovation, Qualcomm's anticompetitive practices threaten these benefits. "Qualcomm's practices have harmed competition and consumers both within the markets for CDMA and premium LTE baseband processors and in other baseband processor markets in which OEMs pay Qualcomm inflated royalties. These include markets for UMTScompliant baseband processors and lower-tier LTE baseband processors." Qualcomm has issued a statement refuting the FTC's complaint. "This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint on the eve of Chairwoman Ramirez's departure and the transition to a new Administration, which reflects a sharp break from FTC practice," said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel, Qualcomm Incorporated. "In our recent discussions with the FTC, it became apparent that it still lacked basic information about the industry and was instead relying on inaccurate information and presumptions. In fact, Qualcomm was still receiving requests for information from the agency that would be necessary to an informed view of the facts when it became apparent that the FTC was driving to file a complaint before the transition to the new Administration. We have grave concerns about the two Commissioners' decision to bring this case despite a lack of evidence supporting the allegations and theories in the complaint. We look forward to defending our business in federal court, where we are confident we will prevail on the merits."

AMD in 2017: Will new graphics and processors be worth the wait? by Michael Passingham 18 January 2017 0 shares Read Comments Are AMD’s big CPU and GPU launches in 2017 going to be worth the wait? Computing Editor Michael Passingham asks AMD to make its case. Covering AMD’s not-yet-launched Vega GPUs and Ryzen CPUs has been an exercise in frustration for months. Not because the products look bad, but because I – and everybody else – always wants to know more than AMD is willing to let on. We have performance figures. We know that when compared to a like-for-like Intel processor, an AMD Ryzen chip can perform better with a lower power consumption. Related: Everything you need to know about AMD Ryzen AND: Everything you need to know about AMD Vega They’ll be more fun to overclock, too, with well-cooled PCs getting even better performance thanks to AMD’s extended frequency range technology. But we don’t know which price bands AMD is aiming at, or how far down this competitive performance will trickle. We know that its new Vega GPUs, set to take on the high-end graphics card market, can run Doom in 4K at its highest settings at a stable 70+fps. What we don't really know is what the final products based on Vega architecture will look like. Why should buyers wait even longer, putting off PC builds they so dearly want to start? At CES 2017 I put this question to Jim Anderson, AMD’s senior vice president and general manager of the computing and graphics business group. “I think what the consumer will see when we fully launch is that the amount of performance we’re bringing per dollar is phenomenal. It’s user experience per dollar. That’s why I’d say I’d wait.” Performance per dollar has always been the callsign for AMD kit, so perhaps this isn’t surprising. But the level of confidence this close to launch is certainly something worth noting. Related: Ultimate gaming PC building guide AMD's Jim Anderson AMD didn’t do a showy press conference at CES, unlike both Nvidia (who bagged the first keynote slot) and Intel (whose VR-based conference was fun for everyone in the room, and not much fun for everybody else). Yet in their conference centre suite was a roster of a dozen Ryzen-based PC builds from system builders all over the world, alongside 15 motherboards from all the big manufacturers, ready to accept new Ryzen CPUs. Why not be a bit more showy beyond the confines of a conference suite? “We’ve tried to be very careful about not getting ahead of ourselves and rolling out information in a controlled way and making sure of what we’ve committed to,” explains Anderson. In other words, the company does not want to overpromise and under deliver – something we see all too often in the computing sphere. Rightly or wrongly, AMD also finds itself as a sort of people’s champion, taking on the perceived might of Intel and Nvidia in the CPU and GPU portions of the market. It's a line they’re keen on following. Anderson adds: “I think this end of the market has been starved of innovation and competition. We’ve finally got some choice and some innovation and that’s good for everybody and the industry.” Related: Best graphics cards How far down will these developments trickle? It’s all well and good serving the high-end enthusiast market but true market share boosts can’t come unless cheaper devices benefit as well. “Certainly we want to take our graphics processing capability across as broad markets as we can," said Anderson. "We’ll have that graphics in high-end and integrated into SoCs (systems a chip) on a laptop, and we’ll have discrete graphics that are more price focussed. We’ll take that strategy and blow that out across all use cases.” Sounds promising, but, again, we need to know more. Vega and Ryzen are set to appear in the first half of this year, with Ryzen rumoured to be launching in a little over a month. But without knowing which price sectors the firm is targeting, it remains difficult to categorically say whether you should wait or not. Whatever you choose to do, things should be about to get very interesting for PC gamers.

Let us know in the comments below. 0 shares Read Comments Andrew January 18, 2017, 1:27 pm "Vega and Ryzen are set to launch in the first quarter of this year." Unfortunately Vega is "H1". By the time it launches the 11 series from Nvidia will be almost with us. Michael Passingham January 18, 2017, 1:39 pm Good spot - indeed, first half for Vega. Not sure if we'll have elevensies by that point, but it's certainly been a very long time coming. Andrew January 18, 2017, 1:50 pm Agreed that 11 won't be quite here, but Nvidia are fairly regular with yearly updates and the 1080 was launched in May (27th?) last year. Best case for Vega is it launches 1 year after the 1080, by then Nvidia have made the big bucks and can choose to compete with Vega on price whilst launching 11 when they choose. Vega has to be good news, competition in the market always is. But I don't see Nvidia getting too worried just yet. nextwave1980 January 18, 2017, 5:20 pm I'll be jumping on the Ryzen CPU the moment its available. I've been plugging away rendering on a FX6300 and can't wait to replace it with this CPU. Whole new build .. can't wait. AMindAmoK January 18, 2017, 6:05 pm But did they actually launch in May or did they just say they launched and let everyone sit in a holding pattern for 3 months? Shane Hoelscher January 18, 2017, 7:37 pm Well, I wanted to wait but I have money burning a hole in my pocket and I'm really in need of an upgrade so going to end up upgrading with intel/nvidia now, even if I spend a little extra. I've been using intel/nvidia for 10+ years and wanted to give team red a chance since there products seemed promising, but i've been waiting for too long now for relevant information on what kind of price point i'm looking at and AMD refuses to throw us a bone. I guess it takes the die hard fanboys of AMD to really be unwavering in waiting. looncraz January 18, 2017, 10:59 pm You can't wait one month? Vega is a ways out, so I can understand just going for nVidia, but Zen looks to be offering much more for, most likely, less money. Not even AMD knows what price points are going to see what level of performance, yet. This stuff takes time. Geoff Graham January 19, 2017, 3:32 am And Intel will drop prices, regardless. And so will Nvidia. Just wait a bit. Geoff Graham January 19, 2017, 3:33 am Good point. I guess they knew we would wait... Mike Jackson January 19, 2017, 6:23 am I'm going to laugh at you when Intel & Nvidia drop their prices MASSIVELY to counter AMD.......enjoy throwing your money away cause you couldn't wait a few more months. PRAFTD January 19, 2017, 6:41 am Won't happen. We may see prices drop a bit, but it won't be substantially. They never have done so in the past. Their respective markets are so huge, that I doubt they are threatened by AMD taking it. PRAFTD January 19, 2017, 6:43 am Some people who have already been waiting 8+ months, you upgrade when you need to. If you spend all your time waiting for the next big thing when building a PC, you will never actually build one. Mihael Martusheff January 19, 2017, 7:40 am I was told by somebody more knowledgeable than I to wait for this to conclude before building my PC, because part prices will decrease, but how much would I be saving? If it's around $100, that could be put to an okay mouse or headset, but if it's any less, I just wanna start my build right now, lol. Eager first-time PC builder... Ivan Yankov January 19, 2017, 8:10 am It's not only about the price. These CPU-s may actually be good and having more than the 4 cores of the i7 can be beneficial. Otherwise I'm not sure Intel will drop their prices much if at all :/ the new 7 series is just a clock increase and overclock increase nothing more. Ivan Yankov January 19, 2017, 8:12 am I sill don't like that the mainstream i7 are with 4 cores ... if the CPU is pushed to the limit hyper threading have really diminishing returns. QuickshooterMk2 January 19, 2017, 9:59 am Ryzen-yes Vega-fuck no. 1080TI is the way to go Xcalibur January 19, 2017, 1:15 pm You'll be paying 300 dollars more for 20 percent less the performance lol. Xcalibur January 19, 2017, 1:18 pm All of AMD's cards will be unveiled by May this year. I've been waiting for a half a year. Another couple of months wouldnt hurt now would they? Деян Добромиров January 19, 2017, 1:20 pm Wait till all of these come out. I think it is worth it as I am AMD fan :D Andrew January 19, 2017, 3:23 pm What makes AMD any different ? They have mooted "Vega" for a long time, we've heard rumoured dates for an eternity, the latest expectation was Q1, now we are H1, when it finally launches (and there's still no date) will there actually be any cards, how flawed will the drivers be, how far away will series 11 be ? Andrew January 19, 2017, 3:24 pm 20% faster than a 1080Ti for $300 less, in H1 this year. Love it. Have you thought of doing stand-up comedy.? Andrew January 19, 2017, 3:29 pm Intel won't drop the mainstream CPU prices massively. That's silly talk which may sadly influence those who read these threads and don't know any better. And neither will Nvidia (with Vega). It's already probable the green team have delayed the 1080Ti due to further Vega delays into "H1" and when Vega is finally launched they will counter what they "need" to, then bring out the Series 11 cards and move the playing field again. Mistermatrix24 January 19, 2017, 3:39 pm They will. Everything will come crashing down upon you in a Y2K esque fever dream. CPU's shall melt and HDD will scratch! All data as we know it will be no more! Chris Ashton January 19, 2017, 4:32 pm And you know this despite having no comparisons how? Matrim Cauthon January 19, 2017, 5:32 pm You should have built it during the black friday/cyber monday/christmas sales. I upgraded a computer I didn't need to, but I did it because sales aligned and I know that it will take at least 4-6 months for stock to stabilize enough for most people to even grab new architecture. At which time, I can just upgrade from my 1080 to the ti or whatever and I value an on sale hybrid 1080 with 6 months of entertainment over what 1 or 2 hundred dollars I may have saved by causing myself undue anxiety and distress from intentionally putting off upgrading. Having said that, I still think now is a good time if you can catch good prices because as I said, stock will be sold out for months on anything worth a damn and six months is a long time to "hold out" in the pc world. You are basically waiting out an entire generation. I will say that one of the biggest pushes for my move from a 970 to a 1080 is because of my decision to grab a refurbished from acer predator 1440p xb271hu for 500 that you just cannot beat. It is flawless and I bought it back in May so I think it's going to last a while. To sum up, this is your introduction to pc gaming, it'll have an adjustment period but is overall well worth it. You just need to kind of watch here and there for parts because you get surprise sales for one big peripheral constantly like I did with the monitor which was on sale out of season and has given me endless joy. You will get the hang of it, and if you have a good sense of things, you will discover when to buy pc parts and when to wait, though sometimes the anxiety makes it so you just cannot wait haha. I rarely post on these types of forums, but I have been wanting to assist people with new building information as I feel most people fall into the boat of being too cheap to afford the best that they really want, and people that just have too much money and will always say to buy whatever the best is because money is no object to them. I fall in the middle, I can afford the "best" for gaming, not high end 8-16 core business cpus and what not, but pretty top tier. I have learned how the market works, and I vulture around every now and then to descend upon too good to pass upon deals I come across and then try to finish the rest within the year if sales and performance increase are both good enough in my opinion to warrant the upgrade. Apologies for so much text, but you really can't put to words what I am trying to convey in one or two paragraphs, and this way you have ample information to work with. Let me know if you need anymore information. I'll try to do my best to assist you and can even write down my setup if you are curious. Have a pleasant day! tl;dr You have 6 months-ish before stock stabilizes on any new pc product, especially gpu. You need to weigh out whether spending one to two hundred more now is worth the extra 6 months of entertainment you will get, along with lacking anxiety from the added patience of waiting upwards of 6 months to build. If you can grab them at a good price, then in my opinion hell yeah get it! :) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

Finance Search ASML etches 'remarkable' 2016 profitAFP – Wed, Jan 18, 2017 11:37 AM AEDT Related Content View Photo ASML is considered a bellwether of the global high-tech industry as it supplies manufacturing giants such as Samsung and Intel ASML, the Dutch maker of machines used to etch computer processors and make memory chips, announced Wednesday a record 6.1 percent jump in full-year net profit. Net profit rose to 1.47 billion euros ($1.57 billion) and sales climbed more than 8.0 percent year-on-year to 6.79 billion euros, ASML said in a statement. It "has been a remarkable year for ASML on many fronts," chief executive Peter Wennink said from the high-tech company's headquarters in Veldhoven, in southern Netherlands. "We have delivered a record financial performance," Wennink said. ASML is considered a bellwether of the global high-tech industry as it supplies manufacturing giants such as Samsung and Intel. Part of ASML's success comes from its sales of so-called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines of which "a significant amount of orders have been placed, leading to an EUV backlog of about two billion euros," Wennink said. The most recent technology available, ASML said EUV lithography machines enable the production of even smaller microchips while still increasing capacity and speed. "It was... the year when the industry turned the corner on the production of EUV," Wennink said, saying there was a current backlog of 18 EUV machines. ASML received an order for six EUV systems in the fourth quarter of last year, sending quarterly profits shooting up by 79.0 percent from the same period in 2015 to 524 million euros. The company sold 139 new lithographic systems in total in 2016. Last year saw ASML "anchor its leadership position in the semiconductor equipment market," Wennink said. It bought Taiwan-based Hermes Microvision for $2.75 billion and a minority stake in German-based Carl Zeiss for 1.0 billion euros. Wennink said he believed the upward sales trend "will continue in 2017" with first quarter sales for the year predicted to be around 1.8 billion euros. ASML proposed a dividend 1.20 euro per ordinary share for 2016, amounting to a total payout of some 515 million euros. The company is listed on the Amsterdam and New York stock exchanges.

Kuo said new 12-inch MacBook models with Kaby Lake processors will enter mass production in the early second quarter, which starts in March, and noted a 16GB of RAM option could be added—presumably as a high-end or built-to-order configuration. The two current 12-inch MacBook configurations include 8GB of RAM. Likewise, Kuo said new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with Kaby Lake processors will start mass production in the early third quarter, which starts in July. The research note did not specify how much RAM these models will have, but 16GB could remain the limit due to the restrictions of current memory designs. Interestingly, Kuo also mentions a "15-inch MacBook" that will include 32GB of RAM and enter mass production in the early fourth quarter, which starts in September. He said this model will be "the most significantly redesigned product this year," and he believes it will adopt desktop-class RAM to satisfy high-end users. Given the high-end specifications, it is likely that this 15-inch MacBook would be part of the MacBook Pro lineup, but Kuo did not specify. Beyond faster processors and increased memory, Kuo said most other specifications and the design of all of the notebooks will be similar to equivalent models released in 2016. Kuo believes the new Kaby Lake notebooks will be power efficient, which may positively affect shipments. He estimates that Mac notebook shipments will resume year-over-year growth at about 10% on the strength of the new models, while shipments will be quicker as production delays affecting 2016 models are resolved. Kuo also expects Apple to discount the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a standard row of function keys this year as that model gradually replaces the 13-inch MacBook Air in Apple's notebook lineup. While no release dates were mentioned, Kuo previously said he expects new MacBook Pro models with 32GB of RAM to launch in the second half of 2017.

Qualcomm designs not only the Snapdragon processors used in countless Android-powered handhelds, but also the baseband electronics needed by phones and other devices to connect to cellular networks. Crucially, Qualcomm holds a ton of patents on the common protocols and technologies used by phones to communicate. According to the FTC, phone makers were offered a discount if they just used Qualcomm's modems, effectively forcing them to pay extra if they want to use a rival's chipset. And Qualcomm crippled its rivals by refusing to fairly license and share its knowhow, resulting in features missing from competing chips, it is claimed. Thus, Qualcomm screwed over its competitors and made phone manufacturers an offer they couldn't refuse, it is alleged. According to the FTC: Qualcomm "maintains a 'no license, no chips' policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm’s preferred license terms." Basically, it is claimed Qualcomm says to its customers: if you ship products with a mix of our modems and a rival's chips, you have to pay extra royalties to us. And if you just use a rival's chipset, that chipset will be hamstrung by being locked out of modern standards that we've patented – so tough luck, get your wallet out if you want to ship a decent product. Qualcomm "refuses to license standard-essential patents to competitors." In other words, Qualcomm is supposed to license its patents fairly and at a reasonable cost to anyone who adopts the standards they cover – but these licenses were withheld from rival chip designers whose baseband processors competed with Qualcomm's. That effectively locked Qualy's competitors out of chunks of the mobile broadband market – it's why Intel's XMM 7360 modem in the iPhone 7 doesn't support CDMA phone networks. (Last year, Apple decided to use a mix of Qualcomm and Intel baseband electronics in the iPhone 7: the Intel modem lacked features found in its Qualcomm counterpart due to patent licensing, resulting in Intel-based iPhones unable to use some network carriers.) Finally, Qualcomm "extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties." Qualy allegedly bribed Apple to take out a five-year exclusivity deal to use only its baseband chips in tens of millions of iOS handsets and tablets sold from 2011 to 2016. And before that, in 2007, Qualcomm also allegedly bribed Apple with rebates: if the iGiant stuck just to Qualcomm's chips, and didn't implement the Intel-championed WiMAX standard, it would get a fat refund. Funnily enough, that WiMAX standard is now dead. "By threatening to disrupt cell phone manufacturers' supply of baseband processors, Qualcomm obtains elevated royalties and other license terms for its standard-essential patents that manufacturers would otherwise reject," the FTC alleged. "These royalties amount to a tax on the manufacturers' use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm's competitors – a tax that excludes these competitors and harms competition. "Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm's competitors." The complaint, filed in the northern district of California on Tuesday, seeks a court order that would require Qualcomm to cease all of the infringing activities or run the risk of further penalties. The FTC authorized the filing via a 2-1 vote, with commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen dissenting. Qualcomm says it will "vigorously defend" against the charges. "The portrayal of facts offered by the FTC as the basis for the agency's case is significantly flawed," the chip designer told The Register in an email. "In particular, Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC's allegation to the contrary – the central thesis of the complaint – is wrong." The words Qualcomm, patent, licensing and dispute are never far apart: the processor designer coughed up a billion dollars in China to make a row over licensing there go away, for example, and it is suing Apple, Samsung, Intel, Broadcom and others for allegedly ganging up on it in South Korea. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 23 Comments Whitepapers Accelerated Computing and the Democratization of Supercomputing This whitepaper provides an analysis on how accelerators like the NVIDIA Tesla P100 can lower data center cost by up to 50%.

Thought the Pentium G4560 processor would be useless? Not so fast, there... slick. In ComputerBase's testing, they used GeForce GTX 980 Ti cards in SLI at 4K, with the Pentium G4560 matching the performance of the Core i5-7600K which costs $243.

 Qualcomm allegedly paid Apple billions of dollars in rebates to use its chips Kif Leswing Jan. 17, 2017, 5:28 PM 13,457 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty/Chip Somodevilla A newly unsealed antitrust suit from the Federal Trade Commission alleges that Qualcomm entered into an anticompetitive deal with Apple to keep its modem chips in Apple's products, including the iPhone and iPad.  The deal allegedly included "substantial incentive payments" on the condition that Apple would continue using Qualcomm's baseband processors "exclusively" in all iPhone and iPad models from 2011 and 2012. "In all, Qualcomm’s 2011 and 2013 agreements with Apple provided for billions of dollars in conditional rebates from Qualcomm to Apple," according to a complaint filed by the FTC. Qualcomm not only makes the chip that lets phones like Apple's connect to high-speed LTE wireless networks, but it also owns a significant amount of the underlying patents and intellectual property. Qualcomm licenses that IP to other companies, like Intel and MediaTek, that also make LTE baseband processors.  Basically, the FTC is alleging that Qualcomm strong armed phone makers by essentially bundling its chips along with its licenses. If a phone maker like Apple were to use Qualcomm's chips, then it would get a deal on the associated property licenses.  If a phonemaker were to use a competitor's chips, then it would pay extra IP royalties.  The discount on the licenses was allegedly paid to Apple in the form of conditional rebates. Conditions allegedly included not using a competitive wireless technology backed by Intel, agreeing not to sue Qualcomm over royalties, and using Qualcomm chips in forthcoming iPhones and iPads.  Qualcomm and Apple allegedly struck deals in 2007, 2011, and 2013 over these royalties.  "Under these agreements, Qualcomm provided Apple large lump sum payments that constituted partial relief from Qualcomm royalties. Qualcomm conditioned this relief on Apple’s exclusive use of Qualcomm baseband processors in new iPhone and iPad models," according to the suit. The FTC did not charge Apple, and in its complaint, suggests that Apple may have chafed under Qualcomm's licensing deals.  Qualcomm vigorously refuted the premise of the FTC's claims against it, saying that "the complaint is based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry." "Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC’s allegation to the contrary -- the central thesis of the complaint -- is wrong," the company said in a statement.  Qualcomm also accused the FTC of accelerating its investigation and filing the complaint days before a change in administration, and a time when two of the commission's five seats are vacant. 'No license, no chips' If Apple or another phone maker were to use another company's baseband processor, Qualcomm would ask for higher royalties on its IP. "The FTC alleges that this tactic forces cell phone manufacturers to pay elevated royalties to Qualcomm on products that use a competitor’s baseband processors," the FTC said in a press release.  One possible reason that Qualcomm allegedly struck the deal with Apple is that if Apple were to use a different supplier, that supplier might become more competitive with Qualcomm. "Qualcomm’s exclusive supply arrangement with Apple denied other baseband processor suppliers the benefits of working with a particularly important cell phone manufacturer and hampered their development into effective competitors," the FTC wrote in its complaint.  Ultimately, Qualcomm has few competitors for high-end baseband modems. In the past year, Intel has started to supply LTE modems for the iPhone 7, but tests showed that the Qualcomm-equipped iPhone 7 has marginally better wireless performance than the one with Intel's baseband chip.  Read the entire complaint below: Qualcomm Redacted Complaint by Kif Leswing on Scribd SEE ALSO: The next laptops Apple launches could fix the biggest complaints about the new MacBook Pro More: Apple Patents Qualcomm facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Qualcomm allegedly paid Apple billions of dollars in rebates to use its chips Qualcomm allegedly paid Apple billions of dollars in rebates to use its chips A newly unsealed antitrust suit from the...

The company's first product was a crowd-funded $120 device that made a 14" laptop-of-sorts out of pretty much anything with an HDMI output. Now the company is back with a second revision that can also turn one of Intel's recently-announced Compute Cards into a hybrid tablet-laptop device with a touchscreen. The device is shaped like a conventional tablet with a bulge in the chassis, where the Compute Card is inserted. The company cleverly calls this bulge an ergonomic hand grip. Instead of the old Micro HDMI plug, the second-generation NexDock uses a USB Type-C port that allows a connected device to provide brains for the screen while simultaneously being charged. The potential of a device like this is easy enough to recognize. The NexDock offers easy-to-understand functionality for the average user. A particularly active person who is tough on hinges and screens could keep a couple NexDocks on hand and easily swap his computer or smartphone from chassis to chassis. Frequent upgraders can easily reuse the docking unit as they move to newer devices, too. NexDock says a crowdfunding campaign for the new docking unit with Intel Compute Card compatibility will begin in mid-2017.   Tags: Systems Displays Mobile computing User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

On January 6, the US Intelligence Community released a report saying it had high confidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. "This is not a questionable case. It is plainly evident to all of our intelligence agencies… that Russia was behind the hacking of American political organizations," Rhodes stated on Tuesday. "It is an insult to our intelligence to suggest that that did not happen right in front of our eyes." The report did not offer proof for the claims that Russia attempted to hack and influence the US election process, but made the claims anyway. Russia has repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues.

Now the company is back with the next generation of their device, and this time it will be powered by Intel’s Compute Card. The Intel Compute Card is a fully self-contained PC that packs a CPU and GPU with RAM, storage, and wireless connectivity and is only slightly longer than a credit card (95mm X 55mm X 5mm). As one of Intel’s initial regional partners, the new NexDock will be the first docking unit that supports the Intel Compute Cards in 2-in-1 laptop form. You can read more about the Compute Card, which Intel announced, at CES, here. The PC will fit in a slot inside the shell, but Windows 10 Mobile fans need not fear, as the device will continue to support the OS and Continuum for Phones, this time via USB-C and with a proper HD display. The new dock is being built from the ground up by new electronic, design and mechanical engineers to come up with a high quality, retail level product on par with big players in the market. The new dock is expected around mid-2017, around the same time as Intel’s Compute Card is expected to drop. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Industrial giant Honeywell International Inc. will team up with chip maker Intel Corp. to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for the retail industry to enhance logistics, improve inventory visibility, and drive supply chain efficiencies, the companies said Monday. By combining Intel's processing capabilities with Honeywell's data collection platforms, the new partners hope to pitch those solutions to customers, such as retail businesses, that are struggling to maintain profitability and compete with rivals in an age where consumers are shifting to online shopping, the firms said during the National Retail Federation (NRF's) annual convention in New York City. Honeywell has been boosting its investment in logistics solutions since the company paid $1.5 billion to acquire material handling automation provider Intelligrated Systems Inc. in July 2016. Both firms had their own booths at the NRF show, but held briefings together as they continue to integrate their products and client bases. Fort Mill, S.C.-based Honeywell Scanning and Mobility said that after the merger, Intelligrated's warehouse execution system (WES) software and order fulfillment technologies would complement Honeywell's product lines in mobile computers, scanning and automatic-identification, and voice automation technology. Now Honeywell is taking another step toward the goal of networking those retail and material handling platforms by partnering with microprocessor industry leader Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif. The companies plan to leverage their combined technology offerings, including sensors; handheld computers; processors; bar code scanners; radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and readers; and cloud-based software. Working in symphony, those technologies can help businesses track, monitor, and assess the condition of goods moving through the supply chain as well as in brick-and-mortar stores, the companies said. "Technology can help transform retail, making stores more responsive to customer needs by connecting physical and digital retail environments," Joe Jensen, vice president and general manager of Intel's retail solutions division, said in a release. "By working with Honeywell, Intel plans to enable retailers to benefit from IoT solutions by having the visibility of real-time accuracy of on-shelf inventory. This will help delight shoppers with better inventory accuracy and in-store pickup of products ordered online." #Logistics #Automatic Data Capture #Software & Systems Resources Mentioned In This Article Honeywell (LXE) Intel Related Articles Wavelink comes under Ivanti name after merger ALK Technologies Integrates PC*MILER 30 with TMW Systems' Software and Services Automated trucks - not a bad idea Project44, McLeod Software team up in API deal Serving the youth a balanced diet: interview with Gregory R.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS LINKED STORIES iOS 10 WWDC 2016 AirPods: Ushering in a Wireless Future App Extensions Are Not a Replacement for User Automation 3D Touch for Power Users The Mac mini Family Tree By Stephen Hackett Four members of the Mac mini family. "The Mac mini is BYODKM," Steve Jobs said, in front of a crowded and slightly confused audience at Macworld 2005. "Bring your own display, keyboard and mouse," he continued. "We supply the computer, you supply the rest." The Mac mini was designed to lure switchers to the platform. A new customer could simply unplug their desktop PC and hook a new Mac mini up to their existing peripherals.1 The original machine started at just $499, making the Mac mini the lowest-cost Mac Apple has ever sold. For some long-time fans, the Mac mini brought back memories of the Macintosh LC, Apple's low-cost Mac in the early 1990s. While totally adorable, the LC was hamstrung to hit a price point, something that Apple managed to avoid with the Mac mini, at least at first. The Mac mini was slower than other desktop Macs at the time, but I thought the compromises made were perfectly fair. Introduced in 2005, the Mac mini was unlike anything else Apple was selling at the time. The original Mac mini was powered by a 1.25 or 1.42 GHz G4 processor, came with a slow 4200 RPM hard drive and just 256 MB of RAM installed. Both initial models came with a Combo optical drive that could read DVDs and burn CDs. All of this was packed into a computer just 2 inches tall and 6.5 inches wide and deep. At this point the iMac and Power Mac were both sporting G5 processors, but the Mac mini's reduced specs helped Apple hit that amazing price point. While I believe many switchers did purchase a Mac mini as their entrance into the Mac OS X ecosystem, the small computer soon garnered a large fan base. People started buying them as servers. They showed up in cars and alongside DVD players in home entertainment setups. In September 2005, Apple silently revved the Mac mini to include a faster hard drive and CPU. The high-end model got a better GPU and a nicer SuperDrive. The Move to Intel Like the iMac, the Mac mini's move to Intel did not involve a radical redesign. Apple kept the case design intact, while adding two additional USB ports, audio in, Gigabit Ethernet and an infrared port for using the Apple Remote with Front Row. That small black plastic at the right of the optical drive opening? That's the infrared port. All of these improvements came with an increase in price. The base model, which is the only Mac to have ever shipped with the Intel Core Solo processor, was $599. The high-end model, with a SuperDrive, Core duo CPU and a larger hard drive was $799. The Mini's industrial design would remain in place for several more generations. The Late 2006 model brought a CPU speed bump, while the Mid 2007 machines came with 1 GB of RAM, larger hard drives and the Core 2 Duo processor. The Mid 2007 model was on sale for 19 months, leading many to worry that the Mac mini was going to be discontinued by Apple.2 Eventually, in March 2009, Apple refreshed the Mac mini again. CPU speed stayed the same, but the update brought Mini DisplayPort in addition to mini-DVI making this the first Mac mini to support multiple displays. Mac mini (Server, Late 2009) In October 2009, Apple introduced a $999 Mac mini that was unlike all other models before it: This machine came with Snow Leopard Server, a 2.53 GHz processor, 4 GB of RAM, and two 500 GB hard drives. To accommodate the second drive, Apple removed the optical drive, leading to a one-off case that looks rather funny today. I think this model shows that Apple had noticed how people were using the Mac mini by this point in the product's life. The machine's low price, small form factor and near-silent operation had made it an attractive option for users who needed a server in their home or office. A "Big" Redesign In the summer of 2010, Apple released a new Mac mini with an all-new design, carved out of a single slab of aluminum. It was shorter and packed a slightly-larger footprint, at 1.5 inches tall and 7.7 inches wide and deep. It's kind of like the original design got squished a bit. The Mid-2010 Mac mini is the only one that featured the unibody design and an optical drive. While upgrading the previous models meant taking a putty knife to the case, the new design included a plastic bottom panel that could be removed with a simple twist. Upgrading the RAM had never been easier. Bolder customers could replace the hard drive, but it wasn't technically a user-serviceable part. Around back, the Mini picked an HDMI port3 as well as an SD card slot. While a separate server model remained, the mainstream Mac mini for 2010 was now $699. 2011 to Today A year later, the Mid 2011 Mac mini brought Thunderbolt, and the removal of the optical drive. Apple brought back the $599 model, and a year later in 2012, the separate Server edition was quietly discounted. Optical drives? Where we're going, we don't need optical drives. Currently, the Late 2014 Mac mini is the newest model available. While it may look like the 2011 and 2012 machines, Apple made several changes that have made its smallest Mac noticeably worse: The RAM is no longer upgradable. That bottom panel still comes off, but underneath is just a sheet of metal. Even if it was easy to get to, the memory is soldered to the logic board. There is no longer a quad-core model, even as a build-to-order option. It's dual-core all the way. The second 2.5-inch drive bay has been removed. Putting in a second drive just isn't an option anymore. The only good things I can really say about the 2014 models is that Apple was able to bring back the $499 SKU, and that the value of 2011 and 2012 machines is still quite high. Customers who want more flexible machines are willing to spend good money on older machines to have access to things that Apple has taken away. The Future of the Mac mini I have two Mid-2011 Mac minis in active duty. The first sits under my television. It handles file sharing for my Drobo, hosts the family iTunes library and acts as a DVD player, thanks to a USB SuperDrive. The second is a quad-core model at MacStadium, on which I run the streaming software used for Relay FM's live shows. Both machines have SSDs and are stuffed full of RAM. Both run amazingly well; it's hard to tell that they are each six years old. I know that at some point, I won't be able to install the newest version of macOS on them. That's a problem. I shouldn't have to rely on a machine from 2011 to provide critical tasks for my business, but I do. Buying a new Mac mini just isn't worth it for me. Upgrading would mean going back to a dual-core system, and to match the SSD and RAM I have in them would mean dropping $1,399 at the Apple Store. I'd love to see Apple take the Mac mini and breathe new life into it. The design is a holdover from the days of the optical drive; a theoretical future Mac mini could be much smaller. As cool as that could be, what I really want is for the Mac mini to be returned to its former glory, as the cheap-but-super-upgradable Mac it once was. Spending even $700 or $800 on a machine and spreading out the upgrade costs is far preferable to many users than spending twice that all at once. From its humble beginnings as the BYODKM Mac to its role as a server, the Mac mini has been a faithful workhorse for 12 years now. It deserves another chance. Assuming they had a USB keyboard and mouse. PS/2 users had to buy new input devices. ↩︎ History always repeats itself. ↩︎ Again, Apple was seeing what people were doing with these computers. HDMI made using a Mac mini as an input on a television a dream. ↩︎ Tags: Apple history, mac, mac mini Sign Up Unlock MacStories Extras Club MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.

According to a Chinese-language Economic Daily News report cited by DigiTimes, Apple is likely to slash prices of 13-inch Pros without Touch Bar to increase its overall shipments in 2017. Industry sources also claim that these more affordable 13-inch MacBook Pros without Touch Bar will eventually replace the 13-inch MacBook Air in Apple’s notebook lineup. Market watchers think Mac sales will grow 10 percent annually to reach 15 million units in 2017 due to new Mac notebooks. This should be music to the ears of Apple’s notebook suppliers like Quanta Computer, Shin Zu Shing, Auras and Wistron. Demand for the latest MacBook Pros with Touch Bar is still “rather strong,” sources said. KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks Apple will refresh 12-inch MacBooks in early second quarter, adding a new 16-gigabyte RAM option. Production of Kaby Lake-driven Pros should being in early third quarter whilst a new 15-inch MacBook Pro with 32GB memory won’t enter mass production until early in the fourth quarter, said the analyst. I’m a big fan of MacBook Air and will be saddened to see it phased-out. This has been my productivity machine for more than five years now. When I’m not on the go, I’m using it connected to Apple’s 27-inch Thunderbolt Display. Despite my Air having only four gigabytes of RAM, it crunches pretty much everything I throw at its feet without breaking a sweat. The phased-out 11-inch Air even handles 1080p video editing quite comfortably. I’m fully aware that the Air lineup has not received a major refresh for quite some time now and that upgrading my desktop experience to 4K resolution is going to require a 4K-capable machine such as the new MacBook Pro. But until that inevitable moment arrives, I’ll be sticking with my rusty old 13-inch Air.

This is according to the latest research note from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In a note presented to investors, Kuo predicts Apple’s 2017 refresh will focus on internal component updates, notably platform-wide adoption of Intel Kaby Lake processors. He said the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with Kaby Lake processors will start mass production early in the third quarter of 2017. Kuo’s prediction of “the most significantly redesigned” 15-inch MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM. The said laptop will enter mass production early in the fourth quarter of 2017, which starts in September. He also added Apple will be adopting desktop-class RAM in order to get improved performance. This is not the first time Kuo predicted 32GB RAM options for the Macbook Pro. Late last year Kuo stated that 2017’s MacBook Pro models may arrive at cheaper prices and offer 32GB of RAM. The current top of the line Macbooks come with maximum 16GB RAM, a feature that is receiving flak from several Mac users. Apple will need to adopt an emerging memory technology like LPDDR4 or DDR4L in order to increase memory configurations. Beyond a faster processor and memory upgrades, the Macbook Pro 2017 refresh will ship with similar specifications and features as the 2016 model. 12-inch Macbook Refresh In addition, Kuo stated Apple will also update the thin-and-light 12-inch MacBook laptop. The next-gen laptops will be among the first computers to be powered by Kaby Lake processor series. Also, the new 12-inch MacBook will come with options of 16GB of RAM. The two current 12-inch MacBook configurations include 8GB of RAM. The devices also feature older-gen Intel Core m3, m5 and m7 processor series. The 2017 refresh will make the 12-inch MacBooks powerful than the predecessors. Kuo believes the Kaby Lake notebooks will be power efficient and improve Apple’s Macbook sales. He stated that Apple’s Mac growth will return in 2017 after its poor performance in 2016. The company has rectified supply chain bottlenecks, and as such, shipments will be quicker boosting Macbook sales. However, the 13-inch Macbook Pro without Touch Bar is not performing well. Apple will, as such, heavily discount the entry level MacBook Pro model for upcoming year. This will help replace the current MacBook Air line.

However as it turns out, Amazon isn’t the only ones who are interested in making shopping a more hi-tech experience. It would seem that Intel is just as interested as they have announced the Intel Responsive Retail Platform, in which the company is expected to invest as much as $100 million towards creating a smarter retail space. This initiative isn’t so much about a single device, but rather it is creating a common set of sensors, software, and other pieces of hardware that will all work together to help speed up the process of inventory tracking, collection of data on buying habits, personalized shopping experiences, and so on. The idea is that retailers won’t have to seek out separate solutions for all their needs, but instead turn to Intel and their partners for products that can work seamlessly together. An example would be Talley by Simbe Robotics. This is a robotic autonomous shelf auditing and analytics solution for retail. According to Intel, “Tally works in concert with retail associates by arming them with information to ensure the store’s products are always stocked, in the right place and displaying the correct price tag.” It is powered by Intel’s processors and also uses the RealSense technology to help make sense of its surroundings.

That means a role for live motion-capture performance – aka that of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings – with the character of Ariel the sprite rendered as an animated character on stage via a an avatar powered by motion-sensor control. RSC Artistic Director Gregory Doran says he was inspired by the masques of the 1600s to think about the kind of theatre Shakespeare might have created if he were writing today, while Intel says it is creating a new toolbox to empower actors, directors and designers to ‘bring their imagination to life for new audiences’. Alongside the new production, the RSC is running a series of debates to explore the development of the technology used in the show and its possible future applications. London’s National Theatre moved into VR last year with the launch of a new Immersive Storytelling Studio, with the institution commissioning new work created specifically using VR or 360 technologies.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 17, 2017 at 11:00AM On January 3, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released a new family of computer processors, branded seventh-generation Core, aimed at desktop and notebook personal computers. Among the new chips were three chips targeted explicitly at gamers and personal computer enthusiasts: Core i7 7700K, Core i5 7600K, and Core i3 7350K. Image source: Intel.  Although the Core i3 7350K isn't widely available yet, the Core i5 and Core i7 models are. The new Core i7 7700K is off to a strong start among those who build and upgrade their own computers, topping the best-selling processor lists on Amazon.com and Newegg.com.  The lower-end 7600K occupies the second-place spot on Newegg's best-sellers list; it's eighth on Amazon's, but Amazon is currently out of stock of those chips, which is likely artificially depressing its ranking on Amazon's list right now (it's updated hourly). What does this mean for Intel? Let's take a closer look. Business as usual One thing that has helped Intel combat declining industrywide personal computer sales has been aggressive segmentation actions designed to convince consumers to buy higher up in its product stack. This means even in a market in which people are buying fewer personal computers than they did last year, they're buying computers packed with more expensive processors than they did before. This phenomenon hasn't always been enough to completely offset the unit declines, though. In 2015, for example, Intel saw notebook processor shipments plunge 9%, but average selling prices grew just 2%. Desktop processor shipments dropped by 16% in 2015 -- a huge decline -- but average selling prices were up 6%, partially offsetting that decline.  Year to date, Intel is seeing a similar phenomenon in a stronger unit environment: Notebook platform volumes have dropped 1% as average selling prices rose 2% (so in that time, notebook chip revenue for Intel is actually up); desktop platform volumes declined by 5%, partially offset by a 2% increase in average selling prices. The fact that the $350 7700K seems to be off to a better start than the $250, less powerful 7600K suggests that demand -- at least among those individuals who build and upgrade their own computers -- continues to shift to higher-end chips. There is a limit to this mix-up among enthusiasts, though Interestingly, although the 7700K is at the top of the best-seller list, with the 7600K right behind it (at least on Newegg.com) -- suggesting a consumer affinity for higher-end chips -- Intel's high-end desktop chips don't seem to be enjoying anywhere near that level of success. For example, the Core i7 6800K -- Intel's cheapest six-core desktop processor at $424 -- is way down on Newegg's best-seller list, at position 20. The higher-end six-core, as well as the eight- and ten-core Intel desktop processors (which sell for about $1,100 and $1,650, respectively) are much further down the list. Part of the problem for Intel, here (aside from the fact that these chips are simply pricier), is that these higher-core-count chips require more expensive motherboards, and memory modules need to be bought in packs of four, rather than packs of two for the mainstream 7700K and 7600K chips. The high-core-count Intel chips also utilize previous-generation processor architectures and run at slower clock frequencies out of the box, meaning per-core performance on these higher-core-count chips is lower than on the lower-core-count chips. In other words, for applications that can't take advantage of lots of cores (like most consumer applications), the cheaper 7700K and 7600K chips are simply going to be better solutions -- both in absolute terms (for those workloads) and in terms of performance per dollar. It would be interesting to see what impact, if any, Intel would see on its desktop chip product mix, particularly when it comes to sales of chips directly to consumers (not through personal computer sales, which represent the bulk of chip sales), if it were more aggressive in driving up the per-core performance of its high-core-count chips.

Credit: Apple More like this Why did Apple take the ‘ding’ out of the universe? 10 reasons to love the USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro MacBook Pro USB-C move is a new gold rush Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell We’ve been waiting a long, long time for new Apple pro desktops, but it’s beginning to look very like Apple’s completely focusing on the MacBook Pro at the high end, with iMac as a consumer desktop and MacBook at the low end. Mobile Mac, desktop class I guess that is one way of looking at Apple analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities claim that Apple plans to increase the max memory configuration in MacBook Pro models to 32GB in the latter half of the year. That’s the kind of memory you’d expect in order to make Apple’s high-end notebooks even more effective professional tools. Particularly when combined with Kuo’s prediction that Apple will put quad core Intel Kaby Lake chips inside the high end MacBook Pro. While delayed, Intel’s latest 14-nanometer chips have a few advantages that appear to dovetail well with what Apple thinks we want: Fully integrated support for USB-C Generation 2, (G2 USB 3.1 and Thunderbolt 3 support) Native HDCP 2.2 support 4K video support. Big ding dongle deal Apple attracted lots of criticism for its wholesale embrace of USB-C in the latest MacBook Pros, but its decision to adopt Kaby Lake with its integrated support for the standard confirms what a good move this was. “We’re absolutely more sure than ever that we’ve done the right thing,” Apple’s VP marketing, Phil Schiller said when discussing the move to USB-C. It seems reasonable to anticipate the standard will be introduced across all future Macs – and now is a good time to purchase USB-USB-C hubs to help your eventual migration to Macs that use it, as Apple is selling these at generous discounts to boost adoption. The move has kick-started this section of the industry. Kuo also thinks Apple will update the 12-inch MacBook with Kaby Lake processors and a 16GB of RAM option. What’s really interesting here was noted by Apple Insider: “In order to achieve high memory allotments and keep unplugged battery life performance on par with existing MacBook Pro models, Apple will need to move to an emerging memory technology like LPDDR4 or DDR4L,” they wrote. This means high-end memory, high end RAM and high end Kaby Lake Macs. These will be desktop class machines. Bell chimes for MacBook Air The analyst has another prediction that may be of interest – that Apple will discount the 13-inch MacBook Pro model that lacks a Touch Bar in order to gradually replace the MacBook Air in its line up. Demand for the Touch Bar MacBook Air remains strong, Kuo said. Manufacturing capacity has been raised by 50 percent in order to keep up with demand, he explained. It is interesting that despite claims Mac sales are slack, when compared to the industry Apple continues to holds its own. “Compared to the industry 2011-16, you can't even say Mac is on a downward trend - yet,” points out long time Apple stock watcher, AAPL Tree. Et tu, Mac Pro? What we don’t know yet is if Apple’s vision for its platform extends to the Mac Pro. After all, if it can create incredibly powerful MacBook Pro machines that work in tandem with a highly effective peripherals I/O like USB-C, then is there any need for them? Most of the expandability you expect from a desktop can now be matched by USB-C devices connected to a notebook. Three years since the Mac Pro was replaced, I’m certain many Mac users want to find out the truth behind Apple’s promise that “great desktops are coming”. Will these be Mac Pros, iMacs? Is the MacBook Pro the future of Apple’s high end Mac market? For the reasons above I think it could be, but I also think Mac users deserve to know. Google+?

Analog engineers need to feed high-end CPUs hundreds of amperes without starting fires. The Intel CPU processor has always been a challenge because it relies on as many as eight multi-phase switching regulators (aka DC-DC converters) per CPU, each generating up to 25 watts per chip. They are typically clocked at 250 kHz, and they generate quite a bit of heat. DC-DC converters are pulse generators whose outputs are filtered and summed to effect currents of hundreds of amps at fixed voltages. Designers and users believe that higher switching frequencies will make incremental increases in energy-transfer efficiency and dramatic reductions in the size of ancillary components such as inductors and capacitors. Thus far, 10MHz has been the upper for commercial pulse-width modulators capable of putting out 40A from a thimble-sized package. In ISSCC session 26 on processor power management, Intel will describe a module with an-order-of-magnitude higher clock rate. It is a fully integrated, digitally controlled buck voltage regulator with on-die inductors with a planar magnetic core on a 14nm CMOS substrate. Technology-circuit co-optimization enables ultra-thin packages, the Intel paper reports. The module obtains a power density of 1A/mm2 and an efficiency of 84% at a switching frequency of 100MHz using a digital pulse-width modulation scheme with an 8ps resolution. Including inductors, the modulators footprint is only 0.42mm2. The analogy I frequently use to describe DC-DC is to imagine a bulldozer moving a mountain of dirt across a road. Each shovel-full may take several minutes to transfer, and a significant amount of dirt (a measure of inefficiency) is left behind. Now, imagine a shovel the size of a teaspoon, but with an ability to move a million scoops of dirt per second. An 100-MHz oscillator can be quite unstable, and only a fistful of companies are now claiming that kind of energy transfer rate even though faster switch rates enable significant increases in power densities. Engineers face trade offs in increasing power density at the expense of energy transfer efficiency and vice versa. The historical trend is shown in the chart below. We are closing in on a 1-watt per mm2 power density and efficiencies of 82% in the state of the art for DC-DC converters, according to ISSCC organizers. DC-DC converter efficiency over time with the latest results in red. (Image: ISSCC) Because they are a must-have for practically all electronic systems, power management ICs are the largest and fastest growing segment of the general-purpose analog market, accounting for almost $12 billion in revenues. Thus power management is arguably the most significant analog skill set today. ISSCC also will showcase analog skills in signal amplification and conditioning. General-purpose amplifiers are having a renaissance with the proliferation of devices for the Internet of Things where they a called upon to capture and elevate a low-level sensor signal to something that can manipulated by a microcontroller. Amplifier circuits account for roughly $3.5-$4 billion in annual semiconductor revenues. Power transistors are also deserve mention. They are current delivery mechanisms used in conjunction with low-frequency power amplifiers like audio or motor drive circuits or as current switches in DC-DC converters such as voltage regulators with switch-mode outputs. The power transistor market is about $10 billion, half of it in MOSFET switches. The most attention-getting part of the power transistor market are the Gallium Nitride (GaN) switches which promise an order of magnitude improvements in switching speed. Thats a boon to switching power supplies with higher currents and energy-transfer efficiencies that are wrestling with gate driver topologies, yet another topic in analog sessions at the event. Stephan Ohr is a former director for analog research at Gartner and former editor-in-chief of Planet Analog.

A white paper co-authored by General Electric (GE) and Intel estimates that digital efficiency applications have the potential to help industry save $81bn per year in fuel costs. The research, details of which were unveiled at World Future Energy Summit (WFES) 2017 in Abu Dhabi, also claims that industrial internet programmes could close the global carbon gap by almost 30% – a reduction of 823Mt of carbon emissions per year, equivalent to removing 174 million cars from the roads. Tools such as embedded sensors, data analytics, and connected platforms are helping companies to boost productivity and reduce environmental emissions, according to the white paper’s authors. Deb Frodl, global executive director of GE Ecomagination, said: “We are working closely with our partners in the region, such as Masdar, Saudi Aramco, and RasGas, among others – some of the first adopters of digital solutions – to support regional economies in achieving their energy and economic diversification goals. “This is part of a larger movement that includes both large companies and start-ups from across the industrial and tech sectors, working together on innovation and implementation to realise the dramatic economic and environmental potential of digital efficiency.” The report identified five segments that stand to benefit from the economic and environmental impact of digitisation: power, lighting, aviation, rail, and ground transportation. The researchers estimate that the power sector could achieve $14bn in cost savings annually, in addition to a potential reduction of 495Mt per year in carbon. Annual savings related to lighting could hit $30bn, reducing carbon emissions by 132Mt per year. The aviation industry could save $14bn per year, and achieve an annual carbon reduction of 45Mt. The rail sector could save $3bn per year, and reduce carbon output by 19Mt. Ground transportation, meanwhile, could achieve annual cost savings of $20bn, and reduce carbon emissions by 132Mt per year, according to the white paper. GE has been working with a number of strategic partners in the Middle East in a bid to use industrial internet applications to achieve enhanced productivity, efficiency, and asset optimisation. Collaborators include, but are not limited to, RasGas, Masdar, Dubai’s Museum of the Future, Saudi Aramco, and Saudi Electricity Company. The report draws on the experience of GE’s Ecomagination business strategy to deploy sustainable strategies that provide economic and environmental outcomes, according to GE. WFES 2017 is currently taking place at Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Center (ADNEC) in the UAE.

A touchscreen with low processing latency, truly invisible touch sensing, and excellent noise rejection isn’t really what you’ll see on billboards, but if these things aren’t done properly just about anyone will notice the results. Similarly, if a fingerprint scanner has high processing latency and doesn’t have features like learning from a partial match and noise rejection, it’ll be very noticeable if you try a device that has all of these features. Probably the best example of this was the difference in TouchID quality from the iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. At CES they had a number of new things to show off. The first was a 30 dollar low profile USB fingerprint scanner, which was designed to retrofit laptops and similar devices without a fingerprint scanner in order to enable the use of Windows Hello. I went ahead and tried it and it works flawlessly from what I can see. Synaptics is also working on integrating a fingerprint scanner into trackpads and power buttons to enable more seamless designs instead of having a random sensor on the palmrest or somewhere similarly obvious. We also saw their FS4400 and FS4500 fingerprint scanners, which have entered mass production. These sensors enable fingerprint scanning under the glass bezel of a smartphone. There were also prototypes of fingerprint scanners on smart watches, although these prototypes are at an early stage and are more a proof of concept than anything else. On the automotive side, Synaptics also showed off a neat prototype that enabled force sensing with only four force sensors at the corners of the display. Judging by the state of the prototype this is only for engineering samples at this point, but may have interesting applications. On the DDIC side of things, Synaptics has been working on new solutions for things like large touchscreens. Using technology borrowed from their smartphone designs, they have been able to reduce the number of components and board area needed to enable large touchscreens in applications like mall kiosks. On the mobile side of things, the ClearView R63353 is a DDIC on glass that reduces the amount of bezel that it takes compared to previous display drivers and is currently available for sampling. The Synaptics engineers on site to discuss the issue of bezels did mention that it would be possible to drive down the amount of bezel used by moving to a chip on flex arrangement. However, I suspect that there are other engineering considerations at play as most devices, even those with thin bezels, continue to use a CoG packaging for the DDIC. In addition to smaller DDICs, Synaptics has also been working on enabling better OLED displays through new features like smoother dimming and software tools to emulate various subpixel arrangements to determine the best possible subpixel design given design rules. PenTile is mostly here to stay for OLED, but choosing something other than diamond subpixel arrangements can significantly reduce the amount of color shifting when changing viewing angles. Overall, while Synaptics doesn’t necessarily have the flashiest technologies, the kinds of things that they’re working on remain critical to the end user experience and it’s impressive to see that they continue to iterate and improve upon their products to enable a better user experience.

POST A COMMENT 4 Comments View All Comments Trixanity - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link If they could get rid of PWM for OLED brightness control, that would be great... And PenTile too. Reply JoshHo - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Samsung currently uses PWM because voltage-controlled brightness causes dramatic hue shifts. The Nexus 6 was an example of this. Reply Trixanity - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Do you think they can get around that with future displays? Reviews I've seen lists the Pixel as using PWM at 23% brightness and below and the OnePlus 3T at 10% and below, so judging from that it does seem like it is possible to some degree to eliminate it. Also, I think it would be great if you added PWM measurements to all your display tests.

Apple will be releasing the updated Macbooks with seventh generation of Intel Kaby Lake processors, as revealed by the latest research note from Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at KGI Securities. The analyst states that the company might launch a new 15-inch MacBook Pro model with a whopping 32GB of RAM. He said in a research note that the new MacBook Pro will be "the most significantly redesigned product this year" and will enter production in the early fourth quarter. The model will also feature the same Touch Bar as we have seen in the 2016 version of the MacBook Pro. Kuo said that the Cupertino-based company will also update 12-inch MacBook models with the latest processor, which will enter in mass production in the early second quarter. The analyst predicts that a 16GB memory option will also be added to the device. Furthermore, the company will also update the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with the same processor and the models will enter the mass production in the early third quarter, though the research note did not reveal any information about the RAM. To recall, Apple introduced the new MacBook Pro 2016 in October 2016, which is touted as the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever. The regular 13 inch MacBook Pro comes with 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. The one with the Touch Bar and Touch ID comes with 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage and lastly, the 15 inch MacBook Pro comes with 2.6 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.5 GHz, 16GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. For graphics, Apple has opted for Radeon Pro discrete graphics in the 15-inch model and for the 13-inch model, you get Intel Iris Graphics that offers two times faster performance than before. For software, Apple has given the new MacOS Sierra which comes with new features like Siri integration, Universal Clipboard, Apple Pay on the web and Photos. For connectivity, there are a 3.5mm audio jack and two Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type-C) ports on the 13-inch variant and four Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type-C) ports on the 15-inch variant.

Computers by Daniel Van Boom January 17, 2017 2:57 AM PST @dvanboom Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) MacBooks may grow more powerful this year According to an analyst known for accurate predictions, Apple will refresh its MacBook line with more processing power and more RAM. by Iyaz Akhtar 1:30 Close Drag Apple's newly refreshed laptop line may be a hit in stores, but many are still concerned that the MacBook Pros aren't quite "pro" enough. The electronics giant may assuage some of those concerns later this year, predicts KGI Securities analyst and Apple Nostradamus Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo, who last year correctly anticipated that Apple would overhaul the MacBook Pro line to include a touchscreen in place of function keys, said the company will release a 15-inch MacBook equipped with 32GB of RAM in the fourth quarter, MacRumors reported Monday. This appears to be separate to a refreshment for 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros, which he said will start offering Intel's new Kaby Lake processors in the third quarter. In the second quarter, Kuo predicts, Apple will update its 12-inch MacBook line with the new processors, as well as a 16GB RAM option. (They currently offer 8GB.) Related stories Why Apple's weird headphones are better than you think Apple's iPhone turns 10. Where does it go from here? Tim Cook's pay slips after Apple's 2016 dip The new processors could potentially address one criticism some had of the new MacBook Pros: their not-much-improved battery life. The 32GB RAM MacBook, which Kuo said will be the "most significantly redesigned product this year," is likely geared toward art professionals, who need RAM for video, audio and photo editing. While Apple relies heavily on its iPhones for its revenue, Apple's computers are the heart and origin of the company. Apple's reputation is especially renowned among creative professionals, who are willing to pay the steep price for Macs and MacBooks but also expect Apple to keep up with the competition on the basics like battery life. Kuo has an impressive record when it comes to Apple predictions. Other than his 2016 MacBook Pro redesign, his correct predictions have included the Apple Watch 2 and its onboard GPS, as well as the 2016 release of a 4-inch iPhone, which became the SE.

According to a report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kup Apple is getting ready to release 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros, with Intel’s brand new Kaby Lake processors. As written by MacRumours, the report goes on to say that production fo both laptops will start in the early third waurter around July. If you’re waiting for a price drop, it looks like you may be in luck. Kuo predicts the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro – the one without the TouchBar – should be discounted this year, partly to bring it in line with the 13-inch MacBook Air it’ll eventually replace.   For everything else you need to know about the new MacBook Pro, keep reading. 1. The new MacBook Pro has a stunning Touch Bar The Touch Bar is by far the most interesting feature on the new MacBook Pro, and it’s also one of the things we were pretty certain about before it was launched. Essentially, Apple has removed the function keys, replacing them with a reactive, OLED screen that changes depending on what you’re doing. There were some pretty convincing demos of the hardware last night, and our hands-on also suggests it’s more than a gimmick. 2. The new MacBook Pro is up to 2.3x faster than the last model Apple has squeezed a quad-core i7 chip into the new MacBook Pro along with 16GB of LPDDR3 onboard memory. That means that the new MacBook Pro is up to 2.3 times faster than its predecessor. Graphics-card wise, the 15in version also uses a Radeon Pro 450 or 455 with 2GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching. Battery life is always an important factor, and the new MacBook Pro offers pretty impressive performance here, too. Both the 13in model will give you around ten hours of use before needing a charge.  3. Apple has removed three familiar features From the outside, one of those is obvious. For years, a glowing Apple logo has been a hallmark of every MacBook, but it’s gone on the MacBook Pro. The new 12in MacBook is the only other laptop in Apple’s range without a glowing logo, so its removal could have something to do with the introduction of new screen technology. Second, and somewhat less obviously, Apple has also done away with the startup chime on the new MacBook Pro – and that’s because it boots up as soon as it’s opened. Lastly, the MagSafe charging connector is gone, although that also disappeared on last year's 12in MacBook.  4. The new MacBook Pro has Touch ID As expected, the new MacBook Pro comes with Touch ID, so you can use your fingerprint to make purchases, open encrypted files and more. The Touch ID module is on the right-hand side of the new Touch Bar, and it’s controlled by a brand-new “T1” chip. 5. The are NO normal USB ports Both MacBook Pros feature no USB ports, but do come with four Thunderbolt or USB Type C ports each. That means any of those points can be your charging socket, and you'll still have room for another three devices. They're also capable of 10GB/sec transfer speeds. Of course, you're going to have to buy at least three dongles to get the most out of them... 6. There are THREE new MacBooks Apple is also unveiling another 13in MacBook Pro without all the new-fangled features of the two flagship models. As you’d expect, it’s slightly less powerful and customisable than the other two models, but it does cost a bit less, too. It features actual physical function keys, and it will have two fewer Thunderbolt ports. All models are available in either Space Grey or Silver. 7. The new MacBook Pro costs A LOT more money See related  The iPhone 7 needs a new cable to connect to the new MacBook Pro — and that's not cool iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Which smartphone should you buy in 2016? In addition to a total removal of regular USB ports, the main issue with the new MacBook Pro is its astonishing price. The new MacBook Pro starts at £1,449, but you have to pay at least £1,749 to get four USB Type-C ports and the new Touch Bar, too. As for the 15in version? That starts at an eye-watering £2,349.  8. The new MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter Apple has shrunk the size of both the 13in and the 15in MacBook Pros. The new 13in laptop is 14.6mm thick, 23% smaller, and weighs just 3.02 pounds – half a pound less than the outgoing version. The 15in MacBook Pro is 20% smaller, and only 15.5mm in width. It also weighs 4.02 pounds, just one more than the 13in MacBook Pro. 9. And that’s partly because of a new keyboard The new MacBook Pro’s thinness owes a lot to its brand-new keyboard. Apple has introduced a double-hinged, butterfly-style keyboard to the new MacBook Pro, and it’s a development of the one we’ve seen on the 12in MacBook. As a result, the new keyboard has considerably less key travel than before, and that’s something you’ll probably have to get used to. At least the already fantastic trackpad is now twice as large as before.  10. The new display is LUSH Apple has improved the new 15in MacBook Pro’s Retina display so it’s even better than before. This time around, the screen is 67% brighter and has a 67% better contrast ratio than the previous version. Apple says the new panel can display 25% more colours too, so pictures will look more vibrant and natural. 11. Storage isn’t bad either All the new MacBook Pro’s come with an SSD of at least 256GB in size, but if you’re willing to pay that can extend to extend to 1TB on the 13in MacBook Pro and 2TB on the 15in model. Storage is up to 50% faster, too.

Comments Submitted by John Hind on Wed, 2016-05-25 08:31. I'd really like to see what could be achieved by fitting a touch-screen in place of the touch-pad. I would then strip the keyboard right back to just QWERTY, replacing all the rarely-used keys, even the number keys, with context-specific and customisable virtual keys on the edge of the touch-pad. Submitted by pureworx on Wed, 2016-05-25 15:53. i'll take the surface book Submitted by Herojig on Fri, 2016-05-27 01:37. As a current user of the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and previous user of most past models of the MBP - I still have a pre-unibody MBP3,1 running - the above rumors don't excite me much, unless the form factor in weight and battery-life becomes one of the current MBA or better, and there is a true touch screen with 2-in-1 convertibility; in short, make me a surface book but better so I don't have to buy an ipad pro. Anything less is unacceptable for a major redesign. Submitted by Dave Knight on Mon, 2016-06-13 12:59. I remain very skeptical of this. Lenovo replaced the function keys with a touch-sensitive bar on their 2014 X1 Carbon. It was a flop, the proper function keys were missed by many professional users, and Lenovo backed down and put the proper function keys back for the 2015 model. I can understand the touch-strip on a less "pro" oriented model, but Apple does also risk alienating some of it's more high-end users with this rather gimmicky feature. Submitted by Different Dave! on Tue, 2016-06-21 17:07. Sure, if you can find a working one. Submitted by henry3dogg on Tue, 2016-08-02 16:44. "...OLED..." Apple won't put OLED screens on a high end device until the blue diode fading / failure problem is resolved. They just don't last long enough. Samsung may not care about screen quality after the first month (within the review life of the device), but Apple do. Not least because many of the devices have 3 year warranty. Submitted by Craig Cockburn on Fri, 2016-08-12 19:29. Why do I need to know this? I don't. Stop abusing English In any case how much free advertising is this for Apple? Submitted by Tulius on Sun, 2016-08-14 10:11. I have a working one. It's excellent. Submitted by Richie on Sun, 2016-08-14 10:26. The Razer Blade Pro has had this for a few years. Though chatter on the support forums suggests that Razer's software wasn't great, and the idea never really took off. Apple certainly has the ability to pull it off, mind you. Submitted by harryajh on Sun, 2016-08-14 12:27. and still no "Delete" Key! good job I have 2 hands to do that shortcut then - shocking! Submitted by Different Dave! on Sun, 2016-08-14 17:47. Well that's good. Our company had a ton of them, sent them all back due to unreliable hardware. Submitted by mp on Thu, 2016-09-15 11:39. "the stung" !!? Submitted by katy sei on Mon, 2016-10-24 16:19. Why screen resolution was not upgraded to 4K screen? hope Apple will use the new ultra fast ssd's from samsung/intel. Submitted by Bloomer on Mon, 2016-10-24 21:03. I think it's unlikely to lose the headphone jack as there is no benefit to losing it and also it's not just a headphone jack: it's also the optical audio port. Maybe it will have a multi function strip but does seem gimmicky rather than adding something fundamentally beneficial. Lastly - I hate the butterfly keyboards! Submitted by henry3dogg on Wed, 2016-10-26 17:54. Love the way Mac Rumours steals an image which is copyright Apple and redistributes it with their own logo embedded on it... ... or else the whole thing is just a hoax. Submitted by Vince O'Sullivan on Thu, 2016-10-27 08:02. Love the naivety of some people. The pictures are teasers, released specifically build up the hype around the announcement. The whole "accidental" nature of the "leaks" and their "discovery" in the run up to the announcement is all part of marketing. Submitted by Menorca Man on Thu, 2016-10-27 15:46. If you had any doubts that Alphr and its sister magazine PC Pro are biased towards Apple products, look no further. Eleven lengthy paragraphs on what to expect from the forthcoming MacBook Pro and only five skimpy paragraphs on the actual launch of the Microsoft Surface Book!! Need I say more? Submitted by Rob Bush on Thu, 2016-10-27 17:42. Did I just jump back 8 years to a Microsoft event? Wow... this entire event feels "old" in how it's being presented and what's being presented. It's like Apple has lost their cool (or their ability to be cool.) Submitted by JohnW on Thu, 2016-10-27 19:47. Wonderful. Someone decided to start the article at the bottom and go upwards! Please either start at the top or warn users the article is upside down. Submitted by JohnW on Thu, 2016-10-27 19:52. I think all those Thunderbird ports are will also work as marginally more useful USB-C ports. Submitted by TV John on Fri, 2016-10-28 07:31. Ah, but the problem with Lenovo's offer was it didn't have a cool little apple icon on it. If Apple's done it then it must be right. I'd better start blocking off the USB ports on my computer. Submitted by DigDug on Mon, 2016-10-31 11:41. Apple fail to innovate again! 'stunning touch bar' is at least a 20 year old idea recycled. overpriced, over hyped and over here tech that appeals to those that like there kit dumbed down Submitted by Baz Wrench on Mon, 2016-10-31 19:58. It would appeal to you then with your spelling and grammar? ;-) Submitted by Trevor Cake on Mon, 2016-10-31 20:04. So you need one hand free when you use your computer? Naughty. Submitted by JohnW on Mon, 2016-10-31 21:57. Another missing iconic, and practical, feature is the MagSafe power connector. Submitted by Frank on Wed, 2016-11-02 19:41. I do believe in the touch bar. Not in the hardware itself, but in Apple's ability to create functionality for such interfaces. The first time I saw the functionality of the trackpad, I thought I would never use more than two fingers to use it. It took a week to use every little functionality of the trackpad and I can't do without it anymore. I also believe that in a few years every peripheral has a USB-C connector (I was there when we had to throw away all serial devices because Apple introduced USB). But why on earth did they remove the magsafe connector? Stupid decision Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 11:43. "A new report suggests Apple is already planning to update its new laptop" At any point in time, Apple is working on the next minor refresh. The major update. And the next generation product product. And maybe the one after that. Saying that Apple is already planning an update is like saying there is a car behind you on the motorway. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 11:44. Far more likely a spoiler, probably sponsored by a competitor. If Apple has a new version coming, why buy this one. Wait. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 11:52. It's got the same number of "Delete" keys as most other notebooks. i.e. it's got the Back key that Apple labels with a back arrow and others label with the word "Delete", but performs exactly the same function in either case. i.e. to delete the character before the cursor. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 12:00. Have you spent time using it? Probably not if you describe yourself as just skeptical. I've been a software "pro" for 40 year. I have this device and use it every day. And the touch bar is brilliant. As is having 4 flexible ports each capable of 40 Gbits/sec. This machine will happily drive 8 (yes, eight) 1920x1200 monitors with 4 split cables. And no, I don't use dongles. I just have the correct cables. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 12:03. The problem with Lenovo's offer is that Microsoft hadn't built support for the touch bar into the keyboard handling, and Lenovo could only hack it in themselves, just so far. Apple control OSX as well has the hardware and so they have been able to fully integrate the facility from day one. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 12:04. Tells you how many readers Alpha believe are interested in the Microsoft Surface Book. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 12:07. For 45 years, I've hated every keyboard that isn't the one that I'm currently most used to. It took me a few days to get used to this one. So now it's great. Less subjectively, this is the fastest keyboard I've ever used. Submitted by RedHarry on Tue, 2017-01-17 12:16. I have never seen another make that only has a Backspace Key, all have Backspace & Delete. Thanks for the Backspace lesson but Delete, delete's character on and after - totally different! Only Macbooks have this weird phenomenon where you need to hold down Fn+Backspace to achieve the same very common, basic functionality. I find this very bizarre as Mac's are supposed to be so user friendly, they're ok IMO, nothing special and massively overpriced! But, each to his own Submitted by Bloomer on Tue, 2017-01-17 13:45. I can believe it - having tried the new one in the shop, the keyboard was better than the previous version...

To help organizations proactively zero in on evaluated threats that are relevant to the specific business, supply chain and industry, SurfWatch Labs, a provider of cyber threat intelligence solutions, announces the release of SurfWatch Threat Analyst. SurfWatch Threat Analyst is an easy-to-use SaaS product that delivers strategic and operational threat intelligence to help organizations identify adversarial opportunities for attack and proactively mitigate cyber risks. Threat Analyst automatically collects, standardizes and evaluates cyber threat data from a wide range of open and dark web sources, to eliminate false alarms and ensure timely and complete information. In addition to providing intelligence and security teams with relevant threat data, Threat Analyst also provides practical expert analyst insights and recommendations. “As our 2016 year-end report shows, cybercriminals continue to go where the opportunities are, and they evolve their tactics to get that upper hand,” said Adam Meyer, Chief Security Strategist, SurfWatch Labs. “With evaluated intelligence, analysts don’t have to sift through piles of irrelevant data to find that needle in the haystack – they have more context right off the bat. SurfWatch Threat Analyst allows intelligence teams to quickly tie relevant threats to specific areas of the business, their supply chain and industry, ultimately changing a security outcome for the better.” Key SurfWatch Threat Analyst Capabilities Include: Comprehensive, Automated Collection of Evaluated Cyber Threat Data –SurfWatch Threat Analyst scans and ingests threat data from open and restricted sources, such as news, social media and blogs, dark web markets and forums, paste sites, phishing feeds and more. Instead of delivering an overwhelming stream of raw cyber event data, SurfWatch automatically standardizes and evaluates the data to ensure accuracy and relevancy. This process ensures timeliness while eliminating false positives and incomplete information that could negatively impact decision-making. Targeted Intelligence Groups – Now analysts have the foundation for receiving highly targeted and evaluated threat data, by quickly and easily classifying threats by key criteria, such as cyber events related to the brand, suppliers, key employees, data, and infrastructure. With this added context organizations can fine-tune their cyber strategy and ensure that key stakeholders receive the right intelligence. Digital Risk Analysis of Your Company, Supply Chain, and Industry – SurfWatch Threat Analyst links relevant cyber events to an organization’s key business characteristics including company brand, suppliers, key employees, data, infrastructure, industry trends and more. Threat Analyst not only provides visibility of an organization’s cyber risks through the front door, but it also identifies risk within the supply chain based on SurfWatch’s threat intelligence collection and analytics engine. Searchable Index of Threat Data – In addition to the evaluated intel provided by Threat Analyst, customers also have the capability to search for and be alerted to specific threats collected in the SurfWatch warehouse. These alerts enable customers to determine the right balance of data they want to process versus filtered intelligence. Ask the Analyst – For specific intel-related questions, organizations can submit a formal RFI to SurfWatch's team of on-demand intelligence analysts. The SurfWatch team will deliver finished intelligence on a wide range of topics including cyber risk trends, malware analysis, TTP analysis, threat impact assessments, and more – along with prescribed risk mitigation steps. Flexible Dashboards for Instant Visibility of Cyber Risks – Threat Analyst comes with out-of-the-box, BI-level dashboards to help answer critical cyber risk questions, but also provides flexibility to easily create and tailor dashboards and reports to meet the unique requirements of other key stakeholders. “SurfWatch Threat Analyst was born out of feedback and usage from not only our customers but also the recommendations of our analysts who needed a flexible, usable solution for cultivating and delivering valuable intelligence to our customers," said Chip Hathaway, VP of Delivery, SurfWatch Labs. "The goal of Threat Analyst is to create a force multiplier for our customers' threat intelligence team by having the best intel, a mature and easy-to-use product, and skilled threat analysts within SurfWatch that can quickly assist our customers."

According to popular analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities in Taiwan, Apple will be bringing new upgrades to the MacBook lineup this year. Since the new Intel Kaby Lake processors are official, this year could see Apple updating the MacBooks with the new chipset along with an option for 32GB of RAM on the 15-inch model. A new 12-inch MacBook is expected to enter production in Q2 of 2017 while the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros will begin production Q3 of 2017. There is also the mention of a new 15-inch MacBook with 32GB of RAM which will enter production in Q4. This model will most likely be aimed at high-end users. Apple announced a refreshed line of the MacBook a couple of months back with Intel’s Skylake processor, so chances of an upgrade to the new processors is quite obvious. While there is limited detail, it is safe to assume that Apple will retain the design and most of the other features. The new MacBooks have been criticised for having poor battery life which should probably by addressed in the new upgrades.

ByCorinne Reichert | January 17, 2017 -- 04:59 GMT (20:59 PST) | Topic: Networking Networking giants Ericsson and Cisco have announced working together on virtualising the core network of Vodafone Australia in an effort to replace its fixed functionality systems with virtualised systems. Under the project, which marks the first "major collaboration" on telecommunications cloud infrastructure between Cisco and Ericsson, Ericsson will build the infrastructure as well as take responsibility for end-to-end operations. Latest Australian news Victoria's failed Ultranet project 'corrupted', declares IBAC Optus launches voice over Wi-Fi Australia's new critical cyberdefender needs action rather than announcements Turnbull pushes TPP as Japan calls it 'meaningless' without the US Optus boosts coverage across Australia with small cells The network architecture solution makes use of Ericsson's Hyperscale Datacenter System and such software as Ericsson Cloud Execution Environment, Ericsson Cloud Manager, and Cloud SDN controller. Cisco is contributing its WAN Automation Engine; IP Network VNFs including IOS XR 9000v and Cloud Services Router 1000v; virtualised and physical security technologies including its Adaptive Security Appliance and Cisco Firepower security gateway; and security support services for the Vodafone project. Vodafone Australia CTO Kevin Millroy, who was appointed to the role last month, said Cisco and Ericsson were chosen because they already provide the telco's core network and routing functions. By simplifying its infrastructure and core network -- which earlier on Tuesday suffered a three-hour voice outage -- Vodafone said it will decrease operating expenditure and capital expenditure, and improve both customer experience and the "agility" of its network. "This transformation allows us to introduce new applications to drive innovation and improve customer services and user experience," Millroy added. "The new infrastructure opens the door to new business models and markets, such as Internet of Things, for Vodafone." Intel last year emphasised how virtualised networks within telecommunications providers will also lead to consumers paying less for more data. "The carriers are getting tremendous pressure to continue to build out that infrastructure to better support higher and higher data rates, [and] greater and greater demands," Diane Bryant, Intel executive vice president and general manager of its Data Center Group, told ZDNet in June. "The network today is very expensive; demands far exceed their ability to support it in a cost-effective way, so they have got to start over and create a network infrastructure that is virtualised and can flux." Increasing network capacity is faster under a virtualised network, Bryant added, because providers no longer need to physically build out a series of fixed function devices, whereas in a virtualised cloud environment, companies can procure more capacity instantly. "Once they go to a virtualised environment, the vision is for customer services on demand," she said. Virtualisation is also a step towards network slicing, Ericsson said, which is used with 5G for more personalisation across networks. Using the slicing technology, a physical network can be segmented into several virtual mobile networks. Ericsson demonstrated 5G network slicing technology in partnership with South Korean telecommunications giant SK Telecom in October 2015, performing the demonstration at its R&D centre. Both Vodafone and Ericsson have been trialling 5G network technology in Australia: Ericsson and Telstra attained download speeds of 18-22Gbps during their 5G trial in September, Vodafone and Nokia attained speeds of 5Gbps in October, and Australia's third mobile provider Optus and Huawei saw speeds of 35Gbps in their 5G test in November. Vodafone also announced at the end of last year that it is working with Nokia to create a proof of concept to combine mobile edge computing, 4G networks, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, network function virtualisation (NFV), and video analytics to improve public safety. The companies said they would trial the technology in 2017, using the Nokia Mobile Edge Computing platform to track the movements and numbers of people in public safety applications through real-time data processing and video analytics from censors including CCTV footage. Telstra is similarly "co-innovating" with Cisco on NFV and software-defined networking (SDN) functionalities. "SDN and NFV technologies are redefining the user experience on the network," said Philip Jones, Telstra executive director of Global Products and Solutions, when unveiling a series of SDN and NFV products with Cisco last March. "By allowing us to overcome the constraints of traditional network infrastructure, the software-driven customer experiences dramatically increases our agility by enabling us to quickly create new solutions, and puts the control of those solutions into the hands of our customers." In October, Telstra additionally announced a partnership with HP, F5 Networks, and Alcatel-Lucent startup Nuage Networks to design a proof of concept for a multi-vendor NFV solution, certified by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. Under the collaboration project, HP's Helion CloudSystem framework was paired with F5 Networks' virtualised network functions, as well as Nuage Networks' virtual services platform. Telstra renewed a deal at the end of 2014 to use Ericsson optical network equipment and services to build out its SDN and NFV offerings.

Some IT professionals think so based on a recent survey, saying Macs are safer and boost productivity while also cutting down on support costs. Read More Kuo, an often-correct analyst, said in a research note the 15-inch MacBook Pro will be "the most significantly redesigned product this year." It's said to feature 32GB of RAM and enter production in early fourth quarter. The update is likely to feature the same Touch Bar that was introduced on the 2016 version of the MacBook Pro. A 12-inch MacBook is said to enter production in the second quarter, according to the analyst. It will be upgradable to 16GB of RAM from the entry level 8GB, and carry the same aesthetics as the 2015 version. Kuo added that new entry-level 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros will enter production in early third quarter with Kaby Lake processors. Intel unveiled the new processors at CES 2017 in January, and are believed to make the laptops more power efficient. There's no word on rumored updates to the iMac line that were pegged for the first half of 2017.

Details from the note were published earlier by MacRumors. According to Kuo, a new 12-inch MacBook will begin production in the second quarter of this year, new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros will begin production in the early third-quarter, and a new 15-inch MacBook will begin mass production in the final quarter of the year, featuring 32 gigabytes of memory and aimed at high-end users. It’s unclear whether this last machine will fall into the “Pro” lineup or have simply the “MacBook” nomenclature. Not surprisingly, Kuo says that all new laptops are predicted to run on Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, the latest revamp in Intel’s Core family of chips. The newest MacBook Pros, released last fall, run on Intel’s 2015 Skylake processors. Of course, there are always plenty of rumors swirling around upcoming Apple products, so we take these notes with a grain of salt. But Kuo has been one of the more reliable sources out there, making accurate predictions that range from specific iPhone features to predicting the high price of a high-end Apple Watch to Apple’s whole product roadmap for the year.

Following the Texans’ 34-16 divisional-round playoff loss to the Patriots last weekend, Wilfork hinted that he is leaning toward hanging up his helmet for good. Even if he does call it quits on the gridiron, Wilfork has already become teammates with Brady again, in a way. Wilfork posted a new Intel advertisement on his Instagram on Wednesday. In the ad, Wilfork gives Brady a makeover of sorts, seeing what the Patriots’ signal-caller looks like in overalls. Brady starred in an Intel commercial himself last week, where he served as the pitchman for Intel’s 360 replay technology that will be used during Super Bowl LI in Houston on Feb. 5. Take a look at the ad below. What do y'all think of my @TomBrady in overalls? 😂 😂 😂 Give Tommy Boy a makeover to land a spot in the ultimate fan-powered @Intel 360 Replay video.

Dr. Shakil Afridi was arrested in May 2011, soon after the CIA killed the Al-Qaeda leader. Afridi is accused of collecting DNA samples from Bin Laden, through a fake vaccination campaign, and turning them over to the CIA to confirm the militant’s identity. The doctor denies maintaining ties with jihadist groups, but Pakistani authorities arrested him in the town of Abbottabad. Considered a hero in Washington, some Pakistanis reportedly regard Afridi as a traitor.  © Flickr/ Cyril Attias Declassified CIA File: 9/11 Mastermind Stopped Providing Intel After Torture In 2012 Afridi was sentenced to 33 years in jail for being connected to the militant group Lashkar-e-Islam, a decision that would be overturned a year later, although he remains incarcerated. He was later charged with murder for the 2005 death of one of his patients and is awaiting trial in jail. Pakistani Minister for Law and Justice Zahid Hamid told the upper house of the Pakistani parliament, "The law is taking its course and Afridi is having full opportunity of a fair trial…Afridi worked against the law and our national interest, and the Pakistan government has repeatedly been telling the United States that under our law he committed a crime and was facing the law," according to the Daily Times. Though lauded for his assistance to the US, in early May 2016 Afridi’s lawyer Qamar Nadeem told AFP that pressure from Washington would be a great help, "but so far they have not shown their support."  © AP Photo/ File Osama Bin Laden Killing Controversy: Hersh Exposes US Media Hypocrisy Islamabad has denied claims that Pakistan’s intelligence services or military played any part in concealing the notorious terrorist, and describes Bin Laden’s time in Abbottabad as a lapse in security. Incoming US President Donald Trump, while on the campaign trail, upset Pakistan’s foreign ministry by declaring that he could have Afridi freed "in two minutes." "I think I would get him out in two minutes. I would tell them let him out and I'm sure they would let him out. Because we give a lot of aid to Pakistan," he said in an interview with Fox News. Pakistani interior minister Chuadry Nisar Ali Khan called Trump’s comments "ignorant," reminding the candidate that "Pakistan is not a colony of the United States of America. He should learn to treat sovereign nations with respect." Khan added, "The peanuts the US has given us in return should not be used to threaten or browbeat us into following Trump’s misguided vision of foreign policy." ...

Unsurprisingly, the company didn't offer up any release notes, as tends to happen with Surface updates. In fact, the same thing happened with the Surface Studio. The first firmware update for the device was released yesterday, but the changelog wasn't available until only a short while ago.

Military Military: The Intel What Obama said about Manning clemency Manning served tough prison term: Obama President Barack Obama says he felt comfortable commuting the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the former U.S. military intelligence analyst who was responsible for a 2010 leak of classified materials. President Barack Obama says he felt comfortable commuting the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the former U.S. military intelligence analyst who was responsible for a 2010 leak of classified materials. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter UPDATE: President Barack Obama said his decision to commute the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning should not lead other leakers to think they will go unpunished. At a press conference this morning, Obama said Manning has already served a “tough” sentence over the past seven years.  “The notion that the average person who was thinking about exposing vital classified information would think that it goes unpunished ... I don’t think (they) would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served,” Obama said. He added that he viewed Manning’s 35-year sentence by a military court as “very disproportionate relative to what other leakers have received.” Given that, it made sense to commute, not pardon, the soldier’s sentence, he said. “I feel very comfortable that justice has been served and that a message has still been sent,” Obama said in a press conference that’s been billed as the final one of his presidency. ORIGINAL STORY: Did President Barack Obama make the military less safe by granting clemency to Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence soldier who handed wartime information to Wikileaks — or did he perform an act of mercy? Obama is expected to offer his own explanation for commuting Manning’s sentence at a press conference at 11:15 a.m. Pacific today. Here are the pro and con arguments surrounding the outgoing president’s controversial move, which cut Manning’s 35-year sentence down to roughly the seven years already served. PRO: Manning was a ‘whistleblower,’ not a turncoat. Some people think that Manning, who deployed to Iraq in late 2009 as a low-grade intelligence analyst, was exposing uncomfortable truths. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The information leaked included military incident logs from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars that exposed detainee abuse by Iraqi military officers working under American authority. It also revealed that civilian deaths in the Iraq war were probably much higher than official estimates. The co-founder of the Chelsea Manning Support Network, Jeff Paterson, said, “It’s tragic that Chelsea had to spend 7 years imprisoned for releasing documents that should never have been classified in the first place, and were clearly in the public interest.” CON: We shouldn’t go soft on espionage, especially with troops on the ground. Arizona Sen. John McCain and House Speaker Paul Ryan seem to think that this will encourage others to do the same thing. “President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won’t be held accountable for their crimes,” Ryan said. McCain’s called it “a grave mistake that I fear will encourage further acts of espionage and undermine military discipline. It also devalues the courage of real whistleblowers who have used proper channels to hold our government accountable.” PRO: Manning’s sentence was unusually long. Manning pleaded guilty without a deal to cap her sentence. Her lawyers have called 35 years “excessive” and said she would have been the longest-serving whistleblower in American history.

(Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters Photo) Obama spokesman Josh Earnest today described the amount of time Manning has served as consistent with sentences imposed on others found guilty of similar crimes. CON: Obama is breaking with military leadership  Manning was, after all, an Army soldier serving in uniform as Bradley Manning when the documents were taken. News reports say that Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and other Pentagon leaders were against commuting the sentence. A military court tried and convicted her. (Manning later came out as transgender and asked to be called Chelsea.) There’s a strong tradition of allowing military justice to handle military crimes.

By JenniferBooton Reporter President-elect Donald Trump says NBC News was “totally biased” and producing “more fake news” in a report it published Tuesday that pointed out that many companies are pre-emptively, or in many cases retroactively, announcing job-creation plans to avoid being targeted by a man set to become president Friday. Totally biased @NBCNews went out of its way to say that the big announcement from Ford, G.M., Lockheed & others that jobs are coming back...— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017 to the U.S., but had nothing to do with TRUMP, is more FAKE NEWS. Ask top CEO's of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017 His tweets aren’t well-founded. The NBC News report spotlighted instances in which companies themselves announced large-scale additions of jobs without mentioning Trump as a reason for their increased investments in the U.S., despite Trump’s having taken credit. That list includes Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.40% , with its press release last week promising 100,000 new U.S. jobs, as well as the automobile makers Fiat Chrysler FCAU, +0.18% and General Motors GM, -1.36%  . Often the corporate plans had been in the works long before Trump’s election on Nov. 8 or were among annual expansion goals that had been on the companies’ road maps for years. MarketWatch, similarly, reported last week that Alibaba Group Holding’s BABA, -0.66% claim, after a meeting at Trump Tower between CEO Jack Ma and the president-elect, that it will create a million U.S. jobs, doesn’t include full-time jobs or actual Alibaba jobs at all. MarketWatch also pointed out that Sprint Corp.’s S, -2.23% decision to bring 5,000 jobs back to the U.S. from other countries, a move for which Trump took credit, were actually related to a previously announced commitment by Japan’s SoftBank Group 9984, +0.23% to invest $50 billion in the U.S. as part of the global technology fund it announced with a Saudi sovereign-wealth fund in October. IBM Corp. IBM, -0.76%  , which pre-emptively announced a 25,000-jobs growth plan in mid-December before ever meeting with Trump, falls into this category, as well. Will augmented reality or virtual reality win?(3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multi-billion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The president-elect went as far, in a separate tweet, as to quote a Wall Street Journal story about Bayer AG’s BAYN, -0.01% pledge to invest and add jobs in the U.S. However, as CNN Money pointed out, those jobs aren’t directly tied back to Trump either, but to Bayer’s move to buy Monsanto, announced in September. When Bayer announced the Monsanto deal, it said St. Louis would remain the North American headquarters of Monsanto while San Francisco would serve as the base for their combined farming assets. A look at a few of the press releases and CEO interviews cited by Trump and NBC News as well reveals varying levels of Trump involvement, from no linkage at all to a direct and causal connection. On Tuesday, General Motors announced that it would invest an additional $1 billion in U.S. manufacturing and create 7,000 jobs, while moving some axle-producing jobs to the U.S. from Mexico. GM made no mention of the incoming administration or its policy priorities and instead said these latest steps follow similar investments it has made annually since 2009 — a period beginning shortly after the U.S. auto industry bailout. “GM’s announcement is part of the company’s increased focus on overall efficiency over the last four years,” the company said in a statement. The GM investment commitment, in fact, is nearly $2 billion smaller than the investment in U.S. manufacturing that GM said it announced last year. And the vast majority of GM’s investment will go to fund new vehicles and advanced technologies, as the company continues to invest in the resources to respond to increased competition from Silicon Valley amid the advent of autonomous-vehicle technology. See also: What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry Fiat Chrysler, meanwhile, said its plan for a new $1 billion investment in the U.S. and the creation of 2,000 jobs is “a continuation of the efforts already underway to increase production capacity in the U.S. on trucks and SUVs to match demand.” As gasoline prices have tumbled, demand for gas-guzzling trucks and sport-utility vehicles has rebounded, a theme that predates Trump’s election. Walmart’s press release Tuesday announcing 10,000 new U.S. jobs also excluded any Trump mention and was more tied to the company’s longer-term strategy to expand its retail locations globally and improve its e-commerce services to better compete with the likes of Amazon. Amazon, for its part, has said it is adding tens of thousands of jobs to staff new but previously announced fulfillment centers in Texas, California, Florida and New Jersey. Other job announcements, though, were more directly linked to Trump, at least in the sense that they were reacting to him, which was part of the point NBC News was trying to make. Ford Motor Co. F, +0.97% told reporters in so many words that its decision to cancel plans for a new plant in Mexico and create 700 jobs in Michigan were related to Trump’s pro-business policies. Lockheed Martin Corp.’s LMT, -0.58% decision to add 1,800 positions and lower the cost of its F-35 program arose following a meeting at Trump Tower. It also followed Trump public statements blasting the company over its prices. The take-away Trump isn’t definitively the reason that companies are currently creating jobs in the U.S., despite his public statements — typically on Twitter — claiming as much. Trump alleged that credibility issues are why NBC’s “Today” show is “doing so badly.” It’s worth noting that the NBC report to which Trump has reacted so emotionally didn’t even break on “Today,” but rather in a story published Tuesday night on the NBC News website. NBC News, owned by Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +0.60%  , did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Trump tweets. Shares of Comcast have gained 33% in the past 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500 SPX, -0.09%  , which is up about 21% in the past year.

The company is also issuing a series of updates for the Surface Pro 4. Here's the list of updates (via Thurrott): Microsoft – System – 11/4/2016 Microsoft – Firmware – 12/8/2016 Microsoft – System – 12/9/2016 Intel Corporation – HIDClass – 11/10/2016 Microsoft – Firmware – 12/7/2016 Microsoft – System – 10/11/2016 And just like the new firmware for the Studio, we have no idea what's included in these. Microsoft does have pages dedicated to Surface update history, but as usual, the company is unable to produce a changelog at the same time that the update is actually released. Obviously, the dates would indicate that the updates are older; however, while there's one fix for the Realtek High Definition Audio driver listed from December 8, there hasn't been anything else since August 30. It's also entirely possible that other Surface devices are receiving firmware, besides the Pro 4 and the Studio. Unfortunately, until Microsoft decides to post some changelogs, it will just be a guessing game.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Now we know what Microsoft’s upcoming ‘Game Mode’ for Windows 10 will do [Updated] Now we know what Microsoft’s upcoming ‘Game Mode’ for Windows 10 will do [Updated] By Joel Hruska on January 18, 2017 at 7:36 am Comment Update: 1/25/2017: An earlier version of this story mistakenly reported that Game Mode’s performance improvements would be limited to adjustments of the Windows 10 game DVR option. While the upcoming Creators Update may include the option to disable the DVR, as we originally reported, that’s not the primary purpose of the new Game Mode or an accurate discussion of its feature set. A new story at Ars Technica details what Game Mode will and will not do, and notes that this update will emphasize consistently, as opposed to automatically driving frame rates up. This is a critical point that will benefit all gamers — while PC players tend to look down their noses at anything below 60 FPS, I’ll take a rock-solid 30 FPS over a title that varies from 30 – 60 FPS, provided the variations are significant. Consistent frame rates are an area where Nvidia cards have classically had advantages over their AMD counterparts, though this gap has been reduced in recent years by a combination of better drivers from AMD and the advent of DX12 and Vulkan. Game Mode will supposedly direct the OS to bias CPU and GPU resource allocation towards whatever game is running, though it’s not clear how much under-the-hood performance is really available to Microsoft for tweaking. A number of websites performed Windows 7 versus 8.1 versus Windows 10 game evaluations, and no one turned up any sign that Windows 10 was slower than previous iterations of the operating system, even when checking minimum frame rates and frame times. That’s not to say Microsoft can’t find a few more knobs and dials to tweak, but I still wonder if this isn’t mostly about cleaning up corner cases. Kevin Gammill, the partner group program manager for Xbox One, told Ars Technica he expected the overall gains from Game Mode to be in the 2-5% range. Generally speaking, you need a higher frame rate jump than that for people to reliably tell the difference between the old rate and the new one in back-to-back runs. Image by PCGamesN Microsoft is still being silent about what, exactly, Game Mode entails, only saying that it relates to background process and affinity settings to dedicate more resources to console titles. It will work with both UWP and Win32 applications, but we’ll have to wait until the Creators Update drops to find out which titles it particularly effects, or whether the benefits are greatest on systems with lower core counts. I still think that could wind up being the case, since any system with quad-cores + Hyper-Threading likely has more CPU resources available than are being used by any single game title. Pentium and Core i3-class equipment would seem to be the most likely to benefit from these improvements, but that’s speculation at this point. Gammill did say that UWP devices would likely see better numbers from the new mode, since Win32 apps can spawn multiple processes in ways that UWP applications can’t. This makes it easier to optimize for the UWP use-case scenario. The Creators Update of Windows 10 will ship with a whitelist of enabled titles; Game Mode will be something you can enable via Win-G, as shown above. We stand by our earlier observation as well. One feature we’d very much like to see Microsoft offer is a Game Mode that prevented Windows Update from rebooting the computer while resource-intensive applications or games are running. If you’ve ever had a Windows 10 system suddenly decide it’s time for a reboot in the middle of a game or benchmark run (and I’ve seen multiple testbeds pull this trick with zero warning), you know how infuriating it can be. Fix that problem, and you’ve got a Game Mode worth deploying.

By JenniferBooton Reporter President-elect Donald Trump says NBC News was “totally biased” and producing “more fake news” in a report it published Tuesday that pointed out that many companies are pre-emptively, or in many cases retroactively, announcing job-creation plans to avoid being targeted by a man set to become president Friday. Totally biased @NBCNews went out of its way to say that the big announcement from Ford, G.M., Lockheed & others that jobs are coming back...— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017 to the U.S., but had nothing to do with TRUMP, is more FAKE NEWS. Ask top CEO's of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017 His tweets aren’t well-founded. The NBC News report spotlighted instances in which companies themselves announced large-scale additions of jobs without mentioning Trump as a reason for their increased investments in the U.S., despite Trump’s having taken credit. That list includes Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.40% , with its press release last week promising 100,000 new U.S. jobs, as well as the automobile makers Fiat Chrysler FCAU, +0.18% and General Motors GM, -1.36%  . Often the corporate plans had been in the works long before Trump’s election on Nov. 8 or were among annual expansion goals that had been on the companies’ road maps for years. MarketWatch, similarly, reported last week that Alibaba Group Holding’s BABA, -0.66% claim, after a meeting at Trump Tower between CEO Jack Ma and the president-elect, that it will create a million U.S. jobs, doesn’t include full-time jobs or actual Alibaba jobs at all. MarketWatch also pointed out that Sprint Corp.’s S, -2.23% decision to bring 5,000 jobs back to the U.S. from other countries, a move for which Trump took credit, were actually related to a previously announced commitment by Japan’s SoftBank Group 9984, +0.23% to invest $50 billion in the U.S. as part of the global technology fund it announced with a Saudi sovereign-wealth fund in October. IBM Corp. IBM, -0.76%  , which pre-emptively announced a 25,000-jobs growth plan in mid-December before ever meeting with Trump, falls into this category, as well. Will augmented reality or virtual reality win?(3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multi-billion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The president-elect went as far, in a separate tweet, as to quote a Wall Street Journal story about Bayer AG’s BAYN, -0.01% pledge to invest and add jobs in the U.S. However, as CNN Money pointed out, those jobs aren’t directly tied back to Trump either, but to Bayer’s move to buy Monsanto, announced in September. When Bayer announced the Monsanto deal, it said St. Louis would remain the North American headquarters of Monsanto while San Francisco would serve as the base for their combined farming assets. A look at a few of the press releases and CEO interviews cited by Trump and NBC News as well reveals varying levels of Trump involvement, from no linkage at all to a direct and causal connection. On Tuesday, General Motors announced that it would invest an additional $1 billion in U.S. manufacturing and create 7,000 jobs, while moving some axle-producing jobs to the U.S. from Mexico. GM made no mention of the incoming administration or its policy priorities and instead said these latest steps follow similar investments it has made annually since 2009 — a period beginning shortly after the U.S. auto industry bailout. “GM’s announcement is part of the company’s increased focus on overall efficiency over the last four years,” the company said in a statement. The GM investment commitment, in fact, is nearly $2 billion smaller than the investment in U.S. manufacturing that GM said it announced last year. And the vast majority of GM’s investment will go to fund new vehicles and advanced technologies, as the company continues to invest in the resources to respond to increased competition from Silicon Valley amid the advent of autonomous-vehicle technology. See also: What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry Fiat Chrysler, meanwhile, said its plan for a new $1 billion investment in the U.S. and the creation of 2,000 jobs is “a continuation of the efforts already underway to increase production capacity in the U.S. on trucks and SUVs to match demand.” As gasoline prices have tumbled, demand for gas-guzzling trucks and sport-utility vehicles has rebounded, a theme that predates Trump’s election. Walmart’s press release Tuesday announcing 10,000 new U.S. jobs also excluded any Trump mention and was more tied to the company’s longer-term strategy to expand its retail locations globally and improve its e-commerce services to better compete with the likes of Amazon. Amazon, for its part, has said it is adding tens of thousands of jobs to staff new but previously announced fulfillment centers in Texas, California, Florida and New Jersey. Other job announcements, though, were more directly linked to Trump, at least in the sense that they were reacting to him, which was part of the point NBC News was trying to make. Ford Motor Co. F, +0.97% told reporters in so many words that its decision to cancel plans for a new plant in Mexico and create 700 jobs in Michigan were related to Trump’s pro-business policies. Lockheed Martin Corp.’s LMT, -0.58% decision to add 1,800 positions and lower the cost of its F-35 program arose following a meeting at Trump Tower. It also followed Trump public statements blasting the company over its prices. The take-away Trump isn’t definitively the reason that companies are currently creating jobs in the U.S., despite his public statements — typically on Twitter — claiming as much. Trump alleged that credibility issues are why NBC’s “Today” show is “doing so badly.” It’s worth noting that the NBC report to which Trump has reacted so emotionally didn’t even break on “Today,” but rather in a story published Tuesday night on the NBC News website. NBC News, owned by Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +0.60%  , did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Trump tweets. Shares of Comcast have gained 33% in the past 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500 SPX, -0.09%  , which is up about 21% in the past year.

First-quarter revenue would be about 1.8 billion euros (US$1.9 billion), Veldhoven, Netherlands-based ASML predicted. Analysts had projected 1.76 billion euros on average. A year earlier, ASML reported sales of 1.33 billion euros. “All of this has further anchored our leadership position in the semiconductor equipment market,” chief executive officer Peter Wennink said in a statement. ASML is pushing chipmaker clients such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (台積電), Intel Corp and Samsung Electronics Co to upgrade to its newest machines, called extreme ultraviolet lithography systems (EUV), which can etch smaller circuits while increasing capacity and speed. ASML in November agreed to buy about a quarter of Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH for 1 billion euros as part of its EUV push. While ASML is speeding up development of a new optical system for the next generation of machines, Nikon Corp in mid-October announced that it would slash development costs for immersion steppers, lithography machines that etch semiconductor circuits onto silicon, citing slow uptake by customers. ASML reported fourth-quarter sales that beat estimates, mostly with older products. Fourth-quarter sales rose 33 percent to 1.91 billion euros, marking the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth. Analysts had predicted sales of 1.77 billion euros. Profit increased to 524 million euros, beating estimates of 419.3 million euros. The stock has gained about 50 percent over the past year, valuing the company at 47.6 billion euros. Since the start of the year, shares of ASML have increased about 1 percent through Tuesday, outperforming the benchmark AEX index in Amsterdam, which declined. This story has been viewed 2028 times.

That’s according to a note Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri issued to investors on Wednesday, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider. Arcuri refers to the so-called tenth anniversary iPhone as “iPhone X”. The analyst claims the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus models may switch from LCDs to AMOLEDs, too, if Samsung Display is able to supply enough panels to Apple. The rumor-mill previously called for a 5.8-inch iPhone 8 model though the actual usable size of the display may be smaller: according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, iPhone 8 will boast an “active display area” measuring 5.1 or 5.2 inches diagonally, or smaller than the existing Plus models of the handset. Arcuri’s note corroborates earlier claims that iPhone 8’s edge-to-edge front panel will embed such components as the earpiece, FaceTime camera and Touch ID fingerprint sensor directly into the display assembly. The device may adopt Synaptec’s optical-based fingerprint reader for its embedded Touch ID sensor because that’s “currently the only workable solution” for in-screen fingerprint recognition, reads the note. Lastly, the analyst contends that iPhone 8 may gain a laser sensor positioned near the front-facing Face Time camera that should be employed in the expected facial and gesture recognition features. Other iPhone 8 capabilities mentioned in the report include wireless charging and dual-sourced baseband modems from Intel and Qualcomm. In fact, Apple may buy more modems from Qualcomm this time around, most probably because of the reported speed issues with iPhone 7’s Intel modem. That would be despite the latest lawsuit by the FTC which charges Qualcomm with bribing Apple and other smartphone vendors into using its chips in exchange for better royalties, which the chip maker vehemently denies. Summing up, the three new iPhone models scheduled to launch in 2017—iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8 (or “iPhone X”)—will represent a “feature-rich launch” for the Cupertino firm, in the analysts’s own words. You’ll recall prior rumors alleging that only iPhone 8 would have an AMOLED screen and all-glass industrial design with a shiny metal frame while iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus would presumably retain their LCD screens. Apple’s rivals are reportedly worried that iPhone 8 will gobble up the entire supply of AMOLED screens. Samsung Display, the world’s top producer of AMOLED smartphone panels, will be the lone supplier of iPhone 8-bound AMOLEDs. By 2018, Foxconn-owned Sharp, Japan Display and LG Display should join Apple’s AMOLED supply chain.

Jamessmooth Ohhhhh sounds delicious! Iskren Donev I would lick-, I mean like that… jOn Garrett Sounds like a Galaxy i8. Rowan09 What is a fixed flex screen? Shinonuke Same. I, too, would love to find out Kaptivator I’m thinking “Fixed” meaning mounted to hardware that will be stationary as in non bendable. The flex screen is the flexible display screen kinda like what Samsung has on the Galaxy. Where the screen edges round over and show stuff on the side like the time and stuff like that so you don’t have to actually look at the face of the phone. If I’m not mistaken, that is Flex Screen or a flexible display. Go to wiki and search flexible display and scroll down to Samsung. It will give you more of what I am trying to convey. However, after reading the wiki page, others have had this tech for a while besides Samsung. No sarcasm, bro. I had to look it up myself. Just was sharing what I took from it. Jamessmooth I don’t know. I’m so used to the plus screen size that it would be hard to go down to iPhone 8 if in fact it’ll be like 5.1 inches. Gonna have to be insanely feature rich to make me step down. 5.8″ would be fantastic. askep3 Pretty sure the non active part of the screen will be used for something, we’ll just have to see nova12 Both my wife and I went from the 6+ to the 7 and neither one of us miss the big screen. The adjustment didn’t even seem like an adjustment. But I suppose that’s 100% subjective. Jamessmooth Any particular reason why you went smaller? nova12 Nothing to do with the performance or anything. I just got tired or the larger footprint. wanted something smaller in my pocket and hand. I’ve got decently big hands (yuge!) but it was still just too big for me to be comfortable with, especially in my pocket. Same for my wife. Also, I hated when the home screen rotated (used to like it, but it seemed like it was really slow returning to portrait — weirdly, only when I was jailbroken; might have been a tweak I had). So I’d turn off rotation in control center, but then need to turn it back on in-app where I wanted to use landscape. Then turn it off again. Just kind of a pain. It all added up to not working for us, is all. I do wish the 7 had the portrait camera feature, though. Kaptivator I would love something between the 7 and 7plus. Like you said, the footprint of the plus is massive. I tried it out and returned it after a day or two because it was cumbersome in pocket. ChloeWade That’d be shit if they actually made the premium device smaller than the plus like that would piss a lot of people off i think it’s highly unlikely I think they’ll make it at last the size of the plus plus if a active display is 5.1 and 5.8 inch panel that’s a lot of bezel askep3 I doubt the “non-active” part of the display would be useless, it will probably have some cool features of its own. Will Maitner *sigh* I want a larger screen and larger device, not the same size screen on a smaller device.. If this is true, I’m not sure, but I may give Android another try.. Ria1979 I don’t think there will be 3 models. Either straight to iPhone 8 and 8 Plus or 7S and 7S Plus special editions. meir cohen Ya ya sure Another ifix Article. What a bout ios 10.2.4 update?

View All Pages ASUS has given its Republic of Gamers (ROG) series of motherboards a shake-up with the launch of Intel’s new Z270 chipset. The mid-range offerings that bring ROG features to more affordable sections of the market are given STRIX naming convention, with their superior siblings featuring direct Maximus IX naming to follow the previous convention. We take a look at the mid-range ROG STRIX Z270F Gaming which targets users who want a ROG motherboard with an extra few features over the entry-level option. You can read our Kaby Lake Core i5-7600K and Core i7-7700K review HERE. Staying focused on its gamer target audience, ASUS’ ROG STRIX Z270F Gaming offers capability to power a pair of high-bandwidth cards in SLI or CrossFire while also driving dual M.2 PCIe SSDs in RAID. Storage buffs will also be pleased to see the presence of 10Gbps USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A and Type-C ports powered by ASMedia’s new ASM2142 chipset. Given the importance of aesthetics for today’s gaming components, ASUS decides upon a largely grey and black colour scheme that allows user customisation by means of onboard RGB LEDs. Good to see is the presence of two onboard 4-pin RGB strip headers, rather than the typical single offering found on most competing boards. An added point unique to ASUS is a 3D printing friendly design that features mounting locations for 3D printed accessories. Is the STRIX Z270F Gaming successful in bringing premium ROG features down to a more affordable price point?

Luke It’s a negative to people who want RGB lighting. A lot or a little RGB lighting doesn’t really change the quality of the motherboard and its stability (something would have to go very wrong in the design and manufacturing process for that to happen). Most modern boards with RGB lighting have an option to turn off the LEDs if a user desires. Granted that may seem wasteful but it gives a pair of options – good RGB lighting for users who want that and no lighting for users who prefer that. If somebody doesn’t want RGB lighting then the minimal onboard lighting of the Z270F Gaming won’t concern them. Polls Which system memory next?

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile FTC sues Qualcomm over chip licensing strategy, alleges antitrust abuses FTC sues Qualcomm over chip licensing strategy, alleges antitrust abuses By Joel Hruska on January 18, 2017 at 9:15 am Comment The Federal Trade Commission has filed suit against Qualcomm, alleging that the company exploited its position as the dominant provider of baseband radios for LTE devices. In its brief, the FTC argues that Qualcomm used its position to extort higher royalties from smartphone manufacturers. The FTC asserts that Qualcomm enforces a “No license, no chips,” policy in which it will not sell parts to a cell phone manufacturer unless the manufacturer agrees to its patent and licensing terms. The terms of these licenses apparently include substantially elevated license rates on chips manufactured by Qualcomm competitors, which amounts to an unfair tax to any company that wants to build a smartphone with a non-Qualcomm processor. Qualcomm is also under investigation for refusing to license standards-essential patents to its competitors. It has long been recognized in patent law that organizations can benefit from creating a standard implementation for a technology or capability that everyone can take advantage of. 2G, 3G, HSDPA+, 4G, LTE — all of these technologies are implemented according to specific standards. When companies contribute IP to the formation of a standard, they are typically required to obey what are known as Fair, Reasonable, and Nondiscriminatory rules (FRAND): Fair – terms are not anticompetitive and would not be considered unlawful if imposed by a dominant firm in its relative market. Reasonable – the licensing rate for the patents themselves will not result in dramatic cost increases or make the industry uncompetitive. The licensing rate would not be unreasonable if all firms were charged the same rate. Nondiscriminatory: Licensees are treated equally. Rates are allowed to vary based on external factors like order volume, length of contract, or the creditworthiness of the licensee. Whatever the variations are, however, all licensees must be treated equally. FRAND agreements are typically voluntary between the standards body and the patent holder, but the contracts are legally binding. If Qualcomm is indeed refusing to license standards-essential patents to competing baseband suppliers, it would explain both why the company shot to a near-complete lock on the LTE market following that technology’s introduction, as well as shedding some light on why nearly all of the other LTE providers gave up and went home. As of mid-2016, reports suggested Qualcomm had a 50% market share (that’s actually down significantly from where it used to be), with the remaining market divided between Samsung, Intel, MediaTek, and Spreadtrum. Samsung and MediaTek were 37% of the remaining 50% in the first half of 2016, but that may have begun to change since some percentage of iPhones also rely on an Intel broadband chip. Note that this data is worldwide, not US-specific. Image by StrategyAnalytics The FTC also alleges that Qualcomm signed an exclusivity deal with Apple from 2011 – 2016 in which Apple agreed to only use Qualcomm baseband chips and Qualcomm gave the company a lower licensing rate as a result. This complaint against the company is just the latest in a string of similar findings. South Korea fined Qualcomm $854 million for its licensing practices, while China fined it $954 million after its own antitrust probe. The EU investigation is ongoing as well. Obviously our ability to evaluate this complaint is limited, since there are sections redacted and we haven’t seen any of the evidence on which the complaint is based. We cannot, for example, draw any conclusions on Qualcomm’s licensing rates or its offers of exclusivity, and since we’re talking about patent standards, those terms matter. One puzzling aspect to the FTC’s filing is that it seeks to draw differentiation between the high-end LTE market in the United States and the general market for LTE in lower-end smartphones. The complaint specifically alleges that Qualcomm faces limited competition for premium LTE processors (definitely true, as evidenced by the overwhelming number of smartphones that use Qualcomm radios). It does not make a general complaint about the rest of the LTE market, though it does state that Qualcomm’s royalty rates and non-FRAND licensing terms apply to the general market for baseband, rather than the premium LTE space. Qualcomm has issued its own dissenting statement, arguing that the FTC’s case is significantly flawed. “This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint on the eve of Chairwoman Ramirez’s departure and the transition to a new Administration, which reflects a sharp break from FTC practice,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s executive vice president and general counsel. The timing of this announcement is interesting, said Anshel Sag, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, as it comes within the last week of the current administration as their FTC appointees prepare to step down. “It will be very interesting to see how the Trump administration and their appointees handle this bombshell of a complaint,” he said. “I believe that the Trump administration may end up being much less heavy-handed with how they approach this complaint than the Obama administration would have been.” Tagged In qualcomm lte wireless broadband FTC antitrust cellular lawsuit Federal Trade Commission FRAND baseband Post a Comment Comment ExtremeTech Newsletter Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.

By JenniferBooton Reporter President-elect Donald Trump says NBC News was “totally biased” and producing “more fake news” in a report it published Tuesday that pointed out that many companies are pre-emptively, or in many cases retroactively, announcing job-creation plans to avoid being targeted by a man set to become president Friday. Totally biased @NBCNews went out of its way to say that the big announcement from Ford, G.M., Lockheed & others that jobs are coming back...— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017 to the U.S., but had nothing to do with TRUMP, is more FAKE NEWS. Ask top CEO's of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017 His tweets aren’t well-founded. The NBC News report spotlighted instances in which companies themselves announced large-scale additions of jobs without mentioning Trump as a reason for their increased investments in the U.S., despite Trump’s having taken credit. That list includes Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.40% , with its press release last week promising 100,000 new U.S. jobs, as well as the automobile makers Fiat Chrysler FCAU, +0.18% and General Motors GM, -1.36%  . Often the corporate plans had been in the works long before Trump’s election on Nov. 8 or were among annual expansion goals that had been on the companies’ road maps for years. MarketWatch, similarly, reported last week that Alibaba Group Holding’s BABA, -0.66% claim, after a meeting at Trump Tower between CEO Jack Ma and the president-elect, that it will create a million U.S. jobs, doesn’t include full-time jobs or actual Alibaba jobs at all. MarketWatch also pointed out that Sprint Corp.’s S, -2.23% decision to bring 5,000 jobs back to the U.S. from other countries, a move for which Trump took credit, were actually related to a previously announced commitment by Japan’s SoftBank Group 9984, +0.23% to invest $50 billion in the U.S. as part of the global technology fund it announced with a Saudi sovereign-wealth fund in October. IBM Corp. IBM, -0.76%  , which pre-emptively announced a 25,000-jobs growth plan in mid-December before ever meeting with Trump, falls into this category, as well. Will augmented reality or virtual reality win?(3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multi-billion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The president-elect went as far, in a separate tweet, as to quote a Wall Street Journal story about Bayer AG’s BAYN, -0.01% pledge to invest and add jobs in the U.S. However, as CNN Money pointed out, those jobs aren’t directly tied back to Trump either, but to Bayer’s move to buy Monsanto, announced in September. When Bayer announced the Monsanto deal, it said St. Louis would remain the North American headquarters of Monsanto while San Francisco would serve as the base for their combined farming assets. A look at a few of the press releases and CEO interviews cited by Trump and NBC News as well reveals varying levels of Trump involvement, from no linkage at all to a direct and causal connection. On Tuesday, General Motors announced that it would invest an additional $1 billion in U.S. manufacturing and create 7,000 jobs, while moving some axle-producing jobs to the U.S. from Mexico. GM made no mention of the incoming administration or its policy priorities and instead said these latest steps follow similar investments it has made annually since 2009 — a period beginning shortly after the U.S. auto industry bailout. “GM’s announcement is part of the company’s increased focus on overall efficiency over the last four years,” the company said in a statement. The GM investment commitment, in fact, is nearly $2 billion smaller than the investment in U.S. manufacturing that GM said it announced last year. And the vast majority of GM’s investment will go to fund new vehicles and advanced technologies, as the company continues to invest in the resources to respond to increased competition from Silicon Valley amid the advent of autonomous-vehicle technology. See also: What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry Fiat Chrysler, meanwhile, said its plan for a new $1 billion investment in the U.S. and the creation of 2,000 jobs is “a continuation of the efforts already underway to increase production capacity in the U.S. on trucks and SUVs to match demand.” As gasoline prices have tumbled, demand for gas-guzzling trucks and sport-utility vehicles has rebounded, a theme that predates Trump’s election. Walmart’s press release Tuesday announcing 10,000 new U.S. jobs also excluded any Trump mention and was more tied to the company’s longer-term strategy to expand its retail locations globally and improve its e-commerce services to better compete with the likes of Amazon. Amazon, for its part, has said it is adding tens of thousands of jobs to staff new but previously announced fulfillment centers in Texas, California, Florida and New Jersey. Other job announcements, though, were more directly linked to Trump, at least in the sense that they were reacting to him, which was part of the point NBC News was trying to make. Ford Motor Co. F, +0.97% told reporters in so many words that its decision to cancel plans for a new plant in Mexico and create 700 jobs in Michigan were related to Trump’s pro-business policies. Lockheed Martin Corp.’s LMT, -0.58% decision to add 1,800 positions and lower the cost of its F-35 program arose following a meeting at Trump Tower. It also followed Trump public statements blasting the company over its prices. The take-away Trump isn’t definitively the reason that companies are currently creating jobs in the U.S., despite his public statements — typically on Twitter — claiming as much. Trump alleged that credibility issues are why NBC’s “Today” show is “doing so badly.” It’s worth noting that the NBC report to which Trump has reacted so emotionally didn’t even break on “Today,” but rather in a story published Tuesday night on the NBC News website. NBC News, owned by Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +0.60%  , did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Trump tweets. Shares of Comcast have gained 33% in the past 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500 SPX, -0.09%  , which is up about 21% in the past year.

(NASDAQ:AMD), and hash out what it may mean for AMD stock. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr The conclusion at the time was — and still is — the new CPU is everything Advanced Micro Devices touted it would be, and more. Not only does Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have good reason to be worried, AMD shareholders have good reason to be optimistic. Although AMD stock is still overbought and ripe for a short-term pullback, any dip would be a buying opportunity in light of the potential of the Ryzen processor. But the new CPU isn’t the only game-changing technology Advanced Micro Devices has been working on for the past couple of years. Its new graphic processor unit (GPU) architecture, called Vega, could give AMD a weapon that lets it take dead aim a video-oriented rival Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Meet Vega Just as a refresher, the new CPU from AMD that is supposed to launch sometime this quarter will give rival Intel a run for its money. The most comparable Intel CPU, the i7-6900K, runs at 3.2 GHz but can cranked up to a pace of 4 GHz. The Ryzen’s base operating rate is 3.4 GHz. Though the top-end speed isn’t clear yet, it shouldn’t be too different than the i7’s. Where the new processor is apt to really turns heads, however, is on price. The industry’s handicappers are looking for the “Zen” to retail for between $500 to $600 apiece, or roughly half the $1,000-plus sticker one would find on the package of the i7-6900. A new CPU wasn’t the only thing Advanced Micro Devices has been working on the past couple of years, though. The Vega graphic processor unit has been under development too, and is about to be unleashed on a market eager to try it out. A GPU is the portion of the computer that handles the display/interface a user sees. Most desktops have a separate chip (with its own memory) attached to the motherboard to make this happen, whereas most laptops integrate this function into the motherboard itself. The Vega platform employs a whole new kind of thinking about the way a machine handles all the video-based demands put on it. Its second-generation high bandwidth memory (or HBM2) is a stacked memory architecture that performs significantly better than the more common GDDR5 (double data rate type-five) utilized by most graphics processing units today. This arrangement allows for a so-called High Bandwidth Cache and High Bandwidth Controller, which effectively offloads the memory work usually performed by a graphics card to that computer’s — the motherboard’s — memory. This means a practically infinite amount of memory can be dedicated to handling the display. The maximum virtualization is capped at a ridiculous 512 terabytes. In layman’s terms, this approach is about twice as powerful as most current alternatives. Perhaps more important, Vega will make Advanced Micro Devices competitive with the newest-generation of GPU architecture from Nvidia, called Pascal. That likely has been the goal all along.

Car on Newbury Street in Boston, Massachusetts automatically identifies pedestrians, cars, cyclists and trucks in the scene. Recognition is done in real-time. This is how a self-driving car can see the world. (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail January 18, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Neurala, the software company that has invented The Neurala Brain, a deep learning neural networks platform that is making smart products like toys, cameras and self-driving cars more autonomous, interactive and useful, today announced the closing of a $14 million series A funding round. The round was led by Pelion Venture Partners, with participation from Sherpa Capital, Motorola Solutions Venture Capital, 360 Capital Partners, Draper Associates Investments, SK Ventures, and Idinvest Partners through its Electranova Capital II Fund and in partnership with Ecomobility Ventures. Both 360 Capital Partners and Draper Associates also provided seed funding. Neurala will use the capital to accelerate servicing of its rapidly increasing customer demand, as well as to revolutionize additional application areas by adding built-in intelligence and autonomous behavior. “The Neurala Brain was designed from the beginning to transform industries,” said Massimiliano “Max” Versace, co-founder and CEO of Neurala. “Bio-inspired brainpower can be built right into drones, cars, toys, cameras, and other devices found in the home so that they can learn, see and act. This is essential for applications like drones and self-driving cars, where reaction time is critical and where you can’t always get fast network access. It’s also an endearing capability when built into toys that recognize their young owners by sight and give them a smile without communicating with a server.” Neurala pioneered the development of deep learning neural network software for NASA to use in planetary exploration, where processing power, battery life and communications are limited. Instead of designing deep learning neural networks for super computers, as other companies do, The Neurala Brain was designed to work where the decisions need to be made. Today, Neurala has customers deploying a broad range of applications, including autonomous drones and cars. Customers include Teal Drones, Parrot and multiple members of the Fortune Global 500. Neurala is currently working with Motorola Solutions on new applications of video, image and audio analytics for public safety. Neurala’s neural network software uses a bio-inspired approach to mimic the way the human brain learns and analyzes its environment. This software enables a variety of smart products—from self-driving cars and industrial drones to toys, consumer electronics and smart cameras—to learn, adapt and interact in real time. With The Neurala Brain, toys can learn to identify their owners, security cameras can identify specific threats, drones can “learn” how to diagnose problems at the tops of cell towers, saving humans considerable danger and drudgery, and self-driving cars can be safer and learn to avoid obstacles. One significant differentiator of Neurala’s deep learning software is that it scales from embedded hardware to powerful servers. Neurala calls this an “Anywhere Brain.” By operating “on the edge” and locally on the device, toys can entertain without communicating personal information to a third party, and applications like self-driving cars need not rely on the internet—which can be slow or unavailable—to avoid accidents. Neurala’s software development kit (SDK) supports industry-standard NVIDIA, ARM and Intel processors, so teams can develop for the processor that is best for their product instead of being forced to select a high-priced proprietary processor. “Motorola Solutions is constantly seeking ways to accelerate technology innovation for our public safety and commercial customers, who work in demanding and often dangerous environments," said Paul Steinberg, Chief Technology Officer, Motorola Solutions. “Neurala brings advanced deep learning capabilities that will enable us to further explore the potential of artificial intelligence to augment our customers' experiences 'at the edge.' This has the power to do things like help police find a missing person faster or guide a field worker's maintenance activities by turning their body -worn camera into a sensor that can recognize actionable information in video and images—in real time at the edge." “Almost every application on earth can benefit from becoming smarter,” said Tim Draper, well-known venture capitalist and founder of Draper Associates. “Neurala is the only platform that enables products to see and react in their worlds, with fast, local, real-time learning. It’s already driving innovative new intelligent hardware applications even as it makes current ones more efficient, with greater financial feasibility.” “Pelion is a firm that believes in a future in which automobiles, robots, drones and other mobile hardware devices will need to navigate the world autonomously and safely, and we believe that Neurala has the right solution to enable that future,” said Senior Associate Ben Lambert of Pelion Venture Partners. “Neurala's executives have a deep technology background and have been leading development efforts in this industry since 2006. As a result, the company is far ahead of its competitors and is at the forefront of the deep learning and computer vision space.” "Neurala technology is already achieving great traction in Europe. We will be able to help the company’s founders build upon that momentum to accelerate growth,” said Idinvest Director Julien Mialaret. “Our fund sponsors have ideas for ways to deploy Neurala's exciting technology."

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Now we know what Microsoft’s upcoming ‘Game Mode’ for Windows 10 will do [Updated] Now we know what Microsoft’s upcoming ‘Game Mode’ for Windows 10 will do [Updated] By Joel Hruska on January 18, 2017 at 7:36 am Comment Update: 1/25/2017: An earlier version of this story mistakenly reported that Game Mode’s performance improvements would be limited to adjustments of the Windows 10 game DVR option. While the upcoming Creators Update may include the option to disable the DVR, as we originally reported, that’s not the primary purpose of the new Game Mode or an accurate discussion of its feature set. A new story at Ars Technica details what Game Mode will and will not do, and notes that this update will emphasize consistently, as opposed to automatically driving frame rates up. This is a critical point that will benefit all gamers — while PC players tend to look down their noses at anything below 60 FPS, I’ll take a rock-solid 30 FPS over a title that varies from 30 – 60 FPS, provided the variations are significant. Consistent frame rates are an area where Nvidia cards have classically had advantages over their AMD counterparts, though this gap has been reduced in recent years by a combination of better drivers from AMD and the advent of DX12 and Vulkan. Game Mode will supposedly direct the OS to bias CPU and GPU resource allocation towards whatever game is running, though it’s not clear how much under-the-hood performance is really available to Microsoft for tweaking. A number of websites performed Windows 7 versus 8.1 versus Windows 10 game evaluations, and no one turned up any sign that Windows 10 was slower than previous iterations of the operating system, even when checking minimum frame rates and frame times. That’s not to say Microsoft can’t find a few more knobs and dials to tweak, but I still wonder if this isn’t mostly about cleaning up corner cases. Kevin Gammill, the partner group program manager for Xbox One, told Ars Technica he expected the overall gains from Game Mode to be in the 2-5% range. Generally speaking, you need a higher frame rate jump than that for people to reliably tell the difference between the old rate and the new one in back-to-back runs. Image by PCGamesN Microsoft is still being silent about what, exactly, Game Mode entails, only saying that it relates to background process and affinity settings to dedicate more resources to console titles. It will work with both UWP and Win32 applications, but we’ll have to wait until the Creators Update drops to find out which titles it particularly effects, or whether the benefits are greatest on systems with lower core counts. I still think that could wind up being the case, since any system with quad-cores + Hyper-Threading likely has more CPU resources available than are being used by any single game title. Pentium and Core i3-class equipment would seem to be the most likely to benefit from these improvements, but that’s speculation at this point. Gammill did say that UWP devices would likely see better numbers from the new mode, since Win32 apps can spawn multiple processes in ways that UWP applications can’t. This makes it easier to optimize for the UWP use-case scenario. The Creators Update of Windows 10 will ship with a whitelist of enabled titles; Game Mode will be something you can enable via Win-G, as shown above. We stand by our earlier observation as well. One feature we’d very much like to see Microsoft offer is a Game Mode that prevented Windows Update from rebooting the computer while resource-intensive applications or games are running. If you’ve ever had a Windows 10 system suddenly decide it’s time for a reboot in the middle of a game or benchmark run (and I’ve seen multiple testbeds pull this trick with zero warning), you know how infuriating it can be. Fix that problem, and you’ve got a Game Mode worth deploying.

Photo: REUTERS/Mike Blake Telecommunications equipment company Qualcomm has hit back at the Federal Trade Commission after the latter filed a lawsuit against it on Tuesday. FTC had questioned the company’s patent royalty practices and also accused it of engaging in anticompetitive tactics to ensure its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The civil lawsuit filed by the FTC in a District Court in Northern California said that the San Diego-based chipmaker forced Apple to exclusively use its chips for iPhones. The commission alleged that Qualcomm blocked out competitors such as Intel by forcing the tech giant to sign an exclusivity agreement from 2011 until 2016. Following the lawsuit, Qualcomm's shares dropped 5.6 percent on Tuesday, before closing down 4 percent at $64.19, according to Bloomberg. Fending off the allegations, Qualcomm said it has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. “This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint on the eve of Chairwoman Ramirez’s departure and the transition to a new administration, which reflects a sharp break from FTC practice,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel, reportedly said. Qualcomm also released a statement saying: “The FTC’s allegation to the contrary -- the central thesis of the complaint -- is wrong. ... Qualcomm believes the complaint is based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry. The complaint seeks to advance the interests and bargaining power of companies that have generated billions in profit from sales of products made possible by the fundamental 3G and 4G cellular technology developed by innovators like Qualcomm." Related Stories FTC: Qualcomm Made Apple Use Its Products South Korea Fines Qualcomm Over $850M Maureen Ohlhausen, an FTC commissioner who dissented with the agency’s suit, also criticized the decision to file the lawsuit. "The complaint fails to allege that Qualcomm charges more than a reasonable royalty…That pleading failure is no accident; it speaks to the dearth of evidence in this case," Ohlhausen said in a statement, according to Bloomberg. FTC claimed that Qualcomm was able to “force” Apple through “billions” in rebates but if Apple breached its agreement and sourced its chips from a rival supplier, it would lose out on the huge Qualcomm rebate payments. “Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors,” FTC said in the suit. Qualcomm owns numerous essential patents in the CDMA (code division multiple access) and LTE (long-term evolution) mobile standards, and charges mobile companies and other chipmakers royalties for using them. The company is also being investigated in Europe, Japan and Taiwan. Just last month, South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Fair Trade Commission, fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won (almost $853 million).

GE unveiled new findings on how companies are using digital applications across their industrial operations to unlock productivity and lower their environmental impact, at the World Future Energy Summit 2017 at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Center. In a recently released report, GE and co-author Intel offer a comprehensive view of how the Industrial Internet - embedded sensors, data analytics and connected platforms-  are helping companies increase their productivity and reducing environmental emissions to securing a cleaner and more competitive future. “We are working closely with our partners in the region, such as Masdar, Saudi Aramco, and RasGas, among others, some of the first adopters of digital solutions, to support regional economies in achieving their energy and economic diversification goals. This is part of a larger movement that includes both large companies, and start-ups, from across the industrial and tech sectors, working together on innovation and implementation to realize the dramatic economic and environmental potential of digital efficiency,” said Deb Frodl, global executive director of GE Ecomagination. The key economic and environmental impact of digitization were identified as: •    Power - $14 billion in cost savings annually and a potential reduction in global carbon by 495 Mt/year •    Lighting – $30 billion in saving, and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction •    Aviation- $14 billion in annual saving and 45 MT/year in carbon reduction •    Railway – $3 billion in saving and 19MT/year in carbon reduction •    Ground transportation – $20 billion in saving and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction GE has been working with its partners on digital industrial technologies that help achieve enhanced productivity, efficiency and asset optimization. For example, RasGas Company Limited (RasGas), one of the world’s largest and pioneering producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is marking the first global deployment of Industrial Internet technologies in the LNG sector. In the UAE, Masdar is working with GE to pilot and commercialize sustainable energy-neutral advanced wastewater treatment solutions in the MenaT region, and co-develop Industrial Internet solutions to optimize efficiencies. GE is also working with Masdar to launch a co-leadership training program for women to drive innovation and talent development in the renewable energy sector. In aviation, GE Aviation and Dubai’s Museum of the Future have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to accelerate innovation and advanced technology around the world. In Saudi Arabia, GE has announced several new digital industrial partnerships, technologies and initiatives. The GE Saudi Technology & Innovation Center (GE STIC) in Dhahran Techno Valley is at the heart of the company’s ‘Industrial Internet’ roadmap to drive digital transformation of industry. GE Oil & Gas Digital is introducing its first Asset Performance Management (APM) solution to reside on Saudi Aramco’s business network for the Aramco Jazan Complex Integrated Manufacturing Operations Management System (IMOMS). Saudi Electricity Company has joined hands with GE, and established a Generation & Optimization Center (GOC), a state-of-the-art center equipped with hardware and software to monitor 16 SEC power plants. In lighting, Current, which brings together capabilities from GE’s LED, solar, energy storage, and electric vehicle businesses, is enabling its partners in Mena to tap into a wide variety of GE offerings and optimize their energy needs across their entire operation. GE’s Industrial Internet operating system, Predix, is playing a pivotal role in providing a foundation for a range of digital solutions that improve energy and water efficiency across aviation, railways, ground transportation, manufacturing facilities, power plants and buildings. The report draws on the experience of GE’s Ecomagination business strategy to deploy sustainable solutions that provide economic and environmental outcomes. Contributions to the white paper also came from the GE Ecomagination Innovation Center in Masdar City, where GE’s professionals work with UAE-based researchers and industry experts to identify sustainable solutions for today’s pressing challenges.  – TradeArabia News Service Tags: GE | World Future Energy Summit | Fuel costs | Ecomagination | Digital solutions | More Energy, Oil & Gas Stories GE secures $1.4bn power plant orders in Iraq Oman’s Khazzan gas project eyes production by Q4 OMV, Dana Energy in deal over Iran projects $255m Morocco wind farm to set up 60 turbines Dewa launches substation at Dubai Design District Saudi Aramco picks US firms to audit oil reserves Aramco showcases clean tech at ADSW Dewa moves up on happiness index Saudi Arabia terminates Samsung's power plant deal AbdulKhaliq Al Ameri to lead Taqa Iraq operations Dewa backs UAE University on PV panel research Engie backs Emirates Electric Vehicle Road Trip Empower completes key phase of Jumeirah project Adnoc Xpress station concept unveiled in Abu Dhabi UAE, India sign strategic oil storage deal 13 industry leaders launch new Hydrogen Council UAE Energy Plan 2050 to attract sustainable investments Abraaj buys key stake in Pakistan wind power project Saudi Aramco taps banking giants for world's biggest IPO NPCC wins Aramco contract for 17 jackets Emerson opens manufacturing facility in Dammam Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week breaks records Dewa invites proposals for 200 MW solar plant Recruitment firm Petroplan expands into Oman ABB’s rooftop solar plant in Dubai inaugurated UAE agency issues licences for ‘fresh’ nuclear fuel transport Solar panel factory opened in Bahrain Bapco to focus on energy and environmental protection at GIF Masdar in Abu Dhabi sewerage tunnel partnership Bentley Systems, AGI launch Cesium Consortium Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds
Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Legal Image Source: DENIS POROY/AP/REX/Shutterstock FTC alleges Qualcomm forced Apple into iPhone LTE chip deals Chris Smith @chris_writes January 18th, 2017 at 7:15 AM Share Tweet The Federal Trade Commission has reason to believe that Qualcomm abused its position in the broadband chip manufacturing business to obtain an advantage illegally. The chip maker is said to have forced smartphone makers to agree to anti-competitive business arrangements that prevented them from using modems from Qualcomm’s competitors. Apple is one of the high-profile Qualcomm partners that was allegedly forced to enter into an exclusive agreement for modem chips, which prevented Apple from using any other chips for several years. Only last year, Apple added a second LTE provider to its iPhone supply — that’s Intel, one of Qualcomm’s main rivals, and a company that has been vying for Apple’s business for years. Don't Miss: The Galaxy S8 might lose the fight against the iPhone before it even launches In its complaint, the FTC explains that Qualcomm doesn’t only make the modem chips it sells to phone makers, but it also holds many patents critical for these components. Some of these patents were declared essential to industry standards that enable cellular connectivity. Qualcomm should license those patents on “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory, or ‘FRAND,’ terms,” but the chipmaker failed to do so. “According to the complaint, by threatening to disrupt cell phone manufacturers’ supply of baseband processors, Qualcomm obtains elevated royalties and other license terms for its standard-essential patents that manufacturers would otherwise reject,” the FTC wrote. “These royalties amount to a tax on the manufacturers’ use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm’s competitors, a tax that excludes these competitors and harms competition. Increased costs imposed by this tax are passed on to consumers, the complaint alleges.” Qualcomm reportedly practices a “no license, no chip” policy. That means smartphone makers who chose modems from other companies have to pay higher royalties. “According to the Commission’s complaint, this is an anticompetitive tax on the use of rivals’ processors. ‘No license, no chips’ is a condition that other suppliers of semiconductor devices do not impose,” the commission said. “The risk of losing access to Qualcomm baseband processors is too great for a cell phone manufacturer to bear because it would preclude the manufacturer from selling phones for use on important cellular networks.” Apple is one of Qualcomm’s most important customers, the complaint explained, which is why the company forced an exclusivity deal. “Qualcomm precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016,” the complaint notes. “Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors.” Apple’s deal with Qualcomm included “substantial incentive payments.” “In all, Qualcomm’s 2011 and 2013 agreements with Apple provided for billions of dollars in conditional rebates from Qualcomm to Apple,” the complaint says. The conditions included “not using a competitive wireless technology backed by Intel, agreeing not to sue Qualcomm over royalties, and using Qualcomm chips in forthcoming iPhones and iPads,” according to Business Insider. Qualcomm, meanwhile, denied the antitrust accusations. The company said, “the complaint is based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry.” “Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC’s allegation to the contrary — the central thesis of the complaint — is wrong.” This isn’t the first antitrust fight for Qualcomm. The company was fined almost $2 billion in Asia — $975 million in China (2015) and $853 million in South Korea ($853).

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe Cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure and the theft of millions of records containing personally identifiable information have indicated that there are serious vulnerabilities in United States’ national cybersecurity approach.  Cybersecurity encompasses the actions taken to protect against criminal access or unauthorized use of electronic data, as well as the measures taken to thwart cyber exploits.  To function properly, this ecosystem requires effective processes, technologies, and enabled people. In spite of many powerful innovations to make us more cyber secure, both governmental and private sector actors have failed to address the glaring talent gap in this field.  There is a worrisome shortage of individuals with the skills and experience needed to protect our country against the asymmetrical threats we face. According to the agency charged with tallying statistics on the cyber talent gap, there are over 1 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs right now.  It is projected that this number will grow to 1.5 million by 2020.  It is clear that we are not matching the capacity of the growing legions of cybercriminals with our own increased number U.S. experts who serve as our most important line of defense against them. We would not tolerate a projected 1.5-million-person deficit in our law enforcement or military ranks.  Would should we accept such a shortage in our cyber defense force? As the new administration enters the fray, the next recalculation should not be how to expand the $175 billion cybersecurity market.  The focus should include practical strategies for assuring there are enough cybersecurity professionals to make the nation resilient.  Enabled people are key to unlocking new opportunities that make the existing tools and processes more effective.  If all existing best practices were employed we would eliminate 80% of all cyber breeches. The costs of failing to act to address this issue are high.  It’s not an exaggeration to say that the health of our economy and democracy is at stake. Intel recently released a survey stating the cybersecurity skills shortage is worse than talent deficits in other IT professions.  The results confirmed what we knew - 82 percent of IT professionals see a shortfall in the cybersecurity workforce, while 71 percent of respondents thought there was a direct correlation between the skills gap, and “measurable damage” to their organizations. Skilled hackers can gain access to databases and make data changes to records  or evidence, compromising the integrity of our health and criminal justice systems.  Remember, many of the fundamental aspects of democracy depend on confidence in systems like “chain of custody”. Concerns voiced about the legitimacy of the recent presidential election should magnify how we should be looking at the potential consequences from cyber exploitation. The Department of Homeland Security, working with the National Institute for Standards and Technology, has shared educational products and workforce development tools through their National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies portal.  The Office of Personnel Management administers a program called Scholarship for Service where participating students on a computer security related career path can get free tuition and an annual stipend. These students pay it back after they graduate by working the representative school years as federal employees. However, the government has not created effective pathways to employment in the cybersecurity field for Opportunity Youth, the 6 million young adults in the United States who are out of school and unemployed or underemployed.  Current approaches to addressing this talent gap fail to provide onramps for those, who often lack the resources, credential, and networks to take advantage of opportunities in this dynamic field.  Without a doubt, we must integrate these overlooked young people as a part of the solution; they are this country’s most tangible cybersecurity assets.  We need to invest in them and can no longer waste time diminishing their value. Effective models for identifying high-potential young adults and preparing them for success in professional jobs exist. Year Up, for example, is a national nonprofit organization that provides marketable skills training, mentoring, and a six-month internship experience to empower opportunity youth to fulfill their career goals. Programs like Year Up are gaining traction as employers come around to the idea of tapping into previously overlooked talent pools and to the practice of considering professional competency-based certifications as an alternative to college degrees. Our sector should support the expansion of such solutions to bring a new generation of driven, talented individuals to the daily cybersecurity fight and help the nation meet its growing skills shortfall. Of the cybersecurity issue, President Obama said, “It's one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.  Foreign governments, criminals, and hackers probe America’s computer networks every single day.” It’s time for us to rise to this call. A solution that introduces youth to cybersecurity and provides them with real work-based experiences can both expand opportunity for our country’s young people and keep our nation safe from the cybersecurity threats of today and tomorrow.

But two years ago, this startup wasn’t based in Montreal, and it had nothing to do with deep learning. Which just goes to show: striking it big in the world of tech is all about being in the right place at the right time with the right idea. Sam Pasupalak and Kaheer Suleman founded Maluuba in 2011 as students at the University of Waterloo, about 400 miles from Montreal. The company’s name is an insider’s nod to one of their undergraduate computer science classes. From an office in Waterloo, they started building something like Siri, the digital assistant that would soon arrive on the iPhone, and they built it in much the same way Apple built the original, using techniques that had driven the development of conversational computing for years—techniques that require extremely slow and meticulous work, where engineers construct AI one tiny piece at a time. But as they toiled away in Waterloo, companies like Google and Facebook embraced deep neural networks, and this technology reinvented everything from image recognition to machine translations, rapidly learning these tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Soon, Pasupalak and Suleman realized they should change tack.

Just thirteen months later, after growing to a mere 50 employees, the company sold itself to Microsoft. And that’s not an unusual story. The giants of tech are buying up deep learning startups almost as quickly as they’re created. At the end of December, Uber acquired Geometric Logic, a two-year old AI startup spanning fifteen academic researchers that offered no product and no published research. The previous summer, Twitter paid a reported $150 million for Magic Pony, a two-year-old deep learning startup based in the UK. And in recent months, similarly small, similarly young deep learning companies have disappeared into the likes of General Electric, Salesforce, and Apple. Microsoft did not disclose how much it paid for Maluuba, but some of these deep learning acquisitions have reached hefty sums, including Intel’s $400 million purchase of Nervana and Google’s $650 million acquisition of DeepMind, the British AI lab that made headlines last spring when it cracked the ancient game of Go, a feat experts didn’t expect for another decade. At the same time, Microsoft’s buy is a little different than the rest. Maluuba is a deep learning company that focuses on natural language understanding, the ability to not just recognize the words that come out of our mouths but actually understand them and respond in kind—the breed of AI needed to build a good chatbot. Now that deep learning has proven so effective with speech recognition, image recognition, and translation, natural language is the next frontier. “In the past, people had to build large lexicons, dictionaries, ontologies,” Suleman says. “But with neural nets, we no longer need to do that. A neural net can learn from raw data.” The acquisition is part of an industry-wide race towards digital assistants and chatbots that can converse like a human. Yes, we already have digital assistants like Microsoft Cortana, the Google Search Assistant, Facebook M, and Amazon Alexa. And chatbots are everywhere. But none of these services know how to chat (a particular problem for the chatbots). So, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon are now looking at deep learning as a way of improving the state of the art. Two summers ago, Google published a research paper describing a chatbot underpinned by deep learning that could debate the meaning of life (in a way). Around the same time, Facebook described an experimental system that could read a shortened form of The Lord of the Rings and answer questions about the Tolkien trilogy. Amazon is gathering data for similar work. And, none too surprisingly, Microsoft is gobbling up a startup that only just moved into the same field. Winning the Game Deep neural networks are complex mathematical systems that learn to perform discrete tasks by recognizing patterns in vast amounts of digital data. Feed millions of photos into a neural network, for instance, and it can learn to identify objects and people in photos. Pairing these systems with the enormous amounts of computing power inside their data centers, companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have pushed artificial intelligence far further, far more quickly, than they ever could in the past. Now, these companies hope to reinvent natural language understanding in much the same way. But there are big caveats: It’s a much harder task, and the work has only just begun. “Natural language is an area where more research needs to be done in terms of research, even basic research,” says University of Montreal professor Yoshua Bengio, one of the founding fathers of the deep learning movement and an advisor to Maluuba. Related Video President Barack Obama on What AI Means for National Security Part of the problem is that researchers don’t yet have the data needed to train neural networks for true conversation, and Maluuba is among those working to fill the void. Like Facebook and Amazon, it’s building brand new datasets for training natural language models: One involves questions and answers, and the other focuses on conversational dialogue. What’s more, the company is sharing this data with the larger community of researchers and encouraging then\m to share their own—a common strategy that seeks to accelerate the progress of AI research. But even with adequate data, the task is quite different from image recognition or translation. Natural language isn’t necessarily something that neural networks can solve on their own. Dialogue isn’t a single task. It’s a series of tasks, each building on the one before. A neural network can’t just identify a pattern in a single piece of data. It must somehow identify patterns across an endless stream of data—and a keep a “memory” of this stream. That’s why Maluuba is exploring AI beyond neural networks, including a technique called reinforcement learning. With reinforcement learning, a system repeats the same task over and over again, while carefully keeping tabs on what works and what doesn’t. Engineers at Google’s DeepMind lab used this method in building AlphaGo, the system that topped Korean grandmaster Lee Sedol at the ancient game of Go. In essence, the machine learned to play Go at a higher level than any human by playing game after game against itself, tracking which moves won the most territory on the board. In similar fashion, reinforcement learning can help machines learn to carry on a conversation. Like a game, Bengio says, dialogue is interactive. It’s a back and forth. For Microsoft, winning the game of conversation means winning an enormous market. Natural language could streamline practically any computer interface. With this in mind, the company is already building an army of chatbots, but so far, the results are mixed. In China, the company says, its Xiaoice chatbot has been used by 40 million people. But when it first unleashed a similar bot in the US, the service was coaxed into spewing racism, and the replacement is flawed in so many other ways. That’s why Microsoft acquired Maluuba. The startup was in the right place at the right time. And it may carry the right idea. Go Back to Top.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     MacBook Expected To Ship 15 Million Units This Year Posted: Jan 18 2017, 5:23am CST | by Shane McGlaun, in News | Apple     Power savings in new Kaby Lake platform is expected to spur upgrades by current MacBook users Yesterday we talked a bit about the Intel Kaby Lake processor upgrade that Apple is expected to make to the MacBook Pro this year. That story also mentions that analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expected growth in MacBook sales for 2017. Today another market report has landed from Chinese publication Economic Daily News. The report predicts that supply chain partners like Quanta Computer, Shin Zu Shing (SZS), Auras, and Wistron will see growth thanks to an uptick in shipments of MacBook computers for 2017. Don't Miss: Super Bowl 2017 Commercials & Advertisers The letter predicts that shipments are expected to grow 10% on year for 2017 to reach 15 million units for the year on demand for new MacBook Pro products. The report expects demand for the Kaby Lake machines to increase later in 2017. Thanks to the low power consumption of the Kaby Lake MacBook Pros, the new machines are expected to trigger a significant amount of upgrades from current MacBook users. The publication also predicts that Apple will reduce the price for the 13-inch MacBook Pro without the OLED touch Bar to increase shipments and use the device to replace the 13-inch MacBook Air. Apple is expected to launch a new 12-inch MacBook in early Q2 with 16GB memory option. Kaby Lake machines in 13 and 15-inch sizes are expected to begin production in early Q3. Mass production for the 15-inch MacBook Pro with 32GB of RAM isn't expected to start until early Q4.

World 09:20, 18 January 2017 REUTERS The decision -- which a senior defense official told CNN was made over the objections of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter -- immediately touched off a controversy in the closing days of the Obama administration. A former intelligence official described being "shocked" to learn of Obama's decision, adding that the "entire intelligence community is deflated by this inexplicable use of executive power." The official said the move was "deeply hypocritical given Obama's denunciation of WikiLeaks' role in the hacking of the (Democratic National Committee)." Read alsoCNN: Intel report says U.S. identifies go-betweens who gave emails to WikiLeaksA presidential commutation reduces the sentence being served but it does not change the fact of conviction, whereas a pardon forgives a certain criminal offense. Manning, a transgender woman, was serving a 35-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth, an all-male Army prison in eastern Kansas, despite her request to transfer to a civilian prison. A White House statement on Tuesday said her prison sentence is set to expire on May 17. Read alsoAssange: Some leaks may have been RussianThe material, which WikiLeaks published in 2010, included a classified video of a U.S. helicopter attacking civilians and journalists in Iraq in 2007. Labeled "Collateral Murder," the film drew criticism from human rights activists for the deaths of innocent people. Though found guilty on 20 out of 22 possible charges (including violating the US Espionage Act), Manning was not convicted of the most serious one; aiding the enemy, which could have earned the private a life sentence. Instead, the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to prison, as well as demoted from private first class to private and dishonorably discharged.

The company said it made quarterly net income of 524 million euros ($560 million), up from 292 million euros in the same period of 2015 and beating analysts' average forecast of 414 million in a Reuters poll. The bullish outlook for the newest lithography systems is crucial, as they must become widely adopted for ASML to continue dominating the market and reach a goal of 11 billion euros in annual sales by 2020. "2016 was the year where we definitely turned the corner," CEO Peter Wennink said. "You can see it in our order book." The company reported 1.58 billion euros worth of new orders in the fourth quarter, including six of the new EUV lithography machines, which cost around 100 million euros apiece and take a year to build and install. Customers Intel, Samsung and foundry TSMC all helped fund development of the EUV technology. The name stands for "Extreme Ultraviolet", the wavelength of the energy beams the systems use to help create the circuitry of cutting-edge semiconductors. ASML's overall order backlog grew to 3.96 billion euros at the end of 2016, up from 3.46 billion at the end of the third quarter, and includes 18 EUV systems in all. The company currently has capacity to build 12 EUV machines annually, expanding to 24 by 2018. That "means for 2017, we are virtually sold out" of EUV machines," Wennink said. "It also means that our first orders for 2018 shipments (are) already in." He said given public statements by chipmakers, he expected significant new capacity to come on line in late 2018 and early 2019. "Looking at that load introduction time, it is very realistic to assume by 2018 that we will use our entire capacity to make (EUV) tools for our customers," he said. ASML shares are up nearly 50 percent over the past year, as investors gained confidence in the technology. Some analysts see expectations for the company as stretched - the stock price is 34 times its previous 12 month earnings - and shares tend to react violently to any hint that chipmakers are accelerating or slowing spending on new capacity. ASML reported fourth-quarter sales of 1.91 billion euros, and forecast sales at 1.8 billion for the first quarter of 2017.

In a recently released report, GE and co-author Intel offer a comprehensive view of how the Industrial Internet – embedded sensors, data analytics and connected platforms- are helping companies increase their productivity and reducing environmental emissions to securing a cleaner and more competitive future. “We are working closely with our partners in the region, such as Masdar, Saudi Aramco, and RasGas, among others, some of the first adopters of digital solutions, to support regional economies in achieving their energy and economic diversification goals. This is part of a larger movement that includes both large companies, and start-ups, from across the industrial and tech sectors, working together on innovation and implementation to realize the dramatic economic and environmental potential of digital efficiency,” said Deb Frodl, Global Executive Director of GE Ecomagination. Overarching report findings on digital efficiency: Emerging digital solutions applied across industry can potentially save $81 billion in fuel costs annually and close the gap to reaching the COP21 goals by 30 per cent or 823 MT of carbon emissions per year, the equivalent of taking 174 million cars off the road. The key economic and environmental impact of digitization were identified as: Advertisement • Power – $14 billion in cost savings annually and a potential reduction in global carbon by 495 Mt/year • Lighting – $30 billion in saving, and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction • Aviation- $14 billion in annual saving and 45 MT/year in carbon reduction • Railway – $3 billion in saving and 19MT/year in carbon reduction • Ground transportation – $20 billion in saving and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction GE has been working with its partners on digital industrial technologies that help achieve enhanced productivity, efficiency and asset optimization. For example, RasGas Company Limited (RasGas), one of the world’s largest and pioneering producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is marking the first global deployment of Industrial Internet technologies in the LNG sector. In the UAE, Masdar is working with GE to pilot and commercialize sustainable energy-neutral advanced wastewater treatment solutions in the MENAT region, and co-develop Industrial Internet solutions to optimize efficiencies. GE is also working with Masdar to launch a co-leadership training program for women to drive innovation and talent development in the renewable energy sector. In aviation, GE Aviation and Dubai’s Museum of the Future have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to accelerate innovation and advanced technology around the world. In Saudi Arabia, GE has announced several new digital industrial partnerships, technologies and initiatives. The GE Saudi Technology & Innovation Center (GE STIC) in Dhahran Techno Valley is at the heart of the company’s ‘Industrial Internet’ roadmap to drive digital transformation of industry. GE Oil & Gas Digital is introducing its first Asset Performance Management (APM) solution to reside on Saudi Aramco’s business network for the Aramco Jazan Complex Integrated Manufacturing Operations Management System (IMOMS). Saudi Electricity Company has joined hands with GE, and established a Generation & Optimization Center (GOC), a state-of-the-art center equipped with hardware and software to monitor 16 SEC power plants. In lighting, Current, which brings together capabilities from GE’s LED, Solar, Energy Storage, and electric vehicle businesses, is enabling its partners in MENA to tap into a wide variety of GE offerings and optimize their energy needs across their entire operation. GE’s Industrial Internet operating system, Predix, is playing a pivotal role in providing a foundation for a range of digital solutions that improve energy and water efficiency across aviation, railways, ground transportation, manufacturing facilities, power plants and buildings. © The Saudi Gazette 2017 © Copyright Zawya.

Quadrupled in 2016 Investors are betting that AMD becomes competitive in both of its core markets after years of terrible results. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Jan 17, 2017 at 7:00PM Image source: AMD. What happened Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 295% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. A return to revenue growth, a series of deals that bolstered the balance sheet, the launch of its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and optimism regarding new CPUs and GPUs set to launch in the coming months drove the stock higher. So what AMD entered 2016 in rough shape. Revenue in 2015 slumped 28%, leading to a net loss of more than $400 million. Cash was dwindling, approaching the lower limit of the company's target range. On top of all that, AMD's core CPU and GPU products were largely not competitive with those of Intel or NVIDIA. AMD took a few steps in 2016 to raise cash, giving it some much-needed breathing room that boosted investor confidence in a turnaround. A deal to create a joint venture in China around the company's x86 server technology raised $293 million in licensing fees, with the potential for royalties on sales of chips. More cash was raised later in the year when AMD sold new common stock and convertible notes, further bolstering the balance sheet. Data by YCharts. AMD returned to year-over-year revenue growth during the second quarter and posted even stronger growth during the third quarter. The launch of the Polaris mainstream graphics cards lifted the computing and graphics segment, while strong demand for semi-custom game console chips drove growth in the semi-custom segment. Polaris hasn't been as big of a success as NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, at least according to Steam's hardware and software survey numbers, but it did help return the company to growth. AMD revealed some information about Ryzen, its upcoming CPU, and Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, last year, adding fuel to the fire. The market is betting that AMD will become competitive in both the high-end CPU and GPU markets when those products launch during the first half of 2017. Now what There's no question that AMD is in a stronger position than it was at the end of 2015. The top line and balance sheet are looking stronger, and Ryzen and Vega have the potential to return the company to profitability. But investors should not forget AMD's long history of over-promising and under-delivering. The Bulldozer family of CPUs launched in 2011 turned out to be a complete disaster for the company. The Fury line of high-end GPUs launched in 2015 didn't even move the needle despite AMD hyping up its use of high-bandwidth memory. And Polaris, while producing some growth for the company, has been completely overshadowed by NVIDIA's Pascal. 2017 may be different. Based on what AMD has said so far, both Ryzen and Vega have some serious potential. But if either product comes up short of expectations, the stock's impressive gains from last year could quickly vanish. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The company used its dominance in baseband processors, which manage cellular communication in mobile devices, to force vendors to pay elevated royalties for Qualcomm technologies, the FTC charged in a complaint filed Tuesday in federal court. At the same time, Qualcomm gave Apple favorable terms so it could supply the baseband chips for all iPhones from 2011 to 2016, according to the FTC. Among other things, in 2007 it got Apple to agree not to use WiMax, the original 4G system used on Sprint’s network, in any iPhones, the complaint said. WiMax was promoted by Intel, Qualcomm’s archrival. Qualcomm’s actions hurt competition and effectively imposed a tax on some products that was passed on to consumers, the FTC said. It’s seeking a court order to undo and prevent the company’s allegedly anticompetitive practices. In a statement, Qualcomm said the complaint was based on a flawed legal theory and inadequate evidence. “Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms,” the statement said. The company said the FTC rushed out the complaint before the new presidential administration takes office on Friday. Only three of the five seats on the commission are filled, and member Maureen Ohlhausen dissented from the complaint. Qualcomm has a vast portfolio of mobile technology patents, and licensing them is a big part of its business in addition to selling chips. Its licensing practices have come under fire before. Last month, South Korea’s antitrust agency fined the company $853 million for allegedly violating that country’s competition laws. By threatening to cut off phone makers’ supplies of baseband chips, Qualcomm got them to accept royalties and other license terms they wouldn’t otherwise have accepted, the FTC alleged. This weakened other baseband chip makers and raised costs for consumers, it said. In addition, the company has refused to license its patented technology to other chip makers even when those technologies were essential to industry standards, the FTC said. Standards groups commonly require patent holders to license anything that’s part of a standard on FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms. In her dissent, Commissioner Ohlhausen said the complaint never alleges that Qualcomm charged more than reasonable royalties because the commission lacked the evidence to say that.

Several Old DDX Drivers Got Updated For X.Org Server 1.19, Even Voodoo Graphics Written by Michael Larabel in X.Org on 17 January 2017 at 09:13 PM EST. 15 Comments X.Org Server 1.19 was released last November while today there was finally an X.Org developer giving some love to the older DDX drivers for those still with vintage GPUs and wanting to run the modern xorg-server. A number of the less common xf86-video DDX drivers hadn't seen new releases for "ABI 23" support as used by X.Org Server 1.19+ until Matt Turner took to getting the updates released today where as previously the ABI fixes were just residing in Git. The new DDX driver releases today include the xf86-video-tdfx 1.4.7, xf86-video-sis 0.10.9, xf86-video-mga 1.6.5, xf86-video-chips 1.2.7, xf86-video-siliconmotion 1.7.9, xf86-video-nv 2.1.21, xf86-video-glint 1.2.9, xf86-video-trident 1.3.8, xf86-video-sisusb 0.9.7, xf86-video-savage 2.3.9, xf86-video-i740 1.3.6, and xf86-video-r128 6.10.2 Aside from supporting the latest X.Org driver, some of these display drivers see some other small fixes too but none of the other changes appear really major. The change-logs for each driver can be found via xorg. There's even a few fixes to the dropped xf86-video-nv driver while generally the other updated drivers are much older, including for vintage SiS and Voodoo graphics hardware. If there's anything funny about these updates, these old drivers like 3dfx Voodoo and MGA were quicker to see a new driver release supporting this latest xorg-server video ABI quicker than there was for xf86-video-intel. The xf86-video-intel driver hasn't seen a new (development) release in two years since v2.99.917 and the last stable release was three years back, but if using xf86-video-intel Git there was the ABI 23 support last summer. We'll see how much longer some of these X.Org drivers continue to be haphazardly maintained... But hey, that's part of the beauty of open-source software. 15 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Quadrupled in 2016 Investors are betting that AMD becomes competitive in both of its core markets after years of terrible results. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Jan 17, 2017 at 7:00PM Image source: AMD. What happened Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 295% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. A return to revenue growth, a series of deals that bolstered the balance sheet, the launch of its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and optimism regarding new CPUs and GPUs set to launch in the coming months drove the stock higher. So what AMD entered 2016 in rough shape. Revenue in 2015 slumped 28%, leading to a net loss of more than $400 million. Cash was dwindling, approaching the lower limit of the company's target range. On top of all that, AMD's core CPU and GPU products were largely not competitive with those of Intel or NVIDIA. AMD took a few steps in 2016 to raise cash, giving it some much-needed breathing room that boosted investor confidence in a turnaround. A deal to create a joint venture in China around the company's x86 server technology raised $293 million in licensing fees, with the potential for royalties on sales of chips. More cash was raised later in the year when AMD sold new common stock and convertible notes, further bolstering the balance sheet. Data by YCharts. AMD returned to year-over-year revenue growth during the second quarter and posted even stronger growth during the third quarter. The launch of the Polaris mainstream graphics cards lifted the computing and graphics segment, while strong demand for semi-custom game console chips drove growth in the semi-custom segment. Polaris hasn't been as big of a success as NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, at least according to Steam's hardware and software survey numbers, but it did help return the company to growth. AMD revealed some information about Ryzen, its upcoming CPU, and Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, last year, adding fuel to the fire. The market is betting that AMD will become competitive in both the high-end CPU and GPU markets when those products launch during the first half of 2017. Now what There's no question that AMD is in a stronger position than it was at the end of 2015. The top line and balance sheet are looking stronger, and Ryzen and Vega have the potential to return the company to profitability. But investors should not forget AMD's long history of over-promising and under-delivering. The Bulldozer family of CPUs launched in 2011 turned out to be a complete disaster for the company. The Fury line of high-end GPUs launched in 2015 didn't even move the needle despite AMD hyping up its use of high-bandwidth memory. And Polaris, while producing some growth for the company, has been completely overshadowed by NVIDIA's Pascal. 2017 may be different. Based on what AMD has said so far, both Ryzen and Vega have some serious potential. But if either product comes up short of expectations, the stock's impressive gains from last year could quickly vanish. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Apple is expected to ship some 15 million laptops this year, or 10% more than last year. Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro is to “blame” for the increased interest in MacBooks. Additionally, Apple’s upcoming 2017 MacBook and MacBook Pro updates should also convince even more users to upgrade. Don't Miss: You can buy a handgun that looks like an iPhone, and cops are worried Citing Chinese-language site Economic Daily News, Digitimes says that demand is still rather high for the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. The laptop is set to get even better later this year, thanks to processor upgrades to Intel Kaby Lake and support of up to 32GB of RAM. Kaby Lake’s low power consumption is expected “to trigger a replacement trend among existing MacBook users,” according to market watchers. The 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar will be even cheaper, as Apple looks to increase overall shipments. The device will replace the 13-inch MacBook Air, the same market watchers claimed. Finally, the 12-inch MacBook is also set to receive an update early in the second quarter of the year. Apple will sell a version of the laptop that packs 16GB of RAM. The Kaby Lake-based 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros are expected to hit production early in the third quarter, while the 32GB 15-inch MacBook Pro will hit production a quarter later. These details, yet to be confirmed by Apple, are in line with the predictions of KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo.

Notably, a big part of the complaint alleges that Qualcomm extracted baseband processor exclusivity from Apple in exchange for partial royalty relief. The FTC reveals that Apple entered into agreements with Qualcomm in 2007, 2011, and 2013. In the 2007 agreement Qualcomm stipulated that Apple would not sell or license a smartphone that implemented WiMax, a rival technology to LTE. Under a 2007 agreement, Qualcomm agreed to rebate to Apple royalties that Qualcomm received from Apple’s contract manufacturers in excess of a specified per-handset cap. Qualcomm’s payment obligations were conditioned upon, among other things, Apple not selling or licensing a handset implementing the WiMax standard, a prospective fourth-generation cellular standard championed by Intel and opposed by Qualcomm. In subsequent agreements, Qualcomm conditioned royalty relief on Apple exclusively using their baseband processors. ----- Qualcomm and Apple entered into additional agreements in 2011 and 2013. Under these agreements, Qualcomm provided Apple large lump sum payments that constituted partial relief from Qualcomm royalties. Qualcomm conditioned this relief on Apple’s exclusive use of Qualcomm baseband processors in new iPhone and iPad models. Under Qualcomm’s 2011 agreement with Apple, Qualcomm agreed to make substantial incentive payments from 2011 through 2016, explicitly conditioned upon Apple using Qualcomm baseband processors exclusively in all new iPhone and iPad models. If, during this period, Apple launched a new handset with a non-Qualcomm baseband processor, it would forfeit all future payments and, depending on when a handset launched, could be required to refund past payments. Qualcomm’s 2013 agreements with Apple modified and extended the exclusivity arrangement set forth in the companies’ 2011 agreement. Under the 2013 agreements, Qualcomm agreed to rebate to Apple royalties that Qualcomm collected from Apple’s contract manufacturers in excess of modified per-handset caps. Qualcomm’s obligation to make these rebate payments was subject to, among other terms, a new condition—that Apple neither initiate nor induce others to initiate litigation claiming that Qualcomm had failed to offer a license on FRAND terms. Qualcomm also agreed to make substantial incentive payments in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, explicitly conditioned on Apple sourcing baseband processors for new iPad and iPhone models exclusively from Qualcomm. If, during this period, Apple launched a new handset with a non-Qualcomm baseband processor, it would forfeit all future incentive payments and, depending on when a handset launched, could be required to refund past incentive payments. ----- As a result of the terms in its agreements with Qualcomm, Apple sourced baseband processors exclusively from Qualcomm for all new iPad and iPhone products that it launched over the five-year period from October 2011 until September 2016. The new iPhone 7 uses baseband processors from Qualcomm and Intel. The FTC has charged Qualcomm with violating the FTC Act. The complaint alleges that Qualcomm: ● Maintains a “no license, no chips” policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm’s preferred license terms. The FTC alleges that this tactic forces cell phone manufacturers to pay elevated royalties to Qualcomm on products that use a competitor’s baseband processors. According to the Commission’s complaint, this is an anticompetitive tax on the use of rivals’ processors. “No license, no chips” is a condition that other suppliers of semiconductor devices do not impose. The risk of losing access to Qualcomm baseband processors is too great for a cell phone manufacturer to bear because it would preclude the manufacturer from selling phones for use on important cellular networks. ● Refuses to license standard-essential patents to competitors. Despite its commitment to license standard-essential patents on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has consistently refused to license those patents to competing suppliers of baseband processors. ● Extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties. Qualcomm precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors. The complaint was approved by a 2 to 1 vote. Notably, the dissenting vote was from Commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen who strongly opposes the complaint. "I have been presented with no robust economic evidence of exclusion and anticompetitive effects, either as to the complaint’s core “taxation” theory or to associated allegations like exclusive dealing", says Ohlhausen. "What I have been presented with is simply a possibility theorem." You can read Ohlhausen's full statement of dissent here. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

South Korea's Fair trade Commission accused Qualcomm of coercing mobile phone makers, including South Korea's Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics as well as Apple of U.S., to pay excessive licensing fees under unfair conditions set by the company.   The Korean FTC said that Samsung, LG, Apple, Intel, MediaTek, China's Huawei Technologies, and Ericsson of Sweden, participated in its investigation of Qualcomm.   Today Bloomberg reports on the U.S. Fair Trade Commission picking up the ball and filing a similar lawsuit against Qualcomm today accusing the biggest maker of mobile phone chips of illegally maintaining a monopoly over semiconductors used in cellphones and pocketing elevated royalties from customers.   Reportedly the filing notes that Qualcomm Inc. forced Apple Inc. to use its chips exclusively in return for lowering licensing fees, unfairly cutting out competitors, the U.S. said in a lawsuit against the semiconductor company.   The FTC further noted that Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm's competitors.   The lawsuit presents yet another regulatory challenge to Qualcomm's most lucrative business, technology licensing. The chipmaker gets most of its profits from selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems. Qualcomm has argued that its licensing follows industry standards that have been in place for more than 20 years and are used by other companies.   In February 2015 China's National Development and Reform Commission levied a fine of 6 billion yuan ($975 million) on Qualcomm for charging excessive royalties for its third- and fourth-generation telecommunication technology patents.

Twitter Facebook Oracle outlines plans to take on Amazon in cloud Bare metal servers, a focus on hosted databases and application development are keys Brandon Butler (Network World) 18 January, 2017 09:54 - - - - print email Comments Oracle executives today revealed the results of years’ worth of engineering and development efforts on its IaaS public cloud and announced a new bare metal cloud database service and an international geographic expansion. Oracle is typically not considered one of the top IaaS public cloud leaders, but the company has hopes of competing in the market by combining its infrastructure services – which focus on its core database services – with a suite of application development and software as a service offerings. At its Cloud World event in New York today, company executives laid out their vision of how they will take on competitors such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Salesforce.com. Oracle founder and now CTO Larry Ellison once famously denounced the cloud, questioning whether the technology was just hype. Since those statements the company has invested heavily in hiring the engineering talent to build up its cloud platform, and has begun releasing what analysts call a minimally viable product in the IaaS public cloud market. Today, Oracle released more details that will advance its cloud offering, across a handful of areas: Compute: Oracle’s IaaS cloud comes in three compute flavors: Physical (meaning non-virtualized) Linux or Windows servers, which offer isolation of customer workloads; virtual servers (where customers share infrastructure resources with other customers) and bare metal servers running Docker containers. “No one else in the public cloud offers that capability,” said Oracle President of Products Thomas Kurian about the company’s physical servers, which he says provide 100% isolation of workloads. IBM offers bare metal servers, too, though. Compute offerings range from inexpensive machines ($0.10 per hour) to ones with between 32 and 44 Intel core processors, 1 TB of dRAM and 29 TBs of local storage, all the way up to 60 TB local storage that are capable of up to 1 million input and outputs per second (IOPS). Kurain claims these cost 20% less than AWS with 7 to 10X the performance. Network: Kurian says that Oracle’s cloud is built on a virtualized network that isolates customer traffic in “fully encapsulated” virtual networks. He argues that this provides better quality of service – eliminating the “noisy neighbor” problem on shared resources – while providing better security. Storage: Oracle cloud offers object, block and file storage systems. Databases: Kurian argues that Oracle’s databases are the company’s biggest differentiator. Databases start at $175 per month and range to DBs with up to 240 TBs of storage and 246 physical cores, all the way to hosted Exadata platforms. They all have the same API and SQL dialect. Oracle, Kurian says, also supports more than 500 open source projects in its cloud. PaaS and cloud management: Oracle’s PaaS is broken into serving two developer profiles, either a professional developer, or a line of business developer, the latter of which would use a graphical drag-and-drop interface for simple application development. Advanced microservice applications can be controlled by Kubernetes on the Oracle PaaS, Kurian says. Meanwhile, the company’s cloud management portal can be used to control on-premises and other public cloud platforms. Administrators can set up policies to automatically backup or patch resources on a scheduled basis. SaaS Services: In addition to IaaS and PaaS functionality, Oracle has a strong set of SaaS tools, ranging from CRM, ERP, HCM and vertical industry specific applications. Geographic expansion: Oracle announced plans to open three more regions for its cloud this year in Virginia, Turkey and London, which will give the company 29 regions around the world. “Oracle should be congratulated for its enthusiasm and the proactive way it is pursuing the cloud market,” says Charles King, an analyst with Pund-IT, adding that the company was late to the market. Oracle has taken a similar approach to Microsoft and IBM in offering services across all three layers of cloud: IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. “They still have a massive install base of customers that want cloud services. The question is whether they will choose Oracle as their cloud vendor as opposed to vendors they may be currently working with, or choosing to go with a more established, more innovative vendor.” King adds Oracle’s cloud will appeal most to existing customers, but he questions how the company will be able to attract net new brands.

The FTC filed a blockbuster lawsuit against Qualcomm today, arguing that the chipmaker used its baseband processor patents to illegally force competitors out of the market. (The short version: the FTC says Qualcomm wouldn’t sell modems to any company that didn’t also agree to pay Qualcomm patent royalties on phones that used modems from other suppliers, which the agency refers to a the “no-license-no-chips” policy.) Anyway, a big part of the complaint has to do with Apple, and the fact that Qualcomm spent a lot of time working and reworking its deal with Cupertino to remain the exclusive provider of modems in the iPhone. Among the moves it made? The FTC says that in 2007, Qualcomm agreed to refund some of Apple’s patent royalty payments if Apple agreed not to make a WiMAX iPhone. Here’s the FTC’s complaint: Under a 2007 agreement, Qualcomm agreed to rebate to Apple royalties that Qualcomm received from Apple’s contract manufacturers in excess of a specified per-handset cap. Qualcomm’s payment obligations were conditioned upon, among other things, Apple not selling or licensing a handset implementing the WiMax standard, a prospective fourth-generation cellular standard championed by Intel and opposed by Qualcomm. WiMAX is dead now, but in 2007, this was a Big Deal: Sprint had just made an enormous bet on beating the market to 4G speeds by deploying a WiMAX network in 2008, ahead of LTE, and Intel still had an opportunity to make a mark in mobile. Paying off Apple allowed Qualcomm to keep the iPhone off a faster network until LTE was ready — and in the process effectively kneecapped Sprint, which invested billions into a network that couldn’t support the future iPhone roadmap. kneecapping sprint’s wimax network Ten years later, and Sprint has switched to LTE but still isn’t in great shape — T-Mobile CEO John Legere just referred to Sprint as “exploding” and hinted that he might like to take it over. Intel’s not doing much better when it comes to mobile, although the company just managed to get some modems in the iPhone 7. But it’s interesting to think about what might have been if the first 4G iPhone had been a WiMAX model on Sprint, while every other network was still running 3G.

Is your business still using Windows 7? It's time to upgrade to Windows 10, according to Microsoft, even though end-of-life support for the aging operating system is still three years away. Windows 7 isn't as secure as its modern counterpart, Markus Nitschke, head of Windows at Microsoft's German subsidiary, wrote in a German blog post. The OS, which first arrived in 2009, "does not meet the requirements of modern technology, nor the high security requirements of IT departments," Nitschke wrote, according to ZDNet. Microsoft plans to end support for the operating system on January 13, 2020. After that date, it will no longer receive security patches. But even those patches aren't enough to make it as secure as Windows 10, which has multiple security features geared toward the enterprise IT environment. They include built-in biometric security and a whitelist that checks each app's cryptographic signature and prevents it from running if it's determined to be unsafe. Meanwhile, Redmond last year confirmed that all next-generation processors built by Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, or others, will only support Windows 10. That means if you buy a PC with these upgraded chips—Intel's "Kaby Lake," Qualcomm's "8996," and AMD's "Bristol Ridge"—they will only run Windows 10; you can't downgrade to Windows 7 or 8.1. Related 10 Reasons to Upgrade to Windows 10 10 Reasons to Upgrade to Windows 10 Microsoft has also been highlighting Windows 10's security success stories in recent weeks. Company security researchers claim that Windows 10 would have thwarted two zero-day exploits that hackers used in a phishing campaign against think tanks and nongovernmental organizations in the US last fall. Still, many corporations will find the 2020 deadline to upgrade or be cut off from security updates a nuisance, because it means updating legacy software that's designed for Windows 7 or earlier OSes. It will also mean updating networks to support new features, and reconfiguring cloud apps, as Brad Passman, director of information technology at Novetta, noted when Windows 10 was released in 2015. Microsoft's decision to step up its role as Windows 10 cheerleader for enterprises comes as the company admitted that its upgrade push for consumers was too aggressive. The company's Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela said last month that Redmond had indeed made mistakes, including "getting too aggressive in pushing out the Windows 10 free upgrade."

Qualcomm believes the complaint is based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry […] Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC’s allegation to the contrary — the central thesis of the complaint — is wrong. Qualcomm is the target of a new Federal Trade Commission complaint filed today involving Apple. The FTC claims Qualcomm engaged in anti-competitive practices that helped it monopolize the market of a “key semiconductor device” used in products including iPhones and iPads. The FTC’s complaint specifically mentions that Qualcomm prevented Apple from working with its competitors over a five year period ending last year. Extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties. Qualcomm precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors. The complaint spans up to last year when Apple added cellular chips from Intel in some iPhone 7 models. Qualcomm was similarly fined nearly $1 billion in China over anticompetitive practices back in 2015 and over $850 million last month in South Korea. The complaint against Qualcomm in the Unites States has only started today, however. The Federal Trade Commission says it wants a “court order to undo and prevent Qualcomm’s unfair methods of competition in violation of the FTC Act” and has asked the court to force Qualcomm to “take actions to restore competitive conditions” which will likely include new penalties in the United States. Full FTC release below: FTC Charges Qualcomm With Monopolizing Key Semiconductor Device Used in Cell Phones January 17, 2017 The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint in federal district court charging Qualcomm Inc. with using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cell phones and other consumer products. Qualcomm is the world’s dominant supplier of baseband processors – devices that manage cellular communications in mobile products. The FTC alleges that Qualcomm has used its dominant position as a supplier of certain baseband processors to impose onerous and anticompetitive supply and licensing terms on cell phone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Qualcomm also holds patents that it has declared essential to industry standards that enable cellular connectivity. These standards were adopted by standard-setting organizations for the telecommunications industry, which include Qualcomm and many of its competitors. In exchange for having their patented technologies included in the standards, participants typically commit to license their patents on what are known as fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory, or “FRAND,” terms. When a patent holder that has made a FRAND commitment negotiates a license, ordinarily it is constrained by the fact that if the parties are unable to reach agreement, the patent holder may have to establish reasonable royalties in court. According to the complaint, by threatening to disrupt cell phone manufacturers’ supply of baseband processors, Qualcomm obtains elevated royalties and other license terms for its standard-essential patents that manufacturers would otherwise reject. These royalties amount to a tax on the manufacturers’ use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm’s competitors, a tax that excludes these competitors and harms competition. Increased costs imposed by this tax are passed on to consumers, the complaint alleges. By excluding competitors, Qualcomm impedes innovation that would offer significant consumer benefits, including those that foster the increased interconnectivity of consumer products, vehicles, buildings, and other items commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. The FTC has charged Qualcomm with violating the FTC Act. The complaint alleges that Qualcomm: Maintains a “no license, no chips” policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm’s preferred license terms. The FTC alleges that this tactic forces cell phone manufacturers to pay elevated royalties to Qualcomm on products that use a competitor’s baseband processors. According to the Commission’s complaint, this is an anticompetitive tax on the use of rivals’ processors. “No license, no chips” is a condition that other suppliers of semiconductor devices do not impose. The risk of losing access to Qualcomm baseband processors is too great for a cell phone manufacturer to bear because it would preclude the manufacturer from selling phones for use on important cellular networks. Refuses to license standard-essential patents to competitors. Despite its commitment to license standard-essential patents on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has consistently refused to license those patents to competing suppliers of baseband processors. Extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties. Qualcomm precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors. The FTC is seeking a court order to undo and prevent Qualcomm’s unfair methods of competition in violation of the FTC Act. The FTC has asked the court to order Qualcomm to cease its anticompetitive conduct and take actions to restore competitive conditions. The Commission vote to file the complaint was 2-1. Commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen dissented and issued a statement. Both a public and sealed version of the complaint were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on January 17, 2017. NOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The case will be decided by the court. The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers.

In a recently released report, GE and co-author Intel offer a comprehensive view of how the Industrial Internet – embedded sensors, data analytics and connected platforms- are helping companies increase their productivity and reducing environmental emissions to securing a cleaner and more competitive future. “We are working closely with our partners in the region, such as Masdar, Saudi Aramco, and RasGas, among others, some of the first adopters of digital solutions, to support regional economies in achieving their energy and economic diversification goals. This is part of a larger movement that includes both large companies, and start-ups, from across the industrial and tech sectors, working together on innovation and implementation to realize the dramatic economic and environmental potential of digital efficiency,” said Deb Frodl, Global Executive Director of GE Ecomagination. Overarching report findings on digital efficiency: Emerging digital solutions applied across industry can potentially save $81 billion in fuel costs annually and close the gap to reaching the COP21 goals by 30 per cent or 823 MT of carbon emissions per year, the equivalent of taking 174 million cars off the road. The key economic and environmental impact of digitization were identified as: • Power – $14 billion in cost savings annually and a potential reduction in global carbon by 495 Mt/year • Lighting – $30 billion in saving, and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction • Aviation- $14 billion in annual saving and 45 MT/year in carbon reduction • Railway – $3 billion in saving and 19MT/year in carbon reduction • Ground transportation – $20 billion in saving and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction GE has been working with its partners on digital industrial technologies that help achieve enhanced productivity, efficiency and asset optimization. For example, RasGas Company Limited (RasGas), one of the world’s largest and pioneering producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is marking the first global deployment of Industrial Internet technologies in the LNG sector. In the UAE, Masdar is working with GE to pilot and commercialize sustainable energy-neutral advanced wastewater treatment solutions in the MENAT region, and co-develop Industrial Internet solutions to optimize efficiencies. GE is also working with Masdar to launch a co-leadership training program for women to drive innovation and talent development in the renewable energy sector. In aviation, GE Aviation and Dubai’s Museum of the Future have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to accelerate innovation and advanced technology around the world. In Saudi Arabia, GE has announced several new digital industrial partnerships, technologies and initiatives. The GE Saudi Technology & Innovation Center (GE STIC) in Dhahran Techno Valley is at the heart of the company’s ‘Industrial Internet’ roadmap to drive digital transformation of industry. GE Oil & Gas Digital is introducing its first Asset Performance Management (APM) solution to reside on Saudi Aramco’s business network for the Aramco Jazan Complex Integrated Manufacturing Operations Management System (IMOMS). Saudi Electricity Company has joined hands with GE, and established a Generation & Optimization Center (GOC), a state-of-the-art center equipped with hardware and software to monitor 16 SEC power plants. In lighting, Current, which brings together capabilities from GE’s LED, Solar, Energy Storage, and electric vehicle businesses, is enabling its partners in MENA to tap into a wide variety of GE offerings and optimize their energy needs across their entire operation. GE’s Industrial Internet operating system, Predix, is playing a pivotal role in providing a foundation for a range of digital solutions that improve energy and water efficiency across aviation, railways, ground transportation, manufacturing facilities, power plants and buildings.

Andrew Tarantola, @terrortola 01.17.17 in Personal Computing Comments 2204 Shares Share Tweet Share Save A major obstacle currently facing VR is the fact that the headsets themselves (generally) have to remain tethered to a bulky desktop tower. With the new Zbox Magnus EN1070K from Zotac, however, that tower is now barely bigger than a Mac Mini. The EN1070K is part of Zotac's gaming line of ultra-compact PCs, but don't let its minuscule footprint fool you. It offers the current Intel Kaby Lake Core i5 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU and can accommodate up to 32GB of RAM. That's more than enough processing power to run a VR setup such as the Oculus Rift. There's no word yet on when the EN1070K will be released, or for how much. Given that the last generation E-series cost around $1,500, you can pretty safely bet the new one will retail for roughly the same, depending on the specific components you select. So even though it may be small enough to fit into a VR backpack, the EN1070K's price tag may be too big to fit into your budget.
