Freedman Jan 6, 2017, 6:12 PM Intel found a way to keep your smart home from becoming obsolete. It's called the Compute Card, and it's a computer, about the size of a credit card, that will provide the entire platform for smart technology, making it easy to upgrade at your whim. The tiny computer has a CPU, RAM, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and it can run anything that has a slot for the card. Intel representatives told me that it's meant to simplify the design process for smart gadgets, as they'll already know the computer they're using. They just need to include a slot for the card.

In three years when your specs are outdated, you can buy a new Compute Card with the latest and greatest without throwing away an entire smart refrigerator. Those worried about obsolete smart tech will be able to upgrade at will. Alternatively, if the PC breaks, you can just swap in a new one. Products using the card will come from partners including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp and inFocus by the end of the year. While Intel showed me the Compute card at its booth at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, the official launch will come at Computex in May with full specs and demos. All Intel reps would mention is that there will be a lineup of Compute Cards at different price points, and will that they will include 7th Generation processors.

With its introduction of its Ryzen CPU, AMD has countered Intel’s best with some excellent performance of its own. Ryzen represents a more aggressive improvement over AMD’s previous architecture, Excavator, with the new Zen chips offering a full 40 percent improvement. That’s much more significant than Intel’s more conservative improvements with its latest generation of CPUs, which focused on smaller performance increases and better mobile battery life. This is an important accomplishment for AMD, because apparently, it’s going to have to last for at least four years, as PCWorld reports. More: Watch AMD demo upcoming desktop CPUs during its ‘New Horizon’ event right here The news came during CES 2017, where AMD’s computing and graphics senior vice president and general manager Jim Anderson discussed the new architecture. As he put it, comparing AMD’s process to Intel’s “tick-tock” development cycle that was actually skipped this time around, “We’re not going tick-tock. Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock.” While Intel’s methodology usually results in a brand new architecture every two years, AMD has averaged closer to three to four years. It’s Opteron and Athlon architectures lasted from 2003 until 2007, and its K10 lasted from 2007 until 2010. The bottom line is that AMD simply must introduce impressive new performance metrics each cycle because its new architectures must remain competitive for far longer. With Zen and Ryzen, AMD has taken the tactic of improving not only clock speeds but also making the chips better at guessing at what data will be processed next, called “branch prediction,” as well as build in the ability for chips to process more information at a time. That means AMD is focusing on going beyond Moore’s Law, which has predicted increased processor performance in PCs for decades, into “Moore’s Law Plus” that focuses on more than just manufacturing processes. Judging by CES 2017, AMD’s efforts are paying dividends. A number of leading motherboard makers announced Ryzen-based components, with a total of 16 AM4-based solutions that are primed to plug in new Ryzen desktop processors. Not only AMD’s newest CPUs are supported in this year’s round of components, but also other high-end PC parts such as PCIe 3.0, M.2 SATA devices, USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 3, and more. ASRock Asus Biostar Gigabyte MSI X370 Taichi B350M-C X370GT7 GA-AX370-Gaming K5 A320M Pro-VD X370 Gaming K4 X350GT5 GA-AX370-Gaming 5 X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium AB350 Gaming K4 X350GT3 AB350-Gaming 3 B350 Tomahawk A320M Pro4 A320M-HD3 B350M Mortar Clearly, AMD is not messing around in making Ryzen a real product. As Anderson put it, “We’re not going to do a paper launch [where products are announced long before they actually ship]. We’ve done that before. We’re not going to mess with it.” That means that AMD and its customers will be able to squeeze every bit of life out of the Zen architecture for its entire four-year lifespan. Competition is a good thing, and so AMD’s efforts are welcome in pushing PC’s forward. Intel isn’t standing still itself, of course, with its own upcoming advancements such as the 10mm manufacturing process coming with its own next generation of CPUs. But AMD is apparently confident that it’s positioned itself well to remain relevant in PCs well into the next decade. Also watch: Share

Zeman   @phonescooper New Balance partnered with Intel and Strava to create the runner-focused RunIQ. This smartwatch runs Android Wear and includes core features such as GPS and a heart rate monitor. Here are Phone Scoop's first impressions. AD       article continues below... The RunIQ from New Balance is an Android-based smartwatch that specifically targets runners. The watch is a collaboration between New Balance, Intel, and Strava. It hopes to gain traction with people who prioritize fitness over the connected features typically associated with smartwatches, though it offers those tools, as well. There's no question the RunIQ is a sport watch. It is made from hard plastics and silicon, it features oversized buttons that are easy to use, and it is water resistant for those times when you get caught running in a downpour. The RunIQ is not overly fancy, and in fact is downright simple in appearance. The core watch is available only in a dark gray color, but a wide variety of colored, silicon straps are available (orange, green blue, purple, red). New Balance says the RunIQ is compatible with any standard 22mm strap, so you can swap them out if you want. New Balance RunIQ   I like that the RunIQ keeps the size under control. Compared to the Casio WSD-F20, the RunIQ is downright dainty. It is lightweight and not too wide. It should be comfortable enough for most people. The materials are decent, but not the best. The hard plastic of the main watch body is certainly strong, but the silicon straps felt a bit flimsy to me. Three hardware buttons are located on the right side of the watch. They are quite large and easy to find and use, even when wearing gloves. The travel and feedback on the upper and lower buttons is just okay, but the large, central button works very well. An optical heart rate monitor is positioned on the bottom of the watch. New Balance took a slightly unique approach with the design of the underbelly. Typically, wearables with optical heart rate monitors need to be worn tightly in order to work well. Optical heart rate monitors rely on darkness, hence the need to be snuffed against your wrist. New Balance added a donut-shaped buffer around the heart rate monitor. New Balance says this lets people wear the watch at a comfortable degree of snugness while still blocking enough light so the heart rate monitor works properly. New Balance didn't do anything fancy with the display. Like nearly all Android smartwatches, the display measures 1.39 inches an has 360 x 360 resolution. The unit we examined looked good. The size/resolution combo mean on-screen elements are plenty sharp. Indoors, the brightness appeared to be good but we were unable to see just how well the display does outdoors under the sun. The RunIQ will ship with Android Wear 1.2 aboard, but New Balance insists the watch will be updated to Android Wear 2.0 as soon as Google releases the refreshed platform. The unit we saw was still running Android Wear 1.2. The core user experience (settings, apps, menus, controls) works just like any other Android Wear smartwatch. New Balance has added a significant number of its own fitness-focused functions for running. Chiefly, the RunIQ offers Strava, which is a fitness app available to Android and iOS devices. Strava allows users to track workouts and share them with an online community. Beyond Strava, the RunIQ has GPS for tracking runs, walks, and hikes. The heart rate monitor can hook into workouts, too, for tracking fitness levels and performance. The wearable includes a wide variety of stopwatches and other timing functions, including easy controls for managing laps when running loops. I didn't see any performance issues with the unit on hand in Las Vegas, but it will be critical to see how the RunIQ functions with Android Wear 2.0 aboard. Interface   face 1 face 1 face 2 face 2 changing faces changing faces face color options face color options running running running running running running running running running running music music music music New Balance didn't share too many specifications for the watch. We know it runs an Intel processor, but not which one. We also know that it has 24 hours of normal battery life, but only 5 hours of battery life when using GPS and the heart rate monitor at the same time. That's not so great. The price is decent at $299. That puts it inline with most other modern Android Wear devices, and much less than that of Casio's $500 F20. New Balance says the RunIQ will ship before February 1.

But for all the running commentary, Trump's transition has been particularly opaque. Over the next week, he and many of his Cabinet nominees will all be out in public, providing answers that could start to bring his administration into sharper focus. The focal point will be Trump's news conference on Wednesday in New York (Thursday in Australia), with two issues uppermost: how he answers questions about the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's emails; and how he explains the steps he plans to take with his business enterprises to avoid conflicts of interests as president. Related Content Russia aimed to influence US election, top spies tell Trump Trump says 'only reason' hacking is a hot topic is because of Democratic loss Confirmations hearings are scheduled for a slew of his Cabinet picks, so many there won't be enough television screens to accommodate them all. They include two of the most controversial nominees: Exxon's Rex Tillerson, Trump's choice for secretary of state, and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the early Trump supporter named to be attorney-general. The many confirmation hearings likely will be overshadowed by Trump's event, but they deserve as much attention as can be given. The coincidence in timing for Trump's news conference couldn't have been written by a Hollywood scriptwriter. The president-elect hasn't met with the press corps for a full-fledged question-and-answer session since last July (days after the first DNC emails were leaked by WikiLeaks), when he approvingly called on the Russians to find and reveal emails from Hillary Clinton's private server. Advertisement "They probably have them," he said that day. "I'd like to have them released." He's sung a different song about the Russians since then. Could he have imagined that questions about Russian interference with the election would be front and centre as he prepares to take the oath of office? Trump's decision to delay until next week a scheduled December news conference puts him up against the release of a declassified version of the intelligence findings that pinned the orders to interfere in the election squarely on the Russian President Vladimir Putin and that ascribed the Russians' motivation as intending to hurt Clinton and help him. That leaves Trump open to more pointed questions about the Russians' role and motivations and his confidence level - or lack thereof - in the intelligence community he will soon oversee - all of which he has avoided since winning the presidency. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link President-elect Donald Trump has preferred making statements over Twitter than traditional press conferences. That will change this week. Photo: AP Nothing has caused more consternation - among leading Republicans and more broadly - than the president-elect's disparagement of the intelligence community's findings. His written statement after being briefed on the findings did pay respect to the men and women in the intelligence community and called for stepped up efforts to combat future cyber attacks. Republicans found reasons to be reassured by what he said, but some will need to see more. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Senator John McCain is among senior politicians questioning Russian hacking of the US election. Photo: AP/Wong Maye-E Notably, however, he stopped short of declaring that he now accepts that the Russians were solely responsible for what happened during the campaign, the DNC hacking and other nefarious activities. Trump also will have an opportunity to explain why he resisted the conclusions of the intelligence community, why he gave more credence to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks (he claimed later that wasn't his intent) and whether the new report has changed his perspective in any significant ways. Led by Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans have sought to put Trump in a position of having to choose between the US intelligence community that he will soon oversee and Assange, who claims that the information he released did not come from the Russians. Trump has been determined to avoid being pinned down. Trump's motivations for his multiple tweets questioning whether the Russians were to blame are not clear. Is he worried that any suggestion of Russian interference aimed at helping him diminishes his victory? He told Mike Shear of The New York Times that the whole issue is part of a "political witch hunt," presumably designed to delegitimise his presidency. He would like the whole issue to go away, but there was enough history before the hacking to raise questions about why he has treated Putin with such respect. Is that friendly posture a genuine effort to recast US-Russian relations with a goal of making them more productive, without making concessions to an adversary? Is his reluctance caused, perhaps, by business relationships with Russians that he does not want jeopardised or exposed? He has said no, but the full extent of his business arrangements isn't fully known. Is he, in some clever way, playing Putin on his way into the Oval Office with some clear strategic purpose? Should Putin actually be nervous about getting what he wished for - a Trump presidency? Meanwhile, Tillerson will be going through his own grilling before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His relationship with Putin while serving as chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil has put Republicans like McCain on edge, fearful of a pro-Russian tilt in the new administration. His private conversations on Capitol Hill, described by some of the senators with whom he met, have conveyed the impression that he will state clearly that he understands the difference between protecting the interest of shareholders and protecting the interests of the country. But where will that leave him with respect to the president-elect in his assessment of Putin, Russian aggression in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, the value of sanctions imposed and how US policy could or should change after eight years of the Obama presidency? That's ultimately up to Trump, but will Tillerson act as a counterbalance or cheerleader for the instincts the president-elect has shown up to now? Sessions can expect a modicum of senatorial courtesy, given his long tenure in that body, but however polite, his hearings will expose some of the rawness that remains in the aftermath of the election. No nomination has brought about more opposition from the base of the Democratic Party, particularly in the civil rights community. Though his nomination appears in no danger, his allies have worked strenuously to counteract the opposition and smooth his path. Beyond those hearings, Trump's choices for the departments of homeland security, education, housing and urban development, transportation, commerce, labor and the Central Intelligence Agency will all have their moments in the public spotlight. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have set some clear priorities, along with GOP congressional leaders, starting with the dismantlement of the Affordable Care Act (otherwise known as Obamacare), a series of executive orders on day one designed to reverse some of President Barack Obama's actions, and a focus on building a wall along the US-Mexican border and a focus on job creation. Still, there is much that remains unsettled, both about those priorities and with other sensitive issues. Details will have to come eventually. How long will the president-elect, who has said many times he wants to be unpredictable, wait to begin to provide more answers?

Advertisement "They probably have them," he said that day. "I'd like to have them released." He's sung a different song about the Russians since then. Could he have imagined that questions about Russian interference with the election would be front and centre as he prepares to take the oath of office? Trump's decision to delay until next week a scheduled December news conference puts him up against the release of a declassified version of the intelligence findings that pinned the orders to interfere in the election squarely on the Russian President Vladimir Putin and that ascribed the Russians' motivation as intending to hurt Clinton and help him. That leaves Trump open to more pointed questions about the Russians' role and motivations and his confidence level - or lack thereof - in the intelligence community he will soon oversee - all of which he has avoided since winning the presidency.

That will change this week. Photo: AP Nothing has caused more consternation - among leading Republicans and more broadly - than the president-elect's disparagement of the intelligence community's findings. His written statement after being briefed on the findings did pay respect to the men and women in the intelligence community and called for stepped up efforts to combat future cyber attacks. Republicans found reasons to be reassured by what he said, but some will need to see more. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Senator John McCain is among senior politicians questioning Russian hacking of the US election. Photo: AP/Wong Maye-E Notably, however, he stopped short of declaring that he now accepts that the Russians were solely responsible for what happened during the campaign, the DNC hacking and other nefarious activities. Trump also will have an opportunity to explain why he resisted the conclusions of the intelligence community, why he gave more credence to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks (he claimed later that wasn't his intent) and whether the new report has changed his perspective in any significant ways. Led by Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans have sought to put Trump in a position of having to choose between the US intelligence community that he will soon oversee and Assange, who claims that the information he released did not come from the Russians. Trump has been determined to avoid being pinned down. Trump's motivations for his multiple tweets questioning whether the Russians were to blame are not clear. Is he worried that any suggestion of Russian interference aimed at helping him diminishes his victory? He told Mike Shear of The New York Times that the whole issue is part of a "political witch hunt," presumably designed to delegitimise his presidency. He would like the whole issue to go away, but there was enough history before the hacking to raise questions about why he has treated Putin with such respect. Is that friendly posture a genuine effort to recast US-Russian relations with a goal of making them more productive, without making concessions to an adversary? Is his reluctance caused, perhaps, by business relationships with Russians that he does not want jeopardised or exposed? He has said no, but the full extent of his business arrangements isn't fully known. Is he, in some clever way, playing Putin on his way into the Oval Office with some clear strategic purpose? Should Putin actually be nervous about getting what he wished for - a Trump presidency? Meanwhile, Tillerson will be going through his own grilling before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His relationship with Putin while serving as chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil has put Republicans like McCain on edge, fearful of a pro-Russian tilt in the new administration. His private conversations on Capitol Hill, described by some of the senators with whom he met, have conveyed the impression that he will state clearly that he understands the difference between protecting the interest of shareholders and protecting the interests of the country. But where will that leave him with respect to the president-elect in his assessment of Putin, Russian aggression in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, the value of sanctions imposed and how US policy could or should change after eight years of the Obama presidency? That's ultimately up to Trump, but will Tillerson act as a counterbalance or cheerleader for the instincts the president-elect has shown up to now? Sessions can expect a modicum of senatorial courtesy, given his long tenure in that body, but however polite, his hearings will expose some of the rawness that remains in the aftermath of the election. No nomination has brought about more opposition from the base of the Democratic Party, particularly in the civil rights community. Though his nomination appears in no danger, his allies have worked strenuously to counteract the opposition and smooth his path. Beyond those hearings, Trump's choices for the departments of homeland security, education, housing and urban development, transportation, commerce, labor and the Central Intelligence Agency will all have their moments in the public spotlight. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have set some clear priorities, along with GOP congressional leaders, starting with the dismantlement of the Affordable Care Act (otherwise known as Obamacare), a series of executive orders on day one designed to reverse some of President Barack Obama's actions, and a focus on building a wall along the US-Mexican border and a focus on job creation. Still, there is much that remains unsettled, both about those priorities and with other sensitive issues. Details will have to come eventually. How long will the president-elect, who has said many times he wants to be unpredictable, wait to begin to provide more answers?

But for all the running commentary, Trump's transition has been particularly opaque. Over the next week, he and many of his Cabinet nominees will all be out in public, providing answers that could start to bring his administration into sharper focus. The focal point will be Trump's news conference on Wednesday in New York (Thursday in Australia), with two issues uppermost: how he answers questions about the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's emails; and how he explains the steps he plans to take with his business enterprises to avoid conflicts of interests as president.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 7, 2017 at 1:00PM In April of 2016, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced that it would be undergoing a restructuring program designed to "accelerate [Intel's] evolution from a [personal computer] company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices." The net effect of this restructuring was the elimination of "up to 12,000 positions globally" as well as "annual run rate savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017." It is widely believed that much of the cost-cutting happened in the company's Client Computing Group (CCG), which sells components for personal computers as well as for phones, tablets, and so on. Although investors were made aware of the company's investment reductions in areas like smartphone and tablet processors, there were some questions about where else the company might have cut costs. Did the company significantly cut expenses in its core personal computer processor and platform businesses, for example? The General Manager of Intel's CCG, Navin Shenoy, recently spoke at the J.P. Morgan Annual Tech Forum, providing some critical insight into just what was cut and what wasn't. Let's take a closer look at what he had to say. Image source: Intel.  Tablets and phones get cut -- PCs, not so much Shenoy began by saying: The first thing we did is a complete, 360-degree view of the business, and, yeah, the first obvious decisions were to shed ourselves of some of the very low [return on investment] investments in markets that, maybe, three or four years ago, held a lot of promise and now are, in some cases, declining. "It was prudent for us to trim some of those investments in tablets and phones," Shenoy further elaborated. However, Shenoy made it clear that the company didn't cut any of its key personal computer product lines and projects as the company's efforts here are "highly profitable." "It didn't make sense to stop doing those," Shenoy explained. That's not to say, though, that the company didn't cut costs in these areas in a bid to participate in those markets "more efficiently." "We did the things you typically see companies do," Shenoy began. "We shifted resources to lower cost geographies, we combined things, we found site consolidation opportunities, and a lot of that yielded very good cost reduction that you see flowing through our bottom line now." Full impact to be seen in 2017 Year to date, Intel has reported operating profit growth in CCG of just under 31% against revenues that are up about 1.3%. Part of that improvement has been due to operating expense reductions, and part of it has been due to product margin improvements (improved 14-nanometer yields, lower contra-revenue, etc.).  Intel announced its restructuring actions back in April, so -- as Shenoy pointed out -- the full impact of the investment reductions on operating profit won't show itself in Intel's full-year 2016 results. "I think what you'll see in 2017 is, since most of that activity really didn't hit fully until the back half of [2016], you'll see now a full-year of benefit on a lot of that cost reduction in 2017," Shenoy said. Investment takeaway Only time will tell whether Intel has cut spending in its core personal computer product efforts too deeply, but Shenoy's commentary seems encouraging. With the company's operational cost structure reduced to where it's likely going to be going forward, investors must look for the company to either grow its revenue and/or its gross profit margins to deliver continued profit growth in CCG. Considering that the personal computer market is likely to remain challenging in the years ahead, investors may want to keep their expectations in check, here. If Intel can keep revenues and profits in CCG roughly flat while growing its other businesses, then the company should be able to deliver overall revenue and profit growth. Investors should keep a close eye on the revenue and profit expectations Intel puts out there when it hosts its annual investor meeting on February 9 of this year. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Amazon’s AI assistant was everywhere at this year’s CES, from phones and cars to robots and refrigerators. But that wasn’t the only big theme at the world’s biggest tech trade show. The team at Tom’s Guide met with more than 200 companies to arrive at this list of the best and most exciting new products. Our picks include a TV that’s so thin you can almost floss with it, a breakthrough that charges your phone across the room, an AI-powered concept car and a 4K streaming box that puts Apple TV to shame. And it has Google Assistant inside. Take that, Alexa. Best of Show: LG Signature OLED TV W Picture 2 of 25 There’s a reason LG nicknamed this TV “wallpaper.” At just about a tenth of an inch thick, the gorgeous W7 OLED set blends so seamlessly into its surroundings, you wonder how it works at all. Available in 65- and 77-inches, we were also blown away by the W7’s stunning picture quality, as well as the audio from its equally impressive Dolby Atmos soundbar, whose upfiring speakers raise and lower with the push of a button on the remote. Because why not! MORE: LG W7 Hands-on Best Virtual Reality: Project Alloy Picture 3 of 25 Intel’s Project Alloy is a VR experience unlike any other. The standalone headset uses four RealSense cameras to scan a room and implement its furniture and walls into the game you’re playing. It also includes an entire computer in the headset, including CPU and battery, which lets you play without being tethered to a computer. The result is an interactive experience that had us ducking behind a table as we waged war with robot enemies. We can’t wait to see what happens when Intel’s partners include the technology in headsets that should appear later this year. MORE: Project Alloy Hands-On Best Innovation: Ossia Cota Tile Picture 4 of 25 Forget about all the so-called "wireless charging" technologies you've seen before. A game-changing breakthrough, Ossia's Cota Tile lives in the ceiling and sends electricity through the air to your device just like a router sends out a Wi-Fi signal. Your phone can charge all day while it sits in your pocket and your smart home devices can get juiced constantly, even if they're nowhere near an outlet. MORE: Ossia Cota Tile Hands-on Editor's Choice: Lego Boost Picture 5 of 25 To succeed in the 21st century job market, today's kids need to learn how to code when they're young. The Lego Boost kit teaches basic programming concepts to children as young as seven as they build any of five really cute robots and control them with a tablet app. Since this is Lego, you can customize these robots with standard bricks too. MORE: Lego Boost Hands-on Best Car Tech: Toyota Concept-i Picture 6 of 25 It will greet you with a wink when you walk up to it, play calming tunes to soothe your mind in difficult times, and it will even let you drive when you want. Toyota's Concept-i isn't just a self-driving car, it's a friend on wheels. Oh, and it looks amazing, too. With the way the Concept-i implements AI, Toyota has elevated what a car can be, and if this is a vision of the kind of tech that's coming down the road, it can't get here soon enough. MORE: Toyota Concept-i Hands-on Best Robot: Ubtech Lynx Picture 7 of 25 The Lynx from Ubtech is a robot like no other. That’s because it’s the first humanoid with Alexa inside. Ask Lynx a question or give it a command, and it will turn it’s head towards you. Don’t be creeped out, because this is a robot with a heart. And a lot of dexterity. The Lynx can execute crazy Yoga poses, dance and even hug your child while you’re on a video call with him from half-way around the world. MORE: Ubtech Lynx Hands-on Best Phone: Asus ZenFone AR Picture 8 of 25 The Asus ZenFone AR is a phone that stands out. It’s the first Android handset to run both the Google Tango augmented reality platform and Daydream VR, and it doesn’t skimp on specs, either. The ZenFone AR is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 CPU, 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Adreno 530 GPU. It also packs a 5.7-inch 2560 x 1440 AMOLED display that will look great when using apps or the Google Daydream VR headset. MORE: Asus ZenFone AR Hands-On Best Budget Phone: Honor 6X Picture 9 of 25 The Honor 6X is the kind of phone that makes you wonder why you pay several hundred bucks for a flagship device. This $249 device packs a dual-lens rear camera (for achieving the iPhone 7 Plus’ portrait mode effect on the cheap) and a fingerprint sensor while boasting all-day battery life. Actually, make that two days, at least when you’re not using it heavily. The 6X is proof that you don’t need to bust your budget just to enjoy some of the finer features smartphones have to offer. MORE: Honor 6X Hands-on Best Smart Home Product: LG Instaview Refrigerator Picture 10 of 25 This Alexa-enabled fridge has a 29-inch touchscreen that runs not just Windows 10, but webOS, too. Among other things, you can check the weather, play music, and leave notes for your family. Cameras inside the LG Instaview refrigerator send photos to your smartphone to let you see if you’re running low on eggs, or you can simply tap the display, and it will turn clear. This lets you look inside without ever having to open the door. MORE: LG Instaview Hands-on Best Design: Dell Canvas 27 Picture 11 of 25 It has a screen that folds down, a pen, and a dial that you can use to select tools and change colors on the fly. No, it’s not the Surface Studio. Dell’s Canvas 27 gives creative professionals a fantastically versatile workspace for a fraction of the price. This display plugs into any existing Windows 10 PC and offers a new interface (in partnership with Stardock) that will make you feel Minority Report-powerful. MORE: Dell Canvas 27 Hands-on Best Laptop: Acer Predator 21X Picture 12 of 25 The Predator 21X is what happens when you throw caution (and budgets) to the wind. This head-turning beast of a gaming laptop sports a curved 21-inch display, which is a first for any laptop. There’s also a mechanical keyboard on board, dual Nvidia 1080 graphics cards and a very nifty magnetic touchpad that you can flip over that turns into a number pad. Sure, this brute costs $9,000, but if you have the means, why the hell not? MORE: Acer Predator 21x Hands-on Best PC: Dell XPS 27 Picture 13 of 25 Plenty of all-in-one PCs look stunning, but the Dell XPS 27 is one of the few that sounds great as well. That's because this desktop packs a whopping 10-speaker soundbar right below its display, allowing you to hear your music, movies and shows the way they were meant to sound. Factor in a 27-inch 4K touch display that can be laid flat, and you've got a spectacular all-in-one for artists, musicians or simply anyone who wants their content to both look and sound fantastic. MORE: Dell XPS 27 Hands-On Best TV: Sony Bravia XBR-A1E Picture 14 of 25 Sony insists on both great picture and great sound for its TVs, but that’s hard to accomplish when sets are becoming thinner and thinner. With the Bravia XBR-A1E, Sony devised a novel solution: turn the screen itself into a speaker. The Bravia XBR-A1E boasts a gorgeous 4K HDR OLED screen, but what really sets it apart is that the screen itself vibrates to produce sound. Not only are there no speakers required, but its novel Acoustic Surface technology should sound even better than most tiny flat screen TV speakers. MORE: Sony Bravia XBR-AIE Hands-on Best Streaming Box: Nvidia Shield Picture 15 of 25 The first Nvidia Shield was a respectable streaming box/game console hybrid; the new Nvidia Shield has the potential to be the centerpiece of your house. With an integrated games store that draws from three robust sources, full support for 4K and HDR games streamed through Steam and built-in Google Assistant with smart home commands, the Nvidia Shield could be one of the most powerful and versatile streaming players to ever hit the market. It’s also the only Android TV system with access to Amazon Video. MORE: Nvidia Shield Hands-on Best Monitor: Dell UltraSharp 32 8K Monitor Picture 16 of 25 Dell's 32-inch UltraSharp 8K monitor is the kind of product that you truly need to see to believe. This droolworthy screen can display over one billion colors and close to 33 billion pixels, which makes photos look incredibly true to life while allowing you to see every fine detail of a map or schematic. The UP3218K's $5,000 price tag means that it's not for everyone, but it's stunning sharpness makes it the ultimate display for creative professionals. MORE: Dell UP3218K Hands-On Best Gaming PC: CyberPower Luxe Picture 17 of 25 CyberPower manages to out-crazy itself every CES, making its new Luxe PC an easy pick for our favorite gaming desktop of the show. The CyberPower Luxe looks like it rolled out of a monster truck show in the best way possible, with a stunning, cage-like chassis that you can easily lift open to access the rainbow of backlit components waiting inside. With support for multiple graphics cards, the highest-end processors and a variety of custom cooling options, the Luxe is just as much a geeky work of art as it is a beastly gaming desktop. MORE: CyberPower Luxe Hands-On Best Security: Bitdefender Box Picture 18 of 25 Most smart home tech doesn’t have very good security. You have three choices: don’t use it, leave yourself open to cybercrime or invest in hardware to protect yourself. The new Bitdefender Box is a router add-on (although you can also use it as a standalone router) that monitors not only the security of your PC and mobile devices, but your IoT gadgets as well. Users can block unauthorized devices attempting to the network, or prevent existing devices from accessing malicious sites. Over time, the Bitdefender Box will learn new smart home vulnerabilities, and defend against them, too.

Trust us, Project Ariana has to be seen to be believed.  MORE: Razer Project Ariana Hands-on Best Gaming Hardware: Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ Picture 22 of 25 There are lots of gaming monitors with 4K resolution and Nvidia G-Sync, but for some reason, not many systems have embraced the vibrant color technology of high dynamic range (HDR). The Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ combines all three features, along with a blindingly fast 144-Hz refresh rate, to give gamers the best-looking experience possible. At 27 inches, the PG27UQ is small enough to fit into a desktop gaming setup, and its striking, angular design means it’ll turn heads even when powered off.

But, the Ambeo Smart Surrounds aren't most earphones. Sennheiser's stylish in-ear cans can record 3D audio for a more immersive listening experience, which goes hand-in-hand with the growing popularity of augmented, merged and virtual reality. Best of all, all you need to start recording are the earphones and a compatible iPhone.

The Mohu Airwave eliminates that hassle by acting as a totally wireless system.

Intel IvyBridge/Haswell/Broadwell/Skylake OpenGL & Vulkan Benchmarks On Linux 4.10 + Mesa 13.1 Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 7 January 2017. Page 1 of 4. 11 Comments With running fresh benchmarks on all of my Intel systems for comparison with my upcoming Kaby Lake desktop CPU Linux reviews, this weekend I have some fresh results of the past few generations of Intel hardware when looking at their HD/Iris Graphics performance when using the latest Linux driver code as of Linux 4.10 Git and Mesa 13.1-devel Git from this week. While we mostly benchmark Skylake graphics on Linux these days and routinely the Broadwell Iris Graphics, it's been a while since delivering many comparison benchmarks going back to Haswell and Ivy Bridge. Thus ahead of the Kaby Lake reviews I figured I'd share these results by themselves. For comparison is also an AMD A10-7850K Kaveri APU with the same Linux 4.10 / Mesa 13.1-dev driver stack as the latest generation desktop APU I have from AMD. The Intel hardware tested was the Core i7 3770K (Ivy Bridge), Core i7 4770K (Haswell), Core i7 4790K (Haswell), Core i7 5775C (Broadwell Iris Graphics), Core i5 6500 (Skylake), and Core i5 6600K (Skylake) based upon the CPUs I have available for testing. On each of these systems, Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 was loaded followed by switching to Linux 4.10 Git and Mesa 13.1-devel from the Padoka PPA. A variety of OpenGL benchmarks were run on this bleeding-edge open-source GPU driver stack followed by some fresh Vulkan benchmarks too later in this article. All of these benchmarks were facilitated in a fully-automated manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

His early-morning assessment came in a series of tweets on the subject and the morning after the release of a declassified report by US intelligence agencies that concluded Russia carried out a comprehensive cyber campaign to sabotage the presidential election and sought to aid Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. Saturday morning's tweets were the latest from Trump to portray the episode in starkly partisan terms, even as some senior Republicans in Congress have called for harsher sanctions against Russia than recently ordered by President Barack Obama. "Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!" Trump said in one of his tweets, referring to an election in which Clinton won the popular vote but he prevailed in the electoral college. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link President-elect Donald Trump is still questioning the validity of the Russian hacking findings. Photo: Evan Vucci/AP In another tweet on Saturday morning, Trump said intelligence officials "state very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results." "Voting machines not touched!" he added. Advertisement Trump's later comment appeared to be consistent with the findings of the report, though it noted that Russia "obtained and maintained access" to numerous election systems that "were not involved in vote tallying." Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 Trump also said that only "fools" would think it was bad to have a good relationship with Russia and predicted that Russia will respect the US "far more" once he reaches the Oval Office. Putin developed "a clear preference" for Trump to win, the intelligence agencies said on Friday in a declassified report on their findings. The agencies said they "assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him," according to the report. "All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence," the report said. Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only "stupid" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We.....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 In a statement after Friday's meeting, the president-elect sought to tamp down his differences with the intelligence agencies – he said he has "tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation" – although he didn't explicitly endorse their conclusions that Russia was responsible. "While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organisations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines," Trump said in the statement. Posting on Twitter early Saturday, Trump repeated that voting machines were not touched. The intelligence agencies agreed there was no evidence of ballots being hacked but said in the report that, "We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election." Trump has expressed admiration for Putin as a strong leader and predicted they can work together on issues such as fighting Islamic State terrorists. He returned to that theme on Saturday. "Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing," Trump said on Twitter.  "Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now." Trump on Saturday also repeated his contention that Democrats were largely to blame for their accounts being hacked. Hackers penetrated email at the Democratic National Committee and of John Podesta, the chairman of Clinton's campaign. "Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense!" Trump tweeted.

According to a senior law enforcement official, the gunman, identified as Esteban Santiago, 26, walked into the FBI office in Anchorage, Alaska, in November and made disturbing remarks that prompted officials to urge him to seek mental health care.

Santiago, appearing "agitated and incoherent," said "that his mind was being controlled by a US intelligence agency," the official said. Other officials said it was too early to tell whether Santiago, who was captured in the airport, had been inspired by terrorist groups, including the Islamic State. The officials said he had viewed extremist materials on the internet.

The shooting spurred a scene of panic and confusion that played out on live television as scores of travelers burst out of the terminal and onto the tarmac, running and seeking cover, at times in response to erroneous rumours of follow-up attacks.

"Everybody was dropping gear, panicking, jumping over tables," Fogarty said in a phone interview. "We were saying: What is going on? Are there people shooting? I am not hearing any gunshots, and the whole place is panicking."

The senior law enforcement official said Santiago was making "disjointed" statements in his Anchorage FBI visit. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Suspect Esteban Ruiz Santiago. Photo: Broward Sheriff's Office "Although Santiago stated that he did not wish to harm anyone, as a result of his erratic behavior, interviewing agents contacted local authorities," who took him to a medical facility for evaluation, the official said. "The FBI closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, interagency checks and interviews of his family members," the official said. On Twitter, President-elect Donald Trump said that he was "monitoring the terrible situation in Florida" and that he had spoken to Governor Rick Scott. Hours after the attack, a picture began to emerge of Santiago as a man who had served his country but who had experienced trouble and failure. Santiago was discharged in August from the Alaska Army National Guard for "unsatisfactory performance," according to Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, spokeswoman for the Alaska Guard. In September, Santiago became a father when his son was born, according to an aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, a resident of Union City, New Jersey, who spoke on Friday to the newspaper The Record. In an email, Olmstead said that Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007. In 2010 he deployed to Balad, Iraq, with the 130th Engineer Battalion, which spent a year clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges; he was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. At least two soldiers from his company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour, but there is nothing in the record that indicates Santiago had been in combat. Olmstead said he served in the Army Reserves before joining the Alaska Army National Guard in November 2014. Before his discharge last year, he had worked as a combat engineer as a private first class. An official service record released by the Army on Friday showed that Santiago had received a number of commendations, including the Army Good Conduct Medal. Santiago's brother, Bryan Santiago, told The Associated Press that Esteban was born in New Jersey and moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2. Nelson Cruz, a Puerto Rico senator who represents Pe??uelas, the city in Puerto Rico where Santiago grew up, said he met him about seven or eight years ago and found him to be a "good young man" who loved his family. Cruz said he spoke Friday with Bryan Santiago, who relayed that the family was shocked by the news of the killings. The family offered no motive for the crime but noted that Esteban Santiago had recently been hallucinating and was receiving psychological treatment. "Bryan said his brother went to Iraq or Afghanistan, one of those places, and came back with psychological problems," Cruz said. "He would suddenly see visions but that he was a calm young man and was never violent." ​The New York Times Advertisement Most Popular If you thought you'd deciphered Trump's master tweeting plan, you're probably wrong 'Pence could be the most powerful VP ever, or he could be kicked to the curb really fast' Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Pendant identical to Anne Frank's found at notorious Nazi camp Follow Fairfax Foreign Share on FacebookFacebook Share on TwitterTwitter Follow SMH Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on EmailNewsletters Advertisement Most Viewed Today Previous slide Next slide World Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Video shows police tackling and beating a black man suspected of stealing a car.

Piro said Santiago had turned up at an FBI office in Anchorage in November of last year behaving erratically and was turned over to local police, who took him to a medical facility for a mental health evaluation. Santiago served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and Alaska National Guard including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon. A private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before being transferred to the inactive ready reserve in August last year. An aunt said he came back from his deployment "a different person", MSNBC reported. The attack was the latest in a series of mass shootings that have plagued the United States in recent years, some inspired by Islamist militants, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed. Nearly two months ago a former Southwest Airlines worker killed an employee of the company at Oklahoma City's airport in what police called a premeditated act. The deadliest mass shooting in modern US history took place last June, when a gunman apparently inspired by Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.

The Purge Election Year Logo (image by Wikipedia (commons.wikimedia.org))   License   DMCA   Details President-elect Donald J. Trump's transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day. Any doubt about purging the current US Administration's foreign affairs and intel community relations around the Globe is a dead horse! It is well known that Intel operations are operated from embassies and their staffing. Internal Intel is being purged at home and abroad and will be held accountable to the incoming President and Staff as December 23rd, a mandate with no exceptions was issued to the State Department recalling all appointed ambassadors, they must vacate their posts by Inauguration Day, January 20th. Is there any doubt now of the insurrection of the existing criminal cabal across the globe being dismantled? It is my humble opinion that a Special Investigative Prosecutor will be assigned to look into actions taken against the incoming President, his Administration and the American people. - Advertisement - This is the war we wanted not the one the neocons and the MIC wanted but the one of purge of unwanted endless wars of murder for profit and their creators. Has Hillary's "If Trump is elected we all go to jail" coming to fruition? The war parties are screaming that many of Trump's Senate-confirmed envoys will not be confirmed in time and the posts could be vacant for months. There is no grace period on this directive. Trump appears to be grabbing the bull by the balls, forget the horns and possibly circumventing any assignation attempt/s or other shenanigans from the ousted regime. Trump is cleaning house fast. Many of the ambassadors are long time diplomats and lifelong politicians as well as heavy donors of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Trump leaves no doubt he wants them gone yesterday! A senior Trump transition official said "there was no ill will in the move, describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Mr. Obama's overseas appointees leave the government on schedule, just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do". The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations, said "the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date, this is what a businessman does as president" he makes the trains run on time". As Terresa Monroe-Hamilton of the Right Wing News reported: YOU'RE FIRED! Trump pink slips these MAJOR Obama appointments! "Trump is shaking up every aspect of the government it would seem and these people just got a rude wake-up call. Opponents are saying this will signal an abrupt change in US policy internationally. Good. The State Department informed all politically appointed ambassadors in a letter the day after the election that they were to submit letters of resignation effective Jan. 20th. It instructed those who wanted to seek extensions to submit formal requests explaining their justifications. And I would bet none of those so-called justifications will be approved. There is a new sheriff in town and he's coming in taking names and kicking butt. Diplomats just got the memo in the form of a pink slip." - Advertisement -   - Advertisement - 4   3   3   View Ratings | Rate It George King has been involved in civil rights and started protesting government as a US Marine protesting the Vietnam War in 1967.

Glad to see you monitoring the fast pace that things are moving towards Jan 20th. Clapper announced his resignation in response I am sure to his letter the day after the election that they were all to submit letters of resignation effective Jan. 20th. I have been missing your thoughts and take on current events recently as most of us have been overwhelmed in looking for signs in what may be the most interesting and dangerous of times. Although I fear as some the underworld will try and derail world events through this thrashing and gasps of a dying transnational regime which may unleash a taking to the streets of revolution not seen in the last two centuries. That multi polar world may be within reach and that will be the catalyst for the Battle of the Sinners and Saints (metaphor).

I doubt any other president-elect has been accused of treason with virtually no evidence. Even the circumstantial evidence is so vague as to need a leap of faith to pin it on Russia, let alone pin it specifically on Putin, while ignoring all other possibilities. Yet, many here on OEN are able to take that leap, some with an extraordinary amount of time on their hands. I wonder if these are really individuals or an organized group masquerading as individuals. All this is being spearheaded by Obama, the outgoing president. Another unprecedented development belying his initial promise of a smooth transition. The man had the grace and credibility of a snake oil salesman for eight interminable years. He is surpassing himself in these last weeks. The heads of the intelligence agencies daring to level such charges against an incoming president are all his appointees. In poisoning the well for Trump, they are dragging the office of the president through a dung heap. A scorched earth, we won't go quietly insurrection that can end very badly. It is not Trump who should be impeached. He hasn't done anything to merit that fate without taking office for a single day. It is Obama, Clinton and the heads of intelligence agencies behind this report who need to be prosecuted for high treason.

In fact, I am counting on the economic motivations prevailing over ideologically driven imperial wars. Although the oil industry is by no means an innocent beneficiary of wars, the nature of the industry is such that a perpetual state of war is not conducive to its business. Well heads, refineries and oil and gas pipelines are the first casualties of imperial armies and jihadi gangs alike. Trump and cronies want to make money and war is bad for their business. The two-headed war party, on the other hand, wants war because it make its money out of the war business. No one is wearing a halo here. But between someone who has to kill to make money and someone who can make money only by having less killing, it's a no-brainer. Am sure people in the target countries would much rather be ranting and raving about their stolen wealth from six centimeters above the ground than from six feet under. Few of us calling for Trump to be given a fair chance have any illusions about him. But he is the lesser evil this time.

The public found out about it and raised holy hell. The meeting was about a pipeline the industry wanted to build across Afghanistan. The results of this meeting and its likely followup planning was the first Iraq war and all that followed. The US oil industry has never shirked from the use of the military to maintain its hegemony in the world economy.

We never got to see its minutes, so we won't know all the plotting and scheming. But it wasn't about the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project alone. That project had a strategic rather than money-making objective. The US wanted it to kill the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline which would have run the oil blockade against Iran. Cheney's meeting was more about the carving out Iraqi oil and gas fields, and laying the groundwork for the Qatar-Syria-Europe gas pipeline. The first was anti-Iran, the second was anti-Russia. I take your point about the oil industry's role in imperial wars. What I was pointing out was it requires a relative peace to operate the trade lines. The wars are for initial capture of supply sources and pipeline routes. Once this part is accomplished, a state of continuing war defeats the purpose of cornering supplies.

The ultimate goal is profit and hegemony. Murder and genocide are just collateral damage to them (and well worth it). Incidentally, I don't think of the US government as an independent player at the table in the war room. They are servants of the oligarchs. The US doesn't give a damn about "bringing democracy to the world". That is a cover for their service to oligarchs.

He is in an information war, with the entire corrupt corporate media arrayed against him in a solid phalanx. If he is tweeting, it is because he has few other means to fight back. It is an asymmetrical war as he has no chance of winning it symmetrically. If even a third of the MSM were willing to give him balanced coverage, he wouldn't be doing this. Except for Fox News, virtually all other bought and paid media is viciously attacking and undermining him around the clock. He may be brash, he may be narcissistic and anything else you want to call him. But the man has balls. He is not knuckling under. I admire his sheer guts. For having come this far and still having to fight tooth and nail on the last mile. This truly extraordinary spectacle is stripping the MSM naked. People are realizing how organized and controlled the corporate media is. If the price of their awakening is to put up with Trump's tendency to go off the rails now and then, it is well worth it. Besides, it is only an assumption -- a rather convenient one for those opposed to him -- that he will be doing this once he assumes office. I would give him a chance to get there and hold my judgment for now.

Fox (Faux) News is the least credible of the lot. Trump changes his intentions without logic and without explanation and doesn't care to respond to anyone who points out that fact. He behaves like a very loose cannon whose brief remarks are shot through with unexplained 180 degree changes of intent and emotional claims that he is under personal attack. It's all about him. He has a bully pulpit from which he could make any logical and credible explanation of any of his behavior that he wanted to advance. It is bizarre to suggest that his only available means to communicate is Twitter. If anyone has had the opportunity to convey a positive, thoughtful, approach to the critically important challenges facing the next POTUS it is he. Yet he has refused or is unable to do that. The electorate had plenty of reason to expect sensible answers and honest clarity from him during the campaign and, not receiving any of that, it is absurd, IMO, to advise withholding judgment in favor of a wait and see approach.

Quite uncharacteristically so. You are questioning his ability to govern. He hasn't had a chance to govern. There is nothing absurd in suggesting one should hold one's judgement until he does. Anything else is premature. As for his mercurial twists and turns, I feel this a calculated strategy to keep people guessing. This is how he got people to sit up and take notice of him during the campaign. Having found a winning formula, he is sticking to it. For now. Once he takes office, things might change as he has proven capable of being tactful when the situation called for it. Right now, he's still fighting a war as I said (which you ignored altogether). All is fair considering kitchen sinks are being thrown at him. You talk as if he is facing a normal situation with the courtesy of the customary honeymoon period extended to his predecessors. His enemies can't even wait for him to take office and they are already calling for his impeachment. What is absurd is not recognizing the absurdity of the all out war against him. It's rather difficult to be (potentially) presidential under a barrage of abuses, insults and accusations. Those expecting greater poise and dignity from Trump should reflect on their own conduct first.

"I recall Goering's shocking statements, "Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship." and "...the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country." "These, I have come to recognize, are the statements of a psychopath. We have been seeing an eerily similar (functionally identical) process of transformation of our democracy into a pathocratic caricature of itself over a period extending back at least to the Watergate era."

Yet he has refused or is unable to do that." In my humble opinion the current seat of power which includes the Obama Administration, appointees, corporate and MIC pay to play control of the MSM that offers no conveyance of any such communications from Trump or the incoming Administration much less one of or by the people. We all see this in the Russian scare of be afraid, very afraid and the inclusion of Trump as an agent of a foreign threat to discredit what they know is their undoing. That is why I see your "But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship." and "...the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country" as relevant as an answer. Do you not see a possible reason? To try and respond against the MSM megaphone of the status quo in its dying throes is a non starter and would only further the attempts of discrediting. I think it has been the correct response so far and blame the above as the reason. In that light I will with hold criticism rather than succumb to what I see aligned against the changing of power in accordance to our laws and tradition. "The electorate had plenty of reason to expect sensible answers and honest clarity from him during the campaign and, not receiving any of that, it is absurd, IMO, to advise withholding judgment in favor of a wait and see approach." Bernie's common sense delivered by a scholar and a gentleman could not stand against what I consider to be a criminal cabal, why would Trump duplicate a failed challenge to the status quo?

There was nothing stopping him from doing that, but he chose to deliver nonstop inanities and attacks on people instead. Now, as President-elect, he still has the opportunity to address the public on matters of grave concern.

And I hope you don't think I believe you should. This stuff about hacking is irrelevant to me. There is much more that concerns me which Trump should have used tweet time or full page newspaper ads or free TV time to discuss. The electorate is entitled to know what candidates intend to do if elected. We never got that from him, and now that he has been elected he thinks mocking Schwarzenegger is more important than showing statesmanship and leadership. This is frightening.

That is undoubtedly why Americans elected him, because he emphasized that platform. If Trump's past relations with Russia but him in good stead to carry out that policy, more power to it.

The advent of connected cars is creating a new sales battleground, and using a vehicle's windshield may be the next way to pitch more products and services to consumers. McKinsey & Co. estimates that mobile and data-driven services in autos will generate $US1.5 trillion ($2.1 trillion) by 2030. At least part of that will be spent projecting information to drivers and passengers right before their eyes. Related Content Smartphone ads not as annoying as you might think How many more ads will people take? Facebook warns growth will slow "When you think of a person driving and what your needs are when you're on a typical trip, it's food, it's fuel and it's rest stops," said John Butler, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. "Owning the inside of the car is critical, it's really where the money is made. The real value is locked up in the ad opportunity." Advertisement Here's how a smart windshield may work. A driver that's close to running out of petrol would see an alert pop up that notes the fuel situation and offers to find a nearby petrol station. The car's virtual assistant will offer a choice, again on the windshield, of two options, including directions to a station where the driver is eligible for a free cup of coffee -- an ad placed by the petrol company that fits with the driver's buying patterns, also known by his smart car. Panasonic demonstrated technology at CES, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas this week, that lets a driver order and pay for fast food through a heads-up display, before pulling off the freeway to collect it. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Forget using the iPhone in the car - the info may soon be on your windscreen. Photo: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg Pairing such offerings with other connected subscription services could generate hundreds of dollars in additional recurring revenue per car each year, according to Tom Gebhardt, the head of Panasonic's automotive business in North America. "When you start doing payments out of the vehicle, you have to secure those payments somehow, so we're matching the facial recognition with your credit card," he said. "We're really investing in an integrated solution, merging the infotainment system, the instrument cluster and the heads-up display." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Carmakers are considering the ability to push content such as video in front of passengers, says BMW's Klaus Froehlich. Photo: Bloomberg Corning Inc. is starting to sell carmakers the glass used in Apple's iPhones for windshields and in-car entertainment systems. The company said the durability and thinness of the glass means that any image projected onto it is sharper than onto a typical windshield. While the product is less than 25 centimetres wide, Corning is working to expand it to a full windshield-size display. "They could be here in less than two years," Corning Chief Technology Officer Jeff Evenson said in an interview on Thursday. "We're making the car much more active to set things up for these kinds of services." Owning the inside of the car is critical, it's really where the money is made. John Butler Connected cars Turning a car windshield into a billboard is part of broader efforts by automakers and tech companies to transform vehicles into connected devices. Multiple companies at CES this week have announced deals and partnerships that use software, digital voice technology and cloud computing to handle everything from automatically scheduling a maintenance appointment to ordering a take-away pizza while on the road. Automakers such as BMW, Hyundai and Toyota already offer basic heads-up displays near the windshield in some models that show information such as the vehicle's speed. Google parent Alphabet, through its Waze navigation app, suggests nearby restaurants and points of interest during your drive, as does TripAdvisor. The next step is merging these two ideas: projecting points of interest onto your windshield. Eventually mapping and navigational data could be superimposed onto the road in front of the driver, much in the way that Google Street View currently displays information about an area on a static image. BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler acquired Nokia's HERE mapping unit in 2015 to ensure they were no longer dependent on Google for maps. Intel announced Tuesday it had bought a 15 per cent stake in HERE. "This is exactly the sort of thing the high-end carmakers are promoting as part of their highly integrated, immersive 'cockpit' concepts,'" said Richard York, an executive at chip designer ARM Holdings who is responsible for automotive sales. Safety concerns The question of how the technology is regulated remains open, given concerns about driver distraction. For now, suppliers are eager to promote heads-up displays as safety tools. For example, the speed and location of vehicles in a car's blind spot might be projected onto the windshield. "We're going to bring the safety aspect of the vehicles" into the augmented reality products, said Joseph Yoon, head of LG Electronics' automotive research and development team. Boosters also say a windshield display is a safer alternative than drivers taking their eyes off the road to glance down and tap a dashboard infotainment system or check a smartphone. For many years BMW, Volkswagen and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive worked with the Munich-based startup Metaio to investigate possible applications for augmented reality technology in cars, according to someone familiar with Metaio's business. The main hurdle to superimposing an enhanced image for the driver was the "tracking problem" -- establishing the direction of a driver's gaze and adapting the image projected onto the windscreen accordingly, the person said. Metaio was acquired by Apple last year, and ended its contracts with the carmakers. Panasonic's Gebhardt said his company had mastered the technology and is seeking a customer willing to deploy it in a car. People usually understand information presented in an augmented reality format more quickly than on paper or a smartphone, according to Sunny Webb, who leads Accenture's research and development efforts in augmented and virtual reality. That makes AR an appealing medium through which to present location-based ads, as well as safety and contextual information to drivers. "Being able to overlay content in a windshield is a really interesting application," she said. "There's a lot of energy going into how to distribute content to passengers and drivers." First steps Meanwhile, Harman International Industries, the in-car infotainment systems giant in the process of being acquired by Samsung, is moving into heads-up displays. In December it announced an investment in Navdy, a San Francisco-based maker of a projection display that sits on the dashboard in front of the windshield and provides navigation guidance, car behaviour data and smartphone alerts. The two companies will start selling a jointly branded heads-up display this year. Automotive supplier Magna International also is likely to unveil an augmented reality product with a major German carmaker this year, according to someone familiar with the plan. Automakers also are considering the ability to push content such as video in front of passengers in addition to mapping or road services as a way to generate more revenue from each vehicle. "We want to have our direct customer relationship delivering premium services to them and being their direct contact," said Klaus Froehlich, BMW's head of research and development. "That's the clear goal for a premium car manufacturer." Bloomberg Related Content Google drops ban on personally identifiable web tracking 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Conway G. Gittens reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The world's biggest consumer electronics show puts a spotlight on razor-thin laptops, as well as faster and powerful smartphones, and thinner flat panel televisions at the annual event in Las Vegas. The annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is gadget heaven for technology lovers. CES mainstay Intel is hoping to create a new market and some buzz with something called the "Ultrabook." Intel's Merlyn Kister: SOUNDBITE: MERLYN KISTER, INTEL MARKETING (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Ultrabooks marry the best of a tablet. You think of thin and light designs with ultra responsiveness and fast start up, with the full performance of a PC that you know and like; a full keyboard." Tablets, however, have sort of faded in significance at this year's show compared to recent years, as manufacturers admit they can't replicate the success of the Apple iPad. But the industry has also learned another lesson or two from Apple, which does not particpate in CES. Peter Choi of iLuv Marketing: SOUNDBITE: PETER CHOI, ILUV MARKETING (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Apple just designs beautiful products. Again, they design things that consumers need and what we do is bring out the full functionality of these products." And the merging of aesthetic beauty and functionality is evident across the massive 1.8 million square feet of showspace, including these video name tags that can be displayed in clothing and not just on. And speaking of displays...flat panel TVs continue to get thinner and smarter - and the industry has yet to give up on the home 3D market, which has yet to catch on. Smartphones are still the talk of the town as wireless carriers roll out new devices for faster mobile networks. The event is still popular even though there haven't been many ground-breaking products announced in recent years. Microsoft is not expected to come back next year, but Bearking Hsuing of Immersive Motion says CES is still the place for technology companies to get the word out. SOUNDBITE: BEARKING C. HSIUNG, PRESIDENT, IMMERSIVE MOTION (ENGLISH) SAYING: "The CES is the biggest show in the world. We developed the product ourselves and we would like to find a distributor for the worldwide market, especially in the United States." Organizers expect some 140,000 to 150,000 attendees to get first look at some of the new gadgets coming to market, with some 2,700 exhibitors hoping to hit the right beat with consumers.

The historic sense of a face-off that likely will inform one of the most vital relationships in Donald Trump's presidency was captured in a blunt observation by former Obama-appointed CIA chief Leon Panetta, who told NBC: "I've never seen anything like this in my lifetime, [with a President-elect] undermining the credibility of the very intelligence agencies that have to provide information to him in order for him to be president of the United States."

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. And to a point, it seemed that Trump might have seen the wisdom of outgoing Vice-President Joe Biden's advice that it was "absolutely mindless" for a new president to feud with the intelligence services – the President-elect was not too vigorous in his comments after the intelligence showdown at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The guts of the report, by the CIA, FBI and the National Security Agency, was the most detailed formal account to date of what, much to Trump's fury, has been leaked in dribs and drabs in the weeks – that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered a huge cyber attack and influence campaign aiming to deny Hillary Clinton the White House. Related Content Russia aimed to influence US election, top spies tell Trump Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte courts Russia in snub to US This was unprecedented stuff – the spooks were effectively putting a question mark over the legitimacy of the man they will serve as president before he takes the oath of office on January 20. The Russian objective – according to a 25-page, sanitised version of the agencies' classified report – was not to manipulate the actual vote so much as to mess with voters' minds by generating negative coverage of Clinton. Advertisement "Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavourably to him," the report by the nation's intelligence agencies concluded. Without revealing how they acquired the information, the agencies concluded "with high confidence" that Moscow's military intelligence unit, the GRU, had crafted a "persona" called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release damaging emails harvested from the Democrats' computers – and when the release of the emails on DCLeaks.com failed to draw media attention, they were subsequently dumped through WikiLeaks. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Donald Trump has big spending and tax cuts plans. Photo: Evan Vucci/AP Just hours before Friday's intelligence briefing at Trump Tower in Manhattan, the President-elect was spinning his usual line, telling The New York Times that efforts to prove Russian interference was "a political witch-hunt". Just as Trump refuses to accept that he lost the popular national vote by as many as 3 million, he bitterly resents any suggestion that his campaign might have had a Russian leg-up – but a statement he issued after Friday's briefing was notable for the absence of his customary mockery of the intelligence services and the inclusion of an oblique concession that the Russians had intervened. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link US Vice-President-elect Mike Pence has pledged action. Photo: Bloomberg In a separate statement, Vice-President-elect Mike Pence said the new administration would act "to combat cyber attacks and protect the security of the American people from this type of intrusion in the future". In its generality, the report is politically damaging for Trump. And in its particulars it is damaging for his newly appointed national security adviser Michael Flynn – Flynn has a close relationship with RT, the Russian English-language news organisation that American intelligence says is a Kremlin propaganda operation pressed into service in the campaign to cripple Clinton. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Vladimir Putin's people have denied they were spying on Trump.  Photo: AP Intriguingly, in ascribing motives, the agencies conclude that Putin held a grudge against Clinton who, he believed, had denigrated him when, as US secretary of state, she had encouraged pro-democracy protests in Moscow in 2011. He also believed that the US was responsible for the leaking of the so-called Panama Papers, which had embarrassed Putin associates; and for revelations on Russian Olympians' abuse of performance-enhancing drugs. The "Russians did it!" row will not go away any time soon. But it remains to be seen just where the intelligence agencies' report fits in to it. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Illustration: Matt Golding  "This is big: CIA, NSA & FBI publish perhaps the most high-profile intelligence community assessment in US history," Thomas Rid, a professor at King's College London and an expert on cyber warfare, wrote on Twitter.

There’s a lot of excitement in the air and it’s not just because we’re in the middle of CES week. AMD hasn’t been competitive with Intel in what feels like ages, a realization that has allowed Intel to take its foot off the throttle in recent years. Its latest Kaby Lake processor series, for example, is hardly any better than the Skylake chips before it (and Broadwell before it and so on). The hope among enthusiasts is that Ryzen is enough of a threat to force Intel to once again get serious about innovation. AMD is well aware of the situation and isn’t taking the opportunity lightly. Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s Computing and Graphics business, told PCWorld that they aren’t going to do a paper launch of Ryzen. It’s something they’ve done in the past but aren’t going to mess with this time around. Instead, Anderson said Ryzen chips will be available from day one. The key word there is “chips” as in, multiple chips, not just the high-end eight-core, 16-thread model that AMD has been talking up in recent demos. What’s more, AMD product manager Jim Prior revealed to the publication that every Ryzen chip you can buy can be overclocked (assuming you have a capable motherboard, of course). It’s also worth mentioning that only the high-end X370-based AM4 motherboards will support Radeon CrossFire / Nvidia SLI multi-card setups. AMD’s Rob Hallock said data has shown that those who buy mainstream PCs simply don’t get into multi-GPU setups. What’s more, the most popular Radeon cards for CrossFire are the highest-end (expensive) models which aren't what mainstream users will be going after. As for Zen’s lifespan, Papermaster said they aren’t going tick-tock (in reference to the tick-tock release cadence that Intel had utilized for many years before abandoning it with Kaby Lake). Zen, he said, will be tock, tock, tock. Here’s to hoping that roadmap pans out.

Intel kicked off CES with an announcement of Optane modules for the PC.  These m.2-format SSDs sport a speedy PCIe/NVMe interface and use the new Intel/Micron 3D XPoint memory to provide faster performance than can be achieved using NAND flash. Surprisingly the web page used for the kickoff hammers on a theme: “A hard disk drive coupled with Intel Optane memory affordably gives you SSD-like speed while maintaining large storage capacity.”  Given that Intel is a leading SSD supplier, it is odd that the company would work to sell a technology that would serve to undermine its SSD business. The idea of adding an SSD layer to accelerate HDD performance is not a new one to Intel.  The company tried unsuccessfully in 2011 to encourage PCs to use a similar approach with its Ultrabook initiative. Like this week’s announcement, the Ultrabook solution paired a low-capacity SSD with a standard HDD.  In the case of the Ultrabook the target capacity underwent some changes, ranging from 13GB to 20GB, a range similar to the 16GB and 32GB Optane modules being promoted today.   It appears that today’s Optane product, as did the Ultrabook, takes advantage of Intel’s Rapid Storage Technology to manage the SSD cache. The company has been working to insert a flash storage layer into PCs since its Robson/Turbo Memory initiative in 2005. Turbo Memory used Microsoft Windows Vista’s ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive software to manage a USB-connected flash cache. The effort was followed by Intel’s Braidwood initiative, an aborted 2009 effort to add flash modules, roughly similar to DRAM DIMMs, to the PC’s motherboard as a configurable flash layer.  It seems that both of these programs failed because of software issues. All in all, the notion of adding a fast storage layer to the PC is a good idea from the perspective of price/performance.  So far two problems have gotten in the way of its adoption in the PC: Execution, in the form of software support (which was finally solved in the Ultrabook), and marketing, where the value prospect of a costly addition to the PC was completely lost on the consumer. This last will be a key factor with the Optane m.2 card (shown below).  Optane is based on 3D XPoint memory, a new technology that is currently proving to be extremely challenging to bring to production. Intel showed at CES an m.2 Optane board plugging into PCs. (Image: Intel) In order for Optane DIMMs to make sense to the user this new memory technology must be sold for less than DRAM since its performance is lower than that of DRAM.  The trouble is DRAM’s awfully cheap since it’s produced in such enormous volumes. 3D XPoint memory will cost less to manufacture than DRAM once its shipment volume approaches that of DRAM.  The way to reach this shipment volume will be to sell XPoint at a lower cost than DRAM.  This is a classic chicken-and-egg issue. Another key drawback is that an Optane PCIe SSD is only 6-8 times faster than a NAND flash based PCIe SSD. The difference may sound significant, but the Optane SSD is based on the Intel/Micron 3D XPoint memory, a technology that is claimed to be 1,000 times as fast as flash. This huge disparity stems from the use of an SSD block storage interface to communicate with a memory technology.  A detailed explanation of the causes of this slowdown can be found in a blog post I wrote last June. Objective Analysis is not bullish on the prospects of Optane SSDs in PCs.  Between the high cost that can be expected early on in the program’s life and the lack of a clear benefit to the average PC purchaser this program is likely to appeal only to enthusiasts with an unlimited budget. On the other hand, we see a clear path to success for Optane DIMMs in servers, since 3D XPoint’s speed advantage will be unleashed by putting it on the memory bus and since the data center has a much stronger understanding of cost/performance than does the average PC user.  This is spelled out in our October 2015 report: “A Close Look at the Micron/Intel 3D XPoint Memory.” --Jim Handy follows storage technology at Objective Analysis (Los Gatos, Calif.)

It's an OEM play. Games are very large and so are serious apps and the input/output files. Hybrids are hard to benchmark in consumer and show their value even when they offer good value. With 16-32GB capacity, it would compete against DRAM not NAND as more DRAM would offer better value for enthusiasts or proffessionals in desktop. DRAM prices have somewhat doubled vs a year ago and likely to keep rising this year, that could help Xpoint a bit- a lot in server. On the other hand, midrange PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs, retailing at bellow 50 cents per GB, are rather compelling. PCIe 4.0 should help Xpoint and ,soon enough, WD's 3D ReRAM as it would make it easier to show the difference vs NAND. The one odd part is that Intel is about to be kicked out of the enthusiast market in desktop. AMD seems about ready to offer twice the cores at same price point and if Intel ties to keep Optane Intel only, they would severely limit its potential.

Perhaps, in time, the PC business will split into two distinct markets: cloud-based and self-sufficeint.  Let's check back in a decade!

Although I do believe that some of the more sophisticated PC buyers that you mention (gamers, photographers, etc.) will like what Optane m.2 XPoint SSDs will do for their system, I am not convinced that this will drive enough volume to make your first two factors play out.  Time will tell. I agree that a block interface helps to hide a lot of sins.  That's why Samsung's been shipping all of its 3D NAND in SSDs. Thanks for the  info on limited m.2 sockets in notebooks.  I didn't know that. Jim   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: Optane Poor Fit Due to Big HDDs? Jim Handy01   1/12/2017 5:35:37 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Jeffrey,  Good thoughts. I don't think, though, that you need a "faster than DRAM" layer.  That's what the processor caches are for.  Since the speed difference between flash and XPoint is said to be 1,000:1 then XPoint will be a good layer to add between DRAM and an SSD.  Note that Intel is positioning it as a layer between an HDD and DRAM to bridge the same gap that is addressed by an SSD. In the near term we (at Objective Analysis) see 3D XPoint being used as memory, rathe than storage.  There isn't yet off-the-shelf software that can use its persistence.  Over time this will change, but in the near term XPoint should serve as a fast memory layer.  This should appeal to server users, but less so to PC users.

I am a lot more positive on the technology than you appear to be. As long as 3D XPoint memory can sell for less than DRAM and can perform faster than NAND flash then it's a reasonable technology to use as a new layer in the memory/storage hierarchy. My question in this article was whether the average PC buyer would feel comfortable spending money for this feature.  I don't expect for that to happen.  I do expect to see adoption in the server, though.

Shinobee   1/11/2017 8:04:20 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I think there needs to be a distinction whether Optane will try to compete in the storage or memory industry.  Both are quite different, but I will address issues for both. As a storage device, it will be competing with 3DVNAND which currently has a very strong hold on the market.  Even without knowledge of the pricetag, the announced capacities of 16 and 32 gb leaves a lot to be desired, as M.2 and SATA Flash SSDs have already broken the 1TB barrier at not unreasonable prices. Optane does boast some performance advantages such as byte level addressing, and if Optane uses some variation of PCRAM technology, its write/erase speed can be estimated to be in the 100 ns range which is significantly faster than Flash's 1 ~ 2 us erase speed.  Whether those advantages will have significant measurable performance increases to make up for its small capacity to be accepted in the mainstream market however, is extremely doubtful in my opinion. As a memory device, it does boast non volatility, but PCRAM's write speed of 100 ns is unsuitable as a memory application, whereas DRAM can have write speeds of less than 10 ns.  In addition, I haven't seen evidence that Optane has infinite write/erase endurance, which is a requirement for a memory application. While there could be surprises awaiting us, the way it looks now and based on my knowledge in this field, Optane will stand in the shadows of Flash and DRAM, making it a niche product at best.

On my client PC, when I first switched from a rotating hard drive to a first gen SSD at just 300 MB/second, the difference was dramatic.  But when I later upgraded to a 1.5GB/sec SSD, the incremental difference was just barely noticeable.  I only notice faster speeds when transferring large files, but then a cache system doesn't work - you need the entire hard drive to be that fast.       Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Rookie Re: Optane Poor Fit Due to Big HDDs? jgeldman570   1/10/2017 7:20:58 PM Login to Rate Jim,   While Optane (and QuantX) isn't a great fit for the PC market before the spigot turns on to 9, it may turn into one. To be clear, it will be hard for 3DXP to ever surplant NAND ever as cost/die size always matters. But consider the timing: a 2 TB 3DXP SSD this year would be as foolish a product as a 2 TB NAND SSD would have been in 1985 (a year after NAND first shipped). Factor one: From a memory maker's perspective, manufactured wafers must be shipped. This is a solid truth in solid state. There are few technical barriers in the PC market from adoption other than price/performance. The market for block controlled 3DXP will find an economic balance as the early devices want to be sold. Factor two: Nothing helps improve the manufacturing process more than the data of manufacturing. 3DXP (or any memory) needs to be manufactured to improve manufacturing to result in an eventual, volume-supported, high-value memory solution. What to do with the early wafer results? See Factor one. Factor three: The PC market and block usage (vs. memory usage) is more tolerant of 'good' early memory that doesn't meet all specifications as the block controller can do well-known 'magic' to correct many issues. Until the manufacturing process is dialed in to enable the high value memory market with volume, the PC market is a great win-win outlet. Gamers, video processors, pro photographers and other storage centric pro's will see a benefit from an 10x speed up at a cost less than DRAM for 'small' (e.g., 16, 32 GB) accelerators. There are multiple protocol specifications for storage cache/acceleration already developed for NAND/HDD that can be taken advantage of for this application (or a heck of a lot of learning already accomplished). NVMe has some too, One interesting physical barrier is how to shoe-horn a M.2 3DXP-based NVMe device into lap-top/2-in-1 designs (or XBox 2?). The one M.2 slot is often busy with the main M.2 NAND-based NVMe SSD. Perhaps the newer controllers enabling NVMe SSDs in BGA form (e.g., Phison E8T) will tend to free the one slot. Two slots isn't impossible, but this choice is possibly one that Intel is mulling over as we discuss this. (I'd expect the drop in peak performance from a four-lane PCIe NVME M.2 device moving to a two-lane PCIe NVMe BGA device would be more than offset by a four PCIe lane Optane/QuantX M.2) Balancing process/memory/SCM/Flash will happen over time, My educated guess is that Optane/QuantX will start as a performance plugin that will price itself into a supply-absorbing market.

HankWalker   1/10/2017 1:04:35 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Perhaps the issue is that in a corporate environment, today's HDDs are way bigger than needed. It is hard to find a desktop with anything smaller than a 500-1000 GB HDD. But a typical install might be only 50-100 GB, since user files are on a file server. If speed is important, it is probably cheaper to go with 128 GB of SDD than HDD + Optane. For a home PC, fast startup from some flash is probably more cost effective. Even for home PCs the trend is for more cloud storage of user files, which makes all-SDD look attractive, especially considering that SDD instead of HDD and a slower processor might be faster for the same price.

This would mean a whole new breed of enthusiast builds. (Photo : eTeknix/YouTube) At CES 2017, MSI has launched more than 30 brand-new motherboards specifically manufactured to work well with Intel Kaby Lake processor. Lurking somewhere in the corner, a couple of motherboards are also featured, known to be the first desktop AM4 boards to suit the highly anticipated AMD Ryzen processors and the Bristol Ridge APUs. It was also reported that AMD announced just announced a handful of AM4 motherboards hours after the Intel Kaby Lake boards were revealed. That said, the scene at CES 2017 made PC enthusiasts delighted as AMD Ryzen boards go pound-for-pound with Intel Kaby Lake boards. AMD Ryzen Motherboards The MSI X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium for the AMD Ryzen, taking the name from the AM4 X370 chipsets, mimics its Intel Kaby Lake rival board Titanium Z270. The board has lots of first-time features, from DDR4 RAM support to a Game Boost Button, all of which overclocks the game's performance. The AMD Ryzen board also supports M.2 and U.2 solid state drives, holds up to three GPUs, USB 3.0 ports, and a lot more similar features. Another AMD board is the MSI B350 Tomahawk, a toned-down B350 chipset specifically redesigned for Bristol Ridge APUs. With that said, some features will be lacking. It will not have a U.2 slot and it can only fit one M.2 solid state drive as opposed to the Titanium, which can have two. It is also important to note that Bristol Ridge APUs are only available on pre-built systems. Intel Kaby Lake Motherboards A number of Intel Kaby Lake motherboards went on display at MSI's booth. Although there were only a portion of the whole 30 plus boards, the ones present on the show were still overwhelming. MSI displayed them by categories, according to their respective series and models. MSI Enthusiast Gaming series cram in all the bells and whistles gamers would love to have. Starting off with exotic SSDs, to a manual button for gaming performance boost, to Game Boost to superior heat sinks, gamers surely can't wait to have this bad-ass motherboard. On top of that, gamers can plug in up to 3 or 4 graphics cards. Going down to a lower tier, Performance Gaming series pack most of the MSI Enthusiast level boards but will be missing some features. However, this tier makes up for it with their awesome styles. Another set of boards is called the business-centric models. As the name speaks for itself, the purpose of these boards is for everyday computing. The PC specifications are similar to the Performance Gaming series with some deductions. © 2017 Auto World News, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. And to a point, it seemed that Trump might have seen the wisdom of outgoing Vice-President Joe Biden's advice that it was "absolutely mindless" for a new president to feud with the intelligence services – the President-elect was not too vigorous in his comments after the intelligence showdown at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The guts of the report, by the CIA, FBI and the National Security Agency, was the most detailed formal account to date of what, much to Trump's fury, has been leaked in dribs and drabs in the weeks – that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered a huge cyber attack and influence campaign aiming to deny Hillary Clinton the White House. Related Content Russia aimed to influence US election, top spies tell Trump Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte courts Russia in snub to US This was unprecedented stuff – the spooks were effectively putting a question mark over the legitimacy of the man they will serve as president before he takes the oath of office on January 20. The Russian objective – according to a 25-page, sanitised version of the agencies' classified report – was not to manipulate the actual vote so much as to mess with voters' minds by generating negative coverage of Clinton. Advertisement "Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavourably to him," the report by the nation's intelligence agencies concluded. Without revealing how they acquired the information, the agencies concluded "with high confidence" that Moscow's military intelligence unit, the GRU, had crafted a "persona" called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release damaging emails harvested from the Democrats' computers – and when the release of the emails on DCLeaks.com failed to draw media attention, they were subsequently dumped through WikiLeaks.

Just as Trump refuses to accept that he lost the popular national vote by as many as 3 million, he bitterly resents any suggestion that his campaign might have had a Russian leg-up – but a statement he issued after Friday's briefing was notable for the absence of his customary mockery of the intelligence services and the inclusion of an oblique concession that the Russians had intervened.

SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Vladimir Putin's people have denied they were spying on Trump.  Photo: AP Intriguingly, in ascribing motives, the agencies conclude that Putin held a grudge against Clinton who, he believed, had denigrated him when, as US secretary of state, she had encouraged pro-democracy protests in Moscow in 2011. He also believed that the US was responsible for the leaking of the so-called Panama Papers, which had embarrassed Putin associates; and for revelations on Russian Olympians' abuse of performance-enhancing drugs. The "Russians did it!" row will not go away any time soon. But it remains to be seen just where the intelligence agencies' report fits in to it.

Maybe. Susan Hennessey, a former intelligence agency lawyer who now runs the online journal Lawfare, wrote: "The unclassified report is underwhelming at best. There is essentially no new information for those who have been paying attention."

Intel has agreed to purchase a 15% stake in Here, a global provider of digital maps and location-based services for automotive and the “internet of things.” The deal will see Intel acquire the stake from Here’s current indirect shareholders Audi AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG. As part of the investment, Intel and Here signed an agreement to collaborate on the research and development of a proof-of-concept architecture designed to support real-time updates of high-definition maps targeting automated driving. The two firms also plan to jointly explore strategic opportunities targeting edge-computing devices with location data. Intel said should the deal gain regulatory approval it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2017. “We look forward to working with Here and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, in a statement. Last week, Here and Chinese companies NavInfo and Tencent announced a strategic partnership to develop and offer location services for the Chinese market. The deal includes a joint venture in China targeting location services for Chinese and global customers across a range of industries. Based on the JV, Here would extend its services to China making use of NavInfo data and services. The two Chinese companies, together with global investment firm GIC, also announced plans to jointly acquire a 10% stake in Here. Nokia sold its 100% ownership stake in Here in early 2015 to the three German carmakers for $3 billion.

The intel chiefs are highly confident the core motivations behind the extensive Russian campaign were to undermine the integrity of the election, denigrate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and undermine her potential presidency. Although the report states Russia developed a “preference” for Trump late in the campaign, it’s clear they believe the underlying goal was always to hurt Clinton. “We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,” the report states. “Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.” (RELATED: Intel Report Destroys Democrat Talking Point On Leaked Emails) Given the timeline of the hacks and the bad blood between Putin and Clinton, the intel assessment of his motivations isn’t surprising. U.S. intelligence has traced the launch of the hacks as far back as Spring 2015 — months before Trump announced his bid for the presidency — and that launch almost certainly took several months of planning. Trump was a media punchline, if anything, at that point, while Clinton had long been on Putin’s bad side. Their rocky relationships goes back to her tenure as secretary of state and as senator. At one point she accused his party of rigging an election, and Putin accused her of inciting protests against his government. Even Clinton herself has attributed a grudge toward her as the motivation for the Russian hacks. “We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,” the report adds. The New York Times rushed to hype this bit of the assessment, seemingly confirming headlines the paper and other outlets such as The Washington Post have been running for weeks about Russia’s supposed goal of helping Trump. (RELATED: Three Bungled WaPo Stories On Russian Meddling All Show The Same Mistakes) But since the report states Putin’s original intent had nothing to do with Trump, it’s not clear what conclusions can be drawn from Russia’s eventual siding with the president-elect. If Putin wanted to denigrate Clinton, it’s reasonable to assume he would have come to “prefer” any candidate opposing her in the general election. “When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining her expected presidency,” the report adds, making it clear the underlying goal was about hurting Clinton.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

They have several chip samples on hand, and power consumption is all over the map, even running the same processor models at the same clock speed and voltage. Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 23:37 Jeremy Laird says: Bit of a minefield, HDR, especially as it pertains to monitors. I actually don’t think it changes a huge amount. You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. That’s pretty much the reason why I’ve been considering an upgrade from Haswell. And while AMD’s Ryzen sounds promising, I remain skeptical about their ability to deliver on those promises – or that they will leapfrog Kaby Lake.

I hear that there are even grown-ups who play video games, these days. Little Pac-Man and whatnot. That’s ridiculous. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Log in to Reply 07/01/2017 at 15:44 Chorltonwheelie says: Yeah, still see no reason to upgrade from my venerable i5 3570k at all. Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Cpu wise I’m set for another 3 years at least. 4800mhz overclock is running smooth on the 4690k, I’m happy. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank More like this Intel says standalone VR is coming by the end of this year Intel eyes chips for mixed reality headsets Intel's new PC, IoT chief brings fresh ideas to the veteran chip maker Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel offered me a chance to try out its new Project Alloy mixed-reality headset prototype on Thursday. For about five minutes, I tried shooting some digital flying robots from the comfort of a replica living room inside the Las Vegas Convention Center. Project Alloy, first announced at Intel’s developer conference last year, is an untethered headset that blends virtual-reality content with information about the physical world around its wearer. It’s designed to give people more freedom of movement when playing games, and also save people from having to buy an expensive gaming rig to play VR games. Based on my brief experience playing the same game that Intel showed on stage Wednesday, the prototype shows a lot of potential. However, it’s hard to know exactly how that will translate into what consumers will get later this year. Intel revealed Wednesday that it’s working with selected manufacturing partners to make Project Alloy devices available in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the meantime, all we have is the Intel-made prototype. It packs in a pair of RealSense depth cameras positioned basically on either side of the user’s nose, along with two RGB cameras at roughly the user’s eye line, and a pair of fisheye cameras at the edge of the visor. Those sensors can be used to render the wearer's surroundings in virtual reality. Its band design is fairly reminiscent of the PlayStation VR headset, with a curved forehead plate attached to an adjustable headband. There’s a large plastic pack on the back of the headband as well. The shooter game that I played lasted only a few minutes, and the headset seemed comfortable enough at the time. It’s hard to know how comfortable the device would be for longer sessions. And again, because this is just a prototype, it’s possible that the commercial versions will feel completely different. In order to get the game up and running quickly, Intel preloaded all the objects in the room onto the Alloy headset. Unfortunately, my headset’s model of the room I was in had drifted slightly relative to the actual objects in the room. That led to me slamming my shin into a coffee table in the center of the room that was supposed to be several inches away. This problem is supposed to be fixed by using the RealSense cameras to detect the positions of objects in real time. In this case, the headset wasn’t set up to do that. There’s still a lot we don’t know about the final hardware, like exactly when it will be available, how much it will cost, and more. Eli Elhadad, the Intel RealSense studio manager, said during my demo that the shipping version of Alloy will have more powerful hardware than the prototype. It will feature a Kaby Lake-based processor, a 400-series RealSense camera and a graphics processing chip from Movidius, which Intel acquired last year. In each case, those upgrades are supposed to provide better performance. It will also be interesting to see if Intel ends up working with Microsoft. The prototype offers untethered mixed-reality experiences, which would fit nicely with Microsoft’s vision for its Windows Holographic platform. The two companies previously announced that they were working together on Alloy, so it seems likely more will come of that.

The entire Dell PC portfolio features Windows 10 and new 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processors, helping people maximize productivity and creativity while enjoying lifelike viewing experiences.   Dell Canvas – Work at the speed of thought What began as the Dell smart desk concept in 2014 evolved into Dell Canvas—a new category of smart workspace technology that expands creative productivity for content developers and designers. The 27-inch QHD smart workspace can be used at an angle or flat on a desk so professionals can create, communicate and express their thoughts and ideas as naturally as they do with pen on paper. For example, through the use of touch, digital pen and totems, the Dell Canvas turns drawings into part of the digital workflow and enhances collaboration. Developed in partnership with Microsoft Corp. and powered by virtually any Windows 10 device, Dell Canvas plugs seamlessly into software solutions from partners including Adobe, Autodesk, AVID, Dassault Systems, SolidWorks and Microsoft to unleash the creative genius in everyone. The best just got better – XPS 13 adds convertible model; XPS 15 more powerful Dell XPS has won more product awards than any other brand in Dell’s history. Building on that success, Dell is adding the XPS 13 2-in-1, the world’s smallest 13-inch 2-in-1¹, to the beloved XPS family. It offers a 360-degree hinge for multiple productivity and viewing options using Continuum, up to 15 hours of battery life² and eye-popping clarity with a gorgeous QHD+ (5.7M pixels) InfinityEdge touch display—another first for a 2-in-1. The fan-less design keeps it silent and the quick-booting solid state drive has it up and running in seconds. And for business customers, the XPS 13 2-in-1 can be configured with 7th Gen Intel® Core™ vPro™ processors and Dell BIOS and manageability software—all backed by Dell’s global ProSupport services. Also, Dell has updated the XPS 15, the smallest 15.6-inch laptop on the planet¹, with 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processors, NVIDIA Pascal™ architecture - GeForce GTX 100 graphics and a fingerprint reader for password-free logins via Windows Hello with the swipe of a finger. XPS & Precision AIOs – The best sound quality of any all-in-one PC Some All-in-One (AIO) PCs on the market today treat the audio experience as an afterthought. Co-created with Jack Joseph Puig, Grammy™ award winning producer and director of creative innovation at Waves Audio, the new XPS 27 AIO, and its Precision business sibling, crank sound to a whole new level with built-in audio quality that previously required an external sound bar. With full frequency range high-fidelity audio built in, they deliver the best sound available in an AIO with 10 speakers pumping out sound at 50W per channel . The viewing experience is equally impressive with a beautiful 4K Ultra HD (3840 x 2160) edge-to-edge touch display supporting 100 percent Adobe RGB color gamut. The Precision AIO delivers more performance options with Intel® Xeon® processors, AMD Radeon™ Pro graphics capable of powering VR and outstanding reliability with ISV certifications for top programs like AVID and SolidWorks, as well as leading security and manageability software. Dell’s first VR-ready mobile workstation cements Dell’s leadership as virtual reality PC authority Dell is a world leader in virtual reality (VR) with the most PC options in the market including XPS, Alienware and Precision workstations supporting Oculus and HTC headsets. As more headsets fly off the shelves, there is a huge opportunity—and demand—for VR content creators. Enter the Dell Precision 7720 mobile workstation—Dell’s first VR-ready mobile workstation designed specifically for VR content creation. It’s Dell’s most powerful mobile workstation, thanks to the latest 7th Gen Intel® Core™ and Intel® Xeon® processors and NVIDIA Pascal™ Quadro professional graphics. And since it’s a mobile workstation, creators can now develop VR content from anywhere they find inspiration. 5K is so yesterday… Dell expands displays leadership with UltraSharp 32 Ultra HD 8K Monitor The Dell UltraSharp 32 Ultra HD 8K Monitor is the world's first 32-inch 8K resolution display. It has more than 1 billion colors, 33.2M pixels of resolution, 100 percent Adobe RGB and sRGB color gamut and an unprecedented 280 ppi—which is four times more content than Ultra HD 4K resolution and 16 times more content than Full HD. Monitors offering this extreme level of resolution and Dell PremierColor clarity and gradation are important in commercial fields where in-depth image zooming is critical—such as photo and video editing, medicine and diagnostic research, and oil and gas exploration—all among the early adopters of this technology. Plus its near borderless display gives customers 32 inches of screen real estate in a highly compact package. Additionally, Dell is announcing several new monitors with its new HDR feature³ to enhance the visual experience through a wider range of colors for exceptionally vivid images, higher clarity with visibly vibrant textures and increased contrast to capture a multitude of natural shades and hues. New monitors with the HDR feature include: the Dell 27 Ultrathin Monitor with a contemporary design, the world’s thinnest profile in its class, InfinityEdge display, Quad HD technology and USB Type-C connectivity as well as the Dell 24 and 27 InfinityEdge Monitors, which also feature dual 6W external speakers professionally tuned by award-winning Waves Maxx Audio. The ultimate “no wires” experience coming soon with the world’s first wireless charging 2-in-1 Wireless connectivity has been widespread in notebooks for years, but there’s one wire that has always remained in the equation—the power cord. Dell will deliver a true wireless experience by incorporating WiTricity magnetic resonance wireless charging technology in the 12-inch Latitude 7285 2-in-1 available later this year. When combined with a charging mat and WiGig wireless dock, users can take the Latitude 2-in-1 with them without disengaging any wires or a physical dock. And when they return to their desk and set the 2-in-1 on the charging mat, it begins charging, automatically reconnects to the WiGig dock and content appears on the external display. More information about the Latitude 7285 2-in-1 and wireless charging will follow at Dell EMC World in May. Dell consumer and commercial devices refresh Dell’s line of XPS, Inspiron and Alienware consumer devices and OptiPlex, Latitude and Precision commercial products get upgraded with 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processors, USB-C with Thunderbolt™ 3 connectivity options and updated professional graphics from NVIDIA and AMD. Dell is also refreshing its monitor lineup, continuing its global leadership in displays. Products built for business also feature 7th Gen Intel® Core™ vPro™ and Xeon® processors and new ultrathin notebook and 2-in-1 designs—reflecting customer demands for thin and light professional products that don’t compromise on productivity, security and manageability. For example, Dell expands its leadership in workstations with the Precision 5520, the world’s lightest 15-inch mobile workstation and a darling among creative professionals.The Latitude 7000 Series Ultrabooks™ and an award-winning 12-inch Latitude 5000 Series 2-in-1 are also added to the lineup. This detachable 2-in-1 weighs less than 2lbs, features a unique auto-deploy kickstand that extends up to 150 degrees for multiple viewing angles and has multiple connectivity options. For desktop lovers looking for space-saving designs, Dell has redefined the desktop experience with the new OptiPlex 5250 AIO and an updated line of OptiPlex small and micro form factor desktops. These sleek products provide full desktop performance and productivity in compact chassis that can be mounted behind corresponding displays with our innovative AIO stands or under a table to free up desk space.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte congratulates Donald Trump on his election win and says he now wishes to stop quarreling with ally, the United States. "Friends, long live…that's from the heart," he told top Russian naval officers, thumping his chest. The comments came after Russia's ambassador to the Philippines, Igor Khovaev, said his country is ready to supply the Philippines with sophisticated weapons.

Mr Duterte's reaching out to Russia at a time of heightened tensions between the out-going US administration and Russia over telephone hacking during the US election is a further blow to Barack Obama's key strategy to "pivot" US forces and diplomatic emphasis to Asia.

The US's criticism of the killings prompted Mr Duterte to tell Mr Obama to "go to hell" and to call him the "son of a whore." Professor Heydarian said Mr Trump's tough approach to China is likely to benefit the Philippines. "For Duterte, this means the Philippines could step back and let the two superpowers slug it out in the high seas, while Manila tries to reap the benefits of friendly ties with Beijing and Washington," said Professor Heydarian, the author of Asia's New Battlefield: The US, China and the Struggle for Western Pacific. "For the Philippine leader it is best to keep out of the clash of the titans," he said. Mr Duterte, who has been described as the "Trump of Asia," has praised Mr Trump and said he hopes to boost business with the US during his time in office.  In November, Mr Duterte appointed Philippine real estate tycoon Jose Antonio to be US trade envoy. Mr Antonio built the almost completed US$150 million 57-storey Trump Tower in Manila, through his Century Propertries Group. "I've always loved the Philippines," Mr Trump says the Trump Tower Manila website. "I think it's just a special place and Manila is one of Asia's spectacular cities," he says.

Russian Ambassador to the Philippines, Igor Anatolyevich Khovaev, reiterated Moscow's support, stating they are willing to provide sophisticated arms to the Philippines, including light weapons, submarines and helicopters. Moscow is no novice when it comes to dealing with terrorism, with Islamic militants continuing to threaten Russia's stability until this day. Most of the terror attacks stem from instability in Chechnya, a region that historically fought for independence from Moscow. Related Content Duterte threatens to throw corrupt officials out of a helicopter Rodrigo Duterte must be investigated, says UN official Although most acts of terrorism are confined to Chechnya and neighbouring Dagestan, occasionally Islamic militants have conducted terror operations elsewhere in Russia, most notably the 1999 Russian apartment bombings, the 2002 Moscow theatre hostage crisis, and the 2004 Beslan School siege. In 2013 alone, 31 terrorist attacks claimed 40 lives and injured dozens more, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia. Moscow has adopted a policy of collective punishment, whereby the entire population of Chechnya has suffered as a result of Islamic militancy. Putin led the campaign against Chechnya, being accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity along the way in an attempt to put an end to the terrorist attacks. Human rights are regularly dismissed in defiance of the law in order to advance counter-terrorism operations.  Advertisement For decades, 8252 kilometres away from Moscow, Manila has been facing an Islamic insurgency in the southern island of Mindanao. Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani formed a violent extremist group in the Philippines known as Abu Sayyaf, who split from the separatist movement Moro National Liberation in 1991. Today, Abu Sayyaf seeks an independent Islamic state on Mindanao, not so different from the Caucasus Emirate in southwest Russia, who aspire to expel Russia from the North Caucasus and create an Islamic emirate in its place.

"I have six years to do it. I do not know how many concessions God can [give], but he made me a President, so I hope He helps me," he said. With the threat of battle-hardened Islamic State fighters returning from the Middle-East to South-East Asia, aspiring to create a caliphate in the region, the prospect of terrorism is growing. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Russia's Rear Admiral Eduard Mikhailov, front right, leads the way as he guides Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at the anti-submarine navy ship docked in Manila, Philippines. Photo: AP In the past, the Philippine military have tried to halt terrorist gangs such as Abu Sayyaf with support from the United States and Australia to little avail. The new relationship with Russia offers an alternative. According to officials, the Philippines is "open to cooperating with the Russian Ministry of Defense through education and training exchanges on counter-terrorism operations". Duterte has shown a liking to Putin's brash politics, often emphasising his admiration for the Russian president. The two men met for the first time at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leader's meeting in Lima, Peru last November. "You know, we have become fast friends", Duterte said in the aftermath. Putin and Duterte claim to share not only a mutual understanding of Western hypocrisy in global affairs, but similar outlooks on how to best handle terrorism. According to Duterte, Indonesian and Malaysian authorities have permission to bomb fleeing Filipino militants and their hostages at sea. "[B]omb them. If they cannot be captured, you bomb them. How about the hostages? Eh, bomb them also," he allegedly told Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and Indonesian President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo. For Duterte, the loss of civilian life is justified if it means combating terror. Putin has regularly conducted operations in a similar way, ignoring large-scale loss of civilian life in its counter-terrorism campaign, most notably in 2002 and 2004. Taking counter-terrorism advice from Putin may suit Duterte, but it will undermine the rule of law in the Philippines as it has in Russia. At present Duterte's "war on drugs" is making headlines with the death roll reaching 6200 since his election. But the second war Duterte may decide to wage, the "war on terror", is just around the corner, which may prove equally damaging for the country.

Credit: Intel More like this Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 will have Intel's superfast Optane storage Intel's silence on Optane SSDs raises questions about launch and focus Intel unveils its Optane hyperfast memory Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD Intel is known for cranking up PC speeds to new highs, and it's doing the same for storage with the super-fast Optane. Optane, which Intel claims will replace today's SSDs and DRAM, is exciting for many reasons. Game play, PC booting, and productivity applications will be much faster with the new class of storage and memory. Intel has said Optane could be up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs, but real-world tests on the storage have yet to be done. The first Optane storage was announced at CES, but it's only in the form of low-capacity 16GB and 32GB units to be used as cache and not as primary storage. The initial Optanes will not have a meaty capacity, but it will be a good start to test and play with the storage, said Pat Kannar, marketing director for Precision desktops at Dell. "You are going to see it roll in higher densities and capacities over the next few years, and different form factors too," Kannar said. Optane still remains a bit of a mystery, but here's what we know based on data gathered from Intel and PC makers. What is Optane? Optane is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, in which memory cells sit in a three-dimensional mesh. Intel and Micron -- which share many memory manufacturing resources -- cooperated on the development of the technology. The first 16GB and 32GB storage will work only on PCs with Kaby Lake chips. It won't work on PCs with older Intel chips like Skylake or Broadwell or on PCs with AMD chips. While the new Optanes are exclusive to Kaby Lake, that could change in the future.  Ultimately, Intel will ship large-capacity Optane SSDs, which will replace conventional SSDs. Intel will also ship the versatile Optane as a DRAM replacement that could plug into DIMM slots. The Optane memory will be denser and retain data, unlike DRAM, which deletes data once a PC is turned off. When will Optane ship? Intel says the low-capacity Optane storage will ship in the second quarter of this year, and PC makers indicated it could be a while before large-capacity Optane SSDs are available. The large-capacity Optane SSDs will likely be installed in servers before coming to PCs. Facebook and IBM are already testing large-capacity SSDs in servers. Like any new storage technology, Optane won't be cheap. Optane technology is still being produced in limited quantities in a factory in Dalian, China. Production will ramp up over time, reducing the cost of making Optane. Intel is projecting a quick switch to mass production, when prices will start dropping. What systems will Optane be used in? Many PCs that will have the 16GB or 32GB Optane storage installed were announced at CES this week. The storage initially will go into sockets on motherboards. Ultimately, you'll be able to plug large-capacity Optane storage into m.2 or 2.5-inch slots. The first laptop announced was Lenovo's ThinkPad T570, with a price starting at $909. It'll have an optional 16GB Optane PCIe M.2 2242-S3, but the laptop's price will shoot up if you select that storage option. The laptop will ship in March, though the Optane option may be available later. HP's revamped Envy Curved All-in-One 34 with Kaby Lake will get Optane during the spring update to the product, said Mike Nash, vice president of product management for consumer PC and solutions at the company. Nash declined to provide a specific timeline, but it is in line with Intel's planned second-quarter release of Optane. Dell plans to install Optane in some of its Precision laptops and OptiPlex desktops around June. Intel's new "tall" NUC systems -- the NUC7i3BNH with 7th Generation Core i3, NUC7i5BNH with Core i5, and the NUC7i7BNH with Core i7 -- will support Optane. Supermicro also announced new SuperO motherboards for gaming and business PCs with support for Optane. Optane could make hard drives relevant again For Dell's Kannar, Optane will make it feasible to put traditional hard drives into laptops or desktops, especially if you are on a budget. A PC with a hard drive as primary storage and an Optane cache could load the OS and applications faster than an all-SSD system, Kannar said. The trick is that Optane -- which is closer to the CPU -- would need to hold images of the OS and key applications. "It's cheaper to do that in some cases than having an all-SSD system," Kannar said.  But, of course, having Optane alongside SSD as primary storage will be much faster, but more expensive. Optane is plug-and-play for Windows There are also questions of how Optane will work with various OSes. Intel has said software will need to be adjusted to effectively work with Optane. PC makers said it's likely Windows 10 will be aware of Optane, thanks to Intel drivers and technologies like the chipmaker's RST (Rapid Storage Technology), which will harness the speed of Optane. Questions still remain on whether Linux and MacOS will have similar plug-and-play capabilities. Linux is notorious for being late on adding support for new technologies.

Cook's $US8.75 million ($12 million) disclosed compensation for fiscal 2016, including a $US3 million salary and $US5.37 million cash bonus, doesn't account for 1.26 million shares delivered from the big award he received after becoming Apple's CEO. They were worth about $US136 million ($186 million) when they vested -- the biggest distribution Cook has received in a single year from the award. The value of the shares isn't included in the proxy filing's summary compensation table since it only lists new equity grants. Related Content Apple just posted its first sales decline in 15 years Apple has turned its back on Mac loyalists The windfall is a huge jump from 2015 when the CEO received $US10 million in salary and bonus, and $US64.2 million in stock from his 2011 promotion award. The bulk of the shares for fiscal 2016 weren't tied to performance and therefore not at risk of forfeiture even as Apple reported its first annual sales decline since 2001. Recent versions of the iPhone, Apple's biggest revenue generator, haven't inspired automatic upgrades the way earlier models did. Competitors in China are churning out cheaper devices while developed countries are reaching the saturation point. Advertisement The board granted Cook 1 million restricted shares set to vest in two increments over a decade when he took over the California-based company in 2011. In 2013, the compensation committee tied one third of the shares to the company's relative stock performance versus the S&P 500 at Cook's own request, and scheduled the shares to pay out annually. A year later, the company made a 7-for-1 stock split. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Apple CEO Tim Cook made close to $200 million last year even though the iPhone maker reported its first annual sales decline since 2001. Photo: David Paul Morris Cook got all 280,000 performance-linked shares earmarked for 2016 since Apple's stock return over the three years ended August 24 was in the top third among businesses in the index. He also received 980,000 shares tied to him remaining on the job. Combined with previous payouts, Cook has collected stock worth more than $US350 million ($479 million) since he became CEO. He's also on track to get half of the shares tied to relative stock return and scheduled to pay out in August 2017 and 2018 based on three-year shareholder returns, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The iPhone-maker's 2016 calendar year stock return including dividends topped 12 per cent, beating almost half of S&P 500 businesses. Equity awards for senior vice presidents Angela Ahrendts, Eddy Cue, Luca Maestri, Dan Riccio and Bruce Sewell are also partially tied to Apple's relative stock return over three years. The remainder typically vests within four-and-a-half years after they're granted. The cash bonuses paid out below target as the company missed net sales and operating income goals. Absent from Apple's compensation disclosures is Chief Design Officer Jony Ive, called by some the company's most important employee. Ive designed many of Apple's most iconic products including the iMac, iPod and iPhone. Apple representatives didn't immediately respond to a call and an email sent outside business hours.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 6, 2017 at 5:00PM Earlier this week, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released a second wave of chips from its seventh-generation Core processor family, also commonly referred to by the code name Kaby Lake. Image source: Intel.  The company released an initial set of processors based on this architecture targeted at thin-and-light/2-in-1 computers late last year, but now the company is releasing chips to target the broader personal computer market. These chips will power desktop computers, high-performance notebooks, and other devices. Here are three things that investors should know about these new chips. They're built using 14-nanometer+ technology In the past, Intel would usually transition to a new manufacturing technology (named "[XY]-nanometer"), build two generations' worth of products using that technology, and then transition to an all-new manufacturing technology. These all-new technologies were expected to deliver benefits in terms of performance, power consumption, and chip area. However, due to the difficulties associated with transitioning to the company's upcoming 10-nanometer technology, the company's latest processors are built on a performance-enhanced variant of the company's 14-nanometer technology, known as 14-nanometer+. This technology allowed the company to deliver more performance with this product family without having to grapple with the challenges associated with an unhealthy manufacturing technology. The catch? Intel doesn't get a chip-area reduction with this new technology. The 14-nanometer+ technology is likely in good shape at this point, meaning that the company is unlikely to face cost-structure problems or supply constraints as it did in the early innings of the transition from 22-nanometer technology to 14-nanometer technology. Image source: Intel.  Big boosts for low-power laptops The biggest gains in performance relative to the prior-generation sixth-generation Core processors, or Skylake processor family, seem to come in power-constrained mobile form factors. For example, Intel's seventh-generation Core processor lineup includes a chip known as the Core i7-7560U. This is a dual-core processor rated at a 15-watt thermal-design power, complete with the company's Iris Plus graphics technology. The chip runs at a base speed of 2.4GHz, a single-core turbo speed of 3.8GHz, and a dual-core turbo speed of 3.7GHz. The direct predecessor to this chip, known as the Core i7-6560U, ran at a base speed of 2.2GHz, a single-core turbo speed of 3.2GHz, and a dual-core turbo speed of 3.1GHz. That's an 18.75% gain in single-core frequency and a 19.35% gain in dual-core turbo frequency -- both substantial uplifts in performance. In higher performance/power products, there are still gains, but they're less substantial. The company's workhorse in gaming laptops, the 45-watt Core i7-6700HQ, ran at a base speed of 2.6GHz and offered single-, dual-, and quad-core turbo speeds of 3.5GHz, 3.3GHz, and 3.1GHz, respectively. The follow-on to this part, the Core i7-7700HQ, runs at a base speed of 2.8GHz, and offers single-, dual-, and quad-core turbo speeds of 3.8GHz, 3.6GHz, and 3.4GHz, respectively. The frequency gains here are between 8.5% and 10% -- tangible performance increases, to be sure, but not quite as robust as the gains seen in the very low-power processors. Whatever improvements Intel made to the manufacturing technology and the chip design appear to have been geared more at lower-power chips -- the bulk of the market -- rather than the higher-power/performance models. The lineup is all done There have been rumors making the rounds that Intel is planning a processor known as Kaby Lake-Refresh U -- essentially, variants of the 15-watt Kaby Lake chips that just launched, but with four processor cores instead of just two. Given that these appeared to be called Kaby Lake, it wasn't clear whether or not these chips would be part of, perhaps, a third wave of seventh-generation Core processors that would launch later. However, thanks to a relatively new leak from generally reliable website BenchLife.info, it appears that Intel plans to kick off the eighth-generation Core processor family with these chips. This strongly suggests, then, that Intel has completed the rollout of its seventh-generation Core processors. Investor takeaway Intel has made it clear that it aims to deliver new products to the marketplace on an annual cadence, irrespective of any challenges that the company faces in trying to migrate to all-new manufacturing technologies. With the seventh-generation Core lineup, it looks as though the company has made good on bringing enhanced products to the marketplace, with the improvements most evident in the segments of the market that are most sensitive to power consumption/power efficiency. That said, a single data point doesn't make a trend -- it'll be interesting to see if Intel can sustain this annual product cadence over a longer time horizon. After all, Intel's prior Tick-Tock methodology worked great early on, but execution problems cropped up, leading the company to formally abandon the methodology after less than a decade -- with cracks in the armor showing up well before then.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing AMD declares Ryzen will be a four-year architecture, details overclocking plans, emphasizes hard launch AMD declares Ryzen will be a four-year architecture, details overclocking plans, emphasizes hard launch By Joel Hruska on January 6, 2017 at 5:08 pm Comment AMD released some additional information about its upcoming Ryzen chips at CES this week. Having spent over four years designing the architecture, the company plans to keep it around for at least that long. That’s according to CTO Mark Papermaster, who was on-hand to discuss the chip. First things first — AMD is promising a hard launch for Ryzen, without any paper launches, limited availability, or limited product introductions. When Zen debuts it’ll debut in multiple (still unknown) configurations, not a single eight-core part. As PCWorld details, Papermaster also confirmed the four-year target and emphasized that it didn’t mean AMD wouldn’t iterate the core. “We’re not going tick-tock,” Papermaster said. “Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock.” There are several ways to read this sentence. Tick-tock refers to Intel’s previous practice of introducing new CPU architectures in one product cycle and new manufacturing nodes in the other. AMD has never strictly deployed an equivalent approach over multiple product cycles. I wouldn’t necessarily conclude that Papermaster is saying AMD won’t deploy Zen on new manufacturing nodes over time, but that AMD intends to implement an aggressive series of tweaks and improvements to the current core as time goes by. There’s a significant lag between when a design tapes out and when it ships to consumers. This means AMD’s CPU design team is almost certainly hard at work on Zen’s successor already, even though Zen hasn’t actually shipped yet. While I can’t make any concrete predictions about how Zen will compete against specific products in Intel’s lineup, the demos we’ve seen and the product information already available has convinced me that Ryzen will be at least a meaningful and significant improvement on AMD’s overall power efficiency, performance, and performance-per-watt. With Intel’s CPU performance largely stuck and performance gains relegated to single-digit increases year-on-year, there’s a great deal of excitement for Ryzen. Even if it doesn’t seize the pole position from every price point, there’s pent-up demand for strong parts at good pricing. AMD wants to capitalize on that, and the best way to do so is to keep delivering core improvements year-over-year. I think we can reasonably look forward to that. The first Ryzen APUs are probably going to be DDR4-based, but there’s no reason for AMD not to push into HBM2 as that standard becomes more affordable. Power consumption and efficiency will continue to be important targets in years to come because AMD is unlikely to match Intel clock-for-clock and core-for-core with its very first launch. Ryzen is the beginning of AMD’s comeback, not the end of it, and setting a four-year target for the architecture now makes sense. It also gives AMD time to think about what it wants to come next. Intel’s Kaby Lake debut this week didn’t do much to excite the enthusiast community, but we’ll have a much better sense of how the two chips compare once we get a little closer to Ryzen’s still-unspecified (Q1) launch date. Overclocking features, Crossfire Meanwhile, PCWorld’s Brad Chacos reports on some interesting news on the overclocking front. All AMD Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked and overclockable, but only three motherboard chipsets — X370, X300, and B350 will have overclocking support. If current rumors are accurate, that corresponds to the upcoming enthusiast-class chipset (X370), mainstream (X300), and small form factor (X300) chipsets. That’s most of the chipsets AMD is launching (most of the non-budget ones, at least) and should cover virtually the entire overclocking market. AMD motherboards have historically been cheaper than their Intel counterparts, so this shouldn’t be a major issue. Crossfire and SLI support will only be implemented on the X370, however. According to AMD, the relative handful of people who use multi-GPUs always use higher-end motherboards. Practically, this makes sense, since most people can’t afford or don’t want a second card, and if you do want one, you can probably afford a slightly more expensive motherboard. Given the typical price gap between AMD and Intel we don’t see this being a major issue, either.

Her husband, Hernan Rivera, said he had "no idea" why Santiago might have opened fire in the Florida airport. "Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good," Rivera said. A spokeswoman for the Alaska National Guard confirmed to NBC News that Esteban Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007, and deployed to Iraq from April 23, 2010 to February 19, 2011.  He was then in the Army Reserves before joining the Alaska Army National Guard on November 21, 2014. He received a general discharge from the Alaska Army National Guard on August 16, 2016, for unsatisfactory performance, the spokeswoman said.  Esteban Santiago was a combat engineer and his rank was private first class when he was discharged.  His brother also confirmed that Esteban owned a handgun.  Fairfax Media Advertisement Most Popular If you thought you'd deciphered Trump's master tweeting plan, you're probably wrong Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent 'Pence could be the most powerful VP ever, or he could be kicked to the curb really fast' CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Pendant identical to Anne Frank's found at notorious Nazi camp Follow Fairfax Foreign Share on FacebookFacebook Share on TwitterTwitter Follow SMH Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on EmailNewsletters Advertisement Most Viewed Today Previous slide Next slide World Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Video shows police tackling and beating a black man suspected of stealing a car.

It has a motherboard, memory, storage, Wi-Fi radio and can even pack Intel's latest Kaby Lake processor. Yet it's only about with size and thickness of a few credit cards. You insert it into any dumb monitor and instantly have a computer as powerful as your laptop. When I was first told about the Compute Card, I expected something a little smaller than a Raspberry Pi, with exposed circuit boards and ports, but this tiny computer is housed inside a thin case of metal. It can be dropped in a pocket or forgotten in your backpack with ease. And as far as Intel and many of its partners are concerned, the Compute Card is the future of computing. The Compute Card port, a new, as yet unnamed, standard. What's really extraordinary about the Compute Card isn't its minuscule size, but its consistency. No matter the specs of the Compute Card it will always the same 5mm thick device with the exact same port (as yet unnamed, but its similar to a PCI Express bus). Which means a smart fridge built with a Compute Card slot can instantly be upgraded. The same goes for a smart hub or smart TV — The Compute Card will allow you to make these devices smart again when their brains become obsolete after a couple of years. The size of the thing could also make it easy for people who split their work between a home computer and work computer. Instead of lugging home a 1kg-plus laptop you can just pop the Compute Card out of one dock, take it home and pop it into another, with all your files, processes and settings remaining unchanged. A dock concept built by Intel. That silver bar? That's the end of the Compute Card. But it's going to be a while before everyone in your family owns a Compute Card. The uber-tiny device was built in collaboration with Foxconn, a major electronics manufacturer (and as of recently, the owner of Sharp), and will first be appearing, not on the back of your monitor, or slotted into your phone, but inside Sharp displays, like those giant ones you see at shopping centres and hotels and schools. Sharp and Foxconn are thrilled at the development of the Compute Card, with Foxconn Executive VP & General Manager Mark Chien telling Gizmodo he expects to see it not just in Sharp products, but in other Foxconn devices such as smart vending machines and Foxconn's own automated factories. The dock built by Sharp and put on the back of it's displays meant for business and education markets. But Foxconn's involvement doesn't just mean more automated factories and cool Sharp displays. Foxconn builds the products for nearly every single major computer manufacturer in the US. Apple, Dell, Lenovo and HP all have their products pieced together in Foxconn factories, and Foxconn's enthusiasm over the Compute Card will absolutely trickle down to those mega-corporate customers. The Compute Card will be launching later this year, with major announcements promised at Computex in Taiwan in May. There's no word on pricing, and Intel stresses that although anyone can buy a Compute Card when they're available, you will still need to build the dock to power the device and cool it, and that will likely be outside the realm of possibilities for your average tinkerer.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Intel announces its first 5G modem, 5Gbps download speeds to launch late 2017 By John Hoff - January 6, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Intel is preparing for the influx of “billions” of IoT (internet-of-things) devices in 2017 and onwards, and for that the internet needs to be ready with a new standard. Intel is announcing a mature 5G modem which will be ready by end of 2017, a new standard to deal with the “things” that will connect to it. What is 5G? Well, if we’re talking of download speeds, the Intel 5G modem satisfies that standard – hitting 5Gbps download speeds through bandwidth aggregation and usage of ultra-low latency frequencies. This standard uses a gamut of technologies, including MIMO configurations, advanced channel coding, and interworking with 4G as fallback. See the video below for better information on the new standard. The main problem is that most of the world’s infrastructure is just now catching up to 4G even, and Intel says these “aren’t designed to accommodate the massive bandwidth required to support such an evolution, or the ultra-low latency needed to allow devices or even vehicles to react to split-second events.” The Intel 5G modem stands out in that the modem is able to work, after a fashion, with today’s infrastructure. Intel is eyeing a sample modem available by second half of 2017, and mass manufacturing to follow right after. Expect a number of tech companies to catch up with 5G as well starting at the middle of this year.

CyberPowerPC and Syber Gaming are certainly making the most of the moment, and have announced plans for refreshing their desktop and notebook lines with 2017's hot hardware. The Syber Gaming XL Series of desktops is coming in the second quarter of 2017. These rigs will be housed in a massive enclosure, spacious enough for elaborate liquid cooling systems and just about any combination of processor and graphics cards that buyers ask the company to install. Intel's Broadwell-E processors and the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors are available, and even AMD's upcoming Ryzen CPUs are on the list. Next up is the CyberPowerPC Hyper Liquid Series, fitted with the company's hard-tube liquid cooling system. The company claims that its system is 14% better at cooling an overclocked CPU than a Corsair H55, and 27% better at cooling GPUs than regular coolers. There are over five models in this line, and like the Syber Gaming XL series, buyers chan choose among a wide range of internal hardware, including Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs and the upcoming Ryzen processors. Finally, CyberPowerPC has big plans for its gaming notebooks this year. It plans to refresh the majority of its gaming laptops to be ready for the heavy duties of powering virtual reality headsets. The company says it will release models with GeForce GTX 1060 and higher graphics cards for that purpose. CyberPowerPC also has two series of notebooks. The Vector II-Z laptops, available in 15.6" and 17.3" form factors, have 1080p IPS displays, a Core i7-7700HQ CPU, and get their graphics muscle from either GTX 1060 or GTX 1070 graphics cards. Meanwhile, the Tracer II laptops are designed to be ultraportable, though the company didn't specify their sizes. Those machines come equipped with a Core i7-7700HQ, and a choice of GeForce GTX 1050 Ti or GTX 1060 cards. The availability of these desktops and notebooks depends on the hardware inside, as AMD's Ryzen CPUs aren't exactly for sale yet. We don't have pricing on the company's notebooks yet, but the Syber Gaming XL series of desktops starts at $1,000, while the Hyper Liquid series ranges from $1,550 to $6,590. CyberPowerPC backs its full-assembled systems with a limited three-year warranty and liftetime technical support via chat, email or telephone.   Tags: Systems Mobile computing Gaming User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

But experts say preventing attacks like the one on Friday, when a gunman opened fire in a baggage claim area at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, is almost impossible given the large public areas at US airports, despite the billions of dollars spent on security.

More videos Multiple people dead in Florida airport shooting At least nine people have been wounded and multiple people killed in a shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, with officials saying the shooter is in custody. "To the extent it was not in a secure area, it doesn't really identify any issues around airport security," said Robert Mann, an aviation consultant. "A guy walks into a bar, a guy walks into an airport baggage claim room - neither of them are secure." Friday's attack killed five people and injured at least eight, authorities said. Related Content Multiple fatalities, injuries in shooting at Fort Lauderdale Airport, Florida The gunman had arrived on a flight with a checked gun in his bag, Broward County Commissioner Chip LaMarca said on Twitter. The shooter claimed his bag and went to the bathroom to load the gun before coming out and firing, LaMarca said. The shooter was unharmed as law enforcement officers never fired a shot, Israel said, adding it was too early to assign a motive. Advertisement The shooter was identified as Esteban Santiago, 26, and had a US military identification, according to a spokesman for US Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who spoke with officials at the Transportation Security Administration. Security at most major airports worldwide is generally focused on protecting aircraft from potential attackers and deadly devices, rather than the airports themselves. As a result, much of the space at terminals is easily accessible to the public, with no formal screening before passengers go through checkpoints to get to their departure gates. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Hundreds of people were evacuated to the tarmac amid the shooting at Fort Lauderdale.  Photo: AP The debate over whether to extend security screening to public areas intensified following the bombings inside a terminal at Brussels Airport in March 2016, which killed 32 people and injured hundreds. Some critics have cited as a model Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, where private security companies trained by the national security agency Shin Bet and backed by police officers profile passengers, question individual travellers and use bomb detectors at the airport's entrance.

"It is logistically impractical to try to protect these areas, unfortunately, and the reason is no matter how far you move the boundary out, you will always have some sort of soft target area," Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst, said. It is logistically impractical to try to protect these areas, unfortunately. Henry Harteveldt; airline industry analyst The cost of implementing that type of screening would also be prohibitive, given the number of major US airports. In response to the Florida shooting, law enforcement agencies at several US airports said they beefed up security presence, including in Chicago and New York. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link A law enforcement officer evacuates a civilian from an area at Fort Lauderdale. Photo: AP Friday's shooting, in which the gunman apparently retrieved a checked gun from his luggage, loaded it in a bathroom and then opened fire, could prompt debate about whether travellers should be permitted to stow guns in checked bags, Harteveldt said. Addressing one potential danger often simply creates an opportunity for another type of threat, Mann said. "It's essentially whack-a-mole," Mann said. "That's what security has always been."  Reuters 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

The PCC itself was targeted on Sunday in neighbouring Amazonas state in Brazil's worst prison slaughter for more than two decades. In a mobile phone video that circulated widely on social media, self-described PCC members are seen hacking away at bodies littering an outdoor patio inside the prison.

Look here, look what is going to happen you! This is revenge for what you did to our brothers," a PCC member is heard saying on the video as dozens of bodies lie in thick pools of blood. State officials said the riot in Roraima's largest prison was brought under control by elite police forces. Violence between rival drug gangs there had already led to 10 deaths in October. Advertisement Roraima's top security official Uziel de Castro blamed Friday's violence at the state-run prison on the PCC. He later added that it was believed most of the inmates killed Friday were not members of the group responsible for this week's attack on the PCC in Amazonas and indeed had no gang affiliations.

Roston - Jan 6, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit In addition to its new RennSeat Pro gaming station, Velocity Micro has unveiled new desktop computers offering 7th-generation Intel Core processors. The company hawks these desktops as solutions for gamers, as well as being suitable for office and home use, and for use as workstations. Unlike the RennSeat Pro, these new desktops are available to purchase now from Velocity Micro. It seems the new desktops are renditions of the company’s previous models, only with updated Intel processors, as well as Intel 200-Series chipset motherboards. The company says the clock speeds are faster than that of the previous models, and there’s also improved graphics included. The company’s website shows a bunch of desktop models with the newest Intel hardware, including the company’s Raptor Signature Edition with Intel Core i7 Extreme Edition processors, Intel 750 Series SSD and Samsung 950 Pro options, up to 10Gbps transfers with USB 3.1, as well as personalization options like laser engraving. Prices are all over the board, and depend on which model you get and what configuration it has. The website shows models priced ‘low’ such as the Raptor Z30 SmallBlock starting at $999 USD, and models priced substantially higher, such as the Raptor Signature Edition starting at $3,999 USD. The lowest priced model starts at $849 USD. The updated models are available on the company’s website now; note that not all models on the website list the 7th-gen Intel processors, however.

Advertisement It represented "a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations aimed at US elections." Without mentioning the name of former NSA-contractor turned leaker Edward Snowden, the report makes an oblique reference to the effects of the disclosures have had on the reputation and legitimacy of the US government.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link What is it about Russia that winds everyone up so much? Photo: AP "We assess the 2016 influence campaign reflected the Kremlin's recognition of the worldwide effects that mass disclosures of US Government and other private data—such as those conducted by WikiLeaks and others—have achieved in recent years, and their understanding of the value of orchestrating such disclosures to maximise the impact of compromising information." The release of the unclassified report comes one day after the role of Russia's role in the election of Donald Trump was the subject of a Senate hearing, an event in which senior Republicans urged a tough line on Russia over efforts to sway US political outcomes. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link President-Elect Donald Trump. Photo: AP Trump has repeatedly faced - and dismissed - questions about his relationship with Russia and Vladimir Putin. During his last press conference, Trump mockingly asked Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails. On Friday Trump continued to try to downplay accusations that he colluded with a foreign power to support his campaign for the White House. He dismissed concerns about the effect of Russia's hacking of the Democrats emails and subsequent dissemination of the emails as a political "witch hunt." He also said Russian hacking had no influence on the outcome of the 2016 election. Trump has made better relations a rare point of consistency in a campaign that has wilfully lied to and confused the American public as an apparent part of a media strategy to gain support from voters. Trump has used Twitter to criticise the conclusions of US intelligence agencies, an unprecedented behaviour from an incoming American president. Republicans, who maintained their majority in Congress on the coat tails of Trump's win, are left in an awkward position by the role Russia played in the election. In recent months, President Barack Obama has been criticised for not taking the threat of Russia seriously. Now that Republicans are in power, with a Republican soon in the White House, the GOP will be responsible for investigating Russian influence operations. Moreover, Trump's frequent denials suggest he has nothing to lose by a thorough investigation. Even before the US election, Russian influence and social media operations were well known through Europe.  "Russia, like its Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on US presidential elections," the report states, warning that the success of Russia in 2016 will likely embolden it. "We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes." Germany, for example, going into elections this year, has sounded increasing concern about the effect of social media-empowered misinformation on its politics.

Trump has used Twitter to criticise the conclusions of US intelligence agencies, an unprecedented behaviour from an incoming American president. Republicans, who maintained their majority in Congress on the coat tails of Trump's win, are left in an awkward position by the role Russia played in the election. In recent months, President Barack Obama has been criticised for not taking the threat of Russia seriously. Now that Republicans are in power, with a Republican soon in the White House, the GOP will be responsible for investigating Russian influence operations. Moreover, Trump's frequent denials suggest he has nothing to lose by a thorough investigation. Even before the US election, Russian influence and social media operations were well known through Europe.  "Russia, like its Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on US presidential elections," the report states, warning that the success of Russia in 2016 will likely embolden it. "We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes." Germany, for example, going into elections this year, has sounded increasing concern about the effect of social media-empowered misinformation on its politics.

EVGA Z270 Motherboard Line-Up Across the three models that EVGA is currently launching, there are many similarities, and several different differences.   Let’s take a quick look at each one of them and see what some of the differences are.  We can spend a lot of time discussing the various motherboards and the differences, however we will just touch on several of the features. EVGA Z270 Classified K Starting with their top of the line, Z270 Classified K motherboard, we can immediately see that it is an E-ATX motherboard, so that means there are a few added features.  For storage support, you are looking at all of the most common types supported, with up to 8 SATA 6Gb/s, 2 SATA Express, 1 U.2, 2 M.2 Key-M and 1 M.2 Key-E.  In addition, it’ll support Intel’s Optane drive if you want the latest M.2 drive.  For dedicated graphics solutions, you are limited to 2-Way SLI.  Audio, is supplied by the Creative Sound Core 3D.  Its networking features are no slouch either, supporting two Ethernet ports one Killer E2500 and the other Intel i219 Gigabit NIC; the choice is up to you which you prefer. EVGA Z270 FTW K The EVGA Z270 FTW K is their main enthusiast grade motherboard, and is a standard ATX motherboard.  Storage, is a little less than the Classified K, the Z270 FTW K, EVGA removed the Marvell SATA controller, which causes you to lose two SATA 6Gb/s ports, so the FTW K has 6 SATA 6Gb/s, 2 SATA Express, 1 U.2, 2 M.2 Key-M and 1 M.2 Key-E.  Graphics support is still limited to 2-Way SLI.  Another change comes from the removal of the Creative Core 3D chip, taking you back to Intel HD Audio.  Ethernet is also the same between the two models with two Ethernet ports one Killer E2500 and the other Intel i219 Gigabit NIC.  However, for power, EVGA has reduced the power switching from a 13 Phase PWM system on the Classified K, to 11 Phase PWM on the FTW K. EVGA Z270 Stinger The last EVGA motherboard is the EVGA Z270 Stinger, a mini-ITX motherboard, that EVGA has squeezed on a lot of features.  DDR4 memory support is one obvious change, going from 4x DDR4 down to 2x DDR4.  Storage has also been decreased to 4 SATA 6Gb/s ports, 1 U.2, 1 M.2 Key-M and 1 M.2 Key-E (which is taken up by an included 802.11AC Dual-Band WiFi + Bluetooth card).  EVGA moved the M.2 Key-M slot to the back of the motherboard to save space on the front of the board.  Graphics has been changed to just one PCIe x16 slot, so no SLI (shouldn’t come as any surprise though).  Networking was also changed a little to support just the Intel i219 Gigabit NIC and the 802.1AC WiFi card. EVGA Z270 Stinger There is one big trend that is missing from the EVGA motherboards, which some like, and others won’t be too happy about;  the inclusion of RGB lighting on the motherboard!  EVGA has kept it simple, not only with just three models to choose from, but also keeping the color scheme neutral and without covering the motherboard in RGB LEDs. That wraps up a quick overview of the EVGA Z270 motherboard line-up, you can find out more information on the EVGA Z270 motherboard line-up by visiting their website here.

It's not restrictions," Brian Krzanich told CNBC. "It's really about making the U.S. more competitive." (AP photo) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 06, 2017 at 12:30 PM, updated January 06, 2017 at 5:48 PM comments Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich says last month's meeting between president-elect Donald Trump and a cadre of tech executives focused on cutting taxes and boosting high-tech manufacturing. Returning manufacturing jobs to the United States was a theme of Trump's campaign and his presidential transition. Trump has called out companies who shift production jobs abroad and demanded the U.S. should take a tougher line with China in particular. The chipmaker is unusual among its high-tech peers in that it makes most of its products in the U.S. The company's largest and most advanced operations are in Hillsboro, where Intel engineers and produces each new generation of microprocessor. In a Friday interview with CNBC at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Krzanich said Intel sells three-quarters of its chips abroad. He said China is the company's fastest-growing market and sought to discourage the prospect of a trade dispute. "The real answer is not a trade war. It's not restrictions," Krzanich said. "It's really about making the U.S. more competitive, lowering the tax rates, making it easier for people to do manufacturing here." Intel is Oregon's largest private employer. The company had 19,500 people working in Hillsboro before a series of layoffs and buyouts last year eliminated more than 13 percent of Intel jobs companywide. Intel won't disclose its current Oregon headcount. Intel has had a prominent role at the Consumer Electronics Show in each of the four years Krzanich has been CEO. In the prior three years Krzanich gave the opening keynote -- this time, Intel showed off virtual reality technology and touted other new products. On Wednesday, the company announced what it calls the world's first 5G modem. Having missed the smartphone and tablet revolution, Intel has all but given up on the current generation of 4G wireless technology. Instead, it's focusing on a forthcoming, faster wireless standard. Intel hopes 5G will do more than just enable faster smartphones. The chipmaker says 5G wireless technology will enable connected devices with very little lag, or latency, in their communication, linking devices in a wireless network that will operate almost as if they were a single machine. It will be at least a few years, though, before 5G wireless is ready for prime time, and it may be several years before it's commonplace. Intel also said Wednesday that it plans to roll out a fleet of 40 self-driving cars late this year through its partnership with BMW and Israeli camera company Mobileye. Intel hopes its processors will find a place in the emerging field of autonomous driving, and has a created a new group within the company to focus on that market. And earlier in the week Intel formally launched its latest generation of microprocessor. -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Daniel Cooper, @danielwcooper 01.06.17 in Wearables Comments 450 Shares Share Tweet Share Save At last year's CES Intel and New Balance announced that they would team up to develop a sports-focused smartwatch. One day shy of a year later, and the pair revealed it to the world with significantly less fanfare than before. Intel's press conference was all about VR, leaving all talk of wearables to a press release that crossed the wire before the event even kicked off. So what does that mean for the New Balance RunIQ? Gallery: Intel & New Balance RunIQ | 11 Photos 11 +7 It's a pretty neat-looking device -- certainly not out of place alongside other chunky running watches from other brands like Garmin with its 1.39-inch AMOLED display and fat bezels. If there's one thing that is disappointing, however, it's how chintzy the plastic device feels, betraying its intention as a rugged piece of running gear. It's also something of a mutt, with the fingerprints of four companies all over its DNA. Intel, for instance, used its hardware know-how to build the device itself while New Balance shaped its style and overall branding. Google obviously created Android Wear -- the first generation of the software, rather than version 2.0 -- and Strava is providing native access to its social network for runners. It's worth adding that this device is aimed squarely at marathoners and their ilk, with all the features geared toward slightly more serious athletes. One of the reasons the watch is shipping before the arrival of Google's redesigned watch OS is that Intel is confident it's done enough to stand apart from the crowd. Intel VP Dr. Jerry Bautista explained that his engineers have spent a long time tweaking the power management of the software for better battery life. One of the other innovations he's proud of is ensuring that the display will always show the time, if not the rest of the UI. New Balance, meanwhile, polled users to find out that runners apparently hate touching their watch's display during a run. So, the company insisted that there be physical controls on either side of the crown for one-touch lap times. As an added benefit, this allows runners to use the device even while wearing gloves. After all, if you're running in the Pacific Northwest in January, you don't want to have to expose your fingers to the elements. Another neat tweak that Intel is proud of is the raised curve that surrounds the optical heart rate monitor on the underside of the case. It apparently encourages the skin on your wrist to push up into the space immediately around the optical sensor. That way, you get less light interference and a better, more accurate heart rate track than you would with other devices. If Intel is to be believed, this is the best implementation of an Android Wear running watch, as the fitness features are mostly custom. The running app, which is Strava-branded, has been totally rewritten from the ground up for better performance and to be used without a smartphone. Once you've used your phone to pair the watch to your account, the device will then independently sync your stats whenever you hit WiFi. One thing the device is lacking is a better music function, mostly because Intel and New Balance held off on altering the software. Knowing that Android Wear 2 will open up implementation beyond Google Play Music users, the two companies chose to wait for the update before making meaningful changes there. Speaking of which, the device will get an over-the-air update to the latest OS, but not before Intel has had chance to tweak it where necessary. We'll reserve judgment on if the litany of small tweaks set the RunIQ ahead of other Android Wear devices in the same category. But while we wait to review the device, you can pre-order the watch for delivery on February 1st. Oh, and if you notice, we have images of a cool gold-and-gray model -- an alternative to the stock all-black edition. It's a limited paint job of just 1,500 that will be available on a first-come, first-served basis when the device hits stores. Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.

Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 6 January 2017 at 03:20 PM EST. 16 Comments This week Intel launched the desktop/socketed Kaby Lake CPUs. Over the next week will be many Linux CPU benchmarks on Phoronix so here is your last opportunity to put in any special benchmark requests. Intel is said to be sending over a Core i7 7700K next week while already I ended up buying a Core i5 7600K CPU after finding it for a deal and having a lot of other Core i5 CPUs to make it for an interesting comparison and that many Phoronix readers will probably find the i5-7600K to be interesting for around the $250 USD price-point. (You can currently find it retail for $243.) The i5-7600K arrived this morning and as alluded to in some other Phoronix articles already, I've begun upgrading all my benchmarking systems to Ubuntu 16.10 + Linux 4.10 kernel for running some fresh comparison data points. That will still be going on for the next few days and will have the Core i5 7600K followed by the Core i7 7700K numbers next week. I've already been running a number of CPU benchmarks, but as usual, looking for any last-minute test requests you'd like to see with Kaby Lake. Here's a look at some of the other CPU numbers so far, again, just a portion of what it will look like when all my available Linux systems are freshly tested: A lot of our usual test suspects for good CPU workloads... Of course, everything being compiled on-host and "-O3 -march=native" for each CPU. I also included some of our newer test profiles like Blender and Darktable to make things more interesting: And much more. You can see the benchmarks I am running so far on the systems I have tested so far with Ubuntu 16.10 + Linux 4.10 via this OpenBenchmarking.org result merge. On the systems with integrated graphics I also have separate Vulkan/OpenGL benchmarks being run that are not part of this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. Am I missing any other interesting tests?

Companies lined up at CES 2017 to paint a future about super-fast mobile internet that doesn't yet exist. By Mary-Ann Russon January 6, 2017 18:25 GMT Close CES 2017: The best tech on show IBTimes UK The exact international standards to define 5G – the next generational leap in mobile internet technology – are yet to be set, but the work has begun to devise these specifications. The global mobile standards body GSMA has its heart set on 5G networks being rolled out around the world by 2020. Numerous mobile operators are now trialling different methods to get the ultra-fast speeds needed for 5G, such as using the "millimetre wave" radio frequency bands (30GHz to 300GHz). Millimetre waves, also known as extremely high frequency (EHF), offer much bigger bandwidths, but in the past it only worked for short distances (such as a few kilometres) due to high free space loss and atmospheric absorption. If you want to have super-fast mobile internet, you're going to need infrastructure, hardware and software to help run the network, and continued work on the 5G New Radio (NR) specifications by the 3GPP standards body means that tech companies now have a clearer idea of what they might need, which is why 5G announcements are now taking centre stage. Excitement over the promise of 5G is exploding at CES 2017. Here's what tech heavyweights had to say about the future of ultra-fast mobile internetGetty Images Join IBTimes UK as we highlight the most interesting 5G innovations mentioned at CES 2017. And in case you're wondering what we need it for, here's a guide to all the great things we can do with 5G. Ericsson, Qualcomm and AT&T trialling 5G on millimetre wave Ericsson has developed a prototype mobile base station using Multi-user, Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) technology, and together with a prototype mobile device containing a chip by Qualcomm, the two firms are working with US mobile operator AT&T to conduct interoperability testing and over-the-air field trials using the 5G NR specifications. This is exciting because if it works, it would be an actual demonstration of a mobile device receiving 5G mobile speeds to upload and download data over the network. The trials would be useful to engineers working out the niggling issues in order to make millimetre wave work over long distances, and the results of experiments will probably help 3GPP with their work too. Intel launches the "world's first" 5G modem Intel has launched a 5G modem to enable 5G-enabled devices to work across a wide range of industriesIntel Semiconductor manufacturer Intel has announced that it has developed the world's first global 5G modem, designed to be used in everything from mobile devices and home routers to self-driving cars and drones. The modem supports millimetre wave, as well as radio spectrum bands below 6GHz and the 5G NR specifications. Intel also hopes to be able to offer useful feedback to 3GPP when it starts testing its modems in mid-2017. Intel has also created a 5G Mobile Trial Platform that is currently being used in active trials around the world and the modem will also be used to test out use cases for self-driving autonomous cars with a special automotive 5G platform. Intel announced that it would be working with mobile infrastructure provider Nokia, industrial IoT platform provider GE, car manufacturer BMW and mobile operator Vodafone to test out how 5G can work across many different fields. Nokia: We're working towards 5G and powering all your trials Nokia is teaming up with Intel and other partners to help provide the infrastructure needed for 5G technology testsTwitter / Peter Jarich Mobile infrastructure provider Nokia has its fingers in a lot of pies in a bid to help prepare mobile operators for 5G. You've probably heard of their 4.5G Pro and 4.9G solutions, which are a sort of early-stage 5G. These help operators to get the most out of their 4G networks using virtualisation and software defined networking (SDN), as well as preparing them to migrate their networks to 5G when the standards are ready. To that end, Nokia announced at CES that it managed to achieve mobile data speeds of close to 1Gbps using 4.5G Pro technology in a trial with T-Mobile in the US. The demonstration made use of existing technologies already live on the network including including carrier aggregation, 256 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) and 4x4 MIMO. Currently T-Mobile's network offers up to 400Mbps, which means the boost can offer a faster network until 5G. Apart from working with mobile operators, Nokia is teaming up with Intel to help trial multiple use cases where 5G technology is needed, such as providing the base stations needed to make a connected road with self-driving cars possible. Nokia is also really interested in helping to make live virtual reality (VR) broadcasts a norm, and to that end it has been demonstrating event broadcasts at CES with Huffington Post using the Nokia OZO VR camera. Intel has provided the chip to help process the data, while Nokia has created a simulated 5G network to help send VR video wirelessly to smartphone-enabled VR headsets. Qualcomm: 5G will be huge and enable connectivity all the time As mentioned above, Qualcomm is teaming up with Ericsson and AT&T on 5G NR over-the-air field trials to prepare for and model wide-scale 5G deployments. And similar to Nokia, the semiconductor manufacturer also wants to help improve current mobile connectivity by extending the reach of what 4G can do for now. To help speed up connected car and self-driving car development, which will require a huge amount of reliable mobile bandwidth, Qualcomm has launched a connected car platform that works with the Snapdragon X16 LTE modem to offer peak download speed of up to 1Gbps for connected cars. In his keynote espousing the many benefits 5G will have on the world once it is ready, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf touched on the fact that 5G will enable users to stream 4K and even 8K video, as well as being able to whip out smartphones to engage in AR and VR experiences on the go, and helping drones to process more data and make decisions faster in mid-flight. To make this possible, Qualcomm has launched the Snapdragon 835 next-gen smartphone chip that it claims will help deliver better VR and 4K video experience, as well as an improved overall experience and battery life performance. All of the processing and decision-making is happening on these drones in real time. #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/0SiNlzmcQt— Qualcomm (@Qualcomm) January 6, 2017 More from IBTimes UK F1-engined Mercedes AMG hypercar teased again at CES technology show No Windows car, but Microsoft's Cortana is coming to next-gen Nissan and BMW cars Google Assistant expands from Pixel smartphones to Android TV, cars and smartwatches Live over #5G.

The major updates for this year's NUCs include the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors and support for Optane memory. Intel's Optane memory, co-developed with Micron, is a non-volatile memory technology that's faster than flash but denser than DRAM. It doesn't replace standard RAM in these NUCs, which have two familiar SO-DIMM sockets for up to 32GB of DDR4 at 2133 MT/s. Instead, Optane is meant to offer speedy storage, possibly in an M.2 format, to provide fast boot times and application launching. This year's NUC models offer a number of processor and storage options. The top of the line NUC7i7BNH is powered by a Core i7-7567U, a dual-core processor with a max turbo clock of 4.0GHz and a 28W TDP. Intel's Iris Plus Graphics 650 IGP runs the display. For storage, there's an M.2 slot and room for a 2.5" HDD or SSD up to 9.5mm tall. All this hardware fits into a chassis that's only 4.5" x 4.4" x 2" (or 11.5 cm x 11. cm x 5.1 cm).     The NUC models with Core i5 or Core i3 CPUs are available in two configurations: one with a slot for a 9.5-mm-tall drive, and a low-profile model that only has room for an M.2 unit. The low-profile variants (whose names end in K rather than H) have similar dimensions, but are only 1.4" (3.5 cm) tall. The kits labeled NUC7i5BNH and NUC7i5BNK are powered by Intel's Core i5-7260U, a dual core processor with a max turbo clock of 3.4GHz and a 15W TDP. This processor integrates Intel's Iris Plus Graphics 640 unit. The Core i3 variants of this year's NUCs, the NUC7i3BNH and NUC7i3BNK, have Intel's Core i3-7100U processor inside. This dual-core CPU has a base frequency of 2.4GHz, a 15W TDP, and offer up an Intel HD Graphics 620 IGP. The rest of the feature set in these NUCs remains quite solid. They have dual-array front microphones for taking advantage of Cortana, an HDMI 2.0 port, and Intel's 802.11ac dual-band wireless connectivity. There's also a Thunderbolt 3 port on tap that can offer USB 3.1 and DisplayPort connectivity. A Micro SDXC slot with UHS-I support and Bluetooth 4.2 support round out the list of features.   Tags: Systems User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Intel wants in on the IoT action, and to that end the company showed off its Compute Card at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The Compute Card contains all the necessary parts for a contemporary computer: a system-on-a-chip, RAM, some storage, and wireless connectivity. Intel says the Card has "flexible I/O options" that allow hardware makers to easily integrate the Card into their devices, and mentions "digital signage and kiosks, All-in-Ones, smart TVs and appliances" among the intended use cases. Intel will offer the Compute Card in multiple performance levels. Device designers pack Compute Card compatibility into their devices, then they can choose the Card with the performance level needed to meet the design goals. The big blue silicon guys say this gives third parties additional flexibility, since they don't need to worry about validation if they realize they need more computing power halfway through a project. The Compute Card will be available with a wide-range of SoCs, including units packing "seventh-generation Core processors." We have a feeling this phrasing might mean Y-series chips that used to be called "Core m" before consumers seemingly turned away from that particular sub-brand. The card's physical package measures a tidy 3.7" x 2.2" x 0.2" (9.5 cm x 5.5 cm x 0.5 cm). The Card connects to a host device with an extensible "new standard connector" that's based on USB Type-C and can handle USB, PCIe, HDMI, and DisplayPort connectivity. The partner list for the Compute Card includes big hitters like Dell, Lenovo, and Sharp, along with players like Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk, and Pasuntech. That list suggests that initial uses for the Compute Card may trend closer to traditional industrial and embedded applications, rather than consumer-focused IoT devices. Intel says the Compute Cards will start shipping in mid-2017.   Tags: Systems Mobile computing User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The company’s two-headed battle against Intel on the CPU front and Nvidia on the GPU side has resulted in a lack of meaningful updates for either, and a general feeling of indifference among many AMD faithful. But 2017 could change all of that, and even though Nvidia and Intel have both built even more impressive leads over their competitor than they already had, AMD isn’t throwing in the towel just yet. Don't Miss: Two Google Homes are arguing on Twitch and thousands of people can’t look away AMD vs. Intel Intel’s i7 processors lead the charge for the majority of the PC gaming community, and enthusiasts are more invested in the company’s flagship chips — like the i7-6700k — than ever before. AMD has always played second fiddle, but its new “Zen” chip architecture is already looking very promising. Early tests on a pre-release version of the chip suggests that it will easily best Intel’s i7-6700k in many computing tasks, which is good news, but it also trailed many of Intel’s chips in gaming-specific tests. However, as the chip was running under the clock speed that it is expected to ship with, it’s hard to say how much those tests really matter. Add to that the fact that Intel’s next generation of desktop processors — namely the i7-7700k — wasn’t included in the comparison, and it’s impossible to predict how the final figures will actually pan out. All that said, AMD’s Zen architecture is indeed extremely interesting and could improve overall system performance and even frame rates in demanding games, if the software is properly optimized to take advantage of it. AMD vs Nvidia Potentially even more crucial to AMD’s overall success in the eyes of PC gamers will be how its new Vega GPUs perform against Nvidia’s 10XX, and Titan graphics card lineups. Nvidia has been absolutely killing it on the GPU front, and it’s hard to find an enthusiast-minded gaming build list on Reddit or elsewhere without an Nvidia card on the list. AMD desperately needs to hit a home run with its next generation of Radeon GPUs, and it thinks it’s done so. The new Vega GPU architecture (which replaces the current Polaris tech) boast double the high-bandwidth memory of their predecessors. AMD says that lets the cards render faster, and it’s been doing its best to convince everyone that Vega will top Intel’s cards handily. In a recent video demo, AMD showed off a Vega card running 2016’s Doom at between 60 and 70 frames per second, on “ultra” graphics quality and at 4k resolution. According to Techspot, Nvidia’s 1080 can’t even maintain 60fps under the same circumstances. But AMD has another trick up its sleeve when it comes to establishing graphics dominance: Getting cozy with developers. It’s not a new tactic by any means, and it’s something Intel has been doing for ages, but it’s starting to pay off for AMD. EA, which built its marquee shooter Battlefield 1 with AMD in mind, is just one example of how the company is pushing developers to consider that not all PC gamers are buying Intel and Nvidia machines. Running under Direct X12, Battlefield 1 often performed better on AMD’s cards than it did on Nvidia’s top-of-the-line GPUs, based on many user reports (and complaints). Then there’s the matter of cost. AMD’s hardware isn’t cheap by any means, but it doesn’t carry the same “Nvidia Tax” premium that its competitor’s cards do. If AMD can equal or even top Nvidia’s pure graphical muscle while offering its cards at a lower price point, we may be in for a very interesting 2017 in the PC gaming world.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today The Data Center Will Power the Intel of the Future, CEO Krzanich Contends Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that while Intel is far from giving up on its PC business, the focus has shifted more towards data centers. Giovanni Bruno Jan 6, 2017 12:18 PM EST On a day in which the latest jobs report was issued, Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich discussed the future of jobs at Intel as the company announced last April a restructuring that would cut 12,000 jobs globally. "There was a portion of this that was about reduction and a portion that was about re-structuring how our workforce looked as we moved from a PC-focused company to focused on data centers, IOT and things like virtual reality," Krzanich told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" Friday morning. Krzanich reiterated that though the restructuring effort does carry the unfortunate implication of having to cut 12,000 jobs, there was "absolutely some hiring" involved in that process. He then explained Intel's long-term growth prospects in light of the re-structuring effort.  "It's all about data," Krzanich stated. "The thing that is explosive whether its virtual reality, or autonomous driving, is the massive amount of data. He explained that while the data centers of today are predicated on humans, the data centers of tomorrow will be built on machines. "So, it is the data center that really powers the Intel of the future," he said. But, don't be too quick to think Intel has abandoned PC. "It's not like we are giving up on the PC, but what we want to do is strengthen the other areas so that we are a more balanced company," Krzanich said. He argued that he remains "excited" about the new products Intel along with its OEM partners will launch in 2017.

Called 360 Replay, the tech puts you right by the action of live sports without even needing to leave the sofa, all thanks to the wonderful world of virtual reality (VR). 2 A view of the Intel showcase at CES, where it showed off the very latest VR technology Announced during the firm’s keynote at the conference , Intel boss Brian Krzanich said the merging of digital and physical worlds to create amazing immersive experiences will change the world of sports viewing. “This is the future of sports,” Krzanich said. The company gave Oculus Rift VR headsets to more than 260 reporters in the crowd, including The Sun Online, to show how this could work, taking them court-side of a basketball game in Indianapolis, via VR, from the comfort of a hotel conference room. By simply putting on an Oculus Rift VR headset, Intel was able to bring live sports to the audience never before. 2 Intel presents its VR tech to a roomful of helmet-clad journalists We watched the Villanova-Butler NCAA basketball game live on virtual reality headsets from the press conference. The experience includes a virtual score board that floats in your peripheral vision, and choices of different camera angles what you can select by hovering over different camera view buttons. You can then view the game like you are really there. And that’s exactly how it feels, it felt like we had been dropped court-side. You are able to look around in 360-degrees and watch the action like a spectator in the sports arena. This tech was made possible thanks to Intel’s acquisition of VOKE VR in November last year, a firm that had previously presented sports content including highlights of NFL games in VR. Intel said it will be among the first technology companies to enable this live sports experience on multiple VR devices, and said the option to view VOKE VR content on Oculus Rift will be available later this year.

Claudia Winkleman and pals look like the Ramones as they show off their matching fringes happy moanday Ten things to look forward to to help you survive Blue Monday - the most depressing day of the year “Viewers get to decide their point of view,” Krzanich said. “So you’re going to decide, do you want to be on the 50 yard line? Do you want to be court-side at a basketball game? "Do you want to be behind the basket to watch the next slam dunk? Do you want to be in the goalie’s position? All of that is possible.” Intel believes this is how we will view sports in coming years, giving us an opportunity to go to games that we’d never been able to before. We pay for your stories!

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 6, 2017 at 11:00AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been working to become a major player in the cellular modem market since its acquisition of Infineon's (NASDAQOTH:IFNNY) wireless assets all the way back in 2010. Image source: Intel.  The company's cellular efforts struggled for years, as the company was late to deliver modems implementing important technologies such as 4G LTE and LTE Advanced. Indeed, the competition always seemed to be at least a step ahead -- if not a couple of steps ahead -- of Intel.  The chip giant seems to be determined to hit the "reset" button as the wireless industry transitions from 4G LTE and 4G LTE Advanced to 5G technologies, aiming to position itself as a "leader" rather than as a (fast?) follower. Only time will tell if Intel can ultimately succeed in becoming a leader, here, but the company recently announced its very first 5G modem, codenamed Gold Ridge. Let's take a closer look at the announcement. Pairs with XMM 7360, sampling in second half of 2017 Intel's Gold Ridge chip appears to be a "5G-only" modem that needs to be paired with a separate 4G chip (an Intel image posted by EETimes shows that the Gold Ridge modem paired with Intel's XMM 7360 LTE Advanced modem). This solution looks like wireless chip leader Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon X50 5G modem, which the company says "can be paired with a Snapdragon processor with an integrated Gigabit Class LTE modem." The chip will reportedly sample in the second half of 2017, which suggests that it will find its way into the first commercially available devices sometime in the second half of 2018. Qualcomm has said that its own Snapdragon X50 5G modem will also sample to customers in the second half of 2017 and that "the first products integrating it are expected to surface throughout 2018." If Intel manages to keep to its publicly announced schedule, it could have a shot at achieving rough time-to-market parity with the industry leader. Built on the company's 14-nanometer technology All of Intel's modems released to date have been manufactured by third parties on older manufacturing technologies. Not only that, but those chips have been manufactured by third parties, rather than by Intel itself -- a company that routinely claims that owning and operating its own manufacturing plants is a significant competitive advantage. Per EETimes, the Gold Sand 5G modem will be manufactured in Intel's own 14-nanometer technology, making it the very first cellular modem that's both designed and manufactured by Intel. By manufacturing the modem in-house, Intel might be able to achieve a better cost/margin structure compared to a modem built by a third party since Intel won't have to pay a third-party chip manufacturer's profit margins. Additionally, if Apple adopts Intel's 5G modem in some portion of its 2018 iPhone shipments (Intel currently supplies XMM 7360 modems into some models of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus), then this would mean significant chip volumes for Intel's 14-nanometer chip factories. Indeed, since Intel is likely to begin transitioning much of its chip volumes away from its 14-nanometer technology toward its newer 10-nanometer technologies in late 2018, its 5G modems could be useful in keeping what 14-nanometer capacity that the company keeps online busy. Investor takeaway Intel has made it clear that it believes that connectivity technologies, such as cellular modems, will be critical to long-term success across many important areas of the computing market. The company is clearly putting its money where its mouth is by investing in next-generation wireless standards and chips that implement them. I suspect that over the next three to five years, we'll know whether Intel is destined to be a potent player in the cellular modem market or just another has-been.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

"The real answer is not a trade war, it's not restrictions. It's really about making the U.S. more competitive," the tech executive told "Squawk Alley." "Lowering the tax rates, making it easier for people to do manufacturing here ... that's what will bring manufacturing back to the U.S." Krzanich said that was a major topic of discussion at President-elect Donald Trump's December meeting with major U.S. tech CEOs, which Krzanich attended. When asked about the prospects for a new administration that runs the risk of heightening trade tensions with major players like China, Krzanich said he actually sees a lot of opportunity. "Our major manufacturing is in the U.S., yet we export 75 percent of our product. We're the second-largest exporter in the United States. So we consider ourselves kind of the role model manufacturer," he said. Krzanich also highlighted the company's ties to China, which has emerged as a target of the president-elect's criticism. "China's an important market for us, it's the fastest growing market we have, and so … for us it's constantly balancing between great relationships with China and growing there but also the manufacturing presence here in the U.S," Krzanich said. Krzanich spoke to CNBC from Intel's booth at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Intel's Compute Card Could Change The Smart Game Posted: Jan 6 2017, 10:22am CST | by Noel Diem, in News | CES   Credit: Intel   Intel was a little bit behind the times and never really jumped on the smartphone bandwagon, but now they are trying to establish themselves in the marketplace for smart technology. Their latest effort is called the "Compute Card," a small 94.5mm by 55mm by 5mm slab that includes a CPU and GPU, RAM, storage, and wireless connectivity, according to Ars Technica. Don't Miss: Super Bowl 2017 Ads The idea is to separate the "smart" parts of appliances and computers - TVs, refrigerators, all-in-ones, commercial equipment, etc - from the rest of the hardware. This will keep the price of things like smart TVs low because while the processing hardware goes quickly, the TV is still fine. With a Compute Card, you would simply have to eject the old card and put in a new one. Intel talked briefly about the Compute Cards are CES 2017, but you can expect the ones that are the fastest to perform like high-end, fanless laptops. Intel said that processors with a TDP of up to 6W could fit inside Compute Cards. They also said that the card uses a variant of the USB-C port called a "USB-C plus extension" to connect. The connector gives access to the USB and PCIe buses and the HDMI and DisplayPort video outputs. It will replace the Compute Stick, which will probably disappear in about 2018. The problem with the Compute Stick is that its input and output ports were limiting. The Card will be able to work with more enclosures so that it can use different ports and display interfaces.  Intel predicts that they will have more information available in June 2017, with the cards coming out soon after that. According to Ars Technica, Intel's Compute Card partners, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp on the computing side and Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk, and Pasuntech on the commercial side, will all be making their own announcements and releases separately.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel rolls out the rest of the Kaby Lake CPU family Intel rolls out the rest of the Kaby Lake CPU family By Joel Hruska on January 4, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Intel didn’t just launch the new Core i7-7700K desktop CPU, it made a comprehensive update to its entire product line. The initial Kaby Lake mobile refresh was limited to a handful of SKUs; with this launch Intel is bringing out a larger number of cores intended for every price point. The new chips are, for the most part, drop-in replacements for the Skylake SKUs Intel launched in 2015 and 2016, though most of the models feature at least a small clock jump over and above what Skylake offered. The slideshow below steps through each of Intel’s SKUs in some detail, but we’ll give you the 10,000-foot overview. Kaby Lake is priced nearly identically to Skylake in virtually every case, but the Core i5-7600K has a 3.8GHz base clock and a 4.2GHz turbo clock, whereas the Core i5-6700K was a 3.5GHz – 3.9GHz chip. These gains are preserved through most of the product stack; the 35W Core i5-7400T has a 2.4GHz base, 3GHz turbo, compared with the Core i5-6400T with its 2.2GHz base and 2.8GHz turbo. There’s a new nomenclature attached to many of Intel’s 15W and 28W CPUs. These new chips feature what Intel is calling “Iris Plus,” meaning they incorporate a 64MB EDRAM chip alongside the GPU core. The 128MB EDRAM cores that Intel has previously shipped with Skylake and Broadwell aren’t being carried over to the Iris Plus line, at least not for now. OEM uptake on these cores has never been high, even though they can improve integrated graphics performance by almost 100%. All of the new 7th-Generation chips support VP9 hardware decode, as well as supporting H.265 encode/decode completely in hardware. As a result, all of these cores are comparable with streaming 4K video from Netflix or any other service that agrees to use Windows PlayReady DRM via the Edge browser. Intel has already said it won’t bring its EDRAM to any desktop quad-core SKUs this cycle, so if you were hoping for a non-embedded chip with Iris Plus you’ll have to look for a Skylake-based core or consider the Broadwell-based Core i7-5775C, which does have the 128MB cache. Apart from improvements to media playback support, clock speed increases, and the Core i3-7350K (the first unlocked Core i3), the Kaby Lake refresh is a fairly standard update to Intel’s roadmap. A little more clock, a little more performance, and not much to specifically get excited about unless you’ve been waiting on an upgrade that was just a little faster than your 5-7 year-old system. Is it time for a new x86 architecture? I’m a bit torn over Kaby Lake. On the one hand, it’s a fine update as far as it goes. There’s not much reason for Skylake owners to upgrade, but review results from the 7700K show that it generally outperforms Devil’s Canyon from 2014, to say nothing of Sandy Bridge or even earlier chips. Squeezing an extra 8-10% out of Skylake in equivalent power envelopes is no small accomplishment given how hard it’s been to move the ball on x86 performance. At the same time, however, Intel has been working with Sandy Bridge-derived architectures since 2011 and doesn’t have much to show for it — at least, not compared with previous rates of performance improvements. A great deal of this is due to simple physics and the intrinsic difficulty of designing a core that is more efficient, draws the same amount of power (or less, ideally) and provides increased performance without resorting to clock speed gains to deliver it. In a talk several years ago, former Intel Chief Architect Bob Colwell estimated that modern chips are 50-60x more efficient than the original 8086 — but they clock 1,000x higher than that core (4GHz compared with 4MHz). For all the gains we’ve gotten from building better cores, the gains from clock speed are more than an order of magnitude higher. I mentioned this in the Core i7-7700K review, but it bears repeating: I have absolutely no inside knowledge that Intel is contemplating a new uarch and am not claiming it is. But it wouldn’t surprise me if the company does go this route, especially if Zen proves competitive against the 7th Generation core family. With Apple breathing down its neck with the iPad Pro and its old enemy preparing to return to the arena, it’s a good time to revisit old assumptions and see if new tricks can be found to boost perf, cut power, and deliver a superior product.

The credit card size device is a ‘compute module’ with all of the elements of a standard compute inside the tiny 95 x 55 x 5 mm thick device. That means there is an Intel SoC, storage drive, memory, Wi-Fi and  Bluetooth connectivity all tucked inside. Intel will offer a full range of 6 Watt Intel processors inside all the way up to and including Intel 7th Core ‘Kaby Lake’ processors with vPro. The concept behind this is that you can now add compute and connectivity to everything. Companies that make smart devices will be able to make a Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then every year companies can have a quick and simple way to upgrade their models every year. The Intel Compute Cards modular design will allow it to be used in virtually any product, anywhere and Intel is already working with companies to integrate the form factor in devices in the following fields; IoT, intelligent vending machines, digital signage, automobile, smart TVs, smart refrigerators, drones and more. The Intel Compute Card features a new connector that we have never seen before, but it’s basically USB-C with an extension and it is an industry standard and not a propitiatory connector. Basically it has a USB Type-C connection is able to handle USB, HDMI, DP and so on while the other extension connector will PCIe, USB and open lanes for future expansion. It also sounds like you can run multiple Intel Compute Cards in a single system, so more powerful devices can use multiple cards. The Intel Compute Card will be made available mid-2017. Right now Intel has been talking with divisions in Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp, InFocus, DTx, and TabletKiosk. Right now they are seeing a ton of interest in monitors and that many of the first design wins will likely be coming from that segment. The All-In-One monitor market is especially showing interest as you don’t have to throw away the entire device to upgrade. Ultimately, you’ll be able to swap out the Intel Compute Stick when an upgrade is desired. The only downside is the cost of modularity as there is an inherent cost to splitting this out and this device doesn’t cool itself. While the device itself doesn’t have any moving parts it will need to have a heatsink to help keep the tiny computer cool. Right now Intel is using a heatsink and fan to keep the external skin temperature at 61C, but it can technically go higher than that. Active cooling won’t work on all devices, so there is an embedded mode that will be used for thinner devices. We didn’t get all the details on how embedded mode works or how many Watts the entire solution consumes, but Intel will be giving us those details closer to launch. More information on the Intel Compute Card can be found on the product page that came out yesterday.   gerwingr i know i can incorporate small credit card size computer’s, beside control, or radio equipment, this is a good size, my concern though is more like 25 mm thick, so standard connectors can be used, 95x55x25 comes in mind, much like this. http://www.pcgamer.com/credit-card-sized-odriod-c1-is-a-quad-core-computer-for-only-35/ good, good idea.

The new VivoPC X packs Intel Core i5 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPU into a 5-liter chassis. Traditionally, ASUS has positioned its Vivo-series computers as miniature PCs for mainstream tasks, whereas ROG systems were designed for gamers and multimedia enthusiasts. With the release of the VivoPC X, the computer maker changes that positioning and offers an SFF gaming-grade system under the Vivo brand. The reasons for the decision are simple: sales of small form-factor PCs are growing and so are sales of machines for gamers. ASUS wanted to address both markets with computers at more or less mainstream prices and the VivoPC X is a result of this decision. The mini PC is positioned below the ROG GR8 II and its performance is lower, however, ASUS thinks that the combination of price and performance will satisfy many people looking for a console-like gaming PC. The ASUS VivoPC X M80 is based on the Intel Core i5-7300HQ (4C/4T, 2.5 GHz/3.5 GHz, 6 MB cache, HD Graphics 630, 45 W) mobile processor, the Intel HM175 PCH as well as NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 graphics processor with G-Sync support. Since many gamers demand to have the performance of an SSD and capacity of a hard drive, the system will be equipped with a 512 GB M.2 SATA SSD as well as a 2 TB HDD with 7200 RPM spindle speed. The PC also comes with 8 GB of DDR4-2133 memory. To cool down the system components, ASUS uses a custom cooling system consisting of a blower for the GPU and a large aluminum heatsink for the CPU. ASUS VivoPC X Specifications   M80 CPU Intel Core i5-7300HQ Quad Core 2.5 GHz/3.5 GHz 6 MB cache HD Graphics 630 PCH Intel HM175 Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 with GDDR5 memory Memory  8 GB of DDR4-2133 Storage 512 GB SSD (SATA) 2 TB 2.5" HDD (7200 RPM) Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 Ethernet GbE Display Outputs 2 × HDMI 2.0b 1 × DisplayPort Audio 5.1-channel audio USB 4 × USB 3.0 Type-A (5 Gbps) 2 × USB 2.0 Type-A Other I/O - Dimensions 75.94 mm × 259.8 mm × 279.9 mm 2.99 × 10.23 × 11.02 inches PSU 230 W OS Windows 10 When it comes to connectivity, the ASUS VivoPC X has four USB 3.0 Type-A ports, two USB 2.0 headers, Gigabit Ethernet, an IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi with BT 4.1 module, three display outputs (two HDMI and one DisplayPort), 5.1-channel audio with Sonic Suite software enhancements and so on. The computer uses mobile PC components in a bid to keep its physical size small and power consumption low: its volume is about five liters and its power consumption is less than 230 W (it uses an external power brick to feed itself). Meanwhile, usage of such components also means that its future upgrades will be rather complicated if possible at all (for example, the GPU is soldered to the motherboard and is thus not upgradeable). The ASUS VivoPC X will be available in March, 2017, for $799.

Reply close - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link Two (small) fans too many for HTPC perfection :). Reply Murloc - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link probably a bit noisy but I guess that if you want to game you don't have many choices, consoles have fans too. Reply forgot2yield28 - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link I wonder if they let you tweak the fan curves like they do on their motherboards. If so, you might be able to keep it quiet during HTPC operations and only have it kick on if you decide to game. Reply close - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link But it looks like there was plenty of space to install a more massive heatsink and maybe one bigger and quieter fan instead of 2 tiny laptop fans even if this made it a little heavier. This really looks like a missed opportunity since it's not like many people will actually carry it around in their backpack. https://youtu.be/6Y2zHzMKlFk?t=116 Reply Ro_Ja - Saturday, January 07, 2017 - link The fans in some consoles is louder I think. Reply Michael Bay - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link A bit too gaudy for that. Reply MonkeyPaw - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link Seems like a curiously spec'd product--loads of fast storage but uses mobile hardware. The big issue is that it Doesn't sound very serviceable. Even the PSU looks to be proprietary. If something goes bad, the whole thing is junked. This isn't a $250 console we're talking about. Reply Murloc - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link on the other hand, many people have this behaviour with their computers too. AIO computers for starters. Reply BrokenCrayons - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link Agreed on that. Even I did it when my desktop's motherboard failed. I just pulled the hard drive out and carted the rest of the system off to be recycled and this was a system I built myself from parts a bit less than a year ago. It's just not worth the time to mess around with one when a replacement can be had for under $400 and you can get a laptop instead of a desktop. I think a lot of people are learning that these days and just dumping their systems so the fact that something can't be serviced is a non-issue these days.

By Conner Forrest | January 6, 2017, 6:26 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Intel Intel's new credit card-sized computer, the Compute Card, could help businesses more rapidly connect their devices and grow their Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. The card, which is only 5 mm thick, was unveiled at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on Thursday. A press release announcing the Compute Stick refers to it as a "modular compute platform." Intel said that it will be working with a set of partners to build out solutions for the ecosystem, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp. The goal is clear: Enable more connected devices and boost the speed of an IoT deployment. The Compute Card could be used to enable smart kiosks in an office or retail space, to add connectivity to personal appliances, or even to connect security cameras, the release said.

There are a range of processors available for the card, including the 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processors. The Compute Card will connect to devices through a standard USB-C connection. Intel is no stranger to tiny form factor computers, releasing multiple versions of its Compute Stick over the past few years. However, with broader capabilities, and a more narrowed focus, the Compute Card offers something more. Being that the card itself is separate from the device it powers, it could make it easier for organizations to maintain and upgrade the smart capabilities of their IoT devices, without upgrading the device itself. For example, instead of buying an entirely new smart appliance when the features become obsolete, one simply replaces the Compute Card with a newer model. It could also make it easier to continue using the device if it were to become compromised, as one could simply remove the card and continue working. Details and pricing of the Compute Card will be available in Q2 2017, and the device itself is expected to be available in the middle of the year. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Intel's new Compute Card is a credit card-sized computer that can be used to empower smart and connected devices in an IoT deployment. The Compute Card is customizable with different processors, including up to 7th generation Kaby Lake processors. The Compute Card could change the way the enterprise approaches IoT, making for easier upgrades and maintenance of connected devices.

However, it looks like we should not expect any further delays to Cannon Lake, as this week Intel confirmed that we will see the first 10nm processors show up in PCs by the end of this year. Cannon Lake was initially supposed to roll out in the second half of 2016 but Intel hit a roadblock while trying to shrink down transistors. After switching from the ‘tick tock’ release cycle to a new three step rollout plan for future CPU nodes, there was some speculation that Cannon Lake may also miss the end of 2017 but Intel has come out to squash that. As The Inquirer reports, at CES this week, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told journalists that Moore’s Law is still alive and well. According to Intel’s CEO, the first 2-in-1 PC based on 10nm architecture would be releasing this year and no further delays are expected for Cannon Lake. We can expect these new 10nm processors to bring lower power consumption, better performance, lower thermals and better battery life for portable devices. Obviously, unlocked desktop processors will take a bit longer to hit the market, similarly to how the first Kaby Lake processors hit OEM devices in late 2016 but we did not see the release of the Core i7 7700K and other desktop CPUs until this week. KitGuru Says: While Samsung and Qualcomm will be beating Intel in the 10nm arms race with the Snapdragon 835 during the first half of this year, it looks like Intel won’t be hugely far behind. Are any of you currently waiting on 10nm and Cannon Lake to launch before upgrading? What CPU are you running at the moment?  Similar Posts Categories Tags Related Related Tags: 10nmCannon LakeIntelnews Categorized Under: CPU WhiteSkyMage I guess it will be a great thing if they release a 10nm Cannonlake-E with 50% higher performance over my Haswell-E.

The popularity of a “Cannonlake-C” may not be there and thus might as well move us onto whatever is after just for the unlocked mainstream desktop processors. But I think the majority of Cannonlake in Client will be mobile, then of course Cannonlake-X/-EP/-EX will show up long afterwards. VA:F [1.9.22_1171] Rating: 0 (from 0 votes) lehpron It isn’t weird if you consider Intel has different codenames with similar prefixes for each segment that is on a different schedule. Therefore, if you expect all the codenames we read to be in the same segment, on a straight line, it would look weird. For instance, I’m sure like Broadwell, 10nm Cannonlake will debut mobile only while Coffeelake can still come after Kaby Lake in desktop at 14nm. There might be a “Cannonlake-C” desktop unlocked witha powerful IGP coming to the same chipset as Coffeelake, but it may suffer the same fate as Broadwell-C in terms of no popularity.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 15:22 fish99 says: I was considering a CPU upgrade from my 3570K recently, but after looking up some benchmarks, was surprised to see a 6600K is only 11% quicker, and that’s with it running 100 MHz quicker than my 3570K. And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Cpu wise I’m set for another 3 years at least. 4800mhz overclock is running smooth on the 4690k, I’m happy. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The Black PCIe SSD comes in 256GB asnd 512GB capacities and features an M.2 2280 format with an NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 host connection. It is WD's third flash product using branding previously reserved for disk drives, joining the Blue and Green 2.5-inch SARA SSDs. It's classed as a consumer SSD but this doesn't mean it's simple to install. WD says Black PCIe SSDs are "perfect for building high-end gaming systems or high-performance tower desktops and laptops with support for an M-type connector". The word "building" indicates the level of installation complexity. You need to get inside your PC or notebook to install it and may well need a somewhat specialised allen key-type screwdriver to fasten the locking nut that holds the end of the card once it is plugged into its socket. The device uses, we understand, TLC (3bits/cell) flash built on a 15nm process. Intel also has a consumer-class M.2 drive, the 600p which uses 3D TLC flash, and its capacity range is 128BGB to 1TB. The WD Black's performance, compared to the Intel 600p product, looks like this: Random Read Random Write Sequential Read Sequential Write WD Black PCIe SSD 170,000 to 134,000 to 2.05GBps to 800MBps Intel 600p 35,000-155,000 to 128,000 to 1.8GBps to 560MBps The Black PCIe SSD is faster than Intel's 600p. Both drives gave a five-year warranty and nearly identical MTBF (mean time before failure) ratings; 1.75 million hours for the Black SSD and 1.6 million hours for the Intel one. The Black's endurance is 80TB written for the 256GB model and 160TB written for the 512GB unit. Intel's 600p has a 72TB written rating, and this is a hard limit with write locking imposed. While the Intel product features AS 256-bit encryption, the Black PCIe SSD has no encryption option. WD product information doesn't mention an NVMe driver for the Black SSD but we would be surprised if one was not supplied. WD supplies Acronis True Image software drive cloning to aid the Black PCIe SSD drive upgrade process. The prices are $109 (£104) for a 256GB product and $199.99 (£189) for the 512GB one. Apart from its lack of encryption, the Black PCIe SSD looks to be a better price/performance option than Intel's 600p. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register WD gets flash boom bang from SanDisk swallow +Comment Storage stalwart flashes past lumbering Seagate 2 Comments WD flashes first SanDisk drives: Blue and Green Applies disk-drive style branding to SanDy-driven SSDs 8 Comments Oh my Tosh: SanDisk chatted to 3 other buyers before WD slurp Comment Who are companies A, B, C and D?

Project Alloy is the Intel Virtual Reality headset, and is definitely a big game changer for the gaming world and may start the boom of VR headsets. Intel CES 2017’s Project Alloy surprises everyone VR headsets may have been around the market for some time, but Project Alloy potentially can deliver something very unique: world travel at your home. In the Intel CES 2017 demonstration of Project Alloy, we were shown that the headset could do a virtual replica of the scanned room. Related: Shenmue 3 News: HD Remaster Domain Hints Possible Release Before Shenmue III Intel has dubbed this as a “merged reality” and the scanned objects were converted to look appropriate to the game scenery. Project Alloy will not need a separate PC or power source as the computer and battery are built in. Traveling the world without leaving your living room will be more fun and you don’t get to be tired at all. What more can Intel Virtual Reality Project Alloy offer? In an article by BBC.com, Intel also showcased a wide variety of uses for Project Alloy. Included in what was showcased was the 360 view of a waterfall in Vietnam, which is of course in high definition. Related: Google’s AI for SmartTV, Smartwatches and Car Systems Revealed Brian Krzanich, Intel’s CEO, announced in the presentation that the headset can potentially bridge the gap between the digital and the physical world. Among the other possible use is that the VR can be further enhanced through the use of drones and cameras to do rescue missions. Intel also presented its 2-in-1 PC powered by the next generation 10-nm Cannon Lake processor, and their plans for the world’s first 5G modem. Also a partnership between Intel, BMW Group, and Mobileye plans to release 40 autonomous cars this year as well. The Intel CES 2017’s Project Alloy will kick off starting in the fourth quarter of the year and potentially be available next year. Next year will surely be a great year especially for the VR world.

Forums Join   Despite No Actual 5G Standard, Intel Unveils First 5G Modem by Karl Bode Friday Jan 06 2017 08:30 EST Sure, there's no actual fifth generation wireless standard yet, and it may not even surface until later this year (at best). Deployments of the ultra-fast and low latency wireless tech isn't even expected to begin until 2020 (at best). But that's not apparently stopping Intel from proudly proclaiming that it's the first company in the world to unveil a new 5G modem. A company press release states that Intel's new 5G modem (pdf) features a baseband chip and a new 5G transceiver that enables both sub-6 Ghz and mmWave capabilities. Intel says the modem also incorporates 3GPP 5G NR (new radio) technology -- including low latency frame structures, advanced channel coding and massive MIMO -- to deliver "faster connectivity and ultra-responsiveness." "It’s the world’s first global 5G modem to enable initial 5G spectrum trials and deployments worldwide with a baseband chip that supports both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands," proclaims Intel. "Supporting ultra-wideband operation and enabling multi-gigabit throughput with ultra-low latency, the modem pairs both with Intel’s sub-6 GHz 5G RFIC and 28 GHz 5G RFIC to deliver a global reach across the key bands of interest for 5G systems." Granted it's worth reiterating that this modem technically doesn't exist yet, much like the networks it will eventually operate on. Intel says the Intel 5G RFIC is expected to sample in the first half of 2017, and the modem itself is expected to sample in the second half of 2017 and move into production soon afterwards.There's some additional detail in this full Intel 5G Modem spec sheet (pdf) for those interested. tags: business · hardware · bandwidth · networking · 5G News Jump Google Fiber in San Antonio Paused After Build ComplaintsDirecTV Loses 18 Channels in Yet Another Carriage Fee FightForum Topic: Does Installing Ethernet Raise Your Home Value?Friday Morning Links Riding 5G Hype, Redzone Launches '5Gx' Fixed Wireless ServiceGoogle Shuts Down Broadband Drone EffortsForum Topic: When Amazon's Echo Pulls a Hal 9000Verizon Bumps Top FiOS Speed to 750 MbpsWeekend Open Thread!FCC Report: AT&T And Verizon Are Violating Net Neutrality----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 8 comments Packeteers Premium Member join:2005-06-18 Forest Hills, NY Packeteers Premium Member 2017-Jan-6 8:44 am no thanks if intel's docsis 3.0/1 modem chips are any indication of their mastery over i/o best stay far away from any "5g" doorstop. · actions · 2017-Jan-6 8:44 am · How about ..

This means that anyone can enjoy the same experience even when switching from a Raspberry Pi to a PC or Mac. Read More , that comes as part of the Raspbian Jessie operating system. Basically it offers a slick, new user interface to the low-spec hobbyist mini-computer, and the results are stunning. Given the spec of the Raspberry Pi (we’re talking ARM processors without much RAM and no hard disk drive) it would be rather great if this OS could be ported to Intel and AMD 32-bit and 64-bit processors, to pump some new life into older PCs, wouldn’t it? Well, as fortune would have it, this is exactly what has happened Raspberry Pi Launches PIXEL for PC and Mac Raspberry Pi Launches PIXEL for PC and Mac The Raspberry Pi Foundation has released PIXEL on PC and Mac. This means that anyone can enjoy the same experience even when switching from a Raspberry Pi to a PC or Mac. Read More . The Raspberry Pi team has released a version of PIXEL for x86 and x64 computers, which means that there is a good chance that your old, low spec PC or laptop could be persuaded to run, and run well. Clean and Modern The Raspberry Pi Foundation was formed with a vision that “everyone should be able to afford their own programmable general-purpose computer.” The provision of this operating system for free beyond the confines of the $35 Raspberry Pi computer, proves just how much faith the developers have in it. Delivering a clean and modern — not to mention quick — user experience, PIXEL isn’t just a great way to revive some old hardware: it’s pleasing, too. Ads by Google PIXEL has various benefits beyond a usable user interface too. If you’re already using a Raspberry Pi (for projects at home, school, or your local maker space) then time wasted tweaking things, perhaps running a virtualized environment at home How to Emulate a Raspberry Pi on Your PC How to Emulate a Raspberry Pi on Your PC Rather than buy a Raspberry Pi and be disappointed, why not try the QEMU emulator to get a feel for it first? Read More and so on, is eliminated. The learning curve has gone, and you have a continuation of your project between the two devices. You can load up your scripts with the same software, as PIXEL for x32/x64 devices features all of the same utilities and programming tools as the Raspberry Pi version (with the exception of Minecraft and Wolfram Mathematica.) What Old PCs Will PIXEL Run On? It isn’t just any old PCs that PIXEL will run on. At the same time, it probably isn’t all. Your mileage may vary, but in short, if your computer will run Debian, then it should run PIXEL. That doesn’t just mean standard PCs and laptops — if you have a netbook, for instance, you should gain considerable mileage from running a low-footprint operating system and its desktop environment. We recently looked at how five lightweight Linux distros could be installed on an old netbook 5 Lightweight Linux Distros Ideal for an Intel Atom Processor PC 5 Lightweight Linux Distros Ideal for an Intel Atom Processor PC Don't let your Atom-powered netbook or low-specced laptop gather dust in a closet -- install a lightweight Linux distro and start enjoying mobile computing once again! Read More , and PIXEL offers the same advantages. But it doesn’t end there. Because Apple Mac computers have been running on Intel-based hardware for the past 10 years or so, they too can run PIXEL. Old Mac struggling under the weight of the latest macOS update? Reluctant to buy a replacement? Then try PIXEL! Download PIXEL To get PIXEL, you have two choices: Download the image from the Raspberry Pi website. Buy a copy of the latest MagPi magazine (issue 53), the Raspberry Pi magazine produced by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. This includes a cover-mounted Live DVD with PIXEL ready to run. In most cases, you’ll choose option one, and once the ISO file is downloaded, you’ll need to flash it to a USB stick (these steps will help Install Ubuntu On Your Computer Using a USB Flash Drive Install Ubuntu On Your Computer Using a USB Flash Drive Want to install Ubuntu but don't have a spare blank DVD? Don't worry! After downloadin the ISO file, you can use a highly-reusable USB flash drive to get the job done.

When an optical disc breaks, it's gone forever. We show you how to make digital and playable backups of your CDs and DVDs now! Read More . Note that PIXEL isn’t yet available to install. Instead, it is a live disc image. You should note, too, that it is extremely wise to make a backup of your current Windows, Linux, or macOS data in case of issues running PIXEL. After all, it’s not the finished product just yet. Running in a virtual machine will be safe, however. When running from USB, you’ll be able to decide whether you wish to run in persistent (enabling continuity of your PIXEL experience between boots) or non-persistent mode. The latter is the default for running from physical discs. No Installation: PIXEL on PC or Mac Once you’re ready, reboot your PC and insert the DVD or USB flash drive. If everything has worked out, you’ll find that the PIXEL loader boots, and a few minutes later, the live image will run. Done all of this? Good, now run an update: sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade This will ensure that any bugs are fixed, as this is an OS in early release. You might also want to try PIXEL on your PC in a virtual machine. Our various guides to using virtual machines cover what you need to use here. Start by installing Oracle VirtualBox, create a virtual machine, then run PIXEL as a guest OS. Again, no installation is currently necessary. PIXEL certainly joins our list of Linux operating systems you should try in a VM! Of Course It’s Great. It’s Linux! I first tried the Raspberry Pi back in 2012, when I received a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B as a gift. It was fun to use (and remains so) but the Debian-derived Raspbian operating system left a lot to be desired. Improvements over the years have helped improve this, but until PIXEL came along it seemed unlikely that the Pi would ever feel as polished as some other Linux distros. All that has changed now, and PIXEL is heading out into the world! While the lack of an installer is clearly a shortcoming, it is likely that a full installable version of PIXEL will arrive in the foreseeable future. If you’ve tried PIXEL on your old hardware, you’re probably already aware of how much of a difference it makes. If you’re running the OS from some fast flash-based media, you might be surprised to learn you’re even using the same PC! We’ve been pleasantly surprised, and think you will be too. So go ahead and try it! Let us know how it goes, and tell us what you think, in the comments below.

Intel introduced its latest mini-computer at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas yesterday. Called the Compute Card, the device is so small and thin it's the size of a credit card, just slightly thicker THE COMPUTE CARD  The Compute Card is a computer, complete with 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, memory, Bluetooth, storage and wireless connectivity. It measures about about 3.7 inches (9.4cm) by 2.2 inches (5.6cm) and just 0.2 inches (5mm) thick. Intel says the tiny computer is so small it cannot accommodate USB or other ports to power up or connect to displays.  It works by plugging into a slot in a larger device, similar to smart cards.   Intel said it will start shipping the cards in mid-2017.  It will not be sold directly to consumers and is only available for partners.  The Compute Card is a full blown computer, complete with cutting edge 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, memory, Bluetooth, storage and wireless connectivity. The device will not be sold directly to consumers, instead Intel has said the tiny machine will be sold to manufacturers to fit into other devices. But the card could potentially be used to extend the life of older gadgets.  It measures about about 3.7 inches (9.4cm) by 2.2 inches (5.6cm) and just 0.2 inches (5mm) thick. Intel says the tiny computer is so small it cannot accommodate USB or other ports to power up or connect to displays. It works by plugging into a slot in a larger device, similar to smart cards. The company is not positioning the card as a stand alone computer as yet, although they say that will come.  The idea is the Compute Card can easily be swapped in and out of smart devices so when one system in a TV or a fridge, for instance, becomes obsolete, you can just swap it out for a new card.

Share this article Share 146 shares The company believes the Compute is the computer of the future,  because it can be slotted into drones, robots, digital signs and other products.   'Businesses will be able to add a whole PC into products that otherwise have very little computing power,' said a CES analyst. The Compute Card could also make upgrading PCs as simple as plugging it into an existing computer to deliver the latest processors and other components. The new device measures about about 3.7 inches (9.4cm) by 2.2 inches (5.6cm) and just 0.2 inches (0.5cm) thick The idea is the Compute Card can easily be swapped in and out of smart devices so when one system in a TV or a fridge, for instance, becomes obsolete, you can just swap it out for a new card Intel is working with manufacturers like Dell, HP, Sharp and Lenovo to build specialized slots into devises, including PCs and home appliances like fridges and security cameras. The partners will take 'advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability, and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card,' Intel said in a statement.  Intel said it will start shipping the cards in mid-2017.  It will not be sold directly to consumers and is only available for partners, an Intel spokesman said.

Intel has unveiled a new modular compute platform, dubbed the Intel Compute Card. A miniature sized platform including elements like that of a full computer. The company also announced that it will have different partners working together to help in accelerating its solutions based ecosystem. These partners include Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp. Its ecosystem explores technologies and expertise for a connected world. The mini-computer has been designed to transform the compute and connectivity in future connected devices. The card’s functions include Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity with flexile I/O options so that hardware manufacturers can optimise for their solutions. It measures a total of 94.5mm x 55mm x 5mm. This device includes all the functions that are needed to run smart devices such as smart fridges, smart kiosks, security cameras and other Internet of Things gateways. Announced at CES 2017, Intel said the card uses a variant within the USB-C port which is called ‘USB-C plus extension’, enabling it to connect with systems that it is plugged in to. The connector gives devices direct access to the USB and PCle buses, HDMI and DisplayPort video outputs. Intel says that the Intel Compute Card will be made available to run Windows, Linux and all other operating systems which are able to run on a low-end PC. Intel is yet to reveal all the specifications of its compute card, but is expected to release the information, along with availability and pricing in the middle of 2017. The compute card will also be available in mid-2017 with a range of processors such as its 7th gen Intel Core processors.   Tags Compute Homepage News List Intel PC smart gadgets Previous Article‘It’s time for action’ – UK firms demand better access to tech and connectivity post-Brexit Next ArticleLack of in-house skills and the underutilisation of technology continue to hold back charity IT Most read AWS looks to teach military vets cloud skills in IT training programme James Nunns 12th January 2017 Ukranian power outage: Are hackers testing for worldwide SCADA cyber attacks?

But first, the company kicked off its presentation by demonstrating that its next-gen 10nm "Cannon Lake" Core processor was alive and well. That's important, as Intel's current quad-core Kaby Lake chips have received mixed reviews from tech reviewers concerned that Intel had just revamped its existing 14nm process to add a few more megahertz. Cannon Lake moves to an entirely new process, offering the potential for a more dramatic jump. Brian Krzanich, Intel's chief executive, demonstrated the new chip playing back a recent Intel ad. We can expect more info about Cannon Lake this upcoming summer, and a more formal unveiling will likely be timed with the Intel Developer Forum in late summer 2017. Focus on VR Cannon Lake, like the current Kaby Lake, represents an opportunity not just for content creation but for content to be experienced through the magic of virtual reality. The problem is that there really isn't a good way to convey a VR experience, save for VR--2D video doesn't do it, and neither does 2D images. But throughout 2015 and 2016, Intel quietly gobbled up VR technology companies, including Replay Technologies and Voke. None apparently grabbed the attention Kraznich wanted, however, so he arranged for the keynote hall to be outfitted with Oculus Rifts and played back several VR demos (including a live 360-degree video feed, via drone) to the assembled press. Two demos stood out. The first was HypeVR's demonstration of stereoscopic VR, which rendered a pastoral scene from Vietnam with a 360-degree video loop playing back images of grazing water buffalo and a flowing river. But the objects in the video could be looked "around"--if I stood up, I could see more of the video behind the water buffalo in the foreground. It felt a bit artificial, though it did make the scene more visually interesting. Intel's Voke technology feels more like a winner. In concept, it's pretty simple: the broadcaster plants a 3D camera (or two) next to the action and lets the audience switch between them. In Intel's demo, they floated a 3D scoreboard overhead with a live feed of a Villanova basketball game. Though the game largely took place in "front" of the camera, the VR headset still allowed me to focus on what I was interested in. The only drawback was that the game exposed one of the weaknesses of the Oculus Rift: the relatively low resolution, compared to the 1080p or even 4K feeds that sports viewers are used to. Pushing VR into the hands of Intel customers, however, appears to be critical for Intel's future. Project Alloy, a simple "mixed reality" device that Intel disclosed previously, will be turned into a product, Krzanich announced. "We want this to bring the creativity and those experiences to where they need to be," he said. He did not say, however, which manufacturers will make Alloy, or what the price will be, though they will ship during the fourth quarter of 2017. Microsoft has also tried to lure hardware makers to make their own augmented-reality devices, with more success: Asus, Dell, HP, and others have signed on to make them.

(AP Photo/John Locher) By Wire reports Tags: Internet, Internet of Things, E-commerce, PC industry, Dell Las Vegas — The Latest on the CES gadget show in Las Vegas: Companies are upping the "wow" factor trying to stand out as the CES gadget show formally opens in Las Vegas. Samsung, one of the largest exhibitors at the show, is offering demonstrations of its boat racing, air show and other virtual-reality experiences in chairs that move around. Hyundai is offering VR demos for people to experience what it's like to ride in an autonomous car. Also drawing crowds are flashy concept cars like the Toyota Concept-i, with doors that flip up and a 3-D display inside. Polaroid is showing off its Cube+ Wi-Fi camera with a bizarre display of rotating — but fake — monkeys wearing the camera. Camera images are displayed in a live feed above. It's a nod to the monkey-shaped stand that Polaroid sells for the Cube. On the TV front, LG wowed with an OLED 4K display tunnel, which people enter to see the new technology. One of the longer lines on the floor was at MyCharger's Power Up bar — which offered a free MyCharger along with what appeared to be green beer. It's actually regular Sam Adams in a green dye-infused cup. CES takes place over several, sprawling venues in Las Vegas. About 165,000 visitors are expected by the time it closes Sunday. Intel's VR preview includes barf bags Intel thinks the future of virtual reality is skydiving in the desert, watching live sports from a ringside seat and cringing as zombies attack — all powered by Intel chips. Wednesday's demo featured leather chairs, Oculus sensors and headsets — and a barf bag, signaling this was not an ordinary press conference. [VIDEO: CNET provides a video report at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFobWjSYst4 ] "Intel announced a partnership with Hype VR to deliver high-fidelity video capture that allows viewers to move around a video scene as if they were there," CNET reports. One demo was a live feed from a 360-degree camera attached to a drone inspecting solar panels in a desert. Intel was showing how the technology could be used in a work environment. A more exciting live feed showed a college basketball game between Butler and Villanova. Travel experiences took viewers to a waterfall scene in Vietnam and a skydiving experience in the Moab Valley. A trailer for "Arizona Sunshine," a VR game, made viewers jump as zombies lunged for them. No one — noticeably — made use of the barf bags. CEO Brian Krzanich acknowledges that some people are questioning whether VR is going anywhere. He adds, "I hope these experiences give you a taste of where it's going." Whirlpool making fridges, stoves 'smart' Amazon doesn't have an official presence at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas but its Alexa voice control software seems to be everywhere. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its suite of smart-home appliances, including a stove and refrigerator. With that capability, someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as Amazon's Echo speaker. Jason Mathew, senior director of global connected strategy for Whirlpool, says voice is "the most natural way to interact with a product." Other gadgets that include Alexa: Sensory and OnVocal are both launching headphones that incorporate Alexa. Simplehuman is announcing a voice-activated trash can. And GE Lighting is launching a table lamp that includes Alexa software. Amazon has an edge on the market for now because its software has been out longer, but Google's and Apple's systems are catching up. Mathew says "Amazon is the most mature, but we expect to offer other options in the future." How to grow mobile payments? Sometimes, it takes incentives to persuade people to change their habits. Mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay still aren't widely used, in part because it isn't difficult for shoppers to pull out a plastic card at the cashier. Samsung tried to address that by offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent — redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. At a CES panel Thursday, Samsung executive Nana Murugesan said that since the launch of Samsung Rewards in November, daily usage of Samsung Pay has nearly doubled, while the number of users who make purchases almost daily more than doubles each week. The company hasn't specified the number of users and transactions, though analysts say it's still a small compared with cash and cards. Is Alexa spying on you? It's a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Comcast's Derrick Dicol likens it to people getting used to sharing their banking information online. Making hair sprays better Beauty brands L'Oreal and Karastase want to make bad hair days a thing of the past. The two companies teamed up with tech company Withings on a Hair Coach brush that uses a microphone, gyroscope and other sensors to monitor how fast and how hard a person is brushing. An accompanying app recommends how to brush for optimal quality and minimal breakage and split ends. It can also take into account hair-influencing factors like heat or humidity and even discern if hair is wet or dry. The "smart brush" has been garnering buzz at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Vincent Nida, worldwide general manager at Paris-based Kerastase, says one of the top beauty queries online is consistently about taking better care of your hair. The battery-powered brush starts collecting data when a user begins brushing. The smarts may seem like overkill considering the price of the brush — $200. By contrast, Amazon sells brushes for as little as $1. But Nida says you're getting a high-quality brush "even if you don't have batteries or you don't connect it to your cell phone." The Hair Coach brush is due out in mid-2017. Dell's keyboard-less Canvas Who needs a keyboard? Dell is introducing a new way to interact with your computer. The Dell Canvas 27 is a 27-inch glass surface that sits flat on a desk in front of a monitor. The touch surface is where a keyboard would normally be. Various widgets are available to manipulate items on the monitor. The Canvas also comes with a pen for sketching and creating. Dell envisions people using the device to edit photos and video, work on music and even work with financial tables. The goal is to replace clutter generally found on a desk. Instead of working with paper on a desk, just use the touch surface. The device launches in the spring and is expected to cost less than $2,000 — or around $3,000 with the monitor included. Lenovo has a similar concept in last fall's Yoga Book. It's a laptop that replaces the keyboard with a touch screen for both typing and doodling. But the screen is smaller, measuring 10 inches diagonally. Dell announced the Canvas at the CES gadget show on Thursday. Tom Holland, star of "Spider-Man: Homecoming," also stopped by to introduce two Dell products — a tablet and a gaming laptop — that will appear in the movie. Molecular physics on smartphones? Smartphones can do almost anything, but how about molecular physics? An Israeli startup has embedded a molecular sensor called Scio in a new smartphone that can analyze any material — whether that's the nutritional content of an apple or a person's body fat. Consumer Physics' scanners use infrared light to analyze molecular structure. The startup has been developing them for a few years, but this is the first time it's embedded in a mobile device — one from Chinese phone manufacturer Changhong. Is that a little too much science to carry around in your pocket? Consumer Physics CEO Dror Sharon says knowledge is power. He explains, "When we go out and buy stuff, eat stuff, drink stuff, we think we know what's in there, but we have no clue." Pricing and availability for the phone will be announced Friday at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas. Apple app store surging Apple's app store closed 2016 with 2.2 million apps, an increase of 20 percent from 2015. Apple says New Year's Day 2017 was the biggest day ever for app store purchases — people bought nearly $240 million of stuff in the digital marketplace. Nintendo's "Super Mario Run" was the most downloaded app worldwide on both Christmas and New Year's Day. The app is free to download, but it costs a whopping $10 to play the full version. In what should surprise no one, "Pokemon Go" was the year's most popular app. The game peaked over the summer, when hordes of people prowled real-life locations to catch digital pocket monsters through its innovative augmented reality interface. Other popular apps included Sweat With Kayla, a workout app, and Procreate, a painting and sketching app. The milestones were announced as the CES gadget show in Las Vegas formally opened, though Apple has no official presence there. ​ WRAL TechWire any time: Twitter, FacebookCopyright 2017 WRAL TechWire.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | January 6, 2017 -- 12:34 GMT (04:34 PST) | Topic: CES 2017: The Big Trends for Business Intel Compute Card First there was the Compute Stick, Intel's mini-computer that resembles a pack of gum. Now the chip giant is releasing a PC that's even more diminutive than that device. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage The new Compute Card is even thinner than the Compute Stick, looking more like a slightly bigger, thicker credit card. It's a mere 5mm thick, but still manages to house most of the essentials for a running computer. CNET: Intel's Compute Card could keep your gadgets from going obsolete Whereas the Compute Stick was at least partially marketed to consumers looking to stick a full-fledged PC in the HDMI port of their HDTV for living room computing tasks, the Compute Card is designed to be added to connected devices as a module that's easy to swap out when you want to upgrade its "smart" capabilities. Despite its dimensions, the Compute Card still fits most of the guts of a typical PC within its narrow frame. That even includes Intel's latest Core processors -- the seventh generation or Kaby Lake CPUs -- rather than the low-performance system-on-a-chip that Internet of Things devices typically ship with. It also naturally comes with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to connect the smart object with the greater world, along with what the company is calling a "USB-C plus extension" to connect the Compute Card with products. The fact that the Compute Card features most of what you need from a bare-bones PC will naturally lead some to wonder if Intel plans to offer this as a product that consumers can use for their own computing tasks, rather than it being placed in a smart refrigerator or vending machine. While the company is clearly marketing the Compute Card as an IoT platform, it's not inconceivable that you could place it in a compatible dock and use it like the Compute Stick or other PCs on a stick. The companies that Intel lists as partners for the platform should give hope to those who might want a Compute Card of their own. It has Dell, HP, and Lenovo lined up to help it create products that can make use of the Compute Card, and obviously those manufacturers are much better known for building PCs than kiosks and digital signs. Intel says the Compute Card will be available by the middle of the year, so we'll wait to see what compatible devices are announced and whether docks to use it as a dedicated PC emerge on the company's road map.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

They have several chip samples on hand, and power consumption is all over the map, even running the same processor models at the same clock speed and voltage. Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 23:37 Jeremy Laird says: Bit of a minefield, HDR, especially as it pertains to monitors. I actually don’t think it changes a huge amount. You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

That’s pretty much the reason why I’ve been considering an upgrade from Haswell.

Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Here’s everything we know about the iMac 2017 UK release date, price and specification rumours. With Intel's new Kaby Lake processor announcements at CES 2017, new iMacs surely must be coming soon By Marie Brewis | 12 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Intel has announced Kaby Lake processors that we will likely see in Apple iMacs, but how long will we have to wait? A new iMac is hotly tipped for March 2017. Here’s everything we know about the iMac 2017 UK release date, price and specification rumours.  Also see: New MacBook Pro  iMac 2017 UK release date rumours: When is the iMac Pro coming out? New iMac UK release date: March 2017 (TBC)  Apple held a special event on 27 October in which it was expected to unveil new Macs. Chief among those Macs, following a Best Buy slip up that saw a Kaby Lake-powered iMac listed for sale, was a new iMac family. This didn't happen, but we're still fairly confident new iMacs are coming soon - with the next possible launch date March 2017. A Q1 2017 release date is all the more likely following Intel's Kaby Lake processor announcements at January's CES. We'd expect to see the S-Series desktop chips (7500/7600/7700K) in the 27in iMac, although there is no clear upgrade path for the 21.5in iMac - we'll just have to wait and see. Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated on an internal Q&A session that, "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." iMac 2017 UK price rumours: How much is the iMac Pro?  According to Best Buy, if accurate, a 27in iMac with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive will cost $3,199.99. This appears to be slightly higher than the current 27in iMac with 32GB RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive, though of course we don’t know exactly what other upgrades this model includes (and whether or not it is merely placeholder text).  Over in the UK the current 21.5in iMac starts at £899 or £1,199 with a 4K display, while the 27in 5K model starts at £1,449, both direct from Apple. We would expect prices to remain roughly the same.  iMac 2017 specification rumours: Is the iMac Pro any good?  Following that Best Buy leak, it’s highly likely the new iMac will feature a processor upgrade to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake family. The listing also mentioned a 27in 5K display, 32GB of memory and a 2TB Fusion Drive, with the model priced at $3,199.99. It could be placeholder copy, but why bother to update the processor? We’d really like to see this Fusion Drive rolled out as standard across the range.  Apple could well turn to AMD once again for its graphics solution, with Polaris 10 a prime candidate. It offers improved graphics performance (naturally), plus potential reductions in power consumption and waste heat. More exciting, though, is that these new graphics chips would for the first time bring VR potential to the Mac.  We’ve seen Apple bring the Pro name to its iPad line-up over the past year, and we’re anticipating that the iPad mini will also get a Pro makeover next week. One rumours circulating online is that the iMac will also get Pro treatment, and we could be about to see a sufficiently powerful iMac Pro to replace the Mac Pro.  Content continues below For more new iMac rumours see our sister site Macworld.

The lineup includes the next-gen Republic of Gamers (ROG) Maximus IX gaming motherboards and a new breed of ROG Strix gaming motherboards. These new motherboards come with a number of world-leading innovations, best-in class gaming audio, networking and connectivity, plus Aura RGB illumination and support for 3D-printed components as well. For Singapore, Asus is going to be bringing the following Maximus IX and Strix Z270 motherboards: ROG MAXIMUS IX FORMULA ROG MAXIMUS IX CODE ROG MAXIMUS IX HERO ROG STRIX Z270E GAMING ROG STRIX Z270F GAMING ROG STRIX Z270H GAMING ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING   The following Z270 motherboards will also be on sale in Singapore:   TUF Z270 MARK 1 TUF Z270 MARK 2 PRIME Z270-A PRIME Z270-K PRIME Z270M-PLUS PRIME B250M-A PRIME H270 PLUS PRIME H270 PRO   Detailed information regarding local pricing and availability is expected to be available in a few days. More information on the new motherboards can be found in the press release below: Commenting on the Z270 motherboard series, Joe Hsieh, ASUS Corporate Vice President and General Manager of Motherboard Business Unit & New Product Planning Division said, “Our previous generations have been validated and most awarded by many respected media outlets, proving that ASUS is the number-one motherboard brand. We strive to offer Best-selling, Easy-to-use, Stable and Trusted motherboards — that’s why we call them BEST. For our Z270 generation, we’ve taken innovation and customization to the max, with personalization features such as Aura Sync RGB lighting and support for 3D-printed components. We’ve also co-operated with Shapeways to launch a dedicated ASUS shop where users are able to purchase, download and customize and 3D-printable accessories worldwide — so they’ll never again have to stare into a drab, unexciting computer case. It’s time to unlock the power of 7th Generation Intel Core processors — and an ASUS Z270-series motherboard is the perfect way to do just that!” Built for performance: Multiple overclocking-friendly technologies ASUS is the world’s foremost motherboard manufacturer. Our world-class research-and-development teams are devoted to providing the best performance to users, with exhaustive testing that exceeds industry standards, giving users the ability and confidence to overclock to 5.0GHz or even beyond1 — and all with a single click from the ready-made UEFI profile. ASUS Z270 motherboards have multiple features to aid overclockers in their endeavors. ASUS-exclusive 5-Way Optimization dynamically optimizes essential aspects of the system based on real-time use, including the all-new Stress Test Distribution feature that allows users to adjust the proportion of CPU and DRAM stress for the best overclocking performance. As well, the latest-generation Fan Xpert 4 allows users to monitor the GPU temperature to ensure cooler usage scenarios when the graphics card is under heavy loads, such as during 3D content creation or when gaming. ASUS Pro Clock technology has a dedicated base-clock (BCLK) generator designed for 7th Generation Intel processors, enabling overclocked base-clock frequencies of up to 425MHz and beyond. It works in tandem with the ASUS TurboV Processing Unit (TPU) to enhance voltage and base-clock overclocking control, and boosts performance up to 5.4GHz and beyond. Third-generation ASUS T-Topology takes DDR4 memory overclocking to new heights — up to 4133MHz or even beyond2. Refined manufacturing ensures ultra-consistent quality and minimal crosstalk between custom trace paths, so users can enjoy the thrill of overclocking DDR4 with time-aligned signaling for superior stability. And ASUS motherboards are tested for compatibility with industry-leading 790+3 DDR4 memory modules — for great flexibility and reassurance. Built for customization: Aura Sync and 3D-printable components ASUS Aura Sync is the world’s first motherboard-RGB-synchronization technology, delivering distinctive light shows across Aura Sync-capable motherboards, graphics cards and peripherals for up to nine effects — all controlled via the simple and intuitive Aura app. The all-new Music mode is also able to pulse synchronized LEDs in time to the user’s favorite tunes. Users are able enhance their illumination still further, either via the integrated 4-pin/12V Aura RGB header or the included extension cable. Aura offers a brilliant spectrum of colors, and can even change shades to reflect the CPU temperature, providing valuable information at a glance. ASUS has always strived to make it easier for users to customize the cosmetic appearance of their PC components, and now it has become the world’s first motherboard brand to support 3D-printed components — making it easy for users to print their own parts to customize the motherboard’s appearance, improve system performance or manage cables. Dedicated onboard 3D mounts that use the same screws as M.2 and standard motherboard mounting holes make fitting 3D-printed parts easy, so users can quickly add custom nameplates, cable covers, or even an M.2 fan holder to lower M.2 temperature by up to 30°C — preventing throttling. ASUS has also designed a series of 3D-printable accessories, including 2-way SLI™ bridge cover, fan grille, ROG-font letters and all sizes of cable combs, adding style to any build. ASUS has also cooperated with Shapeways, the world’s largest 3D-printing service company, to launch the ASUS 3D Printing Store. This hosts the full selection of ASUS 3D-printable parts, enabling users to select the parts they want to print — replete with preferred materials and color — and order directly via Shapeways. For advanced customization, the original CAD files are available for download, allowing users to personalize them as much as they want before ordering parts via the Shapeways printing service or using their own 3D printers. Record-breaking performance: Redefining limits for the 7th Gen era The all-new ROG Maximus IX Apex motherboard is the latest ground breaking model in the ROG product family which brings players back to ROG’s roots, a one-of-kind community for world-class cutting-edge enthusiasts looking to reach the apex of gaming performance. With a performance-oriented layout, the Apex enables overclocking enthusiasts to go beyond the limits by using extreme cooling methods, including liquid nitrogen (LN2) or liquid helium (LHe)— and it’s already scored multiple world records (WRs) and global first places (GFPs), several being long-standing records. These include the best Intel Core processors CPU frequency processors, with a record of 7.383GHz on a single core and one thread and 7.328GHz on four cores and eight threads using the Intel Core i7-7700K. It also set a reference clock (BCLK) at 584MHz and a memory frequency surpassing 5GHz, with 5041MHz. In total, the Maximus IX Apex has secured eight world records and 13 global first places, as detailed in the following table: Category Benchmark New Score WR/GFP   PiFast 8sec 72ms WR   SuperPi 1M 4sec 937ms WR   SuperPi 32M 4mn 17sec 500ms WR   Cinebench R11.5 -4x 16.73 GFP   Cinebench R15 -4x 1515 GFP 2D Benchmarks GPUPI for CPU -1B x4 225643 GFP   Geekbench3 multi –x4 29463 GFP   HWBOT Prime -4x 8471 GFP   wPrime 32M – 4x 2sec 891ms GFP   wPrime 1024M – 4x 1mn 31sec 516ms GFP   XTU – 4x 2301 GFP           Aquamark       1x GPU 652098 GFP   3DMark2001 SE       1x GPU 212326 WR   3DMark03       1x GPU 351557 WR Legacy Benchmarks 2x GPU 342682 GFP   3DMark05       1x GPU 88398 WR   2x GPU 87604 GFP   3DMark06       1x GPU 68888 WR   2x GPU 68766 GFP           Unigine Heaven – Xtreme preset     3D Benchmark 1x GPU 11009.58 GFP   2x GPU 11187.77 WR *All world records were verified on 3rd January 2017 on HWBOT.org       Leave a comment SCAN THIS QR CODE WITH YOUR PHONE Close Next Post MSI debuts new Intel 200-series gaming motherboards Related Post The Strangest Gadgets of CES 2017 CES 2017 has just concluded, and we’ve seen many promising gadgets, such as LG’s paper-thin Related Post Panasonic unveils the rugged Toughpad FZ-A2 Android tablet Panasonic has announced a new Android tablet for consumers who care more about durability than Tags ASUS CES 2017 Intel 200-series chipset Intel Z270 Kaby Lake motherboards News PRIME B250M-A PRIME H270 PLUS PRIME H270 PRO PRIME Z270-A PRIME Z270-K PRIME Z270M-PLUS ROG MAXIMUS IX CODE ROG MAXIMUS IX FORMULA ROG MAXIMUS IX HERO ROG STRIX Z270E GAMING ROG STRIX Z270F GAMING ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING ROG STRIX Z270H GAMING Skylake TUF Z270 MARK 1 TUG Z270 MARK 2 Z270 © 1999 - 2016 VR Zone AP Pte.

The object Patterson produces from his pocket, not much larger than a credit card, is packing a fully functional system — CPU, SSD, RAM, and Wi-Fi — with a pair of ports on one end, which Intel says are USB Type-C with “extensions” that enable advanced connectivity like PCIe — with some room to spare for future improvements. More: Intel crams its freshly baked seventh-gen CPUs into five new NUC mini PCs It may seem like a smaller Compute Stick on the surface, but the Compute Card plays a very different role in the Intel system lineup. Hardware manufacturers, which already include big names like HP, Dell, InFocus, Lenovo, LG, and Sharp, will use Intel’s specifications to build the Compute Card into their new products. It’s an easy way for a company that does’t have experience producing tiny smart internals to add the functionality into a new device. Now LG doesn’t have to figure out how to produce the computing portion of its fridge, it can just outsource the problem. Even better, it means you don’t need to replace your fridge when you want new features — you can just upgrade the card. It also allows for some novel new advancements in modular security. The card can be built to physically latch into a device, or only release with software control, preventing unauthorized access. It can even be tied to a specific system, so inserting it into a card dock elsewhere wouldn’t work, thanks to a TPM module. No word on pricing or system specifics yet, but Patterson says it will scale up from Atom to full Intel Core processors with time. It’s also not the kind of system consumers would buy, although Intel says the idea of a NUC-sized dock for interested enthusiasts has been kicked around. Also watch: Share

Ars Staff - Jan 6, 2017 12:30 pm UTC reader comments 68 Share this story What happens at CES, ends up in a video montage. Jennifer Hahn LAS VEGAS—The annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas tries to get consumers (and the media) excited for the new year with a treasure trove of new devices. Most of the big names in computing, gaming, fitness tech, smart home, and more show off some of their newest products that will come out later in the year. And until they hit shelves (if they hit the shelves), CES is the only way to get a glimpse of them. While the show's vastness results in a lot of seemingly useless hardware and even some vaporware—Ars UK has intel on the smart hairbrush, LG wants to make sure no one ever has to open a fridge manually again—there are always a few products that stick out and manage to get us genuinely excited for the year ahead. You can find all our coverage from the ground here if you want to wade through both the crazy and cool, but these are our picks for the best technology coming out of CES 2017. Best laptop or convertible: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Enlarge Valentina Palladino Traditionally when buying a laptop, one has to compromise. You’ll find a system that has almost everything you want, but there’s always something missing. We wrote about some of the basic features that we're going to insist on for laptops in 2017, and one machine shown at CES stood out as doing all the things we want. With Thunderbolt 3, NVMe storage, Precision Touchpads, biometric authentication, touch screens, and so much more, we're ready to lay hands on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga. The Yoga nails the basics. It also includes the 360-degree hinge that's invaluable on a plane or in a kitchen, a stylus that docks within the unit for safekeeping, built-in LTE connectivity, 802.11ad/WiGig, and (unusual these days) wired gigabit Ethernet. That's a compelling start, but it's the range of options that takes the Yoga to the next level: you can add an OLED screen, Iris Plus graphics, both a fingerprint reader and an IR camera supporting facial recognition, and NFC. The result is a machine that sets a new standard for connectivity and capabilities, showcasing some of the latest technology—and doing so without compromises. Best desktop or all-in-one: Intel Kaby Lake NUCs Enlarge Intel Further ReadingIntel’s new mini PCs have new chips, an updated design, and Thunderbolt 3 We've seen some interesting-looking all-in-one desktops at the show this year, including Dell's XPS 27 and HP's Pavilion Edge All-in-One with Micro-Edge Display. But in terms of sheer versatility and appeal, we've got to give the moniker of best to Intel's new NUC mini desktops. We've been fans of these PCs for years. Like the older NUCs, the new ones put decent Ultrabook-level performance suitable for productivity tasks and light gaming into a little box that will fit just about anywhere. The new models get an attractive makeover, the latest Kaby Lake CPUs and GPUs, HDMI 2.0 and HDMI-CEC support that will be sure to interest home theater enthusiasts, and a Thunderbolt 3 port that will allow for fast external storage, external GPUs, and all kinds of other possibilities. Best PC peripheral: Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ 27-inch gaming monitor Enlarge Asus Simply being first to something in the tech world isn’t necessarily a guarantee for quality or excellence. But when someone can lay claim to launching the consumer market's first monitor to combine 4K resolution, 144Hz refresh, HDR-10 compatibility, and Nvidia G-Sync support, they're bound to get our attention. Just finding three of those four in a PC monitor is tough these days. (The best we've seen, up until now, is Dell's UP3017Q, which maxes its 4K resolution at a 120Hz refresh without G-Sync.) Adding the wider color gamut and luminance differential of HDR to that package is a nice, brightly rendered cherry on top. You'll need quite the powerful computer to render such crisp, colorful, and smooth content, of course, but if you're already spending so much on a gaming powerhouse, what's another pricey monitor to you? Best gaming hardware: HTC Vive's TPCast Enlarge While the HTC Vive's room-scale VR experience is unquestionably amazing, it's also unquestionably annoying to deal with a thick, three-piece wire that tethers you to a nearby PC tower, tugging on the back of the headset and creating a tripping hazard while you walk around. That's why we're excited about the TPCast, which promises to make the Vive a truly wireless experience by streaming video and audio to the headset from a PC over the air (though there is still a wire running to a pocketable battery pack). There have been other untethered VR experiences, of course, but so far they tend to rely on underpowered mobile technology and have trouble with full head-tracking through space. TPCast promises the best of both worlds—high-end VR graphics and tracking without the annoying tether. If you can afford the $250 cost and can tolerate the reported two-hour battery life, this could greatly increase the quality of your virtual life.

The technology, which is a full-fledged computer, is the smallest and thinnest that the company has produced.  ( Intel ) Advertisement Intel might just have solved the challenge for the modular device concept with a breakthrough technology it unveiled at CES 2017. Called simply as the Compute Card, the device packs all necessary components required to run a computer or a smart device. You can merely plug it to a monitor or even an old smartphone and it will instantly turn each into a powerful computing device. More importantly, you can use it as a module for existing hardware so you will no longer need to keep on purchasing new ones. Tiny Full-Fledged Computer What is so cool about this Intel technology is its size. The Compute Card has about the same size footprint of a credit card and it is only 5 mm thick. The real estate is an incredible feat considering the fact that it already houses a motherboard, memory modules, storage, and Wi-Fi radio, among others. According to Gizmodo, this contraption could even include the latest Kaby Lake processor and it will not get any bigger at all. To top it all, Intel has promised the consistency of its form factor even after future upgrades. As a standalone computer, it can function in the same manner a USB stick works. You can plug it to a monitor at home and bring it with you to work. The only difference is that instead of a portable file storage, you will be carrying an entire computing system with you. No More Gadget Obsolescence Not a few, therefore, are already expecting the Compute Card to prevent any form of tech obsolescence. To put it another way, a device only gets upgraded with modules, complementing the Compute Card running at its core. This will be the case for devices that will have a dedicated Compute Card slot. Intel has already revealed that it is now working with several OEMs and the number is not limited to computer manufacturers. "Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs," Intel said in an official statement. "This reduces the time and resources needed to design and validate the compute block and helps speed up innovation to bring the power of intelligence into an ever wider range of devices." Compatibility The Compute Card's power seems best applied to devices that are hard to upgrade such as smart appliances, cars, smart kiosks, and other internet-of-things gateways. When it debuts in the middle of this year, for example, the Compute Card will be found inside a Sharp television. The appliance is first in the queue since it now has Foxconn as a parent company. The Chinese manufacturer is Intel's partner in the development of the Compute Card. TAG Intel, Foxconn, Intel Kaby Lake, CES 2017 © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Moore’s Law, which predicts that the number of transistors in a circuit will double every two years, has proved true since its introduction in the 1960s, but speculation has mounted since 2012 that the law will soon falter as technological progression reaches a peak. But Intel CEO Brian Krzanich used the new PC to demonstrate that “Moore’s Law is alive and well and flourishing”, according to Digital Trends. The publication reported that the unnamed 2-in-1 PC is the first to feature a 10nm chip, which Krzanich said will allow hardware manufacturers to build slimmer, more powerful devices that can better support virtual reality. He added: “So for those who are wondering if Moore’s Law is alive, is 10 nanometers going to be here, the answer is absolutely yes. And I believe Moore’s Law will be well beyond my career — alive and well and kicking.” Intel’s 10nm chip will feature in other products before the end of 2017, Digital Trends reported, with a recent Intel leak suggesting the Cannon Lake processor design could also push into 2018 in the form of Kaby Lake U and H chips.  Qualcomm also announced a 10nm chip, the Qualcomm Centriq 2400, at CES yesterday, after teasing them in December. Previous reports suggest Intel will start production of 7nm chips in 2020, and 5nm in 2022 if silicon remains a cost-effective material for processors.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 21:19 vahnn says: I heard from a friend that they tend to run very hot when overclocking. Have any info on that? Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 01:53 Person of Interest says: Tomshardware has some good words about this. They have several chip samples on hand, and power consumption is all over the map, even running the same processor models at the same clock speed and voltage. Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 23:37 Jeremy Laird says: Bit of a minefield, HDR, especially as it pertains to monitors. I actually don’t think it changes a huge amount. You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 21:40 thedosbox says: Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. That’s pretty much the reason why I’ve been considering an upgrade from Haswell. And while AMD’s Ryzen sounds promising, I remain skeptical about their ability to deliver on those promises – or that they will leapfrog Kaby Lake.

System has held up a lot longer than I expected it to. Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 22:22 GunnerMcCaffrey says: So then, to someone who is fairly new to all this but also needing an upgrade before long, does this mean price drops are likely any time soon on the 6xxx series of i5s? Or is that not how it works? Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 22:49 thedosbox says: Intel don’t generally cut prices on their old kit. You might be able to get a CPU/motherboard combo on sale, though that will be down to individual retailers.

I tried win 10 for a week and found out it is basically an advertisement platform that is incompatible with my older games that I haven’t played yet. thanks Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 03:03 Person of Interest says: Some of the review sites tested their Kaby Lakes on Windows 7. No problems reported from them, although the integrated graphics seem to be giving some Win7 users trouble, and I didn’t see any reviews test the new stuff in Kaby Lake (more video decoding features and more granular power management). Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 09:25 ButteringSundays says: People are funny with their hobbies :) The CPU in my box is nearly 5 years old and works absolutely fine, the only time it’s ever been a bottleneck is when playing dwarf fortress. I think some folks just like a new shiny. Graphics cards of course are a different story. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:03 Ghostwise says: People are funny with their hobbies. Yeah. I hear that there are even grown-ups who play video games, these days. Little Pac-Man and whatnot. That’s ridiculous. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

It’s pretty hard to actually find a motherboard without one, at least looking at consumer chipsets. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 15:22 fish99 says: I was considering a CPU upgrade from my 3570K recently, but after looking up some benchmarks, was surprised to see a 6600K is only 11% quicker, and that’s with it running 100 MHz quicker than my 3570K. And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 15:28 fish99 says: Actually that’s got to be Gb/s, not GB/s. Log in to Reply 07/01/2017 at 15:44 Chorltonwheelie says: Yeah, still see no reason to upgrade from my venerable i5 3570k at all. Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel. Log in to Reply 07/01/2017 at 03:21 Ovidiu GOA says: Getting a 4690k few years ago was one of the best choices i did. Same as getting the previous Q6600 in 2007. Cpu wise I’m set for another 3 years at least. 4800mhz overclock is running smooth on the 4690k, I’m happy. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

This fleet of self-driving BMW 7 Series cars will be tested in the US and Europe. This news follows last July’s announcement that the 3 firms would be cooperating on the development of self-driving vehicles. Since the partnership was first announced, the companies have succeeded in developing “a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state of the art designs and create differentiated brands.” “Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye. This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles. Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies — manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies — to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform,” stated Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. “This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle,” he added. As you would expect, BMW will be responsible for the actual real-world testing of the self-driving fleet, as well as the evaluation of the overall functional safety of the technologies. BMW will also be responsible for the integration of the various components and prototype production. The press release provides more: “Within the car, the Intel GO solution offers a scalable development and compute platform for critical functions including sensor fusion, driving policy, environment modeling, path planning and decision making. In the data center, Intel GO offers a wide range of technologies ranging from the high performance Intel Xeon processors, to Intel Arria 10 FPGAs and Intel Solid State Drives to the Intel Nervana platform for artificial intelligence that provides a powerful machine and deep learning training and simulation infrastructure required for the autonomous driving industry. “Mobileye contributes its proprietary EyeQ5 high-performance computer vision processor offering automotive-grade functional safety and low-power performance. The EyeQ5 is responsible for processing and interpretation of input from the 360-degree surround view vision sensors as well as localization. EyeQ5, in combination with Intel CPU and FPGA technologies, which forms the Central Computing Platform to be integrated into each autonomous vehicle.” BMW and Mobileye will apparently be working closely to develop the sensor fusion solution — which will integrate LiDAR, camera, and radar inputs. As a reminder here, the plan is apparently for the test efforts to lead directly to the release of the BMW iNEXT model in 2021. So … don’t get too impatient as a result of the news, we’ve quite a while to go before BMW releases a fully autonomous car.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Jef Cozza. Updated January 4, 2017 9:04AM SHARE ALSO SEE CES Intel Processor Chip Kaby Lake Hardware Laptops Desktops Enterprise IT Technology News Chipmaker Intel announced updates to its core CPU series yesterday, in preparation for the CES 2017 tradeshow in Las Vegas, which officially opens Jan 5. The announcement focused on launch of the remaining models in the 7th generation of its Intel Core processors. The addition of the desktop versions of the Kaby Lake processors should have plenty of appeal for enterprise clients thanks to improved performance, security, and graphics. The new CPUs feature several small improvements in efficiency and performance over Intel's previous Skylake models. Improved Integrated Graphics One of the key differences between Kaby Lake and Skylake is an upgraded video engine. This can be important for laptops that lack the space for a dedicated graphics card, but often has little impact on the desktop market where users can add a dedicated GPU. But most corporate customers aren't going to invest in separate graphics cards for their employees' desktops. For these buyers, the improved media engine offers the promise of improved graphics and video rendering performance during their next upgrade cycles without having to spend any extra cash on a GPU. "With the latest 7th Gen Intel Core vPro processors, business owners and IT managers can offer new PCs with up to 10 hours of battery life and a 65 percent increase in productivity when compared with a 5-year-old PC," Navin Shenoy (pictured above), senior vice president and general manager for the Client Computing Group at Intel, said in a statement about the launch. "And with many Millennials today taking technology into consideration when choosing their workplace, I'm confident the new 7th Gen Intel Core processor-based 2 in 1s and AIOs will delight them." Enhanced Security for Enterprises The new Kaby Lake chips make use of the same 14nm manufacturing process that Intel introduced with the launch of its Broadwell chips several years ago. Nevertheless, Intel is claiming that the new chips show a significant improvement in performance over the previous Skylake processors, with up to 20 percent improvement for performance and gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops. For 4K and 360-degree content, users can expect up to 65 percent faster performance on notebooks and 35 percent faster on desktops, the company said. But the biggest news for enterprise clients is likely the new improvements in security. The new chips feature several advances in hardware-enhanced security and two-factor authentication. The new processors feature Intel's hardware-based Authenticate multi-factor authentication solution. Authenticate verifies user identity using a combination of hardened factors such as a PIN, a Bluetooth signal from the user's phone or a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint, making employee logins many times more secure than traditional password logins. The new integrated graphics engine and hardwired security features of the Kaby Lake chips will likely make it appealing to businesses that were already looking to replace their aging IT infrastructures.

Hackers Release Malware Tools   Review: Samsung Gear S3 Classic   Concierge Tech Comes to Cruise Line   iPhone 8: Rumor of the Week   MORE IN HARDWARE PC Sales Continue on Downward Slide Dell Intros Wireless Charging Laptop Samsung Debuts Chromebook at CES New Snapdragon 835 Chip Debuts Intel, Dell Show Off New Products Next Article > Qualcomm Unveils Smaller, More Powerful Snapdragon 835 Chip By Shirley Siluk / Top Tech News. Updated January 04, 2017. The next generation of Qualcomm Technologies' Snapdragon system-on-chip (SoC) will be far smaller, thinner and more power-efficient than than the previous version. It will also support faster wireless connectivity for mobile computing, gaming and multimedia use, the company said yesterday. Introduced yesterday ahead of the kick-off to CES 2017, which runs from Jan. 5 through Jan. 8, in Las Vegas, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 is made by Samsung using a new 10-nanometer design that could put new pressure on competitor Intel. Currently, the global microprocessor leader, Intel is still producing 14-nanometer-based chips, although the company said it expects to begin shipping 10-nanometer technology sometime this year. Qualcomm's new design for the Snapdragon 835 makes the SoC 35 percent smaller than the previous version, the Snapdragon 820. Combined with the Snapdragon 835's improved power profile, that means the new chip could enable significantly better battery life, charging, camera images and virtual reality applications for a range of devices, Qualcomm said. 835 To Appear in New Smart Glasses "[A]s we embark on a new era of intelligent, connected experiences, our mobile devices are going to need a new, one-of-a-kind processor that's smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient than any chipset in history," Francisco Cheng, Qualcomm's director of technical marketing, wrote yesterday on the company's Snapdragon blog. "Qualcomm Technologies' newest mobile SoC is designed to meet every one of these rigorous requirements while setting new standards in mobile performance." The architectural improvements in the Snapdragon 835 will pave the way for a new wave of capabilities in smartphones, virtual reality (VR) gear, Bluetooth devices, 4G connectivity and security-focused authentication, Cheng said. The improved computing power of the new SoC will also enable smarter and more dynamic machine learning applications, he added. One of the first VR devices to incorporate the Snapdragon 835 will be Osterhout Design Group's R-8 and R-9 smart glasses, both set to hit the market later this year. Unveiled at CES yesterday, the devices will allow wearers to view movies and videos, play games and read articles and books, among other uses. Improvements Across 5 Key Technologies Qualcomm said the Snapdragon 835 will help deliver improvements across five key technologies: battery life, virtual/augmented reality immersion, image and video capture, connectivity and security. One of the chip's new features, Qualcomm Haven, is a security platform that supports biometric authentication via fingerprint, eye and face-based imagery. The Snapdragon 835 also features an upgraded software framework for neural processing that will enable new machine learning capabilities, Qualcomm said. Original equipment manufacturers and software developers will be able to use these capabilities for "rich experiences such as intelligent photography, strong security and privacy protection, smart automobiles and personal assistants, and responsive and true-to-life VR and AR," Qualcomm said. Faster connectivity will be provided through the chip's new integrated Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, which can support download speeds of up to one gigabit per second and upload speeds of up to 150 megabits per second, Qualcomm said. The company added that the new Snapdragon is also the first certified commercial technology to support the latest Bluetooth 5 standard, which promises signficant improvements over the previous Bluetooth 4 range and connection speeds. In production now, the Snapdragon 835 will begin appearing in commercial devices hitting the market in the first half of this year, Qualcomm said.

The maxim, which became known as Moore’s law, directed technology companies for five decades before reaching a crunch point last year. Physicists and technology giants alike said transistors had reached a point where it was no longer economically viable to make them smaller, bringing about the end of the law. But Intel’s chief executive Brian Krzanich has put an end to such fears with news the company will release a 10 nanometre chip in 2017. The tiny chip will be cheaper than its predecessor, Intel said, keeping Moore’s law alive. "I've heard the death of Moore's law more times than anything else in my 34-year career and I'm here today to really show you and tell you that Moore's law is alive and well and flourishing," Krzanich said. The news came as Intel opened the doors on its virtual reality project, which includes applications for the technology, content production and a headset. For Krzanich, VR is one of the most exciting uses of the faster processor coming this year. “Imagine in your living room being able to walk around the next hotel you’re going to visit, or visiting the event you’re going to,” said Krzanich in a demonstration of the VR uses Intel is working on at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Some of the applications Intel is developing include live sports games in VR and monitoring remote areas, such as solar panel farms, through a live 360 video stream from a drone and a VR headset. The chipmaker has teamed up with La Liga to fit three stadiums with 360-degree cameras that will stream to 38 channels this year. “From the comfort of your home you could be transported to your favourite seat,” said Krzanich. “This is the future of how you’ll view sports. You’ll have the opportunity to go to games you’ve never been to before.”   David Fuller's view I do not assume that silicon chips will always be used for the more complex challenges, because the technology for transistors is still in its infancy, relative to future developments.  We live in an exciting era of accelerating technological innovation, which will not end of its own accord. This item continues in the Subscriber’s Area, where a PDF of The Telegraph’s article is also posted.   Email of the day On the economic consensus being horribly wrong: Dear David I really enjoyed reading this very positive article about the UK economy which was written by a distinguished and well-informed commentator. All the points he makes sound good sense to me. The most surprising thing is the newspaper in which it was published, the rabidly anti-Brexit Independent. Maybe some newspapers are at last tiring of their own negativity! Best wishes   David Fuller's view Thanks for this and more people in the UK now hold similar views, than at the time of the referendum. The biggest risk, in my opinion, would be a frustratingly long exit from the EU, which would increase uncertainty, not least within both the UK and international business communities.  I hope the Supreme Court will bear this in mind and decide on what is best for the UK under the current circumstances.  However, if it rules that legislation is required before notice of Brexit is served – a debatable legal point - I think the additional delay would be both divisive and more costly for the UK economy.   President Mark Zuckerberg? It May Not Be as Crazy as It Sounds Here is the opening of this intriguing article by James Titcomb for The Telegraph: When 13 tech bosses – among them some of the world’s richest entrepreneurs – were summoned for a meeting with Donald Trump, one face was conspicuous in its absence. Facebook’s role in the US election had been much scrutinised: it was accused of being a petri dish for fake news that allowed anti-Clinton stories to spread like wildfire; and the social network was employed to great effect by the Trump campaign, which built up profiles of voters to target and bombarded them with ads. And yet, Mark Zuckerberg was nowhere to be seen at Trump Tower. Instead, he sent his trusted deputy and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, making Facebook the only company at the meeting without its CEO in attendance. Zuckerberg has not explained his absence, but two likely – and related – reasons may well become clear. Firstly, the man who started Facebook 13 years ago now has priorities outside of its daily running: as with many tech founders, he would prefer the nitty gritty of advertising relationships and regulatory tangles to be dealt with by someone else, as Zuckerberg focuses on his missions – the $45bn fund he has set up with his wife Priscilla Chan, or the internet.org project to bring connectivity to the world’s poor. But more fundamentally, Zuckerberg may see a photo-op with the president-elect as harming his own political ambitions, especially if he plans to act on them sooner rather than later. If your main impression of Facebook’s founder came through seeing The Social Network in 2010, you might find the film's portrayal of Zuckerberg as an awkward Machiavellian schemer a little difficult to square with the idea of a role in public office. But in recent years he has been spring cleaning his image. Connecting directly to the world via his own Facebook page, Mark Zuckerberg is now the family man, the internationalist and the statesman (his profile is full of images documenting meetings with Narendra Modi, officials in Beijing, and Pope Francis). While like much of his Silicon Valley brethren, he is a natural liberal, lobbying on immigration and science research, but Zuckerberg has been careful to appeal to a wider base. In response to allegations that Facebook suppressed conservative news, he fired the team responsible and replaced them with supposedly bias-free algorithms. He has declined to take the immediate action that many liberals demanded on Facebook’s fake news problem. He has come out as religious after years of claiming atheism, a move that a cynic could point to as practically mandatory for high office. And most recently, he announced his ambition to visit every state in the US in order to understand the effect of globalisation. “We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone,” he said on Tuesday.   David Fuller's view It may seem a bit early to be discussing this possibility shortly before President-elect Trump is sworn in on 20th January… but perhaps not.  After all, Trump has certainly opened the door for unconventional candidates who have never held political office. Might the possibility of a bad Trump presidency close that door?  Theoretically, yes although I think it would be premature to assume that Trump will be judged as having more failures than success over the next four years.  In any event, Trump and Zuckerberg have very different profiles.   I think it would be a great idea if Zuckerberg ran for President in 2020, or 2024.  Governance is everything and countries with the most capable leaders generally outperform.  If nominated by his Party, I suspect Zuckerberg would win.   America's Roster of Public Companies Is Shrinking Before Our Eyes This article by Maureen Farrell for the Wall Street Journal may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: The number of U.S.-listed companies has declined by more than 3,000 since peaking at 9,113 in 1997, according to the University of Chicago’s Center for Research in Security Prices. As of June, there were 5,734 such public companies, little more than in 1982, when the economy was less than half its current size. Meanwhile, the average public company’s valuation has ballooned. In the technology industry, the private fundraising market now dwarfs its public counterpart. There were just 26 U.S.-listed technology IPOs last year, raising $4.3 billion, according to Dealogic. Meanwhile, private U.S. tech companies tapped the late-stage funding market 809 times last year, raising $19 billion, Dow Jones VentureSource’s data show. Private funding markets have taken on attributes of public equity, such as an ability to hand employees shares they can trade. Airbnb Inc.’s recent $850 million funding round, which valued the home-rental company at $30 billion, enabled employees to sell $200 million of stock. Investors, particularly in late-stage funding rounds, now often have a better view of a private company’s financials than they used to, including through quarterly conference calls. “There’s no great advantage of being public,” says Jerry Davis, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business and author of “The Vanishing American Corporation.” “The dangers of being a public company are really evident.”   Eoin Treacy's view There have been two important themes that have shaped the view going public is not the most worthwhile exercise for new companies. The overbearing nature of regulatory requirements has increased substantially over the last decade, not least in response to the financial crisis, and this represents a significant cost for public companies which private companies avoid. It is quite simply a hassle for small companies to go through the motions of preparing earnings reports on a quarterly basis and formulating them in such a way as to be amenable to analysts.   Bitcoin Suffers Biggest Fall in Two Years Following China Currency Gains This article by Martin Baccardax for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here it is in full: Bitcoin's value suffered its biggest single-day decline in two years Thursday, just hours after China's offshore yuan posted its biggest two day gain and days after the cryptocurrency touched $1,000. The price of bitcoins against the U.S. dollar fell 13% in London trading, changing hands at around $950 each by 13:45 GMT. Bitcoins traded as low as $880 during a volatile session which saw it reach as high as $1137, according financial bookmakers IG. The moves follow the biggest two-day gain on record for China's offshore yuan, which trades more freely than the domestically controlled currency of the world's second-largest economy. Speculation of government buying led the gains as investors bet authorities are determined to stem capital outflows and avoid a sustained decline in the currency ahead of the inauguration of President elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to label China as a currency manipulator. The connection is relevant in the nearly all of the daily trading in bitcoin is linked to the yuan, which has fallen more than 7% against the dollar over the past year, as speculators attempt to skirt currency controls and ensure value. The offshore yuan gain 1% to 6.7989 against the greenback in Asia trading, putting downward pressure on the dollar index and boosting the yen in foreign exchange trading. The move whipsawed the dollar index, a measure of its strength against a basket of six global currencies, from a near 14-year high on Tuesday to three-week low of 101.74 by the start of European trading before it recovered to 102.10 by 13:45 GMT   Eoin Treacy's view I have been pointing out in recent audios that China represents the majority of Bitcoin trading and what goes on in that country is likely to have a profound impact on the value of the cryptocurrency. In many respects we might look on Bitcoin as the anti-Renminbi because it tends to do best when Chinese investors are worried about the stability of their domestic currency.   Treasuries Soar Most Since Post-Brexit as Market Volatility Hits This article by Brian Chappatta and Edward Bolingbroke for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: Treasuries extended gains across the curve, driving down benchmark yields by the most since the days after the June Brexit vote, as traders across financial markets backed away from crowded bets. The benchmark 10-year U.S. yield plunged about eight basis points to 2.36 percent at 12:15 p.m. in New York, touching the lowest level since Dec. 8, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It’s on pace for the biggest decline since June 27. The 10-year break-even rate, a market measure of inflation expectations, fell from close to the highest level since 2014. Across financial markets, trends snapped Thursday as investors weighed the risk of a lackluster payrolls report Friday and the prospect that trades based on Donald Trump’s impending presidency had gone too far. Data from the ADP Research Institute on Thursday indicated companies added fewer jobs in December than forecast. The figures come a day before the Labor Department releases its monthly payrolls report. “A bunch of the widely predicted trades for this year are all being broken at the same time, with oil going lower, investment-grade corporates widening out, TIPS break-evens tightening, and then rates rallying as a result,” said Mike Lorizio, a Boston-based senior trader at Manulife Asset Management, which oversees about $343 billion. “Some key levels being broken just inspired further buying.”    Eoin Treacy's view The odds are in favour of the view that the 35-year bull market in bonds is over, however it would be a mistake to think that such a lengthy expansion will end overnight. Inflationary expectations might well be justified in the medium-term but they have run ahead of the market and Treasury yields in the region of 2.5% are competitive with many equities and therefore desirable by bond investors conditioned over generations to buy the dip.   Email of the day on separate video and audio files The VIMEO software for the new subscriber’s audio demands lots of download capacity. I am fixing this issue with my phone company. Is it possible to include a separate Audio file with the combined Video & Audio? If I am away from the house I like the choice to just to listen to the audio. If this is too difficult don't worry I like the new Video and Audio format. Eoin see you in Singapore in April.   Eoin Treacy's view Thank you for this question which gives me the opportunity to clarify what services we are in fact providing and I look forward to renewing our acquaintance in Singapore in April. I record the video and audio file concurrently and post them separately. You will find links to the video on the homepage for the relevant day but I also post the regular audio file separately in the Subscriber’s Audio section.

Since then, the trio have worked on creating a scalable architecture that can be used by other automakers as a foundation and go on to create their own set of autonomous vehicles. After a quiet few months of development, BMW announced at the ongoing 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that approximately 40 autonomous cars will be on the roads by the second of 2017. The German auto giant says that the fleet of BMW 7 Series will feature cutting-edge Intel and Mobileye tech during the global trials, starting in USA and Europe. All three companies are pioneers in their own game. As part of the tie-up, BMW Group will be responsible for testing the overall functional safety, driving and dynamics of the autonomous system. The Munich-based carmaker is also aligned to engineer a high performance simulation engine, overall technology integration into the cars, production of prototypes and eventually sizing up the platform with the help of deployment partners. Intel will inject the power of high performance computing elements that will connect the vehicle to the data centre. It will make use of its newly launched Intel GO solution for autonomous driving, which the company says, delivers the most efficient balance between power and performance and, at the same time, meets the challenging thermal and safety requisites of the auto industry. Intel’s in-car tech will help compute platform for vital functions like sensor fusion, driving policy, environment modeling, path planning and decision making. Then comes the part where Mobileye can flex its muscles. The company uses its EyeQ 5 high-performance vision processor which has automotive-grade functional safety and low-power performance. The tech is responsible to read and understand the surroundings of the vehicle from its 360-degree view vision sensors. This system, in collaboration with the Intel’s in-car CPU, forms the central computing platform that will be integrated in every autonomous vehicle. Mobileye will further partner with BMW to develop the sensor fusion function which will help to create a full model of the environment surrounding the vehicle. BMW recently announced that it will develop a range of autonomous vehicles under its iNEXT project name by 2021. These developments will surely help the carmaker to establish a concrete platform for it to build on for the future of mobility.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

They have several chip samples on hand, and power consumption is all over the map, even running the same processor models at the same clock speed and voltage. Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 23:37 Jeremy Laird says: Bit of a minefield, HDR, especially as it pertains to monitors. I actually don’t think it changes a huge amount. You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

That’s pretty much the reason why I’ve been considering an upgrade from Haswell. And while AMD’s Ryzen sounds promising, I remain skeptical about their ability to deliver on those promises – or that they will leapfrog Kaby Lake.

I tried win 10 for a week and found out it is basically an advertisement platform that is incompatible with my older games that I haven’t played yet. thanks Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 03:03 Person of Interest says: Some of the review sites tested their Kaby Lakes on Windows 7. No problems reported from them, although the integrated graphics seem to be giving some Win7 users trouble, and I didn’t see any reviews test the new stuff in Kaby Lake (more video decoding features and more granular power management).

I think some folks just like a new shiny. Graphics cards of course are a different story. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:03 Ghostwise says: People are funny with their hobbies. Yeah. I hear that there are even grown-ups who play video games, these days. Little Pac-Man and whatnot. That’s ridiculous. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

It’s pretty hard to actually find a motherboard without one, at least looking at consumer chipsets. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 15:22 fish99 says: I was considering a CPU upgrade from my 3570K recently, but after looking up some benchmarks, was surprised to see a 6600K is only 11% quicker, and that’s with it running 100 MHz quicker than my 3570K. And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Log in to Reply 07/01/2017 at 15:44 Chorltonwheelie says: Yeah, still see no reason to upgrade from my venerable i5 3570k at all. Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Cpu wise I’m set for another 3 years at least. 4800mhz overclock is running smooth on the 4690k, I’m happy. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

When working for Intel Corporation for over 15 years, Kalyan Muppaneni, founder and chief executive of Pi Datacenters, was always close to the hardware, digitisation and server market. That was how he developed a passion for back-end infrastructure, an area not many techies would think of for entrepreneurial pursuit, given the complexities involved. The cloud server market has gone to a new level in the past five years. Many enterprises in the US and elsewhere have not only moved to cloud as a first choice but started using commercial data centre services, owing to the complexity involved in data management and its applications. Muppaneni saw a clear opportunity in these when he decided to return to India from the US for a new journey. The opportunity According to Gartner, the research and advisory entity in information technology, the value of the Indian data centre infrastructure and services market was $2 billion in 2016 and is the fastest growing segment. It will be anywhere between $3.5 billion and $5 billion by 2018, said Mupanneni. When he shared plans about going back to India to establish a data centre entity, four of his friends there instantly backed his decision, with funding commitment. "It was only a discussion over a cup of coffee and we closed the initial angel round with overwhelming subscription, almost triple of what I really needed," he told Business Standard. Having worked for Intel Corporation in California and Arizona on design architecture, among other core tasks, Muppaneni, who has a master's degree in computing from Griffith University, Queensland, indeed comes with a large vision that makes Pi's upcoming enterprise-class data centre in Andhra Pradesh's new capital, Amaravati, look like a hurried step on a course to a big journey. Data storage is one of many applications and functions a data centre can deliver: "A data centre is like your heart pumping transactions, acting as a hub, gathering data from different locations and churning out and giving decisions to other centres instantly. So, it is very important to design a solution that is scalable, that is high performance. It cannot be slow; otherwise, it will crash," Muppaneni explains. On December 15, Pi Datacenters announced it had got a first private equity funding round of Rs 154 crore, led by Epsilon Venture Partners, barely three months ahead of the scheduled commissioning of the data centre. The facility would be a modular, 500,000 sq ft infrastructure with 5,000-rack capacity. When fully commissioned, spread across 10 acres, it will be a tier-four certified facility. The investment required is Rs 600 crore, which the promoters plan to spend in five years as they seek to scale up the infrastructure to the targeted capacity in a gradual manner, based on demand. Challenges India has been seeing a surge in data centre investments. In 2016, the who's who of the global IT world, including Microsoft and Amazon, have started investing hundreds of millions of dollars to establish these in India, to offer a variety of services in data management. A sizable data centre infrastructure was already created in the country by a number of players such as Tata Telecommunications, CntrlS, Netmagic, Tulip, Sify and GPX Global, among others, as both big and small Indian companies switch to digital data storage practices. Can this challenging, highly capital-intensive and increasingly crowded space, led by big global players, still qualify to be a start-up play? Does it have scope to bring potential 'disruptions' in the data centre architecture or in data storage and management services, so that a new entrant will enjoy a distinct advantage? Muppaneni says it has all this and more. "The fact that every data centre company is doing well in India is a big positive. As the industry itself is in a positive zone, we will obviously get our piece of pie from the market," the Pi founder says. Business model However, Pi Data seeks to build its business on a strong set of differentiators, not simply by going with the flow. It says it is taking a very different approach to the design of the product, doing it in a completely software-defined approach for the cloud. While Muppaneni bets on the potential differentiators that he believes would make Pi Data the first destination of choice for an enterprise looking to host data within India, he points to fast progress in implementation of this facility as early proof of execution capability. In the best case scenario, even for a large enterprise, it would take three or four years to implement such a project in India, according to him. "In a year and a half, we have not only visualised and conceptualised this but done almost 90 per cent of one of the largest DCs in India, while getting the initial wave of customers on board." Mahesh Vaidya, general partner and head of India at Epsilon Venture Partners, believes the team at Pi was the right mix of hard-core technologists and managers with decades of cumulative experience, drawn from companies across the world. "Kalyan and his team at Pi have attained traction in a year that would easily have taken other teams two or more years," he told Business Standard. Some of the differentiators Pi's data centre comes with own software stack to complement the services on hardware stack, use of the latest technologies in Silicon Valley, lower cost of ownership that would help in offering services at competitive rates, a quick break-even in two-three years compared to the sector average of five years and good technology partnerships. Some of the key offering would be different types of cloud services -- based on a completely software-defined cloud, co-location, hosting, disaster recovery and various other back-up services, manger services, NOC (Network Operating Centre) as a service, private cloud and public cloud. According to Muppaneni, there are customers in every segment he's serving, from day one of the data centre launch in Amaravati. After telecom companies and e-commerce smart cities, the internet of things and big data are expected to create large demand for cloud services. "Healthcare in India also has a huge untapped potential, with not even five per cent of patient records digitised," he says. Local advantage According to Mahesh Vaidya, it is advantageous for a local player with expansive physical presence and efficient teams positioned locally to address the needs of and cater to local businesses. Local players have lower overhead costs and execute data centre services with a quicker time-to-market, he says. "In the long term, there would be a need for global players to partner with local players to deliver data centre and cloud services to local customers. We would see the interest and presence of major players as a validation of the data centre opportunity in India," he told this newspaper. Epsilon expects a return that is comparable in quantum and time frames to any of the other sectors it had invested in. Just as scalability is in-built for cloud services, Pi has created a design architecture which helps in scaling up the capacity in a smooth manner. Adding more DCs is part of this strategy, beside allowing customers a back-up storage as well. Muppaneni says they will be moving to at least two other locations in the next two financial years, which means Pi Data would be building three DCs in three years. "The next time we raise (funds), that would be a very big round for this reason," he said. 'Pi services are at par with those of Amazon' Expert take by Rajarshi Bhattacharya, country head, Suse India, a pioneer in Linux and open source solutions. Pi is developing its own cloud solutions. What Pi delivers today is next-generation cloud services, powered by an absolute open-stack platform. Cloud service providers today offer much faster response time and greater flexibility to customers. In that sense, the services offered by Pi are at par as those offered by companies like Amazon. The latter, too, built its cloud services around open source technology, one reason for it being very successful in this space. Customers or enterprises in India are looking for greater services from data centre players. Initially, it was about picking rack space and then people started taking infrastructure. Now, they are taking a platform and are looking for software-as-a-service from the data centre. Pi Data has made some wise choices. They have decided to build cloud on a platform which is very open and continuously evolving. That automatically makes Pi competitive. The choice of technology is good. Pi is also moving towards software-defined cloud services, which are infinitely scalable. Through an open-stack platform, it can also seamlessly bridge the public and the private cloud.

MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price.

A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart.

However, the company has also used the event to introduce a new interesting computing platform that looks to change how smart gadgets upgrade in the future. To further this effort, Intel has launched a credit-card sized computing platform called Compute Card. In essence, the Compute Card has all the elements that are required for a full-fledged PC. This includes a processor, memory, storage, and wireless connectivity with flexible I/O options. "Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilise the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs. This reduces the time and resources needed to design and validate the compute block and helps speed up innovation to bring the power of intelligence into an ever wider range of devices," Intel explains on its blog. This compute card, because of its small size, can be used in future IoT products like interactive refrigerators, and even smart kiosks to security cameras. This compute card can easily be removed in the future, and replaced with the latest bundle when it arrives. Intel looks to make this the new norm moving forward, and for this purpose it has already started to work with tech companies and regional partners on integrating the Compute Card into their smart gadgets. Global partners include Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp, and regional partners include Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk, and Pasuntech. The Intel Compute Card is set to be available from mid-2017, and will come in a range of options, including the latest 7th Generation Intel Core processors.

Baig 06/01/2017 SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Man jailed for 'horror' hammer attack on police Donald Trump claims Brexit is a 'great thing' for Britain © Associated Press Models demonstrate Project Alloy all-in-one merged reality headsets. LAS VEGAS--Intel's Project Reality virtual reality headgear aims to give users the best of both worlds:  Deeply immersive experiences without the awkward cords and pricey hardware. I got to try it out at CES and found it has potential, though in its current state as a developer prototype it still has a way to go. There’s a considerable tradeoff to experience truly rich virtual reality. The best consumer VR headsets on the market today, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and Sony PlayStation VR, are pricey and demand a tethered connection to expensive and robust hardware--PCs in the case of Vive and Rift, a video game console with PlayStation.  Meantime, the more mobile VR solutions that eliminate the wires and instead work with smartphones—I’m talking Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream--don’t offer near the same compelling virtual immersion.  Intel’s “merged reality” Project Alloy headgear attempts to bridge the gap by   placing all the PC-class processing and graphics capabilities inside the headset itself; no need to connect Alloy to a separate desktop computer or laptop. The self-contained computing engines and sensors for tracking your movement—Alloy doesn’t demand external lasers and tracking systems such as those used by a Rift or Vive--promises a no-brainer set-up too, potentially a big advantage over those other systems.  How it works. Alloy can track six degrees of mobility, double the three degrees of Google Cardboard or GearVR, says Intel Vice President and General Manager, Perpetual Computing Group, Achin Bhowmik, who hosted my demo. That means you can get close to and walk around the objects in the virtual space. What’s more, Alloy employs Intel RealSense 3D cameras to bring the “real world” into your experience—which might help you from bumping into a wall, coffee table or another human being. Indeed, when you come to a new environment, the smarts inside the system cameras will try to “map” and understand the surroundings to keep you safe.  Intel is also relying on computer vision technology from Movidius, a company it recently acquired, which helps with hand and gesture recognition, and this “inside-out tracking.”  What it's like:  Alloy is kind of a cross between a fully immersive VR experience in which the entire outside world is blocked out and an augmented reality scheme in which virtual objects appear layered on top of the real world, something like what Microsoft has shown off with HoloLens. Thus the "merged reality" descriptor. But Alloy, at least for now, doesn’t seem quite as exciting.  To be fair, though, this is still an unfinished product , and even now you get a sense that Intel is really onto something.  The headset is bulky and on the heavier side. Bhowmik says it will get lighter. And the tracking or something else was off when I first put on a headset; a second try with another unit worked out better. The graphics were ok but far from mind-numbing, though I did like that you could make out physical objects and people. In one demo, I spent a few minutes playing a game in which I had to shoot flying drones before they shot me, using a controller that once inside the Alloy environment turned into a menacing enough weapon.  I periodically had to “reload” my gun by virtually walking into a box with the ammunition. But one time the box was too close to a real physical wall and I was not able reload the gun. That said, I had no trouble fulfilling my knock-out-the-drones mission. The most interesting part of the demo for me was how the physical objects in the room became part of the game—the table in the middle of the room for example became some sort of generator. In a second demo that I got to experience—here a pyramid rose up from the ground after I pressed a virtual green button--I could actually see the Intel employee who was in the room with me, as well as see the ring on my finger, and the shirt and jacket I was wearing. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced at CES that a commercial version of Alloy will come out later this year from yet-to-be-disclosed hardware partners--Intel is working with all the usual virtual reality suspects. Bhowmik doesn’t expect battery life on a final Alloy product to be much of a problem. He intimidated you'll get something along the lines of what you get with a laptop. I can’t say I was blown away by what I saw. But I’m all in on the wire-free vision that Alloy promises to deliver and eager to give it another shot.

(Source: Intel) Intel has pushed out the rest of its Kaby Lake 7th generation Intel Core processors for this year; the first set was launched in August 2016, but the latest set covers laptops, desktops and more for 2017. Intel is offering a lot more on the productivity, speed, responsiveness and security front with the new Kaby Lake processors for 2017, and the company revealed them ahead of CES 2017. Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors are built on the 14nm+ manufacturing process, which is a marginal improvement over the 14nm process; both the 7th Gen core processors and Intel Xeon processors are based on the new manufacturing process. So far Kaby Lake was restricted to ultra-thin laptops, but has now been increased to desktops, convertibles, mobile workstations etc. Intel has promised improved performance and reliability with these new processors.  The company claims up to to 20 per cent boost in performance for gaming notebooks, and around 25 percent for desktops. There’s also enhanced support for 4K content, 360-degree content with Intel claiming a 65 percent faster performance on notebooks and 35 percent faster on desktops. Intel has introduced more than 40 new processors as part of the 2017 series; the U series is geared towards thin and light laptops, 2-in-1 computers, convertibles, and minis. The H series is geared for performance laptops and mobile work stations; the S series is aimed at desktops, All-in-ones, and minis.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware ASRock Z270 Extreme 4 LGA 1151 Motherboard Review By Hassan Mujtaba Posted Jan 3, 2017 39Shares Share Tweet Submit Advertisement PRODUCT INFO ASRock Z270 Extreme 4 3rd January 2017 Type Motherboard Price $149.99 US Introduction It has been a year since Intel released their latest and greatest platform for mainstream desktop PCs. The 100-series platform was part of the 6th generation processor launch. Skylake brought with it a range of new feature support and performance updates. The 100-series products were the first to utilize features such as DDR4, M.2, PCI-e 3.0 SSDs and more. Today, Intel officially launches the 200-series platform. Designed to support 7th generation processors that are codenamed Kaby Lake, 200-series offers new features and updates in the form of Intel Optane support. I think the most important thing is that the boards themselves would be far more attractive than the processor series as they are more feature-heavy and offer plenty of reasons for consumers to upgrade. For this review, ASRock sent us their new Z270 Extreme 4 motherboard. The Z270 Extreme 4 features a brand new design scheme and support for the latest features such as M.2, NVMe and 7th generation Intel Core CPUs. ASRock Z270 Extreme 4 aims the mainstream market with an attractive price of 149.99 US so let’s find out how the board holds up in our testing. Intel Z270 Express Chipset – The Top 200-Series PCH The two chipsets that will be offered with the new Kaby Lake processors are Z270 and H270. Intel will be offering support for the Kaby Lake and Skylake processors on both 100-series and 200-series motherboards. This means that consumers can use their Skylake chips on a 200-series board or a Kaby Lake chip on a 100-series board. The two new chips are marketed towards specific markets. The Z270 series is aimed at the consumer market while the H270 series is aimed at the consumer and corporate market. We will get on to the features of these chipset which is an update from the previous 100-series generation of products. Intel Z270 and H270 PCH Features Intel Z270 and Z170 offer the same CPU PCIe configuration support. They allow for 1 x 16, 2 x 8 or 1 x 8 + 2 x 4 config whereas the H270 and H170 chipset offers just 1 x 16 config. The total number of independent Display Port offered by the PCH are 3 and power up to four memory DIMMs in Dual Channel mode. The Z Series offers overclocking support while the H Series is restricted from such support. All chipsets offer Intel SmartSound tech but Intel AIB partners will be offering their own custom Audio codecs to power audio. Moving on, the new 200-series has official support for Optane technology which is not available on 100-series products. Intel Rapid Storage technology is also pushed to 15 (was 14 on 100-series). Some other features in the new chipsets include Raid 0, 1, 5, 10 support, PCIe Storage Drive support, Smart Response Technology and I/O Port flexibility. Intel has increased the number of high-speed I/O lanes to 30 on both 200-series chipsets. The Z170 had 26 while the H170 had 22 lanes. Total USB ports have remain the same at 14 (10 USB 3.0) for Z Series and 14 (8 USB 3.0) for H Series. All boards would have 6 SATA III 6 GB/s ports. Expansion slots would be powered by 24 PCI-e lanes on Z270 and 20 PCI-e lanes on H270. This is a slight increase over 20 PCI-e lanes on Z170 and 16 on H170.

The socket is built to support both 6th gen and 7th gen processors. This allows 200-series boards to support both Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, making it easier for previous gen owners to upgrade. The LGA 1151 socket is also featured on the 100-Series chipset motherboards and will extend support to the new Kaby Lake processors. Motherboard vendors like Gigabyte have released latest firmware for 100 series motherboards to support Kaby Lake processors. The LGA 1151 has a total of 1151 contact pins for interfacing with Skylake and Kaby Lake processors.

So if you have a old LGA 1150 socket cooler that you wish to use with the new LGA 1151 socket, It could be done so, but do note that while the socket looks the same as LGA 1150 socket, the processors are incompatible due to different pin layout so you don’t want to try putting an Haswell processor into the LGA 1151 socket otherwise it would damage the pins permanently. Cooler Compatibility With LGA 1151 Socket While Haswell processors ship with their own boxed coolers and cooler makers providing retention brackets for LGA 1150 compatibility, it should be noted that Intel has stopped offering boxed coolers since Skylake and Kaby Lake processor generation and users have to look forward to retail coolers. Intel does offer a separate boxed cooler but it will be a much better choice to get an AIB cooling solution since those offer better cooling performance. Older CPU coolers will remain compatible with the new socket and some manufacturers are provided updated retention brackets for the 1151 socket boards.

The socket is built to support both 6th gen and 7th gen processors. This allows 200-series boards to support both Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, making it easier for previous gen owners to upgrade. The LGA 1151 socket is also featured on the 100-Series chipset motherboards and will extend support to the new Kaby Lake processors. Motherboard vendors like Gigabyte have released latest firmware for 100 series motherboards to support Kaby Lake processors. The LGA 1151 has a total of 1151 contact pins for interfacing with Skylake and Kaby Lake processors. Following are all of the Kaby Lake processors that will be available at launch for 200-series platform: Intel 7th Generation 'Kaby Lake' Desktop Lineup SKU Name Cores/Threads Core Clock Boost Clock L3 Cache TDP Socket Price Core i7-7700K 4/8 4.2 GHz 4.5 GHz 8 MB 91W LGA1151 $305 US Core i7-7700 4/8 3.6 GHz 4.2 GHz 8 MB 65W LGA1151 $272 US Core i7-7700T 4/8 2.9 GHz TBD 8 MB 35W LGA1151 $272 US Core i5-7600K 4/4 3.8 GHz 4.2 GHz 6 MB 91W LGA1151 $217 US Core i5-7600 4/4 3.5 GHz 4.1 GHz 6 MB 65W LGA1151 $199 US Core i5-7600T 4/4 2.8 GHz TBD 6 MB 35W LGA1151 $199 US Core i5-7500 4/4 3.4 GHz 3.8 GHz 6 MB 65W LGA1151 $179 US Core i5-7500T 4/4 2.7 GHz TBD 6 MB 35W LGA1151 $179 US Core i5-7400 4/4 3.0 GHz 3.5 GHz 6 MB 65W LGA1151 $170 US Core i5-7400T 4/4 2.4 GHz TBD 6 MB 35W LGA1151 $170 US Core i3-7350K 2/4 4.2 GHz N/A 4 MB 60W LGA 1151 $157 US Core i3-7320 2/4 3.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 4 MB TBD LGA 1151 $139 US Core i3-7300 2/4 4.0 GHz TBD 4 MB 51W LGA1151 $129 US Core i3-7310T 2/4 3.4 GHz TBD 3 MB TBD LGA1151 $109 US Core i3-7100 2/2 3.9 GHz TBD 3 MB 35W LGA 1151 $109 US Pentium G4620 2/4 3.7 GHz N/A 3 MB 51W LGA1151 $93 US Pentium G4600 2/4 3.6 GHz N/A 3 MB 51W LGA 1151 $82 US Pentium G4560 2/2 3.5 GHz N/A 2 MB 35W LGA 1151 $64 US Pentium G3950 2/2 3.0 GHz N/A 2 MB 35W LGA1151 $52 US Pentium G3930 2/2 2.9 GHz N/A 2 MB 35W LGA1151 $42 US Watch_Dogs 2 Review - A Substantial Software Upgrade Intel did one thing right with the new socket and that’s the socket positioning which allows older coolers and mounting brackets to remain compatible with the newer socket. So if you have a old LGA 1150 socket cooler that you wish to use with the new LGA 1151 socket, It could be done so, but do note that while the socket looks the same as LGA 1150 socket, the processors are incompatible due to different pin layout so you don’t want to try putting an Haswell processor into the LGA 1151 socket otherwise it would damage the pins permanently. Cooler Compatibility With LGA 1151 Socket While Haswell processors ship with their own boxed coolers and cooler makers providing retention brackets for LGA 1150 compatibility, it should be noted that Intel has stopped offering boxed coolers since Skylake and Kaby Lake processor generation and users have to look forward to retail coolers. Intel does offer a separate boxed cooler but it will be a much better choice to get an AIB cooling solution since those offer better cooling performance. Older CPU coolers will remain compatible with the new socket and some manufacturers are provided updated retention brackets for the 1151 socket boards.

It’s hard to imagine any other chip company CEO who would have met with this much enthusiasm from attendees at one of the world’s biggest trade shows. As Huang talked about revolutionizing gaming, entertainment and the transportation of tomorrow with the power of the company’s GPU and AI technologies, the audience was ready and eager to believe his every word. Huang’s star power aside, Nvidia came to CES to demonstrate how far the graphics chip company has come in advancing the development of AI-enabled autonomous cars. Intel Corp. is trying to catch up by rolling out its own development platforms and the alliance with Mobileye and BMW. But the processor giant’s automotive future is still dependent on the execution and integration of the many automotive technologies Intel has amassed over the last 12 months. During Huang's keynote, Nvidia showed a glimpse of Xavier (originally unveiled last fall), described by the company as an “AI car supercomputer.” Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang during his CES keynote speech While showing off a small board a little larger than the palm of his hand, Huang said that Xavier can process 30 trillion operations a second at 30 watts. It’s integrated with an 8-core custom ARM64 CPU and 512 core Volta GPU. The Nvidia CEO also noted during his speech that Xavier chip itself is ASIL C but its module will be designed for ASIL D safety functionality. Built on top of the hardware is a new OS called DriveWork, explained Huang. The OS helps fuse data coming from different sensors and location information from HD mapping. Nvidia showed a video clip of Nvidia’s BB8 autonomous vehicle zipping around streets in California.   Auto-Pilot and Co-Pilot The car, Nvidia explained, understands and interacts with the driver in natural spoken language. It negotiates stop lights, stop signs and intersections, while making its way to the freeway before passing control back to the driver when requested. Layers on top of the DriveWorks OS include Auto-Pilot DNN and Co-Pilot DNN. While discussing the BB8 autonomous car’s perception capability, Huang said, “We are using two types of AI. One is AI driving you as auto-pilot, and another is AI looking out for you as a co-pilot.” In addition to Xavier, Nvidia announced a number of newly formed partnerships. They include deals with Audi, Bosch and ZF. Huang also laid out the company’s HD mapping strategy involving China’s Baidu, Tom Tom, Japan’s ZeNRIN and HERE. Nvidia and Audi have been working together for a decade. Huang reminded the audience that Audi was the first car company to come to CES seven years ago, when it announced that it was using Nvidia technology. To celebrate their log-standing partnerships, Huang brought Audi of America Head Scott Keough to the stage. Head of Audi America, Scott Keough (left) and Nvidia's CEO Huang Under the new partnership, the two companies’ focus will be on putting “advanced AI cars on the road starting in 2020,” said Huang. The first phase of the collaboration will focus on Nvidia’s Drive PX AI platform for self-driving cars. Future Audi car models will use deep learning to tackle the complexities of driving. Audi’s Keough, on stage, talked up the autonomous car the company has brought to Las Vegas. “When you test drive our Q7 in the Gold Lot, it’s driving by itself," he said. Q7 learned how to drive in just three days through AI, he added. Audi believes that this will be Level 4 automation in just three years. — Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent, EE Times Email This Print Comment More Related Links Biggest Robo-Car Roadblock Is Human Infineon: What Makes Robo-Cars Zero Defect?

Also the backup camera is on "instantly" whereas in the older car it usually came up just as I finished backing up.  The auto companies have upgraded to be able to sell us cars that will easily last 200K miles with excellent mileage.  It would be nice to be able to upgrade our cars with new electronics (e.g., a new GPU card and software) and to have those upgrades integrated, verified and supported by the OEM versus the current third party upgrades we can buy now.  Upgrades could be at good margin and be tied to other services.  This could help get the installed base of vehicles to higher levels of safe driving support much sooner than we can expect with the current situation where new electronics only come with a new car.

OK, so maybe it has also thrown in the towel as far as wearables are concerned, so it’s aiming for the next big trend in consumer electronics: the Internet of Things. To help device and appliance manufacturers kickstart their IoT production process with Intel at the core, the chip maker will be making available a Compute Card they can just slot into their product to make them smarter and connect to the World Wide Web. It’s not hard to think of Compute Card as Intel’s x86 answer to the ARM-based Raspberry Pi. Both, after all, are complete compute platforms, with processor, memory, and input/output hooks, that are just slightly bigger than credit cards. The Intel Compute Card itself measures 94.5 mm x 55 mm x 5 mm only. Of course, there are differences beyond just x86 versus ARM. The Raspberry Pi is a hobbyist, DIY board for everyone and you build contraptions around it. The Intel Compute Card, on the other hand, is more like a ready-made and ready to use component that you slot into devices, calling to mind the PCMCIA cards of old. The idea is that manufacturing partners make products, like, a smart fridge or a security camera system, with the Compute Card in mind. But instead of building it right into the device, they just provide a slot they can insert the card into after the fact. This can be done either by the OEM itself or by consumers, making the additional intelligence only optional and potentially keeping costs down. Intel is still being coy about the exact specs of the Compute Card, other than it has a 7th gen “Kaby Lake” Core processor and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It is also unknown if it will be made available to the general public when it fully launches in mid-2017, but, from the looks of it, it will primarily be available to manufacturing partners. Intel says that Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp have already signed up to be one of the first to experience Intel’s vision of the Internet of Things.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Intel-engineered New Balance RunIQ revealed at CES 2017 By Rei Padla - January 5, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter This is the first time we’re featuring something related to sneaker brand New Balance. No, there’s no hi-tech sneakers designed by the company but it recently teamed up with Intel to come up with a smartwatch. Okay, this sounds interesting because back in November, we were told that Intel was possibly moving away from wearables. This was after backing out of the tablet and smartphone market and canceling SoFIA and Broxton chips. Now we’ve got news that it has worked again with another company to release the New Balance RunIQ, a new Android Wear-powered smartwatch that is aimed for the runners. The New Balance RunIQ comes equipped with a 1.39-inch AMOLED screen, 512MB RAM, 4GB onboard storage, GPS, optical heart-rate monitor, Intel Z34XX processor, an a 24-hour battery. If you are using GPS and the heart rate monitor, it can only last a maximum of five hours. Just like any other smartwatch, it receives alerts and notifications via WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity. Pair it with your Android phone and receive mails, messages, and stream from Google Play Music. For New Balance RunIQ users, there’s the New Balance Global Run Club platform you can use to share your routes and accomplishments with other runners. This isn’t the first time Intel partnered with other brands to produce a wearable product. There’s the Intel Curie-powered Fossil smartwatch, as well as, the TAG Heuer Connected Android Wear smartwatch. The New Balance RunIQ is now listed for pre-order at NewBalance.com. It will cost you $299.99 and will be available beginning February 1 on New Balance Stores and other retailers. New Balance Run IQ with Intel Inside® enables runners to track their distance, time, pace, heartrate, and cadence during a workout, as well as listen to music and connect with the STRAVA global running community, all without a smartphone as long as you’re connected to Wi-Fi.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

They have several chip samples on hand, and power consumption is all over the map, even running the same processor models at the same clock speed and voltage. Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

That all changed this week at CES, where Intel showed off a developer kit to select media. Gizmodo was lucky enough to be invited into the private demonstration — and we're happy to report that it was well worth the wait. Before we dive into the experience, it's important to make a few caveats: First of all, this is not a finished product. The images you're looking at are just a reference design. Intel plans to work with hardware manufacturers to build different versions of the headset. What enables Project Alloy is Intel RealSense, a tiny camera array that debuted at CES 2014. The camera set is able make a 3D map of any room and the objects in it. Developers can then use the 3D computer model created by the cameras to layer graphics on top of it, which becomes especially handy for creating immersive VR experiences inside of a room. The developer kit is actually a ridiculously good-looking headset considering it's only a reference design. It's completely black and has unnoticeable RealSense camera arrays in the front of the goggles. At the back of the headset is the big battery that enables the headset to be completely untethered. Eliminating the wire from the back of a VR headset is a huge deal. Anyone that's ever played around with the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive will tell you one of the major pain points about those headsets is that you're always tripping over the wire that connects it to power and a nearby computer — especially if you have room tracking enabled. The Project Alloy headset I played around with let me walk around a room filled with book shelves, a coffee table and other objects in it. The demo room was basically made to look like a small apartment. The RealSense cameras took about a minute to scan the room, then another minute to turn the objects inside of the real room into elements in the game. The coffee table was turned into a big generator and the book shelves turned into rusty pipes and other weird objects straight out of a sci-fi film. The game demonstrated doesn't have a name and will never be available for public release. It was made to show off the room mapping and 3D tracking as you walk around the room shooting bad guys. The gameplay was similar to SuperHot VR, but I was shooting drones rather than humans. The graphics were also solid and easily comparable to anything I've played on the Oculus or Vive. My only major complaint about Project Alloy was the controller. It felt a little too flimsy and is most comparable to the controller that comes with the Google Daydream headset. It has a trackpad right where your thumb goes and a trigger on the back. They're basically standard VR controller elements at this point, but the quality just wasn't as good as the higher-end headsets. Still, the whole experience was awesome, especially compared to the other high-end virtual reality headsets out there. I was a little sceptical about how important the cable-free headset would be — but it makes tremendous difference when you're walking around the room, ducking behind objects to dodge bullets, swinging your head in every direction to fire at bad guys. This is one of the few truly innovative products at CES and one I'm extremely glad I had a chance to play around with. The Project Alloy developer kit will be made available to in the second quarter of this year, and there's still no price tag on it yet. The public probably won't see this thing for sale for a long time, but let me be the first to say it will be well worth the wait once an untethered VR headset finally makes its way into your home.

For about five minutes, I tried shooting some digital flying robots from the comfort of a replica living room inside the Las Vegas Convention Center. Project Alloy, which was first announced at Intel’s developer conference last year, is an untethered headset that blends virtual-reality content with information about the physical world around its wearer. It’s designed to give people more freedom of movement when playing games, and also save people from having to buy an expensive gaming rig to play VR games. Based on my brief experience playing the same game that Intel showed on stage Wednesday, the prototype shows a lot of potential. However, it’s hard to know exactly how that will translate into what consumers will get later this year. Intel revealed Wednesday that it’s working with selected manufacturing partners to make Project Alloy devices available in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the meantime, all we have is the Intel-made prototype. It packs in a pair of RealSense depth cameras positioned basically on either side of the user’s nose, along with two RGB cameras at roughly the user’s eye line, and a pair of fisheye cameras at the edge of the visor. Those sensors can be used to render the wearer's surroundings in virtual reality. Its band design is fairly reminiscent of the PlayStation VR headset, with a curved forehead plate attached to an adjustable headband. There’s a large plastic pack on the back of the headband as well. The shooter game that I played lasted only a few minutes, and the headset seemed comfortable enough at the time. It’s hard to know how comfortable the device would be for longer sessions. And again, because this is just a prototype, it’s possible that the commercial versions will feel completely different. In order to get the game up and running quickly, Intel preloaded all the objects in the room onto the Alloy headset. Unfortunately, my headset’s model of the room I was in had drifted slightly relative to the actual objects in the room. That led to me slamming my shin into a coffee table in the center of the room that was supposed to be several inches away. This problem is supposed to be fixed by using the RealSense cameras to detect the positions of objects in real time. In this case, the headset wasn’t set up to do that. There’s still a lot we don’t know about the final hardware, like exactly when it will be available, how much it will cost, and more. Eli Elhadad, the Intel RealSense studio manager, said during my demo that the shipping version of Alloy will have more powerful hardware than the prototype. It will feature a Kaby Lake-based processor, a 400-series RealSense camera and a graphics processing chip from Movidius, which Intel acquired last year. In each case, those upgrades are supposed to provide better performance. It will also be interesting to see if Intel ends up working with Microsoft. The prototype offers untethered mixed-reality experiences, which would fit nicely with Microsoft’s vision for its Windows Holographic platform. The two companies previously announced that they were working together on Alloy, so it seems likely more will come of that. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

By Scott Maben scottm@spokesman.com(509) 459-5528 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS The immersive, live-streaming sports and music experience of a virtual reality technology born on the Palouse is going big time under its new owner, Intel. VOKE, an interactive, 3-D technology giving consumers more control of what they’re watching, was developed by Jay and Uma Jayaram as professors at Washington State University, where they established a virtual reality lab in 1993. The husband-and-wife team founded VOKE in 2004 and have relocated to Silicon Valley as the technology is rolled out for NFL games, the “Project Runway” finale, the Critics’ Choice Awards show and other live events. At a press conference Wednesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, attendees were treated to a demonstration of VOKE VR by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. They donned Oculus Rift headsets to watch the Butler-Villanova men’s basketball game, with 180-degree courtside views. Viewers will be able to select their point of view for live games, music concerts and other events, Krzanich said. “Viewers will get to decide what seat they have. That’s the future of what we believe of sports viewing,” he said. “So you’re going to decide, do you want to be on the 50-yard line? Do you want to be courtside at a basketball game? Do you want to be behind the basket to watch the next slam dunk? Do you want to be in the goalie’s position? All of that is possible.” Intel, which in November announced its purchase of VOKE, said content on Oculus Rift will be widely available later this year. The technology last year was used to present the NCAA men’s Final Four and Villanova’s championship. And just a few years ago, the Jayarams gave WSU Cougars fans a chance to test it on home games at Martin Stadium. Jay Jayaram, VOKE’S CEO, has said the company plans to completely change the way fans engage with and experience live events. But he also insists that virtual reality will make people more engaged with the real world as an extension of life, not a replacement of it. “Should we roll back to a reality where there would be no technology-assisted blurring of reality?” Jayaram told GeekWire. “These technologies expand our reality and make it that much richer for all.” Published: Jan. 5, 2017, 5:18 p.m.  Tags: CES, Intel, Jay Jayaram, Technology, virtual reality, VOKE, Washington State University Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 23:37 Jeremy Laird says: Bit of a minefield, HDR, especially as it pertains to monitors. I actually don’t think it changes a huge amount. You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

That’s pretty much the reason why I’ve been considering an upgrade from Haswell. And while AMD’s Ryzen sounds promising, I remain skeptical about their ability to deliver on those promises – or that they will leapfrog Kaby Lake.

I hear that there are even grown-ups who play video games, these days. Little Pac-Man and whatnot. That’s ridiculous. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 6 January 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM BMW well on the way to a fully-autonomous production car Moving ahead: The iNext, BMW's fully self-driving car is also on schedule for its 2021 launch. — AFP Relaxnews "Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye," stated Klaus Fröhlich, BMW's head of development at a joint press conference at CES in Las Vegas. "This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialise self-driving vehicles." When the partnership was announced in July 2016, the companies set themselves a hugely ambitious target of having not just an autonomous car, but an autonomous car platform that could be used by other companies, ready to go by decade's end. Yet just six months in, it appears that the project is on track. "We have made very good progress in designing a state-of-the-art solution for autonomous driving on both highways and in urban areas. The solution has been defined in a scalable manner to allow affiliate automakers to meet their unique needs," said Mobileye chairman, Prof Amnon Shashua. It also means the iNext, BMW's fully self-driving car is also on schedule for its 2021 launch. "This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNext," said Fröhlich. According to Intel, the main obstacle that has been slowing down the development of autonomous vehicle technology is the huge initial costs involved. "From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. As well as a progress report, Intel confirmed at CES that it is taking a 15% stake in HERE. HERE offers global mapping and localisation services for vehicles and is currently owned by Audi, Daimler and BMW. With Intel on board the owners plan to develop high-definition maps that are detailed enough for autonomous driving. "A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms," said Edzard Overbeek, HERE CEO. "As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE's ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected."   —  AFP Relaxnews   You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Travel fair targets expats who holiday locally Malaysia’s beauty through the lens Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Mercedes wants to use robots for making goods deliveries Create your own website Two thumbs-up for Oculus Touch Sci-fi tech set for 2017 QLED vs OLED Most Viewed in Tech QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Create your own website Sci-fi tech set for 2017 Could your gadgets send you to jail?

That's what makes iBuyPower's Snowblind PC so jaw-dropping. This one-of-a-kind desktop packs a translucent monitor right into its case, which can display cool color patterns, pertinent system information or whatever else you want to show off while you game. Key Specs and Features Snowblind's see-through LCD side panel essentially operates as its own monitor, allowing you to play videos and display widgets right on the case itself. The demo unit I saw displayed some mesmerizing color effects, as well as rotating Intel and iBuyPower logos as well as widgets that displayed the time and the system's CPU usage. Plenty of potential here, practical or otherwise. The unit I saw featured fully custom parts in an alluring frosty white finish, including a 7th-gen Intel Core i7 processor and an Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card. Snowblind is very easy to pop open, should you need to replace any components. The top of the machine features plenty of ports for plug-and-play gaming, including four USB 3.0 inputs as well as headphone and mic jacks. Why You Should Care While Snowblind seems aimed at folks who want a gaming PC that demands the attention of anyone in the room, it also offers up plenty of practical potential. For example, pro gamers can proudly display their team's logo while at a tournament, while folks without a spare monitor can use the LCD screen to keep track of their Twitch chat or system performance without having to close their game. And if you mainly just want a PC that oozes style, there's nothing that looks (or works) quite like the Snowblind. MORE: Sexiest and Wildest Gaming PCs Pricing and Availability Snowblind is set to launch in February. The model we saw would run you $1,800, largely due to the custom high-end parts inside, though iBuyPower is working to come up with more wallet-friendly configurations. We look forward to spending more time with Snowblind and putting as much crazy content as possible on its translucent display, so stay tuned for our full review.  See Also : CES 2017 Day 3: Tech You Missed The Best Gaming PCs The Ultimate Guide to Twitch Streaming Gaming Desktop Buying Guide: 7 Things You Need to Know About the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

Sponsored by The GeekWire team is covering CES 2017 live from Las Vegas, featuring the latest in consumer electronics, cars, sports tech and more. Alan Murray of Time Inc. interviews Ford CEO Mark Fields, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Flex CEO Mike McNamara at CES today. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) LAS VEGAS — Ford was the latest company to find itself in the spotlight over issues of jobs and globalization this week, as the automaker canceled plans for a Mexican factory that would have employed nearly 3,000 people. President-elect Donald Trump is getting the blame, but Ford CEO Mark Fields, speaking today the Consumer Electronics Show, insisted that the company made the decision for its own reasons. Ford CEO Mark Fields at CES in Las Vegas today. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) “In our case, obviously with the plant in Mexico, we did what was right for our business, not because the President-elect said … ” Fields said in response to a question about the issue during a panel at CES today with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Flex CEO Mike McNamara. “But Trump had some effect on the decision,” countered moderator Alan Murray of Time Inc. Fields said, “Well, you know, bottom line is we didn’t need the capacity anymore. We were going to build our Focus there, small cars are decreasing here, demand. So we just didn’t need it.” That was the prelude to a larger discussion about globalization and automation among the CEOs, three high-profile figures in the worlds of automobiles, technology and manufacturing. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at CES today. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Fields continued, “When you look at a lot of the trends around globalization, particularly around information and the Internet, all information is now global, and you really have to step back and understand, why are people questioning globalization. I think part of it is because the benefits that were sold to voters, particularly in more affluent countries, haven’t materialized.” He added, “For globalization to regain its mojo, so to speak, the folks in some of these affluent countries are going to need to see the benefits, and as we’ve seen over time, it ebbs and flows.” Flex CEO Mike McNamara Addressing the issue from the perspective of technology manufacturer Flex, McNamara said “globalization continues to be a powerful force … We’re going to end up building closer and closer to the end markets that we actually serve. It’s more efficient, it’s more productive. … I don’t think it’s going to stop.” The bigger impact on jobs could come from technology and automation, and Intel’s Krzanich took on that topic in response to a subsequent question. “I have this belief that technology drives transformation — it actually creates jobs,” Krzanich said, referring to overall net employment gains and losses. “It rarely ever eliminates jobs.” However, Fields added, “There’s going to be a lag effect here.” He referred to the scenario of autonomous trucking displacing human truck drivers. “They could be trained for lots of different things, but are they going to be trained as data analysts, things of that nature?” Fields said. “I agree with Brian — ultimately it creates more jobs, but as you go through that transition, there are going to be displaced, and they’re going to be vocal about it, and I think we as a society are going to deal with that, because the last thing is the society to turn against technological innovation. That would be disastrous.” More Special Coverage: CES 2017 Sponsor Post Explore Northeastern University in the Pacific Northwest Be a part of Seattle’s tech boom!  Northeastern University – the global, experiential, research university – is right in our backyard!  The Seattle campus is Washington State’s first private research university and its portfolio of online and hybrid graduate degree and certificate programs include computer science, bioinformatics, global studies, and project management. Learn more about their graduate degrees, tech boot camps and one-of-a-kind ALIGN program for those with a non-science background.

Scott Applewhite Politics 20:02 07.01.2017(updated 03:40 08.01.2017) Get short URL 304082793 The United States intelligence community made unfounded allegations of Russia-sponsored hacker attacks, in favor of the outgoing US presidential administration. As a result, it made a fool of itself, according to Franz Klintsevich, the first deputy chairman of the Defense and Security Committee of the Russian parliament's upper house. © REUTERS/ Carlo Allegri/File Photo Trump Says US Intel Has 'Absolutely No Evidence' Alleged Hacking Affected ElectionEarlier this week, US intelligence command, US Cyber Force command and the Pentagon issued a joint statement labelling Russia as a serious cyber-threat to the US. In addition, the US intelligence community once again accused Moscow of hacker attacks, in an attempt to interfere with the US electoral process. On Thursday, President Obama received an intelligence report on the issue. "Frankly speaking, we’ve had enough of this. It’s time to dot the i’s and cross the t’s. It would be childish to deny that Russia and of course the US are very concerned about possible cyber-threats. But as for cyber weapons, there is still no equivalent to the nuclear bomb," the senator told RIA Novosti. © REUTERS/ Yuri Gripas Different Hacks for Different Folks: White House Can’t Explain Why China Left Unpunished for 2014 AdventureAccording to Klintsevish, Moscow should not repeat that the allegations are unfounded. "What is more, they simply make no sense. The main reason is that no one can interfere with the electoral process in such country as the United States," he pointed out. "Acting in favor of the outgoing presidential administration, the US intelligence community laid itself open to ridicule," Klintsevich added. In October 2016, US intelligence officials claimed that "Russian hackers" were behind a series of cyber-attacks on the country’s electoral system. However, no evidence to the allegations has been provided by the American side. © REUTERS/ Brian Snyder US Intel Report Confirms WikiLeaks Data on DNC, Clinton Contain No ForgeriesRussian authorities have repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues. In December, media reported that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) suspects that Russia had interfered in the course of US presidential election, hacking mail servers of US citizens and organizations, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The agency claimed that Moscow had targeted the presidential campaign of  Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, because it wanted Trump to win. At the same time, the FBI reportedly reached opposite conclusions from the same raw intelligence. © Sputnik/ Pavel Lisitsyn US Intel Says 'Russian Hacking' Retaliation for Panama Papers, Doping ScandalsCommenting on the allegations, Russian President Vladimir Putin underscored that Russia was not interested in the contents of the leaked Democrat emails. He also noted that hysteria over alleged "Russian hacker attacks" was aimed at distracting public attention from the contents of the leaks. US President-elect Donald Trump believes that the allegations against Russia are unfounded. "Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!" Trump said via Twitter on Saturday. Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 7 января 2017 г. ​The US president-elect also stated on Saturday that he believes that the issue of the alleged hack of the DNC is being discussed only because the Democratic Party is "totally embarrassed" because of US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's loss in the election. "Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!" Trump wrote on Twitter. ...

Trump is immaterial in the overall picture and truthfully I think Russia has more important things to do than get involved with the US's lunacy. Reply Adrienne Adonis 21:24 07.01.2017 | 5 | Edit | Delete Trump is correct ! The Dems are beside themselves. They can not understand how they lost. They had the media and Hollywood and the support of major corporations backing them up. They had polls in their favor as well. Which we know were fraudulent to begin with. The odds were stacked up against Trump from the beginning. They mocked him and belittled him for over a year. What these socialists did not realize was how sick and tired and disgusted the American people throughout the United States were ! The American people that voted were not the white trash people Hillary said but it was an accumulation of Americans from all walks of life who all agreed that Hillary was corrupt , her Clinton Foundation was a slush fund for bribery and political favors and the trump voters wanted no more of the Obama twisted agenda. Hillary sucked as a candidate and was strictly catering to Wall Street and corporations and did not give a crap about the American tax payers. She also catered to the freeloaders of the American society as well. The Democrats are crying foul because wiki leaks proved how corrupt the DNC and its minions truly are. So to sum it all up the Dems are pissed off that they their corruption was exposed to the American public. This is a demonic entity that exposed itself.

Reply bertramc 23:18 07.01.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete Not to worry -- In the US, the self-annointed "main-stream" media has maybe a 7% credibility. They started trafficking in fake news years and years ago. At this point, in the US, we consider "MSM news" (i.e. CIA propaganda) to be Ludicrous News. There are many sides to this story. For starters, if the release of Potesta's emails on Hillary's favorite practice is considered interference with a free election, it was not. In that case, if it happened, it was interference with the CIA's attemp to interfere with US elections, which has been going on already since the assassination by JFK in the 1960s. Podesta's emails show that Hillary and her team were involved in eating babies, and drinking their blood, in Satanic ceremonies, for youth and power. The so-called "Pentagon," which is really a Pentagon-Hollywood-MSM amalgam, that is financed by global heroin and cocaine trafficking operations, and its three cutout operations, namely NATO, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are doing global regime change operations, not for democracy, or for war-machine profits. They are doing it for global establishment of its religion, which is ritual child sacrifice, and ritual baby eating (literally!). Pentagon regime change operations are real;ly religion.change operations. They start with flooding an area with heroin and cocaine, progress through a period of "escalating tensions" along psychological fault lines to special operations "terrorism" to destroy local economic infrastructure, to civil war and total social breakdown. In this form of "democracy" the populations are all to willing to "cut a deal" with the baby eaters. If the Russians are to be blamed for attempting to right the Pentagon-MSM-CIA's effort to steal the election from the American people, and push Hillary into power, are they also to be blamed for attempting to defend themselves. The Russian people have a right to defend themselves. From what? bombs? yes-ok. But bombs and war do not frighten the Russians, or the Persians. What they want to defend themselves, and their futurity from is ... the Pentagon's religious practice of baby eating. In that case, if it was "Russia" (who dat?) that released Podesta's emails, then "Russia" was not only helping Americans, but it was also taking whatever MINIMUM steps it could take to DEFEND itself, and it future generations. The top brass at the US Pentagon (really, the CIA-MSM-Hollywood-Banking complex) are really sick people. Schreeching bedwetters, habitual liars, drugs traffickers, baby eaters, ... really scum. NATO, Israel and Saudi Arabia are merely high-paid crisis actors. They do nothing without direction from Pentagon brass. The CIA itself, is also a cutout. "Gen." Clapper is 100% a joke.

Reyes, contributor - 01/07/17 11:00 AM EST 142   © Getty Images A former Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump’s healthcare plan will offer ‘insurance for everybody’: report Trump on outgoing CIA director: ‘Was this the leaker of Fake News?’ What Obama will do after his presidency? Sleep. MORE critic has gone from adversary to adviser. Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC), has signed on as a member of President-elect Trump's national diversity coalition. "Our association is going to respect the process and respect the will of the people. We're going to do everything we can to help the new administration move this country forward," Palomarez told BuzzFeed News. "I'm very enthused and encouraged by the progress thus far." As a headline in Latina magazine put it, reporting on this development: Que?! Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Palomarez rightfully called out Trump's anti-Latino, anti-immigrant rhetoric. He criticized the president-elect in unusually personal terms. Nothing we've seen in the meantime indicates that Trump has changed, yet Palomarez is surrendering his dignity and signing on with him. The USHCC describes itself as "America's largest Hispanic business organization," representing over 4.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses.  ADVERTISEMENT As head of the USHCC, Palomarez made it clear how he felt about Trump. In September, he told two MSNBC hosts that Trump was a "payaso, a complete clown" and that his "movement of hatred" wouldn't solve any real problems. When the USHCC made its first-ever presidential endorsement for Democratic nominee Clinton, Palomarez told Reuters that Trump was "dangerous" and "a buffoon." He noted that Trump's campaign had "devolved into something that is frankly scary." He called Trump's deportation plan "the argument of a child and fear-mongering at its worst." That was then. Now Palomarez is apparently eager to work with Trump and members of his team like white nationalist champion Steve Bannon. The president-elect's attorney and adviser, Michael Cohen, explained to BuzzFeed that the diversity coalition was put together "to dispel the notion that Mr. Trump is one of the many things that the liberal mainstream media tried to label him as — that he is anti-Hispanic." But it was not the liberal mainstream media that forced Trump to label Mexican immigrants "criminals, drug dealers, rapists" or to defame a distinguished federal judge because of his Mexican-American heritage. Of all people, Palomarez knows this — he has spoken out against Trump's hate speech in the past — which is why his joining Trump's coalition is so disappointing. Palomarez's new alignment with Trump is also unfortunate given Trump's well-documented history of not paying small-business owners who worked for him. Is there a place for Latinos in a Trump administration? Absolutely. A Latino Cabinet member could give 55 million Hispanics, literally, a voice at the table when critical national decisions are made. Palomarez would have been an outstanding choice to head the Small Business Administration, a spot that went to World Wrestling Entertainment co-founder Linda McMahon. Being part of a diversity coalition, in contrast, means that Palomarez will likely serve as window-dressing, designed to give Trump cover from charges of racism and bigotry. And how much impact will a "diversity coalition" have, anyway, in an administration that does not value diversity? Now more than ever, Latinos are taking stock of who our allies are, and Palomarez seems to be putting his personal ambition above all else. That's a shame, because Palomarez has been a thoughtful advocate for Latinos in general and Latino small-business owners in particular. Since taking over the USHCC, he helped turn the organization around. While he has stated that he still disagrees with Trump on key issues, his opinions will probably be muted now that he is linked to the administration. Like most Trump associates and advisers, Palomarez can look forward to a future of explaining, clarifying and walking back The Donald's indiscreet, erratic comments. What a sad waste of Palomarez's expertise, experience and abilities. Palomarez's decision appears at best misguided and at worst opportunistic. His joining the Donald Trump diversity coalition means the loss of an influential, once-credible voice for the Latino community. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and columnist in New York City.

PC-on-a-stick devices like Intel’s Compute Stick and the sea of me-too devices that followed seemingly vanished overnight. Similarly, modular smartphone concepts like Project Ara never made it off the ground while companies like LG that did make it to market with modular products no doubt regret the decision. Nevertheless, the industry isn’t willing to give up on the idea just yet as Intel has demonstrated at CES with a new modular compute platform calling the Intel Compute Card. The idea is pretty straightforward. Intel’s Compute Card is essentially a full-blown computer with an Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity that fits on a card roughly as thick as a few credit cards. Said card then gets plugged into the Compute Card slot of devices like interactive refrigerators, security cameras or IoT gateways. The lure here is the ability to easily upgrade the performance of a connected device without having to replace it entirely. Intel said it is already working with several large partners on the endeavor including HP, Dell, Lenovo and Sharp as well as multiple regional partners. The Compute Card seems like a great idea in theory although I’m not certain it’ll take off. Samsung tried essentially this exact same thing – albeit on a much smaller scale – with its HDTVs a few years back through a product called the Smart Evolution upgrade kit. Samsung seemingly discontinued that product line in early 2016. Intel says its Compute Card will be available by mid-2017 in a range of processor options including seventh-gen Intel Core chips.

Mi Mix is a high-end device which has been made out of ceramics and boasts a 6.4-inch bezel-less display. From an engineering perspective, Xiaomi Mi Mix is a step ahead of the rival smartphones and that’s the reality. While the Mi Mix has been made available in China since October last year, there’s no information whether the device will see a global release date. At CES 2017, we saw the white variant of the phone making its debut. Sony XBR-A1E Bravia 4K OLED TV It was rumoured to make its debut at CES 2017 and Sony just did that. President and CEO Kazuo Hirai announced the company’s first ever OLED TV with 4K UHD resolution. The A1 BRAVIA OLED series makes the screen the speaker, making it the world’s first acoustic surface sound system. The A1 BRAVIA OLED series makes the screen the speaker. In addition, the A1 Series also boasts 4K resolution and HDR compatibility. To be available in 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch sizes and will be available later this year as prices are yet to be announced. Honor Magic The star of the show was not the 6X, but the Honor Magic. Originally announced in China last month, Honor Magic made its international debut at CES 2017. It packs a 5-inch QHD screen, a Kirin 950 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB of storage, and dual 12-megapixel cameras. Huawei has also added the “AI” features and hence the name “Magic”. But the phone is not about the spec sheet alone. The front glass and the rear both curve on all four edges. Huawei has also added the “AI” features and hence the name “Magic”. The Honor Magic appears to be another winner from Huawei. Unfortunately, the company has no plans to bring the smartphone to India anytime soon. Mangoslab Nemonic This printer lets you print sticky notes using a companion app on a smartphone. Choose photos or notes and print black-and-white photos in seconds. Nemonic uses Thermal printing technique, which means it requires a special paper that changes colour when exposed to heat. This printer lets you print sticky notes using a companion app on a smartphone. Unfortunately, you cannot print coloured photographs. The printer itself costs $120 and will hit the US market in April. Meanwhile, the cost to print one photo will cost $4. Petcube Play The Petcube Play is a unique device that lets you keep a tab on your cat when out of the home. So basically, Petcube Play is a Wi-Fi-enabled camera that captures HD video and can be accessed using an app on your smartphone. You can record videos or take pictures of your cat. Petcube Play is a Wi-Fi-enabled camera that captures HD video and can be accessed using an app on your smartphone. Interestingly, the camera comes with a built-in microphone and speaker so that you can hear and speak to your cat. We still don’t know how many people in India would be interested getting a Wi-Fi-based pet camera, but again it seems to be interesting device.

Beijing’s goal to achieve a leadership position in semiconductor design and manufacturing, in part by spending US$150 billion over a 10-year period, requires an effective response to maintain US competitiveness in the industry, according to the report released on Friday. “We found that Chinese policies are distorting markets in ways that undermine innovation, subtract from US market share, and put US national security at risk,” the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology said in the report. Obama blocks Chinese takeover of German semiconductor company The warnings about China could give ammunition to President-elect Donald Trump two weeks ahead of his swearing in. Since winning the election, Trump has backed up fiery campaign rhetoric toward China with a series of pronouncements on Twitter and the appointment of China hawks to key roles. The real answer is not a trade war, it’s not restrictions, it’s really about making the US more competitive Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel Corp Trump’s attacks have stoked fears of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Beijing is prepared to step up its scrutiny of US companies in the event Trump takes punitive measures against Chinese goods, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The options include subjecting well-known US companies or ones that have large Chinese operations to tax or antitrust inquiries, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter was not public. Other possible measures include the launch of anti-dumping investigations and scaling back government purchases of American products, according to the people. “China has gained from global openness, but has been less committed to sustaining it – and, in some cases, has worked against it,” the White House report said. “Now, globally, more countries are questioning the benefits of economic openness – a trend that will shape, and be shaped by, how the United States responds to challenges in the semiconductor arena.” US industry leaders do not want Trump to engage in a standoff with China. Giving corporate tax breaks to US companies was the way Trump advocated bringing back jobs to this country, according to Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel Corp. China’s semiconductor ambitions get a reality check as Stats ChipPac deal sees poor returns “The real answer is not a trade war, it’s not restrictions, it’s really about making the US more competitive,” Krzanich said on CNBC on Friday.  “Lowering the tax rates, making it easier for people to do manufacturing here, that’s what will bring manufacturing back to the US.” Krzanich attended the recent meeting between Trump and leaders of technology companies. The Council of Advisers on Science and Technology’s semiconductor working group includes several industry executives such as Paul Otellini, the former chief executive of Intel, and Paul Jacobs, the chairman of Qualcomm. Foreign acquisitions of US businesses are routinely reviewed for national security risks by a panel of officials led by the Treasury Department. That panel – the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS) in the US – has frustrated some Chinese investment in the US semiconductor industry. In December, US President Barack Obama blocked a Chinese company from buying the US business of Germany’s Aixtron, a semiconductor-equipment supplier. The White House report recommends a strategy for US policy makers that includes countering “innovation-inhibiting” Chinese industrial policy and improving the business environment for US chip makers. It suggests broadening what is considered a national security risk as part of CFIUS reviews in certain circumstances, while also cautioning against blanket opposition to China’s advancement in the industry. US officials should also work with allies to strengthen global export controls, according to the report. China’s tech sector blasted for ‘innovation mercantilism’ and other protectionist policies aimed at giving it an unfair advantage The US has led the semiconductor industry since it took off in the 1960s. Companies such as Intel and Qualcomm have pushed the technical bounds of innovation in the US$300 billion market. In 2015, China did not have one company among the top 10 industry suppliers. China, the world’s most populous country, is nonetheless the biggest buyer of the electronic components. The main rivals to the US’ dominance are in South Korea and Taiwan, where companies such as Samsung Electronics, the second-largest chip maker by revenue behind Intel, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have gained ground over the last decade. To strengthen its position in chip manufacturing, China relies on subsidies for domestic suppliers, according to the White House report. That could harm US firms by allowing Chinese companies to sell below cost and reduce US market share, the report said. China also encouraged domestic customers to buy only from Chinese suppliers and required technology transfer to China in exchange for access to its market, the White House said. A representative of the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment about the report. Underlining some of the difficulties that US chip makers have faced gaining unfettered access to their largest market, in February 2015, Qualcomm announced it had paid US$975 million to settle a case brought by China’s National Development and Reform Commission accusing the company of abusing its dominant position in the chip market for mobile phones. Under the settlement, Qualcomm agreed to lower its licensing fees for phones sold in China to rates that are lower than it charges in other countries, but it is still striving to get Chinese handset makers to pay up.

New Windows 10 Device Features Surface-like Specs (Probably) at Half the Price GO Chuwi launches Windows 10 tablet with detachable keyboard Jan 7, 2017 07:00 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​Chuwi is one of the Chinese companies that are trying to wrestle with the big guys, and as we’ve told you in our own reviews, the firm has surprisingly good products that really offer excellent value for the money. Their latest device is a 2-in-1 similar in specs with Microsoft’s own Surface Book, and Chuwi says that the display is even identical to what the Redmond-based software giant is offering on its laptop. Called the Hi13, Chuwi’s new tablet features a 13.5.-inch display with a resolution of 3000x2000 pixels and 3:2 screen ratio, and is powered by an Intel Apollo Lake Celeron N3450 CPU coupled with 4GB DDr3 RAM. Additionally, it boasts a 9th generation Intel integrated graphics card, as well as 64GB eMM storage, Wi-Fi, a USB Type-C port, and Windows 10. And last but not least, the Hi13 adopts the approach invented by Microsoft with the Surface, so it also sports a detachable keyboard and pen support. Same display as the Surface Book Now, for the comparison between the Hi13 and the Surface Book, Chuwi says the display is identical, as they are both 13.5 inches in size, have a 3000x2000 pixel resolution with 267 PPI and 3:2 aspect ratio. Furthermore, the two displays support 10 point multi-touch, 100 percent sRGB, and feature 400 Nits brightness and 1700:1 contrast ratio. It goes without saying that you shouldn’t expect this device to be as powerful as the Surface Book, and the difference is made by the other specs. The top-of-the-range Surface Book comes with an Intel i7 processor and a dedicated NVIDIA graphics card, but the Hi13 should still be good enough for typical activities like browsing and working with documents. As far as pricing is concerned, Chuwi is yet to disclose such details, but more information will probably be unveiled soon when the device goes on sale. What’s important to note, however, is that Chuwi, as the majority of Chinese manufacturers, targets a price that’s as low as possible, so there’s a good chance the Hi13 will be insanely cheap. And it goes without saying that it’ll be a lot more affordable than the Surface Book.

Russia’s objectives were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate former Secretary of State Clinton, make it harder for her to win and harm her presidency if she did, an unclassified report released by the top U.S. intelligence agency said. “We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,” the report said. “We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.” The report, although it omitted classified details, was the U.S. government’s starkest public description of what it says was an unprecedented Russian campaign to manipulate the American body politic. Reports of Russian interference in the already divisive election have roiled Washington, even as the U.S. Congress on Friday certified Trump’s victory in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots. The report’s conclusions, though lacking details of how the Russians may have relayed the material to WikiLeaks and others, will give ammunition to Democrats and Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress who want tougher action against Russia, setting the scene for a potential showdown with Trump. It could also give a boost to members of Congress seeking an independent, bipartisan investigation of Russian hacking. Trump, who has developed a rocky relationship with U.S. spy agencies and at times disparaged their work, defended the legitimacy of his election victory after receiving a nearly two-hour briefing Friday on the report. The report neither assessed “the impact Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election” nor did it provide details on the evidence underpinning its conclusions, a fact likely to keep alive the controversy over what Moscow may have done. Russia denies the U.S. government’s allegations of hacking during the election campaign. RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AGENCY The report said U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russian military intelligence, the GRU, used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the Guccifer 2.0 “persona” to release emails that it had acquired from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and top Democrats as part of the effort. The release of the emails led to embarrassing media coverage for Clinton and triggered the resignation of the DNC’s chief. WikiLeaks founder Julian AssangeWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and top Clinton aide John Podesta from “a state party.” However, Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party. Russian actors were not found to have targeted U.S. systems that are involved in tallying votes, the report said. The report was produced by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. Also on Friday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security designated U.S. election infrastructure as critical infrastructure, widening the options the government has to protect voting machines from cyber attacks. While the report found Russia had conducted cyber attacks on both the Democratic and the Republican parties, it made clear that the primary aims were to harm Clinton whether or not she won the election and evolved over time. “When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency,” it said. “We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,” it said. The CIA and FBI had high confidence in this judgment and NSA moderate confidence, the report said. Neither the Russian Embassy in Washington, nor Clinton aides immediately responded to requests for comment. The report suggested Putin was motivated in part by personal animus toward Clinton. “Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him,” it said. ‘TROUBLING CHAPTER IN ONGOING STORY’ In a statement after his intelligence briefing, Trump did not squarely address whether he was told of the agencies’ belief Russia carried out the hacking. Instead, he said: “Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations” including the DNC. “There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,” Trump said. The businessman, who is to be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, also said he would appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days of taking office on how to prevent cyber attacks but suggested that he would keep their recommendations secret. The report did not reveal how the intelligence agencies collected the evidence underpinning their conclusions or the evidence itself, including the means by which Russian military intelligence “relayed” the materials filched from the DNC and other hacking targets to WikiLeaks and others, omissions likely to leave the report open to criticism. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who was briefed on the report on Friday, took issue with Trump’s comments. “The President-Elect’s statement that the Russian hacking had ‘absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election’ is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,” Schiff said. “It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying – which is true – it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to … Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns,” he said. “The consequence of these disclosures was hugely beneficial to the President-Elect and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended.” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said his panel would continue to compile “facts surrounding Russia’s active measures,” adding: “This is a troubling chapter in an ongoing story.” Print Friendly Next article Vast iceberg poised to crack off Antarctica - scientists Previous article Five-star City demolish woeful West Ham News timeline Jan 15th 8:38 PM Football United’s Ibrahimovic rescues draw against Liverpool Jan 15th 8:07 PM Football Man City’s title hopes hit by Lukaku and Everton teens Jan 15th 6:57 PM Americas Top Republicans disappointed with questioning legitimacy of Trump’s win Jan 15th 6:09 PM Middle East Israel says Kerry sought to reassure Netanyahu over Paris conference Jan 15th 5:35 PM Middle East Iran says it will not renegotiate nuclear deal Jan 15th 5:09 PM Cyprus Nine Turkish colonels arrested in the north for Gulen links Jan 15th 5:00 PM Cyprus MPs fail to ease confusion and anger over fuel prices Jan 15th 4:54 PM Europe Fierce Merkel critic resigns from conservative party Jan 15th 4:48 PM Europe Serbia says Kosovo wants war as neighbours row over Serb nationalist train Jan 15th 4:06 PM Europe Bodies of five migrants found off Spain’s southern coast Broadcaster Rosie Charalambous takes a weekly look at the stories and cultural events making the news.

Here are some of the newest health and fitness wearables, announced at CES, that could be making their way into your workouts this year. Bodytrak Picture 2 of 18 There are plenty of wireless headphones, but Bodytrak stands out for an obvious reason. While users listen to music, the “hearables” can track a variety of vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, cadence, and VO2. (The ear is close to major blood vessels that connect to the brain, so it’s a good place to get accurate readings of vital signs.) The earbuds sync with an analytics app that will help users monitor their performance with an eye toward preventing injuries. London-based Bodytrak is being tested by English Premier League teams and rugby clubs -- and the company says the earbuds could be useful for workers in the defense, energy, and healthcare industries who need both hands free while on the job. Bodytrak will be available to consumers and sports teams this summer. Pricing has not been announced, but the company says it will be comparable to devices that range from $249 to $299. Casio WSD-F20 Picture 3 of 18 Casio unveiled its first smartwatch at CES 2016, and what the device lacked in style it made up for in substance—it was the only Android Wear watch to come with a built-in GPS, barometer, altimeter, and compass. It was a niche watch, made specifically to withstand the rigors of outdoor use. This year’s watch, the WSD-F20 ($500), is even more rugged, complete with button guards and a protective bezel surrounding the entire display. Mapping features have been updated as well; through a partnership with Mapbox, users can download full-color maps and view them while offline in the wilderness. Users can also write notes and place markers on a map. In another upgrade, the WSD-F20 also adds a low-power GPS mode. Built on the new Android Wear 2.0 platform, the WSD-F20 will be available April 21. Casio also announced that the WSD-F10 will be upgraded to Android Wear 2.0 at the same time. Digitsole Picture 4 of 18 This maker of heated, connected, and activity-tracking shoe inserts has taken the next step and unveiled a prototype of a “smart shoe.” The Active Cushioning Run Profiler promises shock detection and can shift support (making the insole softer or harder) over the course of a run based on data collected from sensors at five pressure points along the foot. The shoe also tracks activity and connects to a mobile app using Bluetooth; the company says the app can help runners figure out if they are fatigued. The app also comes with an audio coaching feature that provides workout tips, much like fitness headphones. A hiking version of the shoes is heated, too. Digitsole’s shoe will be available later this year. Pricing has not been announced, but a company spokesperson estimated that they would cost around $250. Garmin fenix 5 Picture 5 of 18 Garmin skipped v4 of its fenix watch line and went straight to the fenix 5. The watches come with many of the same features of the fenix 3 line, and the features you now come to expect from rugged GPS watches—activity tracking, water resistance to 100m, optical heart rate monitor, barometric altimeter, compass, and so on. The biggest difference is the size. The fenix 5S ($599) has a diameter of 42mm, and the fenix 5 ($599) is 47mm. Both are more compact that the watches in the fenix 3 line, which are about 51mm. This mean the fenix 5 watches should appeal to users with smaller wrists, as well as anyone looking for a watch to wear continuously. The smaller size does impact the 5S’s battery life, though 13 hours in continuous GPS mode is still pretty good. Both the 5S and 5 are available in stainless steel, WiFi-enabled Sapphire models for $100 more. The third watch in the fenix 5 line, the 51mm 5X, also checks in at $699. This watch also includes preloaded topographic maps and an Around Me feature that shows nearby points of interest. All fenix 5 watches will be available this spring. InBody WATCH Picture 6 of 18 The new InBody WATCH aims to be more than just an activity tracker. Using embedded PPG and ECG sensors, the watch can track heart rate as well as Pulse Wave Velocity, which measures how well blood pumps through the body’s arteries and is a potential predictor of cardiovascular disease. Data from the watch can also be used to perform InBody’s body composition analysis, which calculates metrics such as water weight, muscle mass, and BMI. The watch includes the same fitness-tracking features available in the company’s InBody BAND -- step counting, distance traveled, calories burned, sleep tracking, and activity tracking. An updated version of the band will be available this summer; the watch will be available this fall. LINX Smart Helmet Picture 7 of 18 The LINX Smart Helmet ($200) from Coros appears at CES2017 after a Kickstarter campaign that raised more than $300,000. The helmet lets riders listen to music, as well as hear mid-ride data or turn-by-turn directions, using bone-conduction technology. Two speakers are positioned over the cheekbone so that a rider’s ear canals remain open to listen for pedestrians, cars, or other hazards. A built-in microphone also allows for ear-free phone calls. In addition, the helmet comes with a remote that attaches to the handlebars and sync with an Android or iOS app. The app syncs to Strava and MapMyRide and also lets users create, save, and share routes. The routes support waypoint, which can be helpful when mountain biking or riding in remote areas. Mio Slice Picture 8 of 18 Nearly all fitness trackers measure steps taken, calories burned, and minutes of exercise. The Mio Slice ($129), a wristband from Mio Global, focuses on a different metric: Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI). The device uses a series of optical heart rate sensors to measure and display a user’s PAI. The higher the number, the better. Mio says the algorithms that calculate PAI are based on the results of a 25-year study that showed a correlation among low PAI, high resting heart rate, and increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease—which is the leading cause of death in the world but is highly preventable. Along with PAI, the face of the Mio Slice displays the user’s heart rate, activity, and sleep data. The device can also receive phone call and text message notifications. Misfit Vapor Picture 9 of 18 With the Vapor ($199), Misfit has branched out from activity trackers to smartwatches. The Vapor comes with the usual fitness-tracking features -- accelerometer, altimeter, gyroscope, an optical heart rate monitor and built-in GPS. The watch also offers 4GB of storage, so users who work out with music will be able to leave their smartphones at home. The Vapor is the first Misfit watch with a touchscreen. The 44mm display encased in stainless steel, and there are interchangeable wristbands, so the Vapor may appeal to athletes who want a watch that doesn’t look out of place with dress clothes. However, the battery only lasts 2 days on a single charge, and Misfit is developing its own operating system, which may limit the number of third-party apps made for the Vapor. Misfit hasn’t announced a release date for the Vapor, so interested buyers will have to wait a while. In the meantime, check out our hands-on with the Misfit Vapor. Motiv Ring Picture 10 of 18 In an increasingly crowded market for fitness trackers that are worn on the wrist, the Motiv “smart ring” ($199) stands out by fitting on a single finger. Motiv can track steps, distance traveled, calories burned, and sleep. It also includes an optical heart rate monitor to track active and resting heart rate. There’s obviously no display on the ring, but users can view activity and heart rate data in an iOS app. The limited features won’t appeal to hardcore athletes, but Motiv might interest anyone who wants to track activity but doesn’t want a wristband or clip-on device. The Motiv's lithium ion battery will last up to five days on a single charge, depending on use, and recharges using a USB stick. Available this spring, the ring comes in two colors (slate gray or rose gold) and seven sizes.   New Balance RunIQ Picture 11 of 18 At last year’s CES, New Balance and chipmaker Intel announced that they were collaborating on an Android Wear smartwatch. This year, the RunIQ ($299) made its debut. Available Feb. 1, RunIQ delivers the functionality runners have come to expect: GPS tracker, heart rate monitor, smartphone notifications, and a lap button. The battery will last 5 hours in GPS mode, which is only has as long as comparably priced watches such as the Garmin Forerunner 235 and TomTom Spark 3. The RunIQ features on their own aren’t all that impressive, especially when compared to other Android Wear devices. However, two things do set the watch apart. One, it integrates with Strava for tracking run data instead of sending users to yet another proprietary app. Two, it connects to the New Balance Run Club, which offers virtual training runs and in-person events at New Balance stores. PIQ Robot Blue Everlast Picture 12 of 18 Pugilists finally have their own wearable with PIQ’s Robot Blue, which takes the company’s sensor for tracking tennis, golf, and skiing activity and puts it into a wrist strap that slides over hand wraps or boxing gloves. Accelerometers and a gyroscope within the PIQ device measure a boxer’s punch speed, impact, intensity and total time. The device syncs with an artificial intelligence system known as GAIA, which compares a user’s stats against professionals. (The company has partnered with Everlast to get this data.) Based on the data, the system can recommend which punches would work best for a particular boxer. The sensor-wrist strap combination is $99—you’ll need one for each hand—and will be available in March.  PKVitality K’Track Sensors Picture 13 of 18 The K’Track sensors from PKVitality also strive to provide more than the usual activity data. Two devices—K’Track Athlete ($200) and K’Track Glucose ($150)—gather readings from a from a biosensor, known as a K’Apsul, which uses needles 0.5mm long to analyze the interstitial fluid just below the surface of the skin that absorbs chemicals such as glucose and lactic acid. Worn on the arm, K’Track Athlete measures lactic acid, heart rate, and VO2 levels in real-time during exercise. This eliminates the need for post-workout blood draws to calculate an athlete’s lactate threshold. Worn on the wrist, K’Track Glucose can provide glucose readings in one minute and displays the rest of the day’s measurements as well. Users can also set reminders for their next glucose reading, and the device tracks steps taken, distance traveled and calories burned. Both devices sync with an Android or iOS app. Capsules last 30 days and cost $99 for Glusose and $149 for Athlete. The devices are due for release in 2018 following regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Polar Team Pro Shirt Picture 14 of 18 The industry leader in chest-strap heart rate monitor technology has entered the “smart fabric” market. The sleeveless Polar Team Pro Shirt (available in March) uses two fabric sensors to measure a user’s heart rate. This eliminates the need to wear a chest strap, which can get uncomfortable during long workouts. There’s also a pouch on the back of the shirt collar where users can tuck in a small device that measures speed, distance, and acceleration. As the name implies, the Polar Team Pro Shirt is designed for the company’s Team Pro coaching software, which is used by major professional and college teams. For weekend warriors, the company says the shirt will also integrate with the Polar Flow app and other Polar Pro brand wearables, including the M600. Sensoria Sock 2.0 Picture 15 of 18 Version 2.0 of Sensoria's “smart sock” ($199, available later this year) are not only lighter than before, but are better protected from sweat and water, which improves accuracy. Three pressure sensors, embedded under the planar area of the foot, connect to the Sensoria Core, a half-ounce, square-inch component that measures the typical running stats (pace, speed, GPS tracking) as well as cadence and foot landing technique. Core will also connect to the company’s new Vivobarefoot shoe, which will be launched later this year. The socks stream data to an iOS app, Sensoria Run 2.0, and also store data for a month, so users can run smartphone-free. The new app also offers advice from a virtual running coach called Mara and can let users know when it’s time to get a new pair of running shoes. Sensoria also announced a monthly subscription service; Users can receive a delivery of fresh smart socks as well as access custom training plans through Sensoria Run 2.0. Under Armour Record Equipped Sneakers Picture 16 of 18 Introduced in 2015, Under Armour is doubling down on its lineup of shoes that can track how far and how fast you run. This year, UA is adding a new feature, called Jump Around, that measures how high you can jump to determine your overall muscle fatigue, and then tailors a workout to your ability. The Record Equipped line now boasts three models: The Gemini 3 RE ($159) is the original, neutral running shoe; the Europa 3 RE ($159) is a stability shoe; and the Velociti 3 RE ($139) is a minimalist shoe. All are available for preorder now, and ship in February. While we were a bit tepid in our review of the Speedform Gemini 2, the embedded technology in the Record Equipped shoes is intriguing. Link AKC Picture 17 of 18 Humans aren’t the only ones who can benefit from activity tracking. Beyond location tracking, the Link AKC ($149) dog collar uses an accelerometer to measure moderate and intense activity. The connected app then analyzes the data to provide activity recommendations depending on a dog’s age, breed, behavior, and size. Link AKC will also measure the air temperature and alert an owner if it’s too hot or cold for a dog to be outside. (This data transmission requires a monthly or yearly service plan, which also includes access to a pet poison hotline.) Along with activity and data tracking, the collar comes with a small speaker, which owners can use for sound training, and an LED light for nighttime visibility. The app tracks activities in a scrapbook that displays the date, distance, and any photos of Fido taking along the way.

Finance Search Virtual reality seeks momentum at CES gadget galaBy Glenn CHAPMAN | AFP – Sat, Jan 7, 2017 3:22 AM AEDT Related Content View Photo A man wearing a VR headset experiments with a merged reality experience using Project Alloy at the Intel exhibit during the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas Virtual reality sought its stride Friday at the Consumer Electronics Show, where despite being a hot topic there was little sign it is racing into mainstream culture. Show floor space devoted to virtual reality abounded with companies diving into the market with headsets, content, or tools for better creating or delivering immersive experiences. Last year at CES, virtual reality was an eye-grabbing sensation. This time around there was a focus on what it is going to take to get it into the hands of the masses. Shawn DuBravac, chief economist at the Consumer Technology Association behind the annual show, was confident that sales of mixed reality gear would grow, and the range of uses expand far beyond video games. "There is a lot of investment going into content," DuBravac said. "Sales will eventually come." - Scratching the surface - Taiwan-based HTC used CES to announce initiatives aimed at getting developers to create more VR experiences and revealed plans for arcades in public venues so more people could give it a try. HTC had a 'great' year with its Vive VR head wear and Steam online game venue but was "really just scratching the surface," said Vive general manager Daniel O'Brien. "Our goal is to build the largest VR platform in the world," O'Brien said. "2016 was a coming out party for VR; 2017 is developing it in the marketplace and continuing to evolve the product." Vive is up against PlayStation VR and Facebook-owned Oculus Rift. Each company has been wooing software developers and refining its hardware to better entice users. HTC said that later this year it will release a Vive Tracker device that lets digital versions of real-world objects easily be put into fantasy worlds. O'Brien also said that HTC is working on a wireless version of its headset, to sate a strong desire to be able to move around untethered to computers while using Vive. Rikard Steiber, head of Viveport virtual reality app shop, said that more than 3,000 titles for the Vive platform would be available by the end of this year. The vision is to have Viveport serve all VR platforms, including those of Oculus and Sony, according to Steiber. - VR arcades - HTC said it will launch what it billed as the world's first virtual reality app subscription service, likened to "Netflix for VR." The goal is to help developers reach audiences and make money, ideally inspiring the creation of more VR content, according to HTC executives. HTC also planned to bring VR to the masses in arcades in shopping malls, downtowns or other public locations. The company envisioned thousands of Viveport Arcades in operation by the end of this year. Sony Corporation chief executive Kazuo Hirai revealed at CES that the Japanese consumer electronics company had sold more than 53.4 million PlayStation 4 consoles, which can power it virtual reality head gear. He said that Sony aimed to continue the console momentum with more services and content, including VR games. Sony Pictures was among more than two dozen companies that used CES to announce the creation of a Virtual Reality Industry Forum. The Forum said its goal is to "further the widespread availability of high-quality audiovisual VR experiences." The group wants standards and formats that allow rich VR content to be equally accessible from the array of devices, avoiding "fragmentation" that has plagued audio-visual media in the past, according to a release. "We believe this is crucial for the market to take off," Sky broadcast strategy chief engineer Chris Johns said in the release. "We all expect that 2017 will be the year when intense consumer interest in VR spurs a quantum leap in the user experience." CES featured the largest collection of VR technology ever at a trade show, according to Gartner analyst Brian Blau. "There is a bit of the cart being before the horse," Blau said. "A lot of people have learned about it, but people aren't really buying it." He described the VR scene at CES as the first incarnation of an ecosystem of devices, applications and services in what was a big step for the technology. "There is nothing like putting it on and experiencing it," Blau said of VR. "The disappointing part is that it is quite expensive. VR will be held back a bit until quality goes up and price goes down."

Close share panel Image copyright Symantec Image caption The futuristic looking Core is controlled via a smartphone app Security firms have launched routers at CES that can stop smart household gadgets being hijacked by hackers. Symantec, BitDefender and Intel unveiled devices that scrutinise data as it flows across home networks. The companies say routers with built-in defences will be essential as homes are filled with net-connected gadgets. The routers also come with parental control features that help manage how much time children spend online and what they see. Home invasion "You will have to buy a security solution for your internet-of-things," said Alex Balan, chief security researcher at BitDefender. The "internet of things" refers to the growing collection of smart gadgets that can be controlled via the net. "Pretty soon everything will be connected one way or another and managed by a smartphone app," said Mr Balan. "You won't be able to avoid it." But that interconnectivity and ease of use comes at a cost, he said, adding that the end of 2016 had seen a surge in attacks that compromised net-connected CCTV cameras, televisions and media servers. Image copyright Bitdefender/Arris Image caption BitDefender unveiled a new version of its Box router while Arris revealed that it was adding Intel's security software to its devices The poor security on these gadgets led to them being enrolled in massive networks by hackers who use them to carry out overwhelming attacks. One network, called Mirai, staged some of the biggest net attacks ever seen. The problem has got so serious that the US Federal Trade Commission has kicked off a competition to create tools that consumers can add to their home network that can protect IoT devices from attack. Cash rewards of $25,000 (£20,000) will be given to the best entrants. "Security for these devices has to start at the network level," said Gareth Lockwood from Symantec. "There's no other way to do it." As the entry and exit point for home networks, routers were the best place to put a security system that can watch for malicious traffic coming in and cut off hackers trying to access insecure kit. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The show floors of the CES tech expo are packed with new internet-connected products for the home While current home routers do have security systems, most are pretty basic, said Mr Lockwood, and none is ready for the explosion of smart devices predicted to be in use soon. "If we look forward four to five years from now we expect to see between 20 to 30 billion devices in homes," he said. "There'll be tens of devices per household."

Symantec launched the Norton Core that is intended to replace the router supplied by an ISP. In the US, the Core will cost $279 BitDefender unveiled the Box which sits alongside a home router and polices traffic as it flows across a network. The Box currently costs $129 Intel Security has signed a deal with hardware firm Arris to include its security software in a specially-made line of home protection routers. Intel has yet to release prices for these products All three will face competition from established devices such as the Cujo smart firewall and the Home Halo and Eero products as well as from Asus which has teamed up with Trend Micro to put security software on its routers. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Net-connected cameras are helping attackers in large-scale attacks The devices launched at CES will only initially be available in the US but will reach other regions later in 2017. Typically, buying one of the secure routers includes a subscription to a firm's standard security software that runs on desktops, laptops and tablets. All three also include net access control systems that let parents decide for how long different gadgets can be used and which sites youngsters can visit. Some, such as the Norton Core, have an internet pause button that cuts off access for everyone in a household.

Ockel crams Windows 10 into a pocket-sized touchscreen PC The Ockel Sirius A is an Intel-powered miniature PC with a 6-inch touch screen. Jared Newman (PC World (US online)) on 07 January, 2017 11:15 0 - - - - print email A little-known company called Ockel wants to put a touchscreen Windows 10 PC in your pocket. At CES 2017, Ockel was showing off an extremely rough prototype of its Sirius A mini-PC, which was funded on Indiegogo late last year with more than $443,000 raised. The device is small enough to fit in a pocket or purse, and will pack a 6-inch 1080p multitouch display. Other specs for the $699 version include a quad-core Intel Atom x7-Z8750 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a 5-megapixel front camera, two USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C port, full-sized HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, ethernet, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and a headphone jack. For an extra $100, the RAM and storage double to 8GB and 128 GB, respectively. Jared Newman Why would anyone want a touchscreen mini-PC? Aside from having the full power of Windows in your pocket, you could theoretically plug it into any monitor or TV, and use the second screen as a keyboard and trackpad, saving the hassle of carrying even more hardware. There’s just one problem: The unit on display at CES was not exactly working. The touchscreen was non-responsive, and some of the input/output ports didn’t work. Still, it was displaying the Windows 10 home screen, so at least it wasn’t a total brick. Ockel also has one Indiegogo success under its belt already with the Sirius B, a mini-PC without the built-in screen. Assuming Ockel can whip the Sirius A into working order, the plan is to start shipping it to Indiegogo backers in May.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

View Latest Posts >>> Propaganda intended to incite Americans: John McAfee on ‘Russian hacking’ claims By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on January 6, 2017 … from Russia Today,  Moscow We have all been here before [ Editor’s Note: John McAfee is certainly having a good time. The election is over and he is still getting lots of airtime for his debunking of the claimed Democratic party hack. The Intel agency briefing that Trump got today was a Shakespearean event, “Much ado about nothing”. The community seems to have an addiction to circumstantial evidence, with the biggest thing reported being that high-level Russian officials were happy that Trump had won. Well, hello! Trump had already said he was going to rebuild better relations with Russia, so of course they are happy he won. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence report had SEVEN pages on RT alone, kind of an indication they were scraping the barrel to fill the report with something. With the major anti-Russian sanction shift we are seeing in the EU, the sanctions appear to be on the way out in 2017; and so may be Angela Merkel for the role she played in the ill-conceived effort, plus opening Germany to a wave of Muslim extremist terrorism and violence that could last for decades. One of these days, a foreign Intel agency or “contractor” is going to slip a mini-nuke into some dumb suicide jihadi’s car bomb, and we are going to have another 9-11 style terror event, because the lack of public discussion on the proliferation of the small nukes is the biggest security risk we all face. With all the stories that VT has run on mini-nukes, we have not had a single call from anyone of standing wanting to learn more. It is the classic ostrich head in the sand response, and it includes government, media, security and academia. Their demonstrated interest is zero. What McAfee is doing with his banging the drum, we should have been seeing some of the security, defense and academic trade organizations doing. They are AWOL, and we need a hell of a lot more public pressure to point that out to them… Jim W. Dean ] ___________ “Here’s lookin at ya” – First published  …  January 06, 2017 – Who is going to press the common sense button on this hacking story circus? The sloppiness of the alleged DNC hack by itself proves it was not organized by a nation state, and the “utter nonsense” presented as proof of Moscow’s involvement is rather evidence of intelligence agencies being “ignorant and naïve,” John McAfee told RT. Cybersecurity legend McAfee is one of the modern computer tech pioneers and the developer of the first commercial antivirus program, who has been in the business for the past 50 years. He is also the CEO of MGT Capital Investments, and a former presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party. The so-called evidence of the Russian involvement in the hacks not only looks like “the most deceptive propaganda was perpetrated on the American public” but actually proves quite the opposite, McAfee believes. “In there are four facts which they claim prove that Russia did this hack. It was utter nonsense. The information was number one – Russian language was found in the malware. Number two – a Cyrillic keyboard was used. The forensic science can now tell what type of keyboard was used to develop a piece of a malware,” McAfee told RT. “Number three – the compiler, the piece of software that compiles the code so that it can execute, always dated time stamps. The time stamps were in a time zone for the business hours of Moscow and St. Petersburg and other places in Russia and the number four that the IP address pointed to a Russian address.” To make it simple for the American audience, McAfee metaphorically explained the situation: “Seriously, if Russia declared war on us because we hacked Russia and the head of the CIA and the intelligence committee came to the Congress and they ask him ‘What happened?’ – ‘Oh, well you know we didn’t have time to remove English language, we didn’t have time to move the date stamp, the guy could not use a Chinese keyboard, so we gave him our regular keyboard. And also there was my wife’s birthday so I could not remove the IP address.’” “Please, that person would be scheduled for a suicide,” McAfee concluded. Thus, McAfee believes, the whole “Russian hacking” narrative is either “propaganda intended to incite the American people, to anger toward Russia for some reason, or our intelligence community is so ignorant and naïve that they should all be replaced.” The Cybersecurity specialist believes that based on the presented evidence the hack “cannot possibly be an organized nation-state.” “The hack on the DNC used a piece of malware a year and a half old and there have been many updates since then, McAfee said. “This was done by an independent one person kid that downloaded the software. Please, this is not an organized hack and certainly not a nation-state that did this.” ____________ Related Posts: Jill Stein files for recount in Michigan, Does Russia Regret “Hacking for Trump?” Trump reveals details on his Russia policy Russian Hacking – No Big Deal Trump might roll back Russia sanctions: Conway You can’t make this stuff up: Trump win proves Russia hacked the DNC!

As I had seen the interview earlier in the day I thought it was odd for Jim Dean. For some of the other VT Writers their lack of even handed reporting on the Rep & Dem Candidates has been a problem for me, and I suspect a number of others. Glad I was wrong on this one. Regardless, it worrying that the current Admin runs such a potentially provocative agenda. As a World, as appose to, a US Citizen, I can only hope that there is nothing more incendiary before 20th January! Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  January 8, 2017 at 5:26 am The back story here, on McAee, and which I chose to cover this, is once again we see none of the industry experts challenging him, or us either. They just go “quiet” with no response, betting on the age old bet that a week from now most of the public will not ever remember. That is why none of the fake news people worry about getting caught. It is just a temporary problem. The only bright light we have on this now as the term fake news have become part of the lexicon now, when VT has been featuring the problem constantly, and like McAfee, no one with standing, meaning a reputation to lose officially has wanted to debate us. Well Aware  January 7, 2017 at 10:53 am It’s looking like the phony Russian hack is failing, so they have to escalate it to the point of saying Putin himself did it, lmfao The gigantic mass deception needed a boost of panic, and it looks like the Ft Lauderdale scam was brought in to scare the public. It’s looking really infantile. Once all news helicopters were in place, came the second “scare”, the rumors that there was another shooter in the parking garage. That’s the panic that helps propel the hot air ballon of lies and deception, people running and freaking out- Log in to Reply joetv  January 7, 2017 at 6:26 am What? Are you starting rumors here. This is totally an opinion piece. I value the opinion. But it wasn’t 1 kid. It was the professor, in the library, with a book. Truthfully. I ain’t got a clue. We’re on a runaway train. There is so much bs in the air confusion is confused. What if…..!? Log in to Reply JohnZ  January 7, 2017 at 4:02 am Over at Jonas Alexis’ page he swears the Russians did it! Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  January 8, 2017 at 5:35 am Yes, but there are multiple parts to this. The part about the self-erasing code, the existence of which has been around for a long time, you will notice does not get a word of coverage in the mainstream press, not even the Intel report mentioned it. That reason could be because we are using the same tactic and don’t want to publicize it. What is failing on the hack is the Intel folks so far have not put anything solid on the table, and even go so far as to say the vote was not compromised anywhere despite some counties recording more votes in a precinct than it had registered voters, and the same numbers after the recount, which boggles the mind. But that anomaly got almost zero coverage which is not unusual in these complex multilayered stories. kaho  January 7, 2017 at 1:52 am Helpingmind : I think there is a BS quota that needs to be filled each month … or else… People like McAfee, who know what they are talking about, easily look through the hype.

We've seen this with the HoloLens tests Microsoft set up in partnership with NASA -- one in space, one under the sea -- with the idea that explorers could wear the headsets and get on-the-go training or troubleshooting from mission control. We've seen this with the HoloLens demonstrations at Ignite 2016, where the virtual reality headset was used to help design a kitchen without any of the professionals actually stepping into the space they were redoing. But for me, the reality of how VR will change the nontechnical job market really sank in during the Intel press event. On Wednesday, we Intel press event attendees put on our Oculus headsets for four discrete demonstrations: a zombie shoot-em-up game called Arizona Sunshine, a trip to the Ban Gioc waterfall, a college basketball game, and a live flying drone inspection of a solar panel array at a facility in Nevada. This last demonstration -- just minutes of panning over shiny, dark panel after shiny, dark panel, all of them gleaming under a cloudless desert sky -- was when I realized what jobs had just been created. Let me backtrack for a moment. I spent a decade working as a lifeguard, at everywhere from hotel pools to water parks, and while the swimming and lifesaving skills were the specialized requirements for the job, what I was really being paid to do was pay attention to my environment and prevent serious incidents before they happened. Being paid to pay attention to something used to require being on site. Consider the forest fire lookouts employed through the American west. At one point, there were 10,000 people paid to simply sit and watch the land around them, looking for signs of fire. Now, there are a few hundred -- some states have already moved to aerial surveillance using cameras and aircraft. At the same time, fire risk in the American west keeps climbing: decades of fire suppression, rising temperatures and years of drought have led to longer "fire seasons." So imagine state and federal land management agencies deciding to bring back fire lookouts -- only these people don't have to traipse to an isolated tower in the middle of nowhere. They can work from anywhere, in shifts, and their job will be to put on a headset, watch drone footage as the drones run prescribed routes, or direct the drone to inspect a smudge on the horizon. And if these VR fire inspectors see anything amiss, they can sound an alarm to contact on-the-ground firefighters. The point is: VR will create a class of jobs where people will be paid to pay attention. And, unlike my lifeguarding job, they won't have to be onsite to combine their observation with their skilled training. Imagine security services for apartment complexes, gated communities, office parks, big-box stores, or public parks. Imagine warehouse facilities inspectors and power station inspectors. Imagine insurance companies doing preliminary surveys of houses after a hurricane's come through. Imagine media companies hiring stringers to keep watch on specific areas for stories. Imagine fisheries inspectors, agricultural inspectors.  Imagine ranch owners who want to keep tabs on their herds without having to go out in terrible weather. The cowboy who rides through the cold could be replaced by a console jockey who works on their lanai in Florida. Granted, the drone technology needs to become tougher -- drones will have to be able to go for hours in all weather and be fairly low-maintenance. There are social and legal issues to work out regarding the propagation of drones in public and private spaces. But the combination of VR plus drone could do for observe-and-report jobs what call center technology did for customer support jobs: remove the location dependencies from certain types of jobs. (And the only people left working on site or in a specific geographic location are the ones whose specialized training and skills are necessary to respond to the emergency someone else observed.) Remote work will soon be more than telework. Across the country, people might be able to get paid to pay attention. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) —  A public version of the comprehensive intelligence report assessing Russian activities and intentions in the 2016 US presidential elections was released on Friday. "The CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment, the NSA has moderate confidence," the report said. The NSA is the US agency that specializes in gathering, monitoring and assessing electronic intelligence activities. The report is based on information from multiple sources a public version of the comprehensive intelligence report assessing Russian activities and intentions in the 2016 US presidential elections. "We have completed this report and briefed President Obama as well as President-elect Trump and Congressional leadership," the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) stated in a press release on Friday. "We declassified a version of this report for the public, consistent with our commitment to transparency while still protecting classified sources and methods." © REUTERS/ Jonathan Ernst After Intel Briefing Trump Says Hacking Had No Effect on Outcome of ElectionMoscow, the report alleged, will apply lessons learned from the 2016 campaign to future elections across the globe including against US allies. Russia has repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues. The report noted the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) concluded that Russian hackers targeted systems that were uninvolved with the 2016 US presidential election vote count. "DHS assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying," it stated. In fact, according to the report, US intelligence agencies did not even assess the impact Russia’s alleged interference had on the final outcome of the election. © Photo: PIxabay Trump Curious How DNC Can Accuse Russia of Hacking Without Letting FBI Examine Its ServersRussian intelligence, the report added, accessed materials of some Republican Party affiliates, but did not launch a disclosure campaign similar to the one involving the Democratic Party. The report also claimed that media outlets owned by the Russian government were used during the 2016 US election to influence the campaign. However, the report reaffirms that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won fairly and his victory should not be delegitimized by acts of partisanship, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a press release. "We must also be clear that there is no evidence that there was any interference in the voting or balloting process. We cannot allow partisans to exploit this report in an attempt to delegitimize the president-elect’s victory," Ryan stated. "Donald Trump won this election fair and square because he heard the voices of Americans who felt forgotten." The paper entitled "Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections" excludes from itself any conclusion or assessment on the any effect that the alleged Russian interference had on the US election. "We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of 2016 election," it said. The report acknowledges that Russian President Vladimir Putin took care not to favor Trump publicly, but suggests this was must have been motivated by a Russian fear that praising Trump would backfire against him. © AFP 2016/ SAUL LOEB White House: Obama Did Not Need Intel Report Before Responding to 'Russian Hacking'"Beginning in June [2016], Putin’s public comments about the US presidential race avoided directly-praising President-elect Trump, probably because Kremlin officials thought that any praise from Putin personally would backfire in the United States," the report claimed. It stated that Russia’s "use of disclosures during the US election was unprecedented," but it nowhere specified what these disclosures were. Russian activities to influence the election by their very nature were deniable and could not be decisively proven, the report also claimed. "By their nature, Russian influence campaigns are multifaceted and designed to be deniable because they use a mix of agents of influence, cutouts, front organizations, and false flag operations," the report said. The Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) probably began cyber operations aimed at the US election by March 2016, the report alleged. "We assess that the GRU operations resulted in the compromise of the personal e-mail accounts of Democratic Party officials and political figures. By May, the GRU had extracted large volumes of data from the DNC [Democratic National Committee]," the report maintained. However, the report does not provide any evidence to support this conclusion. Nor it acknowledges the statements by WikiLeaks head Julian Assange that the key compromising material on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was directly leaked to his organization by leakers working within the DNC itself. Assange has offered a $20,000 reward for finding the murderer of Seth Rich, a 27-yewar-old DNC computer programmer who was shot dead in still mysterious circumstances on the streets of Washington in July 2016. Assange has hinted that Rich, a supporter of Clinton presidential race rival Bernie Sanders, was a key whistleblower within the DNC. The report did acknowledge that WikiLeaks material was accurate throughout and was confirmed to be so by the US intelligence community. "Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries," it said. Moreover, the report alleges that Russia employed a "state run" propaganda machine including domestic media, RT and the Sputnik news agency, to serve "as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences." But the report nowhere provides any evidence that this alleged propaganda campaign had an effect on US voters or specific election results.

These are also some of the same people who told us, UNDER OATH, that the US government does not illegally spy on people-right before the Snowden revelations. These people are a bunch of liars and idiots. They're making up this garbage as they go along. It's all lies designed to mislead people, all for political reasons. If these US government vermin want to punish someone for interfering in foreign elections, then they need to look in the mirror.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

Those are only a few of the gadgets that have been unveiled this week at the annual CES gadget expo in Las Vegas, where companies in the tech, automotive, and home appliance industries flaunt their latest innovations. Many high-profile tech companies, like Apple and Google, typically hold their own separate events throughout the year to unveil new products rather than debuting new wares at CES. Still, the annual convention, now in its 50th year, often provides a look at the next big trends in tech. The biggest themes at CES this year include self-driving cars, home robots, and tons of integrations with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. We also saw razor-thin laptops and convertible computers, along with show-stopping massive televisions. Here’s a look at some of the most interesting gadgets at CES 2017: View as 1 of 10 Replay SHARE Dell 2-in-1 Laptops Dell Dell introduced several convertible laptops this year, and the most notable include its Latitude 7285 and new XPS 13 models. The former is a Surface Pro 4 rival that includes a sharp screen, stylus, and a sturdy keyboard that more closely resembles that of a laptop than most hybrids. The latter is an updated version of Dell’s already great XPS 13 that includes a flexible rotating hinge for use in different positions. Replay SHARE Lenovo Smart Assistant Lenovo Lenovo’s new speaker is a slightly cheaper and more colorful alternative to the Amazon Echo. It includes eight microphones that Lenovo says can pick up speech from 16 feet away. It’s also powered by Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, meaning you’ll get access to the same array of “skills” that you would with Amazon’s own gadget. Similarly, Lenovo is touting the Smart Assistant as ideal for tasks like answering questions, managing calendars and to-do lists, and playing music. It launches this May in several colors and will cost $130 for the standard model and $180 for a version with upgraded Harman Kardon speakers. Replay SHARE Razer Project Valerie Razer When you’re using a laptop for doing work, playing video games, and streaming Netflix, one screen isn’t always enough. So why not include three? Razer’s Project Valerie concept does just that by adding two foldable displays that expand out from the primary screen in the center. Each display is 17 inches diagonally and supports 4K resolution, and Razer says they can be used independently or together as one giant display. The downside: it weighs 12 pounds, which isn’t unacceptable for a beefy gaming laptop but is way more than the average notebook. Replay SHARE Asus Zenfone AR Asus Asus is betting that in the near future we’ll be using our phones for way more than hailing Ubers, playing games, and video chatting. The Zenfone AR, as its name implies, is built to provide augmented and virtual reality experiences. It supports two platforms created by Google to enable these technologies: Tango and Daydream, meaning its hardware is tailored to track motion, perceive depth, and learn about its surroundings to run AR and VR apps. Replay SHARE Toyota Concept-i Toyota Toyota doesn’t believe the future of the car is only about teaching vehicles to drive for us. While the Concept-i vehicle shown at CES would be capable of driving autonomously, its biggest draw is the artificial intelligence that powers it. Toyota claims the car will be able to learn more about the drivers’ preferences and needs over time, such as suggesting destinations after a driver chats with the vehicle’s virtual assistant, called “Yui.” Replay SHARE Intel’s Credit Card-Sized Computer Intel While some laptop and desktop computers are designed to be customized and upgraded, Intel is thinking about how we’ll be upgrading the various Internet-connected home appliances and robots we may own in the future. Intel’s Compute Card, which is about the size of a credit card, is a mini-computer designed to be easily inserted into smart devices. The idea is to make upgrading gadgets like smart refrigerators, interactive retail kiosks, and connected security cameras as easy as swapping out one component. This prevents the need to buy an entirely new system once new standards in connectivity or faster processors are released. The computer includes essentially all of the same aspects of a standard-sized computer, including a processor, memory, storage, and wireless tech. Replay SHARE PowerRay Aquatic Drone PowerVision via YouTube PowerVision’s new PowerRay drone sounds like a fisherman’s dream. The waterproof vehicle is compatible with an optional FishFinder add-on that uses a sonar system to detect fish and send images to the user. It operates in both fresh and salt water and includes a 4K camera that can shoot 12-megapixel stills. Replay SHARE LG W-Series TV LG LG hopes to make large-screened TVs blend into the living room as naturally as wallpaper. The company’s new 77-inch TV is incredibly thin and light for its size, weighing just over 27 pounds, Similarly-sized smart TVs from Samsung and Sony weigh around 80 and 73 pounds respectively. That’s because LG’s new TV is designed differently; the screen itself is separated from the guts of the system, which are contained in a Dolby Atmos sound bar that also includes I/O ports for connectivity. Replay SHARE Mattel Aristotle Mattel Mattel’s Aristotle is like a smart baby monitor and Amazon Echo rolled into one. The smart voice-activated speaker works with a companion camera and is intended to help with tasks like soothing a crying baby, buying more diapers, encouraging kids to mind their manners, or helping them learn a foreign language. Replay SHARE Mohu Airwave Mohu While cord-cutting has improved the binge-watching experience in many ways, its Achilles heel has always been its lack of local broadcast TV offerings. Antenna maker Mohu hopes to address this with its new Airwave, a $150 wireless antenna that brings local channels to platforms like Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV, Android, and iOS. It makes live TV viewable through an app, making it possible to access in the same way you would Netflix or Hulu. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Blame VR. 1.4k Shares Share Tweet Share What's This? Acer's monster-sized Predator 21 X has a 21-inch curved display and starts at $9,000. Image: stan schroeder/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-01-06 22:12:46 UTC LAS VEGAS — Despite declining PC sales, laptops have made serious progress over the last few years. Apple's MacBook Air and Intel's Ultrabook initiative pushed PC makers to build ever thinner and lighter laptops with sturdier, premium materials like metal instead of plastic. It's been a great half decade of innovation. But if you've been paying attention to the slew of new laptop announcements at CES 2017, you'll notice a new trend taking shape: Laptops are getting bigger and heavier again, to the point where they're anything but portable. Why's this happening? Blame it on VR. SEE ALSO: This ridiculous laptop is the portable Batman command center you've always dreamed of Up until now, laptops have prioritized portability and mobility over performance. And for good reason. For most people, a laptop that doesn't break your back and lasts all day is simply more important and useful than one that can play Overwatch at "ultimate" settings.  As machines meant to be carried around from one place to another, laptop makers have focused on shredding weight and increasing battery life.  Thin and light laptops aren't going away, though. They will still make up the majority of laptops shipped, but chunkier laptops will also become popular again as more people invest in PC-based VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Chunkier laptops will also become popular again as more people invest in PC-based VR headsets. It's no secret that the Rift and Vive require a great deal of computing power. And though the minimum requirements needed to run these headsets have been reduced thanks to improved optimization techniques, if you want the best VR experience, you'll still want as much performance as possible. Which means you'll want a PC that's got a super fast processor, a powerful graphics card and lots of RAM. On a desktop tower, cramming all these parts and keeping them cool isn't nearly as much of a challenge as on a laptop. Just get a larger chassis, or add more fans or a liquid-cooling system. Fitting these components into a laptop chassis while properly managing all the heat that's emitted, however, is way more difficult. As such, it's not so much that PC makers necessarily want to sell bigger and heavier laptops, but that right now, because of the physical size of the graphics card and the cooling system, they have to go with larger designs, or risk their machines literally melting when running graphics-intensive applications like VR. Sure, big, bulky gaming laptops with discrete graphics cards have been around for ages. The difference with these new clunkers is that PC makers are taking them to the extreme. They've already conceded that their laptops need to be huge and won't win any beauty contests, and so they might as well go crazy and add all kinds of over-the-top features that normally wouldn't make the cut in this form factor. Take for example the Acer Predator 21 X laptop, which starts at $9,000. Acer could have simply built a VR-ready laptop at half the size and weight, but instead decided to go all out with a 21-inch curved display (the world's first), a friggin' full-sized mechanical keyboard and a trackpad that flips over to reveal a number pad.  Image: stan schroeder/mashable Because why not, right? If you're going to go big, you might as well go really big and out-big every other machine. Image: lili sams/mashable Same goes for Razer's Project Valerie. The company already sells the Blade Pro, a 17-inch VR-ready gaming laptop. But in a sea of VR-ready laptops, the company's probably wondering how it can differentiate its VR-ready laptop from everyone else's. For the gaming company, that might mean adding two extra 4K screens to push the laptop's total resolution to 12K. Nuts! Like all technology, the components will shrink over time. The chips and graphics cards will get smaller, and as a result the physical laptops will get thinner and lighter again. But until that happens, or self-contained VR headsets like Intel's Project Alloy become a thing, big and ugly (but powerful) gaming laptops will be the only way to experience high-end VR on the go.
