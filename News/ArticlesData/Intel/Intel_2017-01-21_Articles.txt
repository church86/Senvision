ARB_gpu_shader_int64 Lands For Intel Mesa Git Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 20 January 2017 at 09:37 PM EST. 3 Comments There's some early feature development work that's landed in Mesa Git this Friday as the initial feature development towards Mesa 17.1. Ian Romanick of Intel has landed his ARB_gpu_shader_int64 extension support. This INT64 Mesa support and the Intel driver implementation has been going on for a few months now but has gotten into shape. If the extension name isn't a big enough hint, this GL extension is about introducing 64-bit integer support for OpenGL shaders. Won't be too useful for Linux gamers, but nevertheless is an important step for having the open-source OpenGL drivers step closer to the proprietary drivers. Fetch the code from Git and this ARB_gpu_shader_int64 Intel Mesa support is for Broadwell hardware and newer. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Credit: Agam Shah More like this Intel's new computer can serve as the brains of robots Intel ships $399 Aero board to make drones, and a $249 robotics kit Intel ships Joule 550x computer, but initial units overpriced Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel is getting proficient at developing small computers. First, came its Compute Sticks and then its credit-card-shaped Compute Cards. But nothing's quite like the mysterious Euclid, which is a self-contained computer the size of a thumb designed to be the brains and eyes of a robot. More details have emerged about the computer, which was announced in August and has yet to be released. The Euclid is so small and light that it can be held like a pen. It has a built-in 3D RealSense camera, making it like a PC fused into a Microsoft Kinect. The design makes it possible to install the Euclid where the eyes of a human-like robot would be typically placed. The 3D RealSense camera will act as the eyes of a robot, capturing images in real-time and helping with movement. Euclid has motion and position sensors that can help the robot move around both indoors and outdoors. Intel demonstrated the Euclid computer in a robot moving on stage during CEO Brian Krzanich's keynote at the Intel Developer Forum in August. The Euclid Developer Kit launch page is up on the website of Mouser Electronics. Intel didn't provide a specific launch date or pricing. Once the Euclid is placed in a robot, it can be operated remotely through a mobile device or PC. The Euclid has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity to communicate with the PC. The Euclid can also "serve as a full, autonomous brain with sensing capabilities, or as a smart sensor controlled by a more powerful computer," Mouser states on its website. The computer has GPS capabilities for navigation. The Euclid presentation about RealSense technologies was delivered last year at the Roscon robotics conference. The Atom CPU provides the horsepower to process and analyze the images collected by the 3D camera. The CPU will drive a robot's movement and help it complete tasks. The ZR300 is a 1080p camera bundled with an infrared camera and an infrared laser projector. The combined features will help robots get a better sense of depth and motion, which will aid in movement. The device operates on a battery and has environmental sensors on the back. One sensor is a barometric pressure sensor. Additionally, it has a microphone and speakers, and HDMI and USB 3.0 slots. Euclid supports Linux-based Ubuntu OS and Robotics Operating System (ROS), which typically sits on top of an OS. It will also support Arduino, a software package commonly used by developers to create basic electronics.

The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's USD23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Apple Inc filed a USD1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the US government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's USD23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some USD1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at USD62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm USD854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a USD975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at USD36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts.

Apple files $1 billion lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm REUTERS - Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. By Diane Bartz and Stephen Nellis REUTERS - Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits." Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple's phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Apple sues Qualcomm for $1 billion in unpaid rebates, alleges attempted perjury, extortion Apple sues Qualcomm for $1 billion in unpaid rebates, alleges attempted perjury, extortion By Joel Hruska on January 20, 2017 at 7:32 pm Comment Apple sued Qualcomm today, alleging that the mobile chip giant owes it at least a billion dollars in unpaid rebates and agreements. Apple further states that Qualcomm “attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC [Korean FTC] in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple.” That’s a bombshell accusation, if true. The Korean FTC recently fined Qualcomm $850 million, but an accusation that Qualcomm may have deliberately attempted to pay other corporations to lie on its behalf could open Qualcomm up to criminal lawsuits and accusations of perjury. China has also fined Qualcomm for its alleged monopolistic abuses and the FTC filed a lawsuit against QC earlier this week. Apple provided Ars Technica with the following statement: For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations. Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined. To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them. Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts. Among Apple’s complaints, are allegations that it is forced to effectively double-pay Qualcomm, since Qualcomm requires Apple’s manufacturing partners to take out a license to work with Snapdragon hardware, then charges Apple again for a separate license. According to Apple, Qualcomm sweetened the deal with rebates so long as Apple maintained exclusivity — which actually sounds a fair bit like the rebate practices Intel used to artificially deny and reduce AMD’s ability to win product designs from 2002 – 2006. In this case, however, it was Intel’s modem that allowed Apple to break Qualcomm’s lock on its LTE business. This also explains why Apple used Intel in the first place, given that Intel’s modem isn’t as good as Qualcomm’s according to objective analysis. Apple’s suit alleges that Qualcomm breached its contracts, abused its monopoly power, and violated California contract law. It also claims Apple was overcharged and required to license nine separate patents that Apple does not believe it infringed upon. If this case is anything like the long-running Apple / Samsung litigation, it’ll be years before it goes to trial and years after that until a verdict and damages amount is settled — but throwing another lawsuit shines an unwelcome spotlight on its business practices and policies.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS - Apple Inc filed a US$1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's US$23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some US$1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at US$62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm US$854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a US$975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at US$36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts. - Reuters Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

The latest such behemoth is the new Maingear Drift: a sleek, sporty powerhouse that's quite small for a tower and just slim enough to fit into larger entertainment centers. The Drift's blazing performance and plethora of premium customization options make it fantastic for gamers high on cash and low on desk space, though budget shoppers should look elsewhere. Design Without looking at any logos or packaging, I knew the Drift was a Maingear PC the second I laid eyes on it. The company just has a knack for making desktops that are droolworthy tech showpieces, as made evident by the Drift's transparent glass side panel that reveals the mesmerizing maze of colored cooling tubes inside. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide I'm an especially big fan of our Drift's white-and-teal color scheme, which looks like it was custom-built for one of my favorite Overwatch characters: the bubbly, ice-slinging Mei. As with any Maingear PC, you can have the Drift painted in whichever crazy color combination you like -- including some extra-luxurious automotive paint options. MORE: The Best Gaming Desktops Available Now While the Drift looks stunning standing up, you can screw off its vertical base if you want to lay it flat under your TV. At 18.3 X 15.11 x 5.8 inches and a hefty 35 pounds, the Drift won't blend into your entertainment center as neatly as a PS4 or an Xbox One would, and it's not nearly as small as other living-room-minded PCs such as theMSI Trident and the Origin Chronos. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide Still, the Drift is about 20 percent smaller than Maingear's F131 and looks tiny next to a high-end competitor such as the Origin Millennium, making it a good middle ground for those with a decent amount of desk or shelf space. Ports and Upgradability The Drift's front-facing port layout packs all of your essentials: two USB 3.0 ports, headphone and mic jacks and a Blu-ray disc drive. In the back, you'll find four USB 3.0 ports, two USB 3.1 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, a PS/2 port for older accessories and a standard smattering of audio jacks. You'll also find two Gigabit Ethernet jacks for maximum speeds, as well as an eSATA port for external storage. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide Removing the Drift's glass side panel is as easy as removing some hand screws, though you'll probably be doing more basic maintenance than full-on upgrading due to the complex layout of tubes and wires beneath. Fortunately, the system comes with a one-year warranty in addition to lifetime labor support, so Maingear should be able to handle any major part replacement issues for you. Gaming and VR Performance Offering the latest 10-series Nvidia Titan X graphics card, our Drift churned out some of the best gaming performance you can get from a single GPU. The machine made quick work of the action-platforming of Rise of the Tomb Raider, rendering the game's gorgeous environments and detailed hair physics at 91 frames per second with graphics cranked all the way up at 1080p. The Drift faltered a bit under the same settings at 4K resolution, turning in a just-playable 29.5 fps. That's comparable to the frame rates we typically get from even the highest-end systems, the game at the highest possible settings at 4K. This rig is more than ready for high-end virtual reality, scoring a strong 11 points on Valve's SteamVR performance test. Maingear's PC had a much easier time with the slick stealth action of Hitman, running our benchmark (1080p at max settings) at a swift 140.9 fps, crushing our 83 fps gaming desktop average. The chaotic open-world action of Grand Theft Auto V was also no match for the Drift, running at a breezy 114.2 fps at 1080p with graphics maxed out. That smokes our 63 fps average. MORE: The Best Headsets for Immersive Gaming The Drift is more than ready for high-end virtual reality, scoring a strong 11 points on Valve's SteamVR performance test. That's the highest score we've seen yet, and is on a par with GTX 1080-powered machines, such as the Alienware Aurora and the Lenovo IdeaCentre Y900. Older machines with GTX 970 graphics cards tend to score closer to six. The Drift scored a 6,987 on the Fire Strike Ultra test (which measures 4K performance), trailing the Millennium (13,750) and our three-GPU Area 51 (7,531), while crushing our 3,451 gaming desktop average. Overall Performance Armed with an Intel Core i7-6950X processor, 16GB of RAM and Maingear's Redline overclocking technology, our Drift offered blazing performance across the board. Maingear's PC remained speedy no matter which combination of tasks I threw at it, even as I bounced between four Twitch streams, downloaded a game and ran a full system scan all at once. The Drift scored a 25,777 on the Geekbench 4 general performance test, trailing our Origin Millennium (Core i7-6950X, 32,035) while topping our Core i7 5820K-powered Alienware Area 51 (21,060) and our 13,346 desktop average. MORE: Our Favorite Gaming Mice for Every Genre On our spreadsheet test, Maingear's PC copied 20,000 names to addresses in 3 minutes and 15 seconds. That's quicker than the Millenium (3:01) and the Area 51 (3:50) as well as our 3:29 average. Our Drift's 512GB SSD copied about 5GB of files in a whopping 10 seconds, for an ultrafast transfer rate of 508.92 MBps. Our Origin Millennium's 512GB SSD was just a smidge faster at 565.47 MBps, while our Area 51's 256GB SSD turned in a slower 221 MBps. Configurations The Maingear Drift is a made-to-order system, meaning it’s only as expensive and over-the-top as you want it to be. Basic models start at $1,299 for an Intel Z270-based system, which features an Intel Core i5-7500 processor, 8GB of RAM, an AMD Radeon RX 460 graphics card and 1TB of storage. High-end Superstock models (which feature hand-crafted liquid cooling tubes) start at $4,099 with a Core i5-7500 CPU, 8GB RAM, a Radeon RX 480 GPU and a 1TB hard drive. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide From there, you're free to upgrade to whichever high-end components you like, including Nvidia's GTX 1080 graphics card ($565 extra), the latest Intel Core i7 processors (add $145) and any combination of high-speed storage drives. Slapping on a coat of fancy automotive paint will run you at least another $499, but there are plenty of stylish color options (including Alpine White, Sapphire Blue, and Copper Orange) for those who prefer to splurge. Maingear sent us a tricked-out $7,550 version of the Drift, which has a natural white finish on the outside with baby blue paint and white LED lights on the inside. The system is powered by an Intel Core i7 6950X processor, 16GB of RAM, a 2TB hard drive with a 512GB SSD and Nvidia's high-end Titan X graphics card. Other goodies on our luxury model include a 6X Blu-Ray drive, dual Ethernet ports and Maingear's Redline overclocking tech, which allows you to safely push the performance of the machine. Bottom Line As with all Maingear PCs, the Drift is a stunning gaming desktop aimed at those willing to pay for top performance and an exquisite custom design. It's not exactly console-size, but it won't devour too much of your desk space, and will look great in your entertainment center, provided you have the room for it. And with support for extremely fast Intel Core i7 processors, the highest-end GPUs and plenty of custom cooling options, the Drift delivers when it comes to pure horsepower. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide One of the Drift's only notable cons is its lack of multi-GPU support, which is fairly common on higher-end systems such as the Origin Millennium and Maingear's own F131. Still, the Drift's single graphics card slot keeps it smaller than both of those desktops, and you'll probably be fine with a single GPU as long as you're not powering a plethora of 4K monitors. Overall, if your budget is high and your shelf space is low, the Maingear Drift is one of the most gorgeous and customizable premium gaming PCs out there. 8/10 Quick Take Get the Maingear Drift if you're willing to shell out for a truly custom gaming PC that won't take up a ton of space. If you want to go crazy with multiple graphics cards, consider the Maingear F131 or Origin Millennium. $1299 Maingear About the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

Budget 2017: Can Arun Jaitley make you & economy happy? Click for our special Budget 2017 coverage Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government filed a lawsuit that accused the chip maker of resorting to anti competitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Military Military: The Intel 3 military takeaways from Trump inauguration speech Donald Trump, James Mattis, Melania Trump Andrew Harnik / AP President Donald Trump talks with Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis in the reviewing stand for Trump's inaugural parade on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White House in Washington, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017. President Donald Trump talks with Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis in the reviewing stand for Trump's inaugural parade on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White House in Washington, Friday, Jan. 20, 2017. (Andrew Harnik / AP) Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter In a 1,400-word inauguration speech Friday, President Donald Trump mentioned his plans for the U.S.military just a few times. But here’s what he signaled. 1. U.S. troop buildup: We have “subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.” Trump outlined his plan for a larger military in a September speech in Philadelphia. He called for an Army of 540,000 soldiers, up from 475,000 in uniform at that time. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The drawdown since the official end of the U.S. ground campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan has shrunk the Army to its smallest size since the end of World War II. Trump has outlined a 350-ship Navy, up from today’s 274. (The Navy’s long-range shipbuilding program was already working toward a fleet of 308 vessels by the next few years, and last month the sea service unveiled an upgraded plan for 355.) The new president has also called for 36 Marine Corp battalions, up from 24, and 1,200 Air Force fighter jets, an increase of more than 80 planes. To pay for this, Trump has mentioned ending the budget cap for defense spending. He also has gestured toward government cuts. “I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending. In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public,” he said in September. 2. New foreign policy?: “We've defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.” And, “We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world — but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.” Given Trump’s past criticisms of NATO, it’s possible these statements signal more of a go-it-alone policy.  In September, Trump said he will request that all NATO nations promptly “pay their bills, which many are not doing right now” and that more meet the minimum in defense spending. The now-president has also called on allies Germany, Japan and South Korea and also on Saudi Arabia to pay more “for the tremendous security we provide them.” 3. ‘Radical Islamic terrorism’ is the only enemy mentioned: “We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones — and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.” Trump didn’t say the words Russia, China or North Korea in his speech — despite Russia’s 2014 takeover of Crimea and North Korea’s recent threat to test long-range missiles that could reach the United States with nuclear weapons. As a candidate, Trump said if elected he would ask his generals for a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy the Islamic State, or ISIS. Famously, Trump has claimed to have a personal plan against ISIS that he didn’t want to reveal in order to keep the strategic upper hand.

The British Accidentally Fired A Ballistic Missile At The U.S. And It's Fine, Everything's Fine Even With A GTX 1060, Is Intel's Quad-Core Q6600 Good Enough? Logan Booker Jan 21, 2017, 11:30am ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories benchmarks computing cpus intel Share Image: Miles Bannan / Flickr PC hardware from a few years ago? Relics of another era. How about a decade old? You might as well be talking about fossilised remains. Yet, people still happily run gear such as Intel's venerable Q6600, one of the company's more overclockable quad-core chips, under the belief that it's "good enough". The benchmarks, however, tell a very different story. TechSpot's Steven Walton was curious enough to pit the Q6600 against some more modern components, including the i5-2500K, i7-6700K, i3-6100 and the discount Haswell-based Pentium G3470. All the CPUs were paired with NVIDIA's GTX 1060 or 1070 and while not the absolute top-end of the GPU market, these chips are more than sufficient to make sure the CPU is the main bottleneck. In terms of tests, Battlefield 1 was the first game off the rank. The Q6600 did not do well: The Core 2 Quad Q6600 really struggled in Battlefield 1, delivering just 26fps on average at 1080p with the GeForce GTX 1060 handling the rendering. Worse still, stuttering was a massive issue and we often saw the average frame rate cut in half as the system halted. Even overclocking the Q6600 to 3.1GHz didn't get it out of trouble as minimum frame rates still dipped into the teens. Overclocked, the Q6600 just manages to keep up with the G3470 and doesn't even come close to the other processors. The story remains the same as other titles are benchmarked, including Overwatch, Total War: Warhammer and Gears of War 4. In fact, the ~$100 G3470 starts to pull ahead in the later tests, with even the overclocked Q6600 looking incredibly sad. Are the results surprising? Not really. Considering the age difference between the chips, it'd be like comparing the Q6600 to the 200MHz Pentium. No contest, right? Although CPU technology hasn't advanced as quickly over the last decade as it did during the 90s and early 2000s, it's moved fast enough that you should still consider upgrading every five to ten years. [TechSpot] Comments munfis @munfis Jan 21, 2017, 11:42am I just did an upgrade, was going to buy a 6700 processor, but the guys at the shop held the oprder for a few days so I could get a 7700 instead. Kinda happy they did, upgrading from a 2600 is a massive difference!

Mobo isn't gonna hold on much longer though i dont think.. usb ports and shit starting to fail but when your talking about 900 dollar upgrade for 5-8fps yeahhh nahhh.

Reply 0 darylcheshire @darylcheshire Jan 22, 2017, 5:28am I'm running a 980X at 4GHz with a GTX1080 and it still kicks arse. I was recently playing Doom 2016. Soon I'd like to upgrade to a Kaby Lake. My perception of the CPUs since the 980X was that the speed upgrades were tiny increments until recently. Also now they run cooler with less power and heat. Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Jan 23, 2017, 11:30am Depends a lot on how CPU reliant the games you play are. I found WoW was more CPU sensitive than I thought. Replaced just the CPU and raids became smooth and stutter free on my previous GTX970. Some of the shooters I never saw a difference though. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Dell’s XPS 13 2-in 1 is advertised as the much-loved XPS 13 turned into a tablet. However, that’s not really the case. In order to get the tablet thinner, many of the ports have been taken off. Dell is also including mobile processors that are just updated versions of their slow Core m chips. That’s not to say that Dell created a lemon — it’s anything but that. Let’s compare the XPS 13 2-in-1 to the Surface Pro 4, the item it is trying to beat. Design The design of the XPS 13 2-in-1 is the same as the regular XPS 13. The machine still has an aluminum outside and a carbon-fiber inside. The keys are very much the same, except they may have slightly less travel. The new XPS 13 feels great in tablet mode, although one may wish it had more of a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of the predictable 16:9 one. The Surface Pro 4 has a metallic-grey magnesium finish and an adjustable kickstand. The Type Cover is optional, but something no Surface Pro 4 owner should do without. It’s lighter than the XPS 13 2-in-1, but also smaller. Screen Dell kept the same 3200 x 1800 (276 PPI) screen on the XPS 13 2-in-1, and that certainly isn’t a bad thing. A lot of people hoped for a 4K screen, but not only will the human eye not be able to tell much of a difference, but a 4K screen would eat more battery life. The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 has a gorgeous screen. [Image by Daryl Deino] The Surface Pro 4 has a 12.3-inch 2,736 x 1,824 (267 PPI) display that equals the XPS 13 display depending on your unit. Many of the early Surface Pro 4 units had problems with backlight bleed (something nobody has complained about on the XPS 13) and dead pixels. Performance For the purposes of this review, the higher-end versions of both devices are being compared. The $1,799 version of the XPS 13, has 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD, and what Intel refers to as a i7-7Y75 processor, which means it has no fan and it runs slower than the regular i7 processor. The XPS 13 2-in-1 will be fine for those who do office work. But for those who want to do heavy Photoshop work or video editing, look away. The Surface Pro 4 has a more powerful CPU than the XPS 13 2-in-1. [Image by Daryl Deino] In terms of performance, the higher-end Surface Pro 4 truly is the tablet that can replace your laptop. For just $100 more than the XPS 13, you can get a Pro 4 with the same specs, but with a high-powered Intel Core i7 processor. You will have no problem editing your 4K movies or editing selfies to make yourself look noticeably thinner. Battery life One of the reasons Dell included a lower-powered CPU was to save battery life. Although this reviewer hasn’t been able to test the battery life, others say that the battery can last up to eight hours for regular users and seven hours for power users. The same can’t be said about the Surface Pro 4. When first released, the battery life was the achilles heel of the unit. However, Microsoft has improved things with updates, and now, the battery life is below average, but not a deal breaker. The Pro 4 will last most users six hours on a single charge. Power users will have to do with four-and-a-half hours to five hours of use. Conclusion There really isn’t much competition here. Both are great laptops, but for the money you pay, the Surface Pro 4 gives the user more power and a better user experience. One can only hope that Microsoft fixes the battery life issue with the upcoming Surface Pro 5.

Australian Open 2017: Today's Schedule 10 Most Popular Enterprise Apps In Australia What To Avoid When Choosing A Name For Your Small Business Microsoft Releases 3D Debugging Tool For DirectX 12 Logan Booker Jan 21, 2017, 3:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories microsoft programming Share Image: Microsoft Any graphics programmer worth their salt is familiar with Microsoft's "PIX". No, not the photo app of the same name (by the same company, no less), but the comprehensive Direct3D debugging tool that allows a developer to break down their rendering pipeline frame by frame. The utility has now been updated for DirectX 12, but it comes with a great many caveats. As you can imagine, dissecting a 3D application as it's running — especially a high-end video game — is somewhat demanding and as a result, the new PIX requires a meaty, up-to-date machine. Here are the requirements, according to Microsoft: Windows 10 build 14393 (Anniversary Update, aka RS1) with latest updates 32 GB RAM A Direct3D 12 GPU with the latest available graphics drivers. PIX will not work correctly with older drivers! AMD driver >= 21.19.411.0 (17.1.1) Intel driver >= 15.45.10.4542 NVIDIA 970 or better with driver >= 21.21.13.7290. Note that NVIDIA’s support for GPU shader instruction disassembly requires a DLL. So, if you're just casually interested in debugging 3D games, you might want to reconsider. However, if you have a system that meets these specifications, well, there are a few more details you should know. For one, it's designed specifically for Direct3D 12, so if you were hoping to crack open an app using Direct3D 9 or 11 (we don't talk about 10), you're out of luck. It also only works with 64-bit executables, though considering the target audience, I doubt this will be a problem. Currently, the new PIX is considered a beta, so Microsoft is looking for feedback on its functionality, as well as bug reports. If you're interested, you can find more details on the MSDN blog.

Business Home LBoard Devolution of powers: Sarawak panel eager to send report to Cabinet Richard T.W. Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Apple files $1 billion lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm Reuters | January 21, 2017 Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for “modem” chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. “If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused,” Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s claims “baseless.” “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said in the statement. “We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm’s stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on “reasonable” terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a “no license, no chip” policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel’s shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm “has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time,” Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts.

Picture: Supplied The terror accused twins Brandon -Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie are expected to appear at the Johannesburg Magistrate court on Friday. The defence is opposing the state’s application for the final postponement to April as more investigations are under way. On Tuesday the state had requested the case be postponed due to new information that was being investigated The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) ,the South African Police Service (SAPS) and US authorities are set to meet by the end of March to discuss evidence uncovered in under cover operations. Arrests made by British police in the United Kingdom have also uncovered evidence connected with to the twins. The defence had argued that the state couldn’t claim they had only been speaking to foreign Intelligence since October 2016, stating that the rights of the twins were being infringed upon The defence questioned the honesty of the state saying that the had been working with foreign Intel since July 2015, the state counter arguing that by affirming that they had only been be liaising with other countries when the brothers got arrested. Due to the international nature of the matter in court Magistrate Du Plessis denied bail for the pair. The brothers were arrested on charges of conspiracy and incitement to commit the crime of terrorism as well as conspiring and attempting to commit acts associated with terrorist activities. The Thulsie brothers where arrested in July 2015 after a family member gave police a tip off of the pairs to join international terror group ISIS ,they have been detained for 6 months now. Police had raided the twins home finding hand written notes, several cell phones, documents at Thulsie twins’ house, something the defence said was unlawful only for the court to rule differently. Magistrate Du Plessis had said that the police had reasonable ground for suspicion that warranted the arrest of the twins.

Jan 20, 2017 Ara Macao is Back – But in What Form? In what can only be described as perverse fate, a week that featured news of an implosion of a mega-tourism development project, namely Puerto Azul, ends with news of a possible comeback for another, though in a different form. We are speaking of the Scarlet Macaw Hotel, Marina and golf course development along the Placencia Peninsula, near Seine Bight and Riversdale. As Placencia gets used to the influx of cruise visitors from another major tourism development – Norwegian Cruise Lines’ Harvest Caye off the coast, the developers behind Ara Macao, as it is popularly known, may be seeking to try again on a smaller scale. When it was first introduced in 2006, it garnered great support from the then government. The National Environmental Appraisal Committee had even approved its plans subject to a few conditions. But then it simply disappeared off the radar, as lead developer Paul Goguen engaged in back-and-forth litigation with the citizen’s group Placencia Citizens for Sustainable Development in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. So is Ara Macao back, and in what form? That’s what we asked leading member of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Investment, Senator Godwin Hulse, on Thursday.   Godwin Hulse Godwin Hulse, Member, Cabinet Sub-Committee on Investment “There were five pieces to that project. The latest one was to try to create almost what we could call almost an industrial zone; it’s a little different from that. And it would be to bring in – you know there’s an airstrip there, and there’s some huge unfinished buildings – I understand there was a new group that wanted to finish those, and tried to get permission; and if I can remember well, one would be to create a medical institution, a high-tech institution to do things like what Intel does in Costa Rica and that sort of thing; that was the last I heard of them.”   Reporter “But you would agree that they are embarking a new round of consultations, to spearhead some aspect of the project on Placencia?”   Godwin Hulse “I don’t know that they are embarking on that – they might be jumping the gun, because as I said, whether you do E.I.A.’s, consultation or not, that is only one-fifth of the criteria and the requirement. And I can tell you as a fact: when it came back on the table, the Investment Committee was not supportive of the concept that you would get – these people were looking for fifty years, exclusive; nobody will give anybody that kind of exclusive. To do what? That would mean you are locking out Belizeans from doing some of the same things they want to do. So that in itself made it a non-starter as well.”   Reporter “It came back on the table when?”   Godwin Hulse “About a year ago, I think.”   The developers are said to be planning a community meeting in Seine Bight next week.

You represent an America committed to the common good; an America that is never complacent about defending its freedoms; and an America that remains a steady beacon of hope for all mankind. Every action we take will be designed to ensure our military is ready to fight today and in the future. Recognizing that no nation is secure without friends, we will work with the State Department to strengthen our alliances. Further, we are devoted to gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on defense, thereby earning the trust of Congress and the American people. I am confident you will do your part. I pledge to you I’ll do my best as your Secretary. MATTIS SENDS This is a measured, decorous, and appropriate statement, but it is awesome for three reasons. Trending Trump Retreats from Immigration Hard Line, Continues Obama's Executive Amnesty | RedState Caleb Howe First, because it is an official correspondence from Gen. Mattis as our Secretary of Defense. How great is that, America? Best cabinet appointment, period. Second, he gives props to the Intel Community. This vital part of our national defense has taken a beating lately. It’s great to see him put intel right in the first sentence and bodes well for the months ahead. And third, when Secretary Mattis says that every action “will be designed to ensure our military is ready to fight today and in the future,” you better damn well believe he means it. I’m personally thrilled to see the General take office, and this was a great opening statement. Now watch his swearing-in. You can practically hear red, white, and blue eagles cheering.

Tech Silicon Valley’s Immigrant Community Anxiously Anticipates President Trump Donald Trump threatened to end high-skilled immigration to Silicon Valley. Then he took it back. Here’s how immigrants working in tech are feeling on the eve of his inauguration. Caroline O'Donovan BuzzFeed News Reporter View this image › David J. Phillip / AP ID: 10357784 Attending the same college that Google CEO Sundar Pichai went to was Nisha’s first step out of the poor neighborhood in India where she grew up. After graduating with a degree in computer science, she landed an internship at a tech company in California and, later, a job. For Nisha — not her real name; she asked to remain anonymous because the company she works for doesn’t allow employees to talk to journalists — that first job wasn’t just a gateway to a career in tech, but also to a visa, and the beginning of a permanent life in the United States. “Do I regret coming to the US?” Nisha told BuzzFeed News. “Not at all.” But now, like many high-skilled immigrants working in tech, especially those from India, Nisha finds herself in a situation far more tenuous than she anticipated when she moved to the US six years ago. Immigrants in Nisha’s position — she moved here at a time when President Barack Obama’s ambitious immigration agenda promised to resolve the bureaucratic speed bumps around high-skilled immigration — are now facing an incoming Trump administration that has threatened to crack down on legal immigration. Already in the midst of a decade-long wait for a green card, they’re wondering whether forthcoming policy decisions will make their lives in the US more difficult — or impossible. “I’ve made peace the with the fact that I probably won’t get a green card in my lifetime,” Nisha said. Currently, 65,000 visas for high-skilled workers — known as H-1Bs — are allotted each year. While engineers come from all over the world to work in the US tech industry, a particularly large number come from India. But a much smaller number of Indians are granted green cards, and this has caused a decades-long backlog in the system. Since the election, Madhuri Nemali, an immigration attorney who specializes in small businesses hiring foreign workers, has been hoping to avoid telling her clients “it’s going to get worse than it already is.” “I don’t want to have to do that,” she said. “But I’m thinking I’ll probably have to, based on the rhetoric from last year.” An engineer at Cisco who asked to remain anonymous has been waiting for a green card for five years. He’s optimistic that the recent gathering of tech CEOs at Trump Tower will mean more immigrant-friendly policies under the new administration. But even so, he plans to return to India within the next five years, where’s he’s confident that, given his résumé, he’ll find a job with a US company. Many — including Google, Apple, Facebook, Intel, and Cisco — have campuses In India now. “I don’t see a possibility unless something drastic happens with regards to green card regulations,” he said. “It’s been an excruciating process.” How Trump’s administration plans to handle immigration policy for high-skilled workers remains, on the eve of his inauguration, more or less a mystery. After declaring last year that he would “end forever” the use of high-skilled immigrant workers as cheap labor, Trump later hedged, acknowledging that we “need highly skilled people in this country.” His administration is actively considering reforms for the program, with Reuters reporting that meetings with tech CEOs have nudged the president-elect further in favor of the program. The high-skilled immigration program does have a legitimate gray market fraud problem, which regulators have recently begun to crack down on. Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa has recently reintroduced legislation that would limit skilled immigration to the US. One anonymous engineer who’s three years into his green card wait described how, for immigrants in Silicon Valley, everyday financial decisions around taxes, 401Ks, and stock options are more complicated because of the precariousness of their positions. “Everything else all along was bad — but at least it was predictably bad,” he said. Already, this engineer explained, things like becoming a startup founder are more or less off-limits to him because of what investors perceive as unnecessary risk. Now, the possibility of further job insecurity and economic stability is exacerbating those frustrations. For example, immigrants who lose their jobs have 30 days to find a new one or leave the country, a predicament that would be much worse if the economy dips and major tech companies initiate hiring freezes, as they did during the 2008 recession. “If the economy goes south, the housing market will go down as well. In a month, you might have to do a fire sale of your house because you might never be able to enter the US again to sell it,” he said. Current visa holders are hoping new regulations won’t impact immigrants who are already here. But given the current climate, they’re not rushing to encourage friends and family back home to join them. Avinash Conda, an engineer and immigration reform advocate, said he recently cautioned a cousin planning to get his master’s in the US against the idea, at least for now. “My suggestion for now is stay tight, at least for another year,” Conda said. “Let the president walk in, and see what happens — on April 1, how many applications are filed — what are the new laws being passed, and we’ll have to take it from there.” Others reported telling loved ones back home to consider getting an education in Canada, where tech companies have big offices and it’s easier to get residency. “The job opportunities aren’t as good as in the US, but are still pretty good,” said one anonymous tech worker. Nisha, the engineer who went to the same college as Google’s CEO, shares the same concerns. If the worst should happen, she’s confident her employer could move her to an office somewhere in Europe, or Canada — or even back to India. But she’s also worried about moving away from headquarters in Silicon Valley, where “all the interesting stuff that attracts people” gets done. A move like that could delay her career goals — possibly forever. “If I move back right now, it’s sort of a dead end for me,” she said. “But I grew up next to a slum in India. I’ve seen way more difficult times than anything that could possibly happen now.” Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

The Cupertino maker of AirPods says in a lawsuit [PDF] filed with the Southern California District Court on Friday that Qualcomm has for years been gouging it with excessive licensing charges as a condition of using its cellular modem chips. Apple says that Qualcomm has insisted on charging royalties for patented technology that were, in some cases, not even used in the iOS products Apple had purchased Qualcomm's chips for. The suit seeks roughly $1bn in damages. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in a statement to El Reg. "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies that contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." Apple also claims that Qualcomm withheld payments it owed as retaliation against Apple for cooperating in a probe by the Korean Fair Trade Commission that eventually led to Qualcomm being hit with an $853m fine. "Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use," Apple said. "We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty, we have no choice left but to turn to the courts." The filing comes just days after the FTC filed its own suit against Qualcomm for abuses in its licensing system. That suit included allegations that Qualcomm had been overcharging Apple and bribing the iPhone maker with lower licensing costs in exchange for an exclusive deal to provide baseband chips for its smartphones over a five-year period (Apple switched to a mix of Qualcomm and Intel baseband chips last year). Qualcomm has said it will fight the FTC's complaint. "While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple's claims are baseless," said Don Rosenberg, a Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel. "Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent [Korean] decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits." ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 57 Comments More from The Register Uh-oh!

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The World Economic Forum this year feels like an exercise in ritual self-flagellation, which — as with the old Christian practice of fasting and whipping one's own body — is supposed to purify the sinful nature of man. The sin, of course, is globalization, which everyone now seems to agree has been lopsided, inequitable, and dangerous. In fact, most of the flaws attributed to globalization are actually mistakes in national policy that can be corrected. It took a Chinese billionaire to speak frankly on this topic. Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, estimated that over the last three decades the U.S. government spent $14.2 trillion fighting 13 wars. That money could easily have been invested in America, building infrastructure and creating jobs. "You're supposed to spend money on your own people," he said. "It's not [that] the other countries steal jobs from you guys — it is your strategy." He pointed out that globalization produced massive profits for the American economy but much of that money ended up on Wall Street. "And what happened? Year 2008. The financial crisis wiped out $19.2 trillion [in the] USA alone. What if the money [was] spent on the Midwest of the United States developing the industry there?" You don't have to accept Ma's specifics and statistics to recognize the validity of his general point. Globalization created huge opportunities for growth, many of which were taken by U.S. companies. The global economy today is still pervasively dominated by large American firms; 134 of Fortune's Global 500 are American. And if you look at those in cutting-edge industries, the vast majority are American. These companies have benefited enormously by having global supply chains that can source goods and services around the world, either to lower labor costs or to be close to the markets in which they sell. Since 95 percent of the world's potential consumers live outside the United States, finding ways to sell to them will have to be a core strategy for growth, even for a country with a large domestic economy like America. Obviously globalization has large effects on national economies and societies, and it produces some significant problems. What complex phenomenon does not? But it also generates opportunities, innovation and wealth for nations that they can then use to address these problems through good national strategies. The solutions are easy to state in theory — education, skills-based training and retraining, infrastructure. But they are extremely expensive and hard to execute well. It is much easier to rail against foreigners and promise to fight them with tariffs and fines. But the cost of addressing these problems at the global level is massive. The Economist reports, in a survey on globalization, that in 2009 the Obama administration punished China with a tariff on their tires. Two years later, the cost to American consumers was $1.1 billion, or $900,000 for every job "saved." The impact of such tariffs is usually felt disproportionately by the poor and middle class because they spend a larger share of their income on imported goods — like food and clothing. That same Economist survey points to a study that calculated that, across 40 countries, if transnational trade ended, the wealthiest consumers would lose 28 percent of their purchasing power but the poorest one-tenth would lose a staggering 63 percent. Perhaps most important, the key driver that is depressing wages and eliminating jobs in the industrialized world is technology, not globalization. For example, between 1990 and 2014, U.S. automotive production increased by 19 percent, but with 240,000 fewer workers. Even when manufacturing comes back to the United States, it is high-end manufacturing. It's not just new Intel plants that have few workers anymore. Adidas has set up a new shoe factory in Germany that is run almost entirely by robots. It will open a similar one in Atlanta later this year. And the few workers in these factories tend to be highly skilled technicians and software engineers. You can't turn off technological revolutions. Nor can you stop China from growing. Tariffs on China will simply mean that production will come from some Third World country. The best approach to the world we are living in is not denial but empowerment. Countries should recognize that the global economy and the technological revolution require large, sustained national efforts to equip workers with the skills, capital and infrastructure they need to succeed. Nations should embrace an open world but only as long as they are properly armed to compete in it. And that requires smart, effective — and very expensive — national policies, not some grand reversal of globalization.

The report is titled “The SON (Self-Organizing Networks) Ecosystem: 2015 – 2030 – Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies & Forecasts” Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 01/20/2017 — SON (Self-Organizing Network) technology minimizes the lifecycle cost of running a mobile network by eliminating manual configuration of equipment at the time of deployment, right through to dynamically optimizing performance and troubleshooting during operation. This can significantly reduce the cost of the operator's services, improving the OpEx to revenue ratio. Amid growing demands for mobile broadband connectivity, mobile operators are keen to capitalize on SON to minimize rollout delays and operational expenditures associated with their ongoing LTE and HetNet deployments. Originally targeted for the RAN (Radio Access Network) segment of mobile networks, SON technology is now also utilized in the mobile core and transport network segments. Furthermore, the SON ecosystem is increasingly witnessing convergence with other technological innovations such as Big Data, predictive analytics and DPI (Deep Packet Inspection). Despite challenges relating to implementation complexities and multi-vendor interoperability, SON revenue is expected to grow to more than $4 Billion by the end of 2017, exceeding conventional mobile network optimization revenue by nearly 60%. The "SON (Self-Organizing Networks) Ecosystem: 2015 – 2030 – Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies & Forecasts" report presents an in-depth assessment of the SON and associated mobile network optimization ecosystem including key market drivers, challenges, OpEx and CapEx savings potential, use cases, SON deployment case studies, future roadmap, value chain, vendor analysis and strategies.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Business  • Markets •  Money Real Estate Legal Corporate News One News Page > Markets > Apple Sues Qualcomm For $1 Billion Apple Sues Qualcomm For $1 Billion Friday, 20 January 2017 (4 days ago) It has gone from bad to worse for mobile chipmaker Qualcom, which just days after getting sued by the US government, which accused the chipmaker of engaging in monopoly tactics over mobile phone components, was also sued this afternoon by the world's biggest company. Apple filed a $1 billion lawsuit against its supplier, accusing Qualcomm of overcharging for its chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates for chip purchases. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm demanded onerous terms for its technology and that it withheld rebates because Apple cooperated with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission, in its probe into Qualcomm licensing practice. The KFTC fined Qualcomm Inc 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) in December for what it called unfair practices in patent licensing, a decision the U.S. chipmaker said it will challenge in court. In its statement, Apple said that Qualcomm has taken "radical steps," including "withholding nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them." Apple added, "Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple also said. According to the Apple complaint, Qualcomm’s terms required Apple to pay a percentage of the average selling price of an iPhone to use Qualcomm patents and to exclusively use Qualcomm chips in iPhones from at least 2011 to 2016. Apple received what it called quarterly rebates from Qualcomm under terms of the agreement, but Qualcomm began withholding those last year after Apple met with Korean regulators, the suit says. The lawsuit is surprising in that Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and its arch nemesis, Samsung Electronics for "modem" chips that help phones connect to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40% of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Furthermore, Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Meanwhile, Qualcomm's legal problems continue to pile up. In February 2015, the company paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. In Washington on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers like Apple and to weaken competitors. For now, Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said, however sensing weakness how long until Samsung likewise attacks its key vendor demanding easier terms too? Judging by the modest reaction in QCOM's stock, the market does not see that as a likely possibility. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Bloomberg Global Business - 4 days ago< > Embed Apple Sues Qualcomm Over Patent Royalties 03:35 Jan.20 -- Apple sued Qualcomm, accusing it of monopolizing the market for chips for wireless devices and withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities.

Posted 21 Jan 2017 08:16 In its court filing, Apple said it has been overcharged "billions of dollars" by Qualcomm's "illegal scheme". (AFP/Ethan Miller) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SAN FRANCISCO: Apple on Friday (Jan 20) sued Qualcomm, accusing the California chipmaker of abusing its market power to demand unfair royalties, echoing charges filed days earlier by US antitrust regulators. Apple said in the court filing that it has been overcharged "billions of dollars" by its chipmaking partner's "illegal scheme." Apple also claimed Qualcomm owes it a billion dollars but is refusing to pay in retaliation for the iPhone maker's cooperating with South Korean antitrust regulators looking into the chipmaker's actions in that country. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in an email statement. "To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly US$1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them." The suit charges Qualcomm of building a business model on using its rights to older, legacy technology considered telecommunication industry standards to raise royalties when Apple innovates with features such as TouchID fingerprint recognition or digital wallets in mobile devices. "Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined," Apple said. ANTITRUST WOES Apple noted in the suit that Qualcomm's business practices have come under scrutiny by antitrust regulators in an array of countries for selling its smartphone chipsets only to makers agreeing to its "preferred license terms" for essential mobile telecom patents. Apple asked for a jury trial, and for damages including Qualcomm paying the company what it owes plus giving up excessive royalties it has raked in. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment. The Apple filing came three days after the US Federal Trade Commission filed suit in federal court in California claiming Qualcomm abused its market power in as part of its "unlawful maintenance of a monopoly in baseband processors," which are devices that enable cellular communications in phones and other products. Qualcomm rejected the agency's case as "significantly flawed," arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong. South Korea's anti-trust watchdog last month slapped Qualcomm with a record fine exceeding US$850 million for abusing its dominant market position as a maker of baseband chipsets used in mobile phones. ROOM FOR RIVALS Apple relies on Qualcomm for chip-based modems that enable iPhones and iPads to communicate with telecommunication networks. Apple undoubtedly knows of the antitrust tide rising against Qualcomm and would like to help provide room for rival chipmakers to flourish, perhaps letting Intel improve its position, according to analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insight and Strategies. "I think Apple is not comfortable in feeling that they have only one source and are taking this opportunity to go after Qualcomm," Moorhead said, referring to the mobile device modems. "Qualcomm is being looked at on every continent on the planet; this is probably, strategically, the right time for Apple to do this." While the legal case alleges exclusionary contracts and the idea of being overcharged for licensing, it may well be powered by Apple wanting to ramp up competition to Qualcomm so it can negotiate better deals, the analyst said. Modem chips are separate from processors that act as the brains or graphics engines for mobile devices. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Apple is asking a federal district court in Southern California to order Qualcomm to pay it nearly $1 billion that it says Qualcomm is holding back. Apple says it is owed the money, but Qualcomm is holding it back because Apple cooperated with a South Korean government investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices. The lawsuit alleges that Qualcomm charges high licensing fees to the companies that make iPhones for Apple. Those companies pass the fees on to Apple but aren't allowed to show Apple the specifics of the licensing deals, leaving Apple unsure what it is paying for. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in a statement. "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." The lawsuit comes just months after Apple began using Intel radio chips in some units of the iPhone 7. It also follows two recent legal actions by antitrust regulators against Qualcomm's licensing practices. In December, antitrust regulators in South Korea fined Qualcomm $854 million for unfair licensing practices. Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision. Then, earlier this week, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission followed with allegations that Qualcomm had engaged in anticompetitive practices by forcing some phone makers into accepting unfavorable licensing terms while giving Apple a break in exchange for exclusivity. Apple cooperated with the South Korean investigation. It alleged on Friday that Qualcomm withheld nearly $1 billion in rebates as punishment for that. In response to the FTC's lawsuit earlier this week, Qualcomm denied the charges and said the FTC's lawsuit is "significantly flawed." "Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms," it said in a statement. "The FTC’s allegation to the contrary -- the central thesis of the complaint -- is wrong." It has not commented on Apple's lawsuit.

Check out earlier installments, including  using a real human skull for the audio of Inside, the challenge of creating a VR FPS in Space Pirate Trainer, and creating believable crowds in Planet Coaster.  Who:  Louis Philippe Dion,  Audio Director at Ubisoft Montreal I’m Audio Director for Rainbow Six: Siege and have been working at Ubisoft for seven years. Prior to Siege I worked as an Audio Artist on titles like Prince of Persia and Splinter Cell. I have also worked as product manager for Ubisoft’s internal audio engine solution.   Before working in the game industry, I worked as a sound editor for several television series and films. As a hobby, I have been making music for as long as I remember and nurture my addiction to synths, guitars and basically anything that can produce sound as much as I can.   Having great interests in technical aspects of sound, I was excited to join the game industry. I felt that compared to the well-established industry of film and TV, games offered much more opportunity in innovations and technical breakthroughs. We are only starting to tap into the potential of interactive sound, real-time mixing and new positioning algorithms, I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us. What:  Dynamic sound propagation in a destructible environment There are basically three main concepts in the physics of sound propagation: Reflection, which is when a sound bounces off surfaces; Absorption, which is when a sound passes through a wall but absorbs certain frequencies along the way; and Diffraction, which is when sound travels around objects. You can hear these phenomenon in everyday sounds. Many other factors of real life come into play for localizing sound but I will focus only on the propagation side of physics and how we managed to simulate it. The main innovation on Siege was the extended use of diffraction, which is called Obstruction. By using a series of strategically placed points in the map, called Propagation Nodes, we are able to calculate the lower cost paths of a sound between the listener and the source. The cost of a propagation path depends on multiple factors, namely, the path’s length, its cumulated angles, and the penalty assigned to the destruction level of the specific Propagation Nodes impacted. For example, if a wall is intact, the Propagation Nodes inside the wall are unavailable to the algorithm (infinite penalty). If a hole is created, however, the closest Nodes will be exposed to the Propagation Path selection and will potentially let sound pass through depending on the area impacted. Then, we virtually reposition the sound to reflect the direction of the paths, instead of the actual position of the sound source, which ultimately simulates diffraction. We also use several strategies to simulate Absorption, which we call Occlusion. Depending on the source we will either play a pre-rendered simulation of the obstructed sound (e.g. footsteps on the ceiling) or play the same source in a direct path along with real-time filtering. Since the latter is more CPU intensive, it was mostly reserved to guns. Just like in real-life it is possible to hear the occluded and obstructed versions of sound at once, we combined phenomenon to give more information as to the source location. Finally for Reflection, which is essentially Reverberation in the game terms, we opted for the use of an Impulse Response Reverb Processor. This specific type of reverb “samples” the acoustics of a real room, and then plays our game sounds through it. This method is, in my opinion, light years ahead from Traditional Parametric Reverb—at least for simulation purposes. The only drawback is that due to CPU constraints we could not use it in many instances. To counter this constraint, we relied on “baking” the Reverberation on guns and playing it back on the position of the gun. This allowed the player to benefit from a positioned reverb on weapons, which provided better positional information. Why? Destructible environments were one of the great challenges of the Sound Propagation during production. It’s one thing to propagate sounds through shortest paths, but to have the level modify itself during gameplay was something that we had never done before. Not only from a rendering quality perspective, but also from a CPU performance perspective it was quite challenging. We put several nodes on all “breachable” surfaces, and these nodes stayed closed until destruction occurred. We went through many iterations on the needed granularity to find a sweet spot between precision and performance constraints. Another interesting factor is that Sound Propagation modifications are not one way: the nodes can go from closed to open, but also from open to closed. With barricades and wall reinforcements, players can modify the potential sound paths and the algorithm will re-calculate in real-time the new propagation paths solutions. These Occluders (e.g., barricades, wall reinforcements, etc.) don’t necessarily have to close those propagation nodes completely; depending on their material properties (e.g., wood, glass, concrete, etc.) they can add a certain amount of penalty for the sound to pass through them. For example, wooden barricades and metal barricades both have their own obstruction settings. So we can muffle the sounds more or less depending on the materials used. Additionally, with a high level of destruction and bullet penetration in Siege, it would have been disastrous if we would only rely on Occlusion without the presence of Obstruction. Occlusion would have been a major wall hack. For instance, as a Defender, all you would need to do is reinforce as many walls you can, and wait to hear Attackers walk by non-reinforced walls to shoot away--the Attackers would never know what hit them. We try to be as accurate as we can, but the simulation of “real life physics” adds a certain guessing-game that levels the playing field. Granted, there are some situations when it can be downright frustrating, but that’s kind of how real life is, too.  This is not to say that we are not continuously trying to improve our algorithm. We love to read posts on Reddit of players who have taken on explaining situations when they feel Sound Propagation was unfair; this is pure gold to us, and we will definitely take this into account in future improvements. Rainbow Six: Siege's Hereford map. Listening as player action With quiet and inaction being such a core part of the game, even with the relatively short round timers of 3 minutes, the primary action of the player is listening, and when we started the development process we actually thought that, from an audio perspective, the map ambiences would be a bit of a bore. Waiting inside of a suburban bedroom is not like being in the middle of a battlefield or in space, right? At that time not all gadgets, navigation, and gun sounds were plugged in, and Sound Propagation was still in its early stages. But as the pieces of the puzzle started to fall into place, we realized that we had something way better than “faked tension.” The threat you hear is real, and it’s coming for you. The restraint in using heavy ambience layers helped us to add tension as well as to give a much more space as to offer accurate information to the players. The sound propagation for the Hereford map. Special attention was put to the realism and amount of details in our Navigation Sounds to help the player gain more information simply out of listening to others navigating through the map: the weight, armor, and speed of Operators can all be determined by listening to cues in the Navigation Sounds. Gadgets deployment like breach charges, barricades, and other devices also received particular attention to make sure we gave good cues to players relying on sound to get Intel. First Person Navigation Sounds are also mixed quite loud for two important reasons: it informs the player that they are producing quite an amount of noise revealing their position, and second, it tells the player that they need to slow down if they want to hear the others.This is the basis of Siege’s sound design; if you go slowly and listen to your environment, you can gather more Intel and perform better. A close up of propagation nodes. Result From the beginning of the project the desired emotion was tension. At some point we were adding a bunch of music and artifacts to infuse more tension, but as stated earlier, the best element that we had was the sound of the other players who you could not see. So we removed all “imposed” emotion-giving sounds to focus on what really mattered: the sound created by players.  Today, in retrospect this sounds obvious, but I find that not many games refrain from using any classic tension sounds during gameplay. Keeping the experience void of artifacts, to me, gives Siege a sound print that is not only fun to listen to, but also that influences the game greatly.

These charges echo those filed days earlier by US antitrust regulators. Apple said in the court filing that it has been overcharged 'billions of dollars' by its chip-making partner's 'illegal scheme.' The company also claimed Qualcomm owes it a billion dollars, but is refusing to pay due to Apple cooperating with South Korean antitrust regulators looking into the company. In its court filing, Apple said it has been overcharged 'billions of dollars' by Qualcomm's 'illegal scheme' 'For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with,' Apple said in an email statement. 'To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them.' Qualcomm rejected Apple's claims, saying the iPhone maker 'intentionally mischaracterized' agreements as well as the value of the company's technology.

Share this article Share 'Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world... by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,' Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. 'We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court.' The suit claims Qualcomm built a business model that charges raised royalty fees every time Apple innovates with features such as TouchID fingerprint recognition or digital wallets in mobile devices. The suit claims Qualcomm built a business model that charges raised royalty fees when Apple innovates with features such as TouchID fingerprint recognition or digital wallets in mobile devices The charges say that Qualacomm believes it has the rights to charge these raised royalties by claiming legacy technology. 'Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined,' Apple said.  Apple noted that Qualcomm's business practices have come under scrutiny by antitrust regulators in many countries. The company has asked for a jury trial, and for Qualcomm to the company what it owes plus giving up excessive royalties. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment. Qualcomm rejected the agency's case as 'significantly flawed,' arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong The Apple suit came three days after the US Federal Trade Commission filed in federal court claiming Qualcomm abused its market power in as part of its 'unlawful maintenance of a monopoly in baseband processors.' Baseband processors are are devices that enable cellular communications in phones and other products. Qualcomm rejected the agency's case as 'significantly flawed,' arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong. South Korea's anti-trust watchdog last month slapped Qualcomm with a record fine exceeding $850 million for abusing its dominant market position as a maker of baseband chip-sets used in mobile phones.  Apple relies on Qualcomm for chip-based modems that enable iPhones and iPads to communicate with telecommunication networks. The company knows of the antitrust tide rising against Qualcomm and would like to help provide room for rival chip-makers to flourish, perhaps letting Intel improve its position, according to analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. 'I think Apple is not comfortable in feeling that they have only one source and are taking this opportunity to go after Qualcomm,' Moorhead said, referring to the mobile device modems. 'Qualcomm is being looked at on every continent on the planet; this is probably, strategically, the right time for Apple to do this.' While the legal case alleges exclusionary contracts and the idea of being overcharged for licensing, it may well be powered by Apple wanting to ramp up competition to Qualcomm so it can negotiate better deals, the analyst said. Modem chips are separate from processors that act as the brains or graphics engines for mobile devices.

No one likes being overcharged for the iPhone, not even Apple, so it's suing one of its biggest partners for $1 billion, alleging inflated patent prices. Qualcomm, the San Diego-based chip maker, holds the rights to cellular patents that are used to make the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. But it's getting expensive. Apple says Qualcomm charges "at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined," reports CNBC. Taking a shot at its partner, Apple adds, "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with." Here's what Qualcomm says Qualcomm, of course, doesn't see it the same way , saying, "it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless" in an official statement. It calls out Apple for snipping it at various junctures around the globe, noting, "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world." Qualcomm concludes its statement with, "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court."  It sounds like we'll have another long, drawn-out Apple legal saga, reminiscent of the Apple-Samsung court case. Side benefit? We may discover tantalizing, never-before-heard trade secrets again in the process. When the chips are down iPhone prices have gotten more expensive in the last decade, ever since the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced the original iPhone in 2007. At the same time, Apple's profits have been on a sudden downward trend, and current CEO Tim Cook's compensation even has dipped because of it. Apple is clearly pinching every penny, playing defense in its filing: "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason." It's driving home the point that the more it's charged for patents, the "more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." Qualcomm, for its part, makes most of its money off of these sort of royalties. It sells Apple GSM and CDMA-enabled iPhone 7 modem chips, primarily used in the US models, and they've proven to perform better than Intel's GSM-only modems. Whether or not this billion-dollar lawsuit sours their relationship for the iPhone 8 later this year remains to be seen.  Qualcomm also makes Android chipsets, like the Snapdragon 820 found in over 200 devices, and it has a sequel on the way: the Snapdragon 835, expected in the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8.
