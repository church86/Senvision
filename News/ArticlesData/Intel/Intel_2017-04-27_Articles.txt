Continue Reading Below Alphabet on Thursday said net profit in the latest period grew 29%, with no indications yet of an impact from a backlash that began late in the quarter from advertisers worried about their brands appearing near objectionable content online. Amazon, meanwhile, said first-quarter profit jumped 41%, marking its eighth straight quarter in the black, even as it continues to pour investment into expansion in new areas. Amazon's longest earnings streak since 2012 affirmed confidence among investors -- who had already driven its shares up 53% in the past year -- that Amazon has turned into a profit machine as well as a growth machine. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said success in its core operations is helping it expand in other areas. "The strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams," she said. Strong results from Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. provided further evidence that technology's juggernauts have nurtured businesses they helped found, such as cloud computing, e-commerce and online advertising, into full industries. Still, the industry is entering a time period of heavier investments as autonomous vehicles, drones and robots take off, which analysts warn could consume more capital resources. And the increasingly prominent position the tech giants occupy in society as well as in business exposes them to new kinds of risks, such as the broadcasting of violent episodes on Facebook Inc.'s live video tool. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT A fuller picture of the tech industry's health will come next week when Apple Inc. and Facebook report quarterly results. Amazon and Alphabet's stocks hit new highs in after-hours trading. The boost to Alphabet's market cap was about $25 billion -- equivalent to the value of Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, the mobile messaging service that went public last month. "They're becoming bigger and bigger and their growth rates are unchanged, " said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, noting that Alphabet has increased revenue in its core segment by at least 20% every quarter for seven straight years and Amazon has done the same for over four years. Google credited its growth to the strength of its advertising business on mobile phones and on its YouTube video site. It seemed to avert a crisis when advertisers discovered in recent weeks that their brands appeared alongside offensive content on YouTube. Major companies including Coca-Cola Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. pulled their ad spending from Google except for targeted search ads. That boycott didn't dent Google's growth: Advertising revenue jumped 19% in the first quarter to $21.4 billion. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, said the company had done "thousands and thousands of calls" with advertisers to address the issue, pointing to new "safeguards" to address their concerns. The impact of the protest could be felt more in the second quarter, if it picks up steam. In recent years, Google's growth engine has shifted from its traditional search advertising on desktop computers to mobile advertising, YouTube and automated ad-buying systems. The number of paid clicks on Google's ads soared 44% in the first quarter compared with the year-ago period, benefiting from rising mobile-first internet usage. Google has come to dominate the online advertising market along with Facebook. The digital giants accounted for an estimated 77% of the U.S. online advertising market in 2016, up from 72% the year before, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, analyzing data published by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. Google and Facebook captured 99% of the online ad industry's revenue growth in 2016, estimated Mr. Wieser. On balance the rest of the industry was flat. The question plaguing Amazon was whether the online retail giant could sustain its growth despite substantial spending on everything from international expansion to video content. Amazon has long plowed most of its revenue back into product development and operations, including massive warehouses to speed products to customers. In recent periods Amazon has shown some spending discipline while it expands its operations overseas, bolsters its shipping infrastructure and broadens its library of movies and shows. Analysts expect the phase to last at least through mid-2018, in part due to Amazon's promise to hire 130,000 U.S. workers during that time frame. A big piece of that spending is coming in international markets like Mexico and India, where the company is building out its Prime offerings and competing against heavily entrenched incumbents. The international business has been stuck in the red in recent quarters. That remained the case in the first quarter, as the division reported an operating loss of $481 million. Sales increased 15.6% to $11.06 billion. Amazon's financial chief, Brian Olsavsky, said the company is boosting investments in a number of areas, including in video content, its Echo personal-assistant speakers and its Prime subscription program. Amazon is also investing heavily in warehouses due to strong growth for its business fulfilling orders for sellers on its site. "We're continuing to look for things that customers love, that can grow to be large, that we think will provide strong financial returns in the long run, and that also can last for decades," Mr. Olsavsky said. One of those areas is transportation. The retail giant has also started laying the groundwork for its own shipping business to add capacity for itself, with the grander ambition of one day hauling and delivering packages for itself, other retailers and consumers, according to people familiar with the matter. In the first quarter, Amazon said it is building its first air hub in Kentucky. It is also planning to add airfreight capacity for Chinese customers. The company is leasing up to 40 planes, with 18 planes currently in service, and has more than 4,000 dedicated truck trailer hitches as it aims to move more of its goods itself. And it has rolled out delivery in as little as an hour to more than 45 cities across eight countries. Shipping costs rose 34% in the first quarter to $4.38 billion, a lower rate compared with a year ago. "The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up and we think the cost is very good," Mr. Olsavsky said. Analysts flagged one concern for Amazon in the quarter: Growth in the company's all-important Amazon Web Services division continued to shrink. The decade-old cloud-services operation, which rents computing power to a variety of startups, government agencies and other corporations, has become a major factor in Amazon's recent streak of profitability. The division is facing tougher competition from Microsoft and Google, prompting concerns about whether the growth can continue on pace -- especially amid price wars. Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business again posted torrid growth on Thursday as corporate customers adopt the service to handle larger pieces of their computing operations. Office 365, the online version of Microsoft's widely used productivity software, reported huge gains as well, as businesses increasingly subscribe to email, word-processing and spreadsheet applications that run in Microsoft's data centers. Intel posted an increase in first-quarter profit, helped by an uptick in PC demand. CEO Brian Krzanich said selling price strength across nearly every segment of the business in the quarter "demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data." --Jay Greene and Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.

VK_KHX_multiview Ready For Landing Within ANV, VK_KHX_external_memory Lands Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 28 April 2017 at 12:32 AM EDT. Add A Comment The VK_KHX_multiview extension that is important for VR games/applications is expected to soon land within Mesa Git for Intel's ANV driver. Meanwhile, the VK_KHX_external_memory extensions have landed for this open-source Intel driver. VK_KHX_multiview was introduced as an experimental Vulkan extension back during Khronos' GDC v1.0.42 update. This extension is similar to OpenGL's GL_OVR_multiview extension that was devised by Oculus for VR use-cases. More details back in Intel's Vulkan Driver Working On VK_KHX_multiview Support. On Thursday was a third version of the patches by Intel's Jason Ekstrand. With the 13 new patches, Ekstrand ready is to merge them if there are no longer any objections. Implementing VK_KHX_multiview and the related SPIR-V SPV_KHR_multiview extension is just over 500 lines of code, mostly specific to the Intel ANV driver. Meanwhile, a short time ago in Mesa Git, the VK_KHX_external_memory and VK_KHX_external_memory_capabilities and VK_KHX_external_memory_fd extensions were landed for Intel's driver as other GDC'17 Vulkan extensions.

Intel delivered record revenue for the quarter, of $14.8 billion, up from $13.7 billion a year ago. Intel is a company that loves their margins, and they were once again over 60% for the quarter, coming in at 61.8%, which is 2.5 percentage points higher year-over-year. Operating income was up 40% to $3.6 billion, and net income was up 45% to $3.0 billion, which resulted in earnings-per-share of $0.61 for the quarter, also up 45% from a year ago. This is even though Q1 2016 was 14 weeks, versus 13 weeks in 2017. Intel Q1 2017 Financial Results (GAAP) Â  Q1'2017 Q4'2016 Q1'2016 Revenue $14.8B $16.4B $13.7B Operating Income $3.6B $4.5B $2.6B Net Income $3.0B $3.6B $2.0B Gross Margin 61.8% 60.9% 59.3% Client Computing Group Revenue $7.976B -12.6% +5.7% Data Center Group Revenue $4.232B -9.34% +5.8% Internet of Things Revenue $721M -0.7% +10.8% Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group $866M +6.1% +55.5% Intel Security Group $534M -2.9% -0.6% Programmable Solutions Group $425M +1.2% +18.4% All Other Revenue $42M -35.4% -16% Intelâs Client Computing Group continued to have gains, with revenue for the quarter up 6% to $7.976 billion. Significantly for Intel, operating income for this segment jumped from $1.885 billion a year ago, to $3.031 billion this year. While weâve seen the company forced to slow down its movement to smaller processes, the current 14nm node has been well refined and the Kaby Lake processors have been solid performers. The next generation 10nm node is looking very promising though, with Intel claiming 25% better performance and 45% lower power consumption versus Kaby Lake thanks to the density improvements. The Data Center Group also had gains, with revenues up 6% year-over-year to $4.232 billion, although the growth has slowed somewhat. Operating income for the group was $1.487 billion for the quarter, down from $1.764 billion a year ago. This will be an interesting space to watch with increased competition in both the x86 and ARM space, but Intel will be releasing new Xeon chips as well with a change in branding. The Internet of Things Group continued to show gains as well, with revenue up 11% year-over-year to $721 million, and up 35% since Q1 2015, so in two years they have seen some substantial growth in this segment. Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group had the largest jump in revenue, with revenue up 55% to $866 million. However, this group also saw an operating loss increase to $129 million, compared to a $95 million loss a year ago. This should be an exciting segment to watch though with Intel bringing their Optane products to market, with both the DC P4800X SSD and Optane caching memory. If you havenât checked out those reviews yet, they are well worth the read, and 3D XPoint definitely brings some advantages even on a Gen 1 product. Intelâs Security Group is showing its final mention in their earnings, since Intelâs divestiture of the group closed on April 3, 2017, and subsequently it will fall in to the âAll Otherâ category starting next quarter. Revenue for this group was pretty flat, at $534 million, compared to $537 million a year ago. Operating income was up to $95 million though, from $85 million last year. The Programable Solutions Group, which is Intelâs FPGA segment, had a revenue increase of 18% to 425 million, and an operating income of $92 million, compared to an operating loss of $200 million a year ago. Finally, the All Other category had revenues of $42 million and an operating loss of $1.082 billion. Looking towards next quarter, Intel is forecasting revenues of $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and a gross margin around 62%, give or take a couple of points.

Training Certification Events Webinars Community Participate Q&A Forums Blogs Resources Newsletter Distributions Publications Infographics Photos Videos Jobs Eric Brown April 27, 2017 Pros and Cons of System Update and Integrity Protection Schemes patrick-ohly.png Patrick Ohly, a software engineer at Intel, discusses integrity protection schemes and system update mechanisms at the recent Embedded Linux Conference. The Linux Foundation Given the increasing malware attacks against Linux-based IoT devices, there is growing interest in integrity protection schemes, as well as system update mechanisms that support over-the-air (OTA) field upgrades. At the recent Embedded Linux Conference, Patrick Ohly, a software engineer at Intel GmbH, Germany, who works on the Yocto Project and the IoT Reference OS Kit for Intel(r) architecture, surveyed both topics and explained how they interrelate. With attacks on the rise, embedded developers need a combination of proactive hardening with integrity protection schemes and regular system updates, among other security precautions. âIntegrity protection ensures that your device only runs software that has been verified to be unmodified,â said Ohly. âBut you canât count on catching everything in advance, and there will be new vulnerabilities and attack methods, so thatâs why you need system updates.â The bulk of Ohlyâs talk explored the pros and cons of update and protection schemes available for Yocto/OpenEmbedded. Ohly is the maintainer of meta-integrity and meta-swupd -- two layers that make the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) integrity protection scheme and the Clear Linux OS swupd update mechanism available on Yocto/OE. The experience has led him to see the benefits of swupd, as well as the problems with IMA. Ohly explained the differences between block-based (swupdate, Mender.io) and file-based (swupd, OSTree) system update mechanisms. He then compared three integrity protection schemes: IMA with Extended Verification Module (EVM), or IMA/EVM, as well as whole-disk encryption with per-machine secret key, and dm-verity. Oneâs choice of system update mechanism can affect the choice of integrity protection scheme. IMA/EVM works only with the file-based swupd and OSTree while dm-verity works only with the block-based Mender.io and swupdate. Whole disk encryption, meanwhile, works with all four. Although this talk is specific to Yocto, all but these components can work with other embedded Linux environments, with the possible exception of the more Yocto-specific swupdate. Toward the end of the talk, Ohly detailed a recent project in which he took dm-verity and integrated it with whole-disk encryption into the IoT Refkit. âWe are trying to use this to extend Yocto to additional use cases,â he said. Here, we only briefly reference the project, which involves integrating LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) and finessing QEMU to properly emulate TPM. If youâre interested, the discussion begins about 33 minutes into the 51-minute talk. System update pros and cons Before comparing the system update schemes available to Yocto/OE developers, Ohly noted that âthey all have pros and cons, and in some cases, need further work.â The first decision is whether to with a block-based or file-based mechanism. Block-based schemes like swupdate and Mender.io have fixed partition sizes. This means âyou canât have an update stream that is supplied to different devices with different hard disks because they have to be partitioned the same way,â said Ohly. File-based mechanisms like swupd and OSTree âmake it easier to support a variety of devices,â he added. In addition, updating selected files instead of entire partitions is a lot faster. âSwupd in particular works really hard to do the minimal amount of work for updates,â said Ohly. The two file-based mechanisms have further differences. âOSTree creates an alternative tree using hard-linking, and then during reboot it switches over to a new root,â said Ohly. âItâs a bit more atomic than swupd, but it still needs a writable root file system.â Another point of comparison lies in partition layout. A single partition approach is the default mode for OSTree and swupd, and is supported by swupdate. Mender.io, by contrast, requires an A/B setup in which you have both a live partition and a standby partition. The A/B approach lets you override the standby partition, and after rebooting, switch to the other partition. âHaving a second partition is nice if you get file system corruption,â said Ohly. A/B partitioning is optional on swupdate, and is possible on OSTree and swupd, although it would require a lot more work, he added. Other issues concern the integration with boot process. âIf you have an A/B setup, how do you choose which partition to boot into?â said Ohly. âCan a hacker force us to boot into something we donât want?â To address this, the mechanisms that currently support A/B setup rely on the U-Boot bootloader and set U-Boot variables, which must be stored by the hardware such that an attacker cannot tamper with them. Oneâs choice of update mechanism can affect integration with an OTA update server. âIf you have many devices you might want to update a subset, which depends on detecting which devices are currently checking for an update,â said Ohly. Swupd and OSTree require that clients pull updates anonymously, so they would need additional telemetry to check update status. By comparison, Mender.io offers a dedicated update server. âThis allows you to do real device management, so you know if a device has updated,â said Ohly. Swupdate, meanwhile, supports hawkBit, which does something similar. Integrity protection pros and cons Ohly went on to compare three integrity protection schemes: IMA/EVM, whole disk encryption, and dm-verity. In a previous project with the Yocto-based Ostro Project, Ohly used IVA/EVM, which like dm-verity is now baked into the Linux kernel. He had a lot of trouble making IVA/EVM more secure, however. âI concluded that IVA/EVM is not yet ready for production,â said Ohly. When allowing to write files, thereâs an increased risk that files become unreadable after a sudden power loss. IMA relies on hashing the modified file content after writing and verifies the checksum when opening a file again. This rehashing only happens on âclose()â, which isn't called by long-running processes that keep an sqlite database open. Even when rehashing happens, the checksum and the actual data are not necessarily written to disk together.â Another problem with IMA/EVM is its lack of directory protection. âThere are known attacks because IMA/EVM doesnât protect the integrity of a directory,â said Ohly. âThat allows an attacker to remove a configuration file and replace it with a link to something unprotected. There have been patches to address this, but they have not yet been merged.â By comparison, the whole disk encryption with per-machine secret key technique âis a lot more matureâ than IMA/EVM, said Ohly. With whole disk, when a device is turned off, a malicious hacker sees only âgarbageâ in the partition, he added. âIf the intruder lacks access to the secret key and tries to modify the partition, once the device boots up again, some blocks will be completely modified, so thereâs no way to do dedicated file editing.â Whole disk encryption works great on laptops, but in the embedded realm, the scheme poses the tricky challenge of how to securely store the encryption key. âOn a laptop, the user types in something, or plugs in a USB stick, but that doesnât work in embedded,â said Ohly. Ohlyâs code for the IoT Ref Kit adds an extra layer of security for whole disk encryption by using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to store the secret key. âItâs not a perfect solution since someone still has the device with the key in their hands, but itâs a bit more secure than just dumping the key on the hard disk,â said Ohly. âWhen you combine that with the secure boot, you make it very hard for an attacker to get the key.â Finally, Ohly examined dm-verity, which was originally designed for Chrome OS, and is supported by Android. Unlike the other schemes, dm-verity wonât let you write to and modify files. The mechanism verifies the integrity of each block in a read-only partition so that any modifications immediately lead to a read error. âThe advantage of dm-verity over whole disk encryption is that you get a really specific read error saying this block is unreadable,â said Ohly. One side benefit is its ability to detect if a USB stick is corrupted. âItâs a common problem,â said Ohly. âYou flash something and it doesnât work, and it turns out to be a bit flip on the USB stick.â Finally, if youâre wondering why Ohly is wearing a Santa Claus hat, be advised that itâs rather âa genuine dwarf hat from the coal mines of the Black Forest.â The hat reminds Ohly that much of his work is based on existing open source code. âI feel like Iâm a dwarf standing on the shoulders of giants,â he said. Ohly removed the hat, however, when discussing the aspects of the IoT Refkit solution that he wrote himself. âItâs getting kind of hot in here,â he added.

 Weakness in Intel's most vital post-PC business gave Wall Street a nasty surprise Reuters Apr. 27, 2017, 7:12 PM 1,755 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel CEO Brian KrzanichDavid Becker/Getty Images Intel reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue due to an unexpected slowdown in growth at its data center business, on which the world's largest chipmaker is banking to reduce its reliance on the personal computer market. The company's shares fell nearly 4 percent to $35.97 in trading after the bell on Thursday. Revenue from Intel's higher-margin data center business rose 6 percent to $4.2 billion in the first quarter. That was less than the 9 percent jump a year-ago and the 8 percent increase in the fourth quarter. "I think the Street was looking for slightly better than that," Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Analysts were expecting revenue to increase 10 percent to about $4.4 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. The slowdown in revenue growth comes after Intel warned in February that business's margins could be hit by higher costs. However, Intel still expects the business to grow in the high single-digit percentage rate this year, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a call. Forecast raised Intel marginally raised its full-year revenue forecast, which Krzanich said was due to average selling prices across its businesses trending ahead of expectations. The Santa Clara-based company expects 2017 revenue of about $60 billion. It had earlier forecast revenue would be flat compared with 2016 revenue of $59.4 billion. Intel increased its share buyback program by $10 billion to about $15 billion and also raised its 2017 adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents to $2.85 per share, plus or minus 5 percent. The company has previously said it expects its deal to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, announced last month, to boost adjusted profit. The acquisition thrusts Intel into the forefront of the market to develop driverless systems. The deal, along with a focus on cloud computing, will also help Intel reduce its dependence on the PC market. Intel gets most of its revenue from selling chips used in PCs. Its PC business returned to growth in 2016 as demand stabilized in the second half of the year. Demand also unexpectedly edged up in the first quarter, according to research firm IDC. That helped revenue from the client computing group, as Intel calls the business, increase 6 percent to $8 billion, matching estimates. Intel's total revenue rose 8 percent to $14.80 billion, falling short of analysts' estimate of $14.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income jumped 45 percent to $2.96 billion. Excluding items, Intel earned 66 cents per share, one cent above analysts' estimate. Get the latest Intel stock price here. Read the original article on Reuters. Copyright 2017.

Investors including chip company Intel piled into Cloudera several years ago when a flood of money into private technology companies pushed valuations skyward. Cloudera said it priced its shares at $15, above its indicated range of $12 to $14, but still a far cry from the $30.92 a share that Intel paid in 2014. Cloudera will begin trading tomorrow on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CLDR." The source asked not to be named because the negotiations are confidential. Cloudera and Intel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Get Data Sheet, Fortuneâs technology newsletter. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Cloudera, like rival HortonWorks, focuses on helping corporate customers manage data through "Hadoop," an open-source software system that can sort and handle the increasingly massive amounts of data generated through the Internet and mobile devices. Intel, which took a 18% stake in Cloudera in its initial $740 million investment and subsequently bought more shares, will hold a 19.4% stake in Cloudera after its IPO. Cloudera's data business is meant to help Intel diversify away from its core business of making chips for data centers. For more about IPOs, watch: Since Intel's investment, Cloudera has had to invest heavily in marketing to help grow its revenue and has had to discount its products due to increased competition. In its fiscal year that ended January 31, Cloudera had $261 million in revenue and spent $203 million on sales and marketing. It posted a loss of $187 million for the year. Cloudera is not the first company in recent years to have gone public at a lower valuation than its private market level -- known in investment parlance as a down-round IPO. Mobile payments company Square Inc had a down round IPO in 2015 with a market capitalization of $2.9 billion, a steep discount from its private valuation of $6 billion. Its market capitalization now sits at $6.7 billion. Still, a down round IPO can be a disappointment for employees with expectations of big payouts. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, and Allen & Company are helping to lead the IPO. Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers Â© 2017 Time Inc.

Prices of Intel's chips in both desktops and laptops went up in the first quarter. That helped drive up the quarterly revenue for Client Computing Group -- which deals in PC chips -- to $8 billion, which was up 6 percent compared to the same quarter last year. But Intel's PC chips now face serious competition from AMD's new Ryzen chip, which was released last month. Ryzen chips offer competitive performance, and are priced significantly lower. AMD's fastest Ryzen 7 1800X chip -- targeted at gamers -- has eight cores and is priced at $499. A comparable chip like Intel's Core i7-6900K is priced at $1,089. Intel's fastest gaming chip is the Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition chip, which is priced at $1,723. During an earnings call on Thursday, Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich sidestepped a question on whether Ryzen had any role in the projected chip price declines. He said the market dynamics were a reason.ÃÂ  For more than a decade, AMD's cheaper processors were considered inferior to Intel's chips on performance. PC makers dropped AMD from their product lineup, but are now partnering with the chip maker on Ryzen, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "AMD is offering a competitive part, and their price is significantly lower than Intel's," McGregor said. That is attractive to PC makers, who want to increase their margins on PCs. "There's always the upper echelon that will pay anything for a PC," McGregor said. "This is more about bringing gaming systems to lower prices." It's still early to predict the full impact of Ryzen on the pricing of Intel's chips. But it's already showing up in a couple of places, like in retail stores, where prices of Intel's boxed processors were adjusted after Ryzen's arrival, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. For now, the price pressure is playing out on the premium chips. Later in the year, AMD will release chips for laptops and mainstream desktops. Low-end PCs are even more price sensitive. "Competition is always good, and Intel is certainly feeling the pressure from AMD," McCarron said. Intel could counter Ryzen by offering a newer and faster chips at the similar price compared to processors in its current lineup. Intel will release 8th Generation Core processors later this year, and those chips will be more than 10 percent faster than existing 7th Generation Core chips, also called Kaby Lake. Ryzen isn't the only reason behind Intel's projection of a decline in chip prices. The mix of Intel's chips from low-end to premium chips has slowed down. The price needs to be adjusted so more PC users move from low-end chips like Pentium to Core i5 and i7. The Future State of the CIO - A Case of âCareer Is Overâ or âCareer Is Opportunityâ?

Intel document confirms that Xeons will come in Gold and Platinum by Wayne Manion Â 11:30 AM on April 27, 2017 Rumors have circulated that Intel's next round of Xeons will shed their rather nondescript "E3" and "E5" model prefixes in favor of names based on luxurious precious metals. A document on Intel's website has confirmed that at least some upcoming chips will be branded as Xeon Gold and Xeon Platinum. The document is intended to inform customers of subtle changes to the way that markings will be inscribed on integrated heat spreaders, but it also includes a list of model numbers of as-of-yet unreleased processors. The table lists 20 different Xeon Gold 6100-series processors are listed, with clock speeds ranging from 2.0 to 3.6 GHz. Another 14 Xeon Platinum 8100-series chips are listed with the same frequency range. Core counts are not given, but according to Anandtech, the Xeon Gold chips will work in dual-socket motherboards, while Xeon Platinum processors can be used in four-socket systems. The rumor mongers at WCCFTech are reporting that the new Xeons will be available with as many as 28 cores per socket. We tried searching for some of the product codes in the list but we didn't find any useful additional details.

Intel enjoys healthy revenue and profits for Q1 2017 by Jeff Kampman Â 4:18 PM on April 27, 2017 Intel reported healthy earnings and profits for the first quarter of this year as it continues its transition away from being the company that primarily powers PCs. The company took in $14.8 billion in revenue, up 8% year-over-year, and it made $3.6 billion in operating profit, up 40 percent from this time last year. Â  Q1 2017 Q1 2016 Change Revenue $14.8 billion $13.7 billion up 8% Operating income $3.6 billion $2.6 billion up 40% Net income $3 billion $2 billlion up 45% Gross margin 61.8% 59.3% up 2.5% The PC-focused Client Computing Group took in $8 billion of Intel's total revenue pie, up 6% year-on-year. Despite a 4% fall in platform volumes (a measure of processor and chipset sales as a whole), average selling prices rose 7% from this time last year. Desktop platform volumes fell 7%, but the average selling prices for those platforms rose 2%. The company's laptop platform volumes were up 1% from this time last year, and average selling prices were up 7%. The Data Center Group took in $4.2 billion in revenue, up 6% year on year. Data center platform volumes fell by 1%, but average selling prices rose by 6%. The Internet of Things group took in $721 million in revenue, up 11% from this time last year. The Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group brought in $866 million, up 55% from the same time last year. Finally, the Programmable Solutions Group enjoyed revenue of $425 million, up 18% year-on-yearâat least before a $99 million "deferred revenue write-down in the first quarter of 2016" was accounted for. Had that write-off been considered, PSG revenue actually would have been down 7% year-on-year. For the second quarter of 2017, Intel expects revenue of $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million, which would be an 11% year-on-year increase. Based on its strong first-quarter results, Intel is revising its fiscal 2017 outlook upward by $500 million to $60 billion. Intel expects that upward revision to be carried by increases in client platform average selling prices and strength in its memory business.

On Thursday, Intel reported first-quarter results that improved from a year ago, but data-center sales missed analystsâ expectations. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: April 27, 2017 at 2:32 pm | UPDATED: April 27, 2017 at 5:25 pm SANTA CLARA â Intel on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings and sales that rose from a year ago, as the semiconductor giant said its ongoing push into more memory products shows the company is gaining ground in areas such as self-driving automobiles. However, Intelâs shares fell 4Â percent, to $35.99 in after-hours trading, as data center sales, an area where Intel has invested heavily of late, came inÂ shy of Wall Street analystsâ expectations. Related Articles Intel: Itâs time to âretireâ the IDF developers conference Biz Break: Intel says, âGoodbyeâ to the annual IDF conference Intel security costs rose after CEO, other execs got threats over diversity push McAfee spins off from Intel After the stock market closed, Intel said that for the quarter ending April 1, it earned 66 cents a share, excluding one-time items, on revenue of $14.8 billion, compared with a profit of 54 cents a share on $13.8 billion in sales during the same period a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast Intel to earn 65 cents a share on $14.8 billion in revenue. Speaking on a conference call to discuss Intelâs results, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the results showed the success the company is having âin our transformation from a PC companyâ to one thatâs more immersed in growth areas such as cloud-based technologies, artificial intelligence and self-driving automobiles. Among its individual business areas, memory chip sales showed the biggest gain, rising 55 percent from a year ago, to $866 million. Client computing, or sales for PCs and other computers, also rose 6 percent from a year ago, to $8 billion. But data center revenue, which rose 6 percent, to $4.2 billion, fell short of the $4.35 billion anticipated by Wall Street analysts covering the company. Krzanich maintained that he was upbeat about Intelâs business sales risingÂ from a year ago. Krzanich also reminded analysts that last yearâs first quarter had 14 weeks in it which gave the company more time to finalize sales than the 13 weeks that were in this yearâs first quarter. âWeâre off to a good start and executing against our priorities,â Krzanich said. That sentiment wasnât shared by all analysts that follow Intel. âIâm disappointed with the growth in the data center segment, which has significantly slowed from last yearâs results, and wonât get better with increased competition,â said Clement Thibault, of Investing.com. âIntel, while still growing, is a transitioning company.â Intel also said that for its current (second) quarter, it estimates sales of $14.4 billion, âplus or minusâ $500 million, which puts Intelâs sales forecast range between $13.9 billion and $14.9 billion. Analysts had earlier estimated Intelâs second-quarter revenue to come in at $14.34 billion.

News & Analysis Intel Boosts CapEx 20% PC ASPs bolster quarter, outlook Rick Merritt 4/27/2017 06:45 PM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. â Amid a brightening semiconductor market, Intel nudged its 2017 revenue forecast up slightly, buoyed in part by a slight rise in PC prices. It also boosted its annual capital equipment budget to $12 billion, a level it expects will continue into 2018, in part to support ramping 3D NAND and 3DXP memories. For its first quarter, the x86 giant reported revenue of $14.8 billion and net income of $3 billion, up from 8 and 45 percent last year, respectively. A 7 percent increase in PC prices drove Intelâs client group, its biggest division, to $8 billion in quarterly revenues, a 6 percent increase. Intel's data center group, which targets high-single-digit growth, turned in a 6 percent revenue rise as unit sales fell slightly ahead of the summer release of new server CPUs. Intelâs smallest units turned in its highest growth. Its flash group grew fastest at 55 percent to $866 million, followed by the former Altera FPGA group, up 18 percent to $425 million. The nascent IoT group nudged forward 11 percent to $721 million. All in all, the PC CPU maker reported progress in its slow transition to broaden its base. It lifted its annual revenue forecast by $500 million to $60 billion, which would mark a new high. Intel expects to spend $12 billion on capital equipment this year, up 20 percent. The increase is âunique, but my guess is we may have to continue it for one more year or so as we build out that memory factory, but I donât see it continuing,â beyond 2018, said Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel on a call with analysts. Krzanich did not clarify whether he meant the Dalian, China, fab where Intel is ramping 3D NAND or the Lehi, Idaho, fab where it makes 3DXP with Micron. Bob Swan, Intelâs CFO, said Intel will spend $2.5 billion in capex for memory this year. Next page: 3DXP breaks even in late 2018? Intel nudged annual revenues up $500 million to $60 billion.

Next year they have no chance to beat 14.8B in a quarter (excluding any yet to be announced acquisitions) and by 2020, in a mildly optimistic scenario, their quarterly revenue is more likely to be in the 10-12 billion range, depending on how well they do in deep learning and foundry. The yearly 20 billion in R&D+MG&A and 10-12 billion CAPEX do become unsustainable.

By: Reuters | Updated: April 28, 2017 4:12 AM Intel Corp, the worldâs largest chipmaker, reported lower-than-expected revenue for the first quarter, as its crucial data centre business missed analystsâ estimates. (Reuters) Intel Corp, the worldâs largest chipmaker, reported lower-than-expected revenue for the first quarter, as its crucial data centre business missed analystsâ estimates. Intelâs shares were down 3.4 percent at $36.15 in aftermarket trading on Thursday. Revenue from Intelâs higher-margin data centre business rose 6 percent to $4.2 billion in the quarter, missing analystsâ expectations of $4.35 billion, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The business is crucial to Intelâs move to switch focus from the personal computer market towards making chips for data centres and Internet-connected devices. While revenue at the data centre business is growing, Intel has warned that margins could be hit by higher costs, including those to update the businessâ manufacturing process. But, Intel still gets most of its revenue from selling PC chips, a business that returned to growth in 2016 due to stabilising demand in the second half of the year. Revenue from client computing, as Intel calls the business, rose 6 percent to $8 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $7.95 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Worldwide PC shipments grew marginally in the quarter, well ahead of an expected decline of 1.8 percent, according to research firm IDC. To further reduce its dependence on the PC market, Intel said last month it would buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, thrusting itself into the forefront of the fast-growing market to develop driverless systems. Until it struck the deal, Santa Clara-based Intelâs presence in the market was through investments in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems. The companyâs net income rose to $2.96 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the quarter ended April 1 from $2.05 billion, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2pr8dBB) Excluding items, Intel earned 66 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 65 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $14.80 billion from $13.70 billion, but fell marginally short of analystsâ average estimate of $14.81 billion. The company said it expects second-quarter revenue of $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.34 billion. Up to Thursdayâs close, shares of Intel had risen about 3 percent this year, underperforming the roughly 6.7 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 index. No Comments.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Intel CEO says higher-than-expected prices helped drive Q1 profit growth Dean Takahashi@deantak April 27, 2017 2:15 PM Above: Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel Image Credit: Intel IntelÂ CEO Brian Krzanich said during an earnings conference call that higher average selling prices for the first quarter drove the companyâs financial results. Earlier today, Intel reported earnings that beat analystsâ earnings for the first quarter ended March 31. Revenues for the quarter were $14.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings were $3.2 billion, or 66 cents a share. âThe first quarter marked a great start to the year,â said Krzanich. âQ1 was up 7 percent over the same period last year, a record quarter.â Krzanich said that Intel is focused on growing 2017 revenue for the data center, Internet of Things, the core PC business, memory, and field programmable gate arrays. But there are still downward pressures on the PC market. Krzanich said the company expects a mid-single-digit-percentage decline in unit total available market for the PC in 2017. The earnings come at an interesting time for the worldâs largest chip maker, which faces competition from Qualcomm in mobile, artificial intelligence from Nvidia, and core PC microprocessors from Advanced Micro Devices, which just launched its speedy Ryzen desktop processors. Krzanich said Intel has a responsibility to be âmore focused as a company.â That was one reason why Intel spun out McAfee, its security division. For the first quarter of 2017, Intel projected revenue of $14.3 billion to $15.3 billion, an improvement from $13.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts estimated Intel wouldÂ report revenue of $14.8 billion, directly in the middle of its forecast range, and analysts expected adjusted earnings would come in at 65 cents a share. âIntelÂ had a record quarter and it was driven by acquired growth with Altera and organic growth in flash memory,â said Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. âSome are concerned with data center group margins, but asÂ IntelÂ explained at their recent analyst day, that division is taking some of the early 10nm cost hit.â The company also generated approximately $3.9 billion in cash from operations, paid dividends of $1.2 billion, and used $1.2 billion to repurchase 35 million shares of stock. Intelâs stock is down 3.2 percent in after-hours trading, at about $36.25 a share. That might have to do with the second-quarter outlook, which is expected to be about $14.4 billion. Intel is targeted adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents, plus or minus 5 cents a share, for Q2. Intel recently bet big on Mobileye, spending $15 billion to by the company with self-driving car technology. Intel now has an AI division that pools together all of its expertise in that segment. The competition from AMD will be closely watched, as AMD is rolling out its Ryzen processors throughout the year, based on its advanced Zen processor architecture. Those processors are 52 percent faster on a per clock basis than the previous generation, and itâs not a simple matter for Intel to respond. Intel, however, argues that its manufacturing technology remains a couple of years ahead of its rivals, giving Intel an advantage in production costs. Intelâs Client Computing Group had Q1 revenue ofÂ $8.0 billion, up 6 percent. Data Center Group revenue was $4.2 billion, up 6 percent. Internet of Things Group revenue was $721 million, up 11 percent. And the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue was $866 million, up 55 percent. That was record revenue for the memory group, Krzanich said. Meanwhile, the Intel Security Group (which was spun out during the quarter) posted revenue of $534 million, down 1 percent. The Programmable Solutions Group revenue was $425 million, up 18 percent. Overall, Intelâs numbers still look massive. The company is targeted $60 billion in revenue in 2017, $12 billion in capital spending, and $20.5 billion in research and development. Intel closed the quarter with 106,900 employees. Intel will deliver a next-generation Skylake processor in the summer for data center solutions, Krzanich said. âWeâre off to a good start, and executing well against our priorities,â Krzanich said.

Some, like the synchronized Shooting Star drones created by Intel, are now lifting off in swarms to perform light shows in the night sky.Â  CBS News correspondent Carter Evans went behind the scenes to see what it takes to turn a dark California night into a canvas in the sky. CBS News "For Coachella we've integrated different animations with palm trees, the Ferris Wheel, which is iconic for Coachella," said Natalie Cheung, whose team at Intel has been in the drone light show business for about a year and a half. Their first aerial achievement was choreographing 100 drones to music.Â  When a drone swarm takes off, Cheung said, it's like "Just knots of pure excitement and joy! Excitement. I'm so excited to see these drones take off, and just crossing my fingers." Â  Now they can fly as many as 500 synchronized drones. To create each spectacle, a team of programmers, engineers and animators first built it on a computer. CBS News Cheung explained that they upload a pre-planned pattern to the whole fleet of drones, which they then follow in the sky. Â  "We know exactly what's going to happen to our drones at every frame and second," she said. Â  Cheung's biggest stage yet was Lady Gaga's halftime show during Super Bowl LI. An audience of 111 million watched 300 twinkling drones form a giant aerial American flag.Â  Â  Â  Drones are taking Intel in a new direction. The company normally associated with microprocessors and semiconductors is about to release its first commercial drone, the Falcon 8+.Â  Anil Nanduri, Intel's vice president of new technology, explained some of its features. "You sometimes want to take pictures from below, and this gimbal is designed so you can take 180 degrees," Nanduri said. Â  With a high-res camera and other sensors, the drone can be deployed for a variety of infrastructure inspections and that can help keep humans out of harm's way. The Shooting Star drones utilize the same autopilot technology as the Falcon 8+, except there are no humans manning a remote control for each drone. "We have this master computer that is the pilot. And that manages the whole fleet as we call it," Nanduri said. Intel worked closely with the Federal Aviation Administration to get special permission to launch a drone swarm.Â  FAA regulations require one pilot per drone, and they can only fly during daylight.Â  Intel was granted a waiver so one pilot with a laptop can control multiple drones at night, but never directly above an audience.Â  The performance team is surprisingly small. "We actually need two people: a pilot and a backup pilot," Cheung said. The backup is only in case the pilot can't make it to the event. Each drone carries just a single LED, but there are more than four billion color combinations, according to Cheung. But one of the best parts of the show is something the public doesn't get to see â the drones returning to the ground. "It's just so beautiful just to see all these stars and drones just falling down gracefully. And there's just a slight buzz around you, it's great," Cheung said. Â  What happens if the drone should fail or lose communication with the computer? They're equipped with a GPS to find their way home and land by themselves. Â  Â© 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

X Intelâs profits in first quarter rise near 45% Surge comes on back of stabilising PC market and strong data centre business about 10 hours ago Intel still gets most of its revenue from selling PC chips, a business that returned to growth in 2016 Â  Â  Â  Â  Intel, the worldâs largest chipmaker, reported a near 45 per cent rise in first-quarter profit, helped by strength in its data centre business and a stabilising personal computer market. The companyâs net income rose to $2.96 billion, or 61 cent per share, in the quarter ended April 1st from $2.05 billion, or 42 cent per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $14.80 billion from $13.70 billion. The data business is crucial to Intelâs move to switch focus from the personal computer market towards making chips for data centres and Internet connected devices. While revenue at the data centre business is growing, Intel has warned that margins could be hit by higher costs, including those to update the businessâ manufacturing process. But Intel still gets most of its revenue from selling PC chips, a business that returned to growth in 2016 due to stabilising demand in the second half of the year. Revenue from client computing, as Intel calls the business, rose 6 per cent to $8 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $7.95 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Worldwide PC shipments grew marginally in the quarter, well ahead of an expected decline of 1.8 percent, according to research firm IDC. Driverless systems To further reduce its dependence on the PC market, Intel said last month it would buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, thrusting itself into the forefront of the fast-growing market to develop driverless systems. Until it struck the deal, Santa Clara-based Intelâs presence in the market was through investments in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems. Excluding items, Intel earned 66 cent per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 65 cent. Revenue rose to $14.80 billion from $13.70 billion, but fell marginally short of analystsâ average estimate of $14.81 billion. The company said it expected second-quarter revenue of $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.34 billion. Up to Thursdayâs close, shares of Intel had risen 3 per cent this year, underperforming the roughly 6.7 per cent gain in the broader S&P 500 index. â Reuters Â  Â  Â  Topics: Intel Read More Microsoft profits up 27% on demand for cloud services Trinity College confirms money lost in cybersecurity attack Digitary goes big Down Under with universities deal Review: Is the iKettle 2.0 worth the investment?

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Intel reported earnings that beat analystsâ earnings for the first quarter ended March 31. Revenues for the quarter were $14.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings were $3.2 billion, or 66 cents a share. The earnings come at an interesting time for the worldâs largest chip maker, which faces competition from Qualcomm in mobile, artificial intelligence from Nvidia, and core PC microprocessors from Advanced Micro Devices, which just launched its speedy Ryzen desktop processors. For the first quarter of 2017, Intel projected revenue of $14.3 billion to $15.3 billion, an improvement from $13.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts estimated Intel wouldÂ report revenue of $14.8 billion, directly in the middle of its forecast range, and analysts expected adjusted earnings would come in at 65 cents a share. The company also generated approximately $3.9 billion in cash from operations, paid dividends of $1.2 billion, and used $1.2 billion to repurchase 35 million shares of stock. âThe first quarter was another record quarter, coming off a record 2016. We continued to grow our company, shipped our disruptive new Optane memory technology, and positioned Intel to lead in new areas like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving,â said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, in a statement. âThe average selling price (ASP) strength we saw across nearly every segment of the business demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data.â Intelâs stock is down 3.2 percent in after-hours trading, at about $36.25 a share. That might have to do with the second-quarter outlook, which is expected to be about $14.4 billion. Intel is targeted adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents, plus or minus 5 cents a share, for Q2. Intel recently bet big on Mobileye, spending $15 billion to buy the company with self-driving car technology. The competition from AMD will be closely watch, as AMD is rolling out its Ryzen processors throughout the year, based on its advanced Zen processor architecture. Those processors are 52 percent faster on a per clock basis than the previous generation, and itâs not a simple matter for Intel to respond. Intel, however, argues that its manufacturing technology remains a couple of years ahead of its rivals, giving Intel an advantage in production costs. Intelâs Client Computing Group had Q1 revenue ofÂ $8.0 billion, up 6 percent. Data Center Group revenue was $4.2 billion, up 6 percent. Internet of Things Group revenue was $721 million, up 11 percent. And the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue of $866 million, up 55 percent. Meanwhile, the Intel Security Group (which was spun out during the quarter) posted revenue of $534 million, down 1 percent. The Programmable Solutions Group revenue was $425 million, up 18 percent. âIn the first quarter, we achieved growth across the business and increased capital returns with a five percent dividend raise while investing for future growth,â said Bob Swan, Intel chief financial officer, in a statement. âWeâre off to a good start and raised our outlook for the year as we also look to further improve Intelâs operating efficiency.â Overall, Intelâs numbers still look massive. The company is targeting $60 billion in revenue in 2017, $12 billion in capital spending, and $20.5 billion in research and development. Intel closed the quarter with 106,900 employees.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | April 27, 2017 -- 20:26 GMT (13:26 PDT) | Topic: Processors Intel on Thursday reported first quarter results approximately in line market expectations. Even though the chipmaker posted record-setting Q1 revenues, it still fell slightly short of consensus estimates. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 66 cents a share on revenue of $14.8 billion. Wall Street was looking for earnings of 65 cents a share on revenue of $14.81 billion. Intel stressed the performance of its memory segment, which had record quarterly revenue after shipping the first Intel Optane products. "The first quarter was another record quarter, coming off a record 2016. We continued to grow our company, shipped our disruptive new Optane memory technology, and positioned Intel to lead in new areas like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving," CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement. "The ASP strength we saw across nearly every segment of the business demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data." While its memory business is growing especially quickly, Intel saw year-over-year growth in all segments except the Security Group: Client Computing Group revenue of $8.0 billion, up 6 percent Data Center Group revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6 percent Internet of Things Group revenue of $721 million, up 11 percent Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue of $866 million, up 55 percent Intel Security Group revenue of $534 million, down 1 percent Programmable Solutions Group revenue of $425 million, up 18 percent The client business is benefitting from Intel's "thoughtful segmentation strategy," Krzanich said on a conference call Thursday. That said, Intel isn't changing its expectations for the PC unit, the CEO said. The company still expects to see a mid-single digit decline in the segement for the year. Intel is in the process of transforming itself from a PC business "to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices," Krzanich said. As for the data center group, though growth was only around 6 percent for the quarter, Intel is "absolutely still committed to high single-digit growth for the year," Krzanich said. He noted that the first quarter tends to be Intel's weakest in general. Meanwhile, the data center group has solid momentum heading into the rest of the year, given that the mid-summer launch of the next-generation Skylake processor is on track. For the full 2017 fiscal year, Intel raised its outlook to earnings of $2.85 per share on revenue $60 billion. Krzanich also announced that the company is establishing a spending target of approximately 30 percent of revenues, which it expects to reach no later than 2020.

Among those reporting were chipmakers Intel (INTC), Apple (AAPL) iPhone component supplierÂ Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Microsemi (MSCC), as well as chip gear supplier KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO). Intel Intel earned 66 cents per share on sales of $14.8 billion in the first quarter, compared with 54 cents and $13.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expectedÂ earnings of 65 cents a share on sales of $14.8 billion. Intel's sales miss was due to weakness in its data center market, which has been a growth area. Intel sees Q2 adjusted EPS of 68Â cents on revenue of $14.4 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling for EPS of 64 cents and sales of $14.34 billion. Intel also raisedÂ its share buyback program. Intel shares tumbled nearly 4% inÂ after-hours action. Shares closed upÂ 1.4% to 37.43 on the stock market today, their ninth straight gain. Intel has a potential buy point of 38.55. Skyworks Solutions Skyworks, an Apple chip supplier, earned $1.45 per share excluding items on sales of $851.7 million in its fiscal second quarter, compared with $1.25 and $775.1 million in the year-ago period. Analysts expectÂ earnings of $1.40 a share on sales of $840.4 million in the March quarter. Skyworks stock sank 3%Â in after-hours trading. Shares closed up 1.1% to 104.10, at their best levels since July 2015. Microsemi Microsemi earned 91 cents per share excluding items on sales of $442.9 million in its fiscal Q2, compared with 67 cents and $444.3 million a year earlier. Analysts were expecting earnings of 91 cents a share on sales of $439.8 million. Microsemi was up a fraction in late trading. The stock closed 0.3% higher at 49.14, trading between its 50-day and 200-day lines. KLA-Tencor KLA-Tencor earned $1.62 per share excluding items on sales of $914 million in its fiscal third quarter, compared with $1.15 and $712.4 million a year earlier. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.55 a share on sales of $895.7 million. KLA-Tencor retreated 5% in late trading. The stock rose 2.8% to a new all-time high of 104.22 in the regular session. Chip-gear stocks in particular have been market leaders. Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) soared Thursday on their late Wednesday earnings reports. GoPro GoPro lost 44 cents per share excluding items on sales of $218.6 million in the first quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of 63 cents on sales of $183.5 million. Analysts expected GoPro to lose 45 cents a share on sales of $207.9 million. GoPro sees Q2 revenue of $270 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance, vs. views of $244.4 million. GoPro shares initially rose sharply late, but reversed to trade down about 1%. GoPro closed the regular session down 2.2% to 8.94. The stock has been moving sideways near recent lows for several months.

Luqman Adeniyi | @Luqman_Adeniyi 9 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Intel CEO: Improving the profitability and health of PC businessÂ Â Â  9 Hours Ago | 02:05 Intel reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations on Thursday, but revenue for the quarter and its key data center group segment was below Wall Street projections. The technology company posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of 66 cents, compared to 54 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the quarter came in slightly below expectations at $14.8 billion, against the comparable year-ago figure of $13.8 billion. Intel shares fell over 3 percent in after-hours trading. Analysts expected the company to post earnings of 65 cents a share and $14.81 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. The company reported $4.2 billion in revenue for its data center group segment, missing analyst expectations of $4.349 billion, according to FactSet. Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich said he expected lower profit margins for the data center business at an investor meeting in February. The statement came a day after Krzanich was at the White House and announced a plan to invest $7 billion in an Arizona factory that will employ 3,000 people. During Thursday's earnings conference call, Krzanich said the first quarter "tends to be the lowest quarter in general...for overall revenue and output and growth in [the data center business]." Intel has shifted its focus to the "Internet of Things" and the data center group segment, which creates chips for large computers, to move away from its reliance on the declining PC business. The company recently announced an agreement to buy Mobileye for about $15.3 billion in cash for the Israeli technology company's computer vision expertise. Krzanich told CNBC in March he expects to see self-driving cars by 2023 or 2024. "Uniting these two technologies into one platform will make it easier for lawmakers to regulate the technology," Krzanich said then. show chapters Intel CFO: On-track to capitalize on semiconductor market dynamicsÂ Â Â  10 Hours Ago | 02:51 The company exceeded revenue expectations for its "Internet of Things" segment, reporting $721 million for the quarter, an 11 percent increase year-over-year.

Intel's reported revenue for its client computing group also beat expectations at $8 billion, up 6 percent year-over-year. Analysts expected $7.95 billion in revenue for the segment, according to FactSet. The chipmaking giant also raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $2.85, increasing their 2017 projection by 5 cents. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is also facing increasing competition from companies like Advanced Micro Devices with its new slate of gaming graphics and processor chips .

Intel's shares (intc) were down 3.5% at $36.11 in aftermarket trading on Thursday. Revenue from Intel's higher-margin data center business rose 6% to $4.2 billion in the quarter, missing analysts' expectations of $4.35 billion, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The business is crucial to Intel's move to switch focus from the personal computer market towards making chips for data centers and Internet connected devices. While revenue at the data center business is growing, Intel has warned that margins could be hit by higher costs, including those to update the business' manufacturing process. But, Intel still gets most of its revenue from selling PC chips, a business that returned to growth in 2016 due to stabilizing demand in the second half of the year. Revenue from client computing, as Intel calls the business, rose 6% to $8 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $7.95 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Worldwide PC shipments grew marginally in the quarter, well ahead of an expected decline of 1.8%, according to research firm IDC. Intel also increased its share buyback program by $10 billion, bringing the amount currently available to about $15 billion, the company said. To further reduce its dependence on the PC market, Intel said last month it would buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, thrusting itself into the forefront of the fast-growing market to develop driverless systems. Until it struck the deal, Santa Clara-based Intel's presence in the market was through investments in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems. The company's net income rose to $2.96 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the quarter ended April 1 from $2.05 billion, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Excluding items, Intel earned 66 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 65 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $14.80 billion from $13.70 billion, but fell marginally short of analysts' average estimate of $14.81 billion. The company said it expects second-quarter revenue of $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.34 billion. Intel also raised its full-year revenue forecast to about $60 billion and its adjusted profit forecast to $2.85 per share, plus or minus 5%. Up to Thursday's close, shares of Intel had risen about 3% this year, underperforming the roughly 6.7% gain in the broader S&P 500 index.

Valentina Palladino - Apr 27, 2017 7:55 pm UTC reader comments 28 Share this story New products at Acer's event. Video shot and edited by Jennifer Hahn. NEW YORKâAcer's big press conference last year brought new Chromebooks for work, a new Aspire laptop, and a tablet for the elderly. This year, the company focused on machines thatÂ appeal to every level of gamer as well as those of us who want a laptop that won't break the bank. Acer announced additions to the Swift and Switch laptop families, all of which are more budget-friendly than their predecessors. The company also unveiled a whole new line of gaming laptops geared toward casual gamers plus a few new devices for the hardcore gamer that require portability as well as power. A swift gear switch A big theme of this yearâs event was building: Acer debuted a few high-end notebooks last year including the Swift 7 ultrabook and the Aspire Switch 12. This year, the company built on those laptop families with more accessible modelsâthe Swift 7 now has siblings with the Swift 1 and 3 notebooks. The Swift 1 models will likely be good options for the back to school season with their all-metal design, 14.95mm profile, and 13.3-inch FHD displays. Acer estimates the Swift 1 notebooks will get up to 10 hours of battery life, and considering they donât have many bells and whistles (no high-end GPUs, no biometrics), the devices should last at least all day. Further ReadingReview: Acerâs attempt at high-quality Ultrabook isnât quite good enough Unlike the Swift 1, the Switch 3 models support the latest Intel processors, Intel HD or Nvidia graphics, up to 512GB SSDs or 1TB HDDs, and up to 8GB of RAM. The Swift 3 is certainly the more versatile of the two affordable laptops, but both models keep a budget price tag. Both can be upgraded to include a Windows Hello-ready fingerprint sensor, and they both come with Skype for Business certifications and Acer's Blue Light Shield which helps prevent eye-strain during long periods of PC use. The Alpha Switch 12 came out last year, and now Acer isÂ expanding the Switch convertible line as well. First we have the Switch 3 two-in-ones, featuring Acerâs U-hinge design and magnetic detachable keyboard, a 12-inch FHD display, and active pen support for Windows Ink. The more expensive convertible, the Switch 5, has an auto-retracting kickstand that will move backward and adjust automatically when you press on the 12-inch display. Itâs supposed to make it easier to adjust the display without needing to touch the kickstand itself. We demoed this, and it's impossible to move the Switch 3 unless you bend the kickstandâthe Switch 5'sÂ auto-retracting kickstand smoothly moved back on the tabletÂ as we put pressure on the display. The Switch 5 has a Windows Hello-equipped fingerprint sensor on the power button (which should make logging in a one-press process) and active pen support. The Switch 5 also features Acer'sÂ fanless liquid cooling system that makes the entire system quieter than others and doesnât allow as much dust to get into the machine to disrupt its performance.

Acer Switch 3 convertible. U-shaped hinge design. Acer Switch 5 convertible. Magnetic detachable keyboard. Side ports. Active pen and hinge. Gaming for all Acer wants to capitalize on all types of gamers, including the growing number of casual gamers who donât want to spend thousands on a machine theyâll only use sporadically. So on that front, the company introduced the new Nitro line of affordable gaming laptops with the Nitro 5 notebook. This notebook wasnât available for us to demo, but the model Acer showed off during the press conference looked much like Dellâs Inspiron gaming laptops (which are also geared toward casual gamers). The Nitro 5 will support Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050/1050ti GPUs and 7th generation Intel processors, and it will feature Acerâs âcool boostâ technology, which gives the user control over RPM speeds rather than leaving it up to the machine itself. Acer estimated the Nitro 5 would be available in July, but we donât have pricing information for it yet. Further ReadingAcer Predator 21X: Hands on with a curved 21â, dual-GTX 1080 âlaptopâ However, we do know more details about new Predator laptops: the Helios 300 notebook appears to be a higher-end version of the Nitro 5, coming in 15- and 17-inch sizes, supporting Core i5 and i7 processors, up to 16GB of DDR4 RAM (and itâs upgradeable to 32GB), Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050ti and 1060, and a 1TB HDDÂ or up to 512GB SSD.Â Each model will also have one USB 3.1 Type-C port, one USB 3.0 port, two USB 2.0 ports, and an HDMI port for multiple connectivity options. But the standout Predator device at this yearâs Acer event is the Triton 700, a not-so-mammoth gaming notebook with a unique keyboard deck layout. Acer managed to make the Triton 700 just 18.9mm thick, much thinner than most gaming laptops, by using its second-generation Aero Blades inside the device. The companyâs first-generation, all-metal blades increased airflow through its devices by 15 percent, and now Acer has made them thinner and better, allowing for 35-percent increased airflow. These Aero Blades are inside the Helios 300 laptop as well. The Triton 700 has these inside its chassis, and you can actually see them: Acer placed the laptopâs see-through trackpad on top of its keys, positioning it near the hinge of the laptop. Underneath the trackpad inside the chassis are the Aero Blades that you can see moving while youâre using the device. Itâs unclear if this design trick will be as ergonomic as it is intriguing, but it does give the Triton 700 a unique design that other gaming laptops donât have. Acer Helios 300 gaming notebook.

Aero Blades can be seen under the trackpad and allow 35-percent better airflow through the device. Acer's Leap Ware fitness watch. The 15-inch Triton 700 comes with an FHD IPS display and supports 7th-generation Intel processors, Nvidia GeForce 10-series graphics, two NVMe PCIe SSDs in RAID 0 configuration, and up to 32GB of DDR4Â RAM. It'll also have a Thunderbolt 3 port that provides speeds up to 40 Gbps and support for dual 4K output, two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port, a DisplayPort, and an Ethernet port. Somewhat unexpected,Â Acer also announced a wearable today. For the past couple of years, the company developed a few Leap wristbands, and this year it debuted a full-featured fitness watch: the $139 Leap Ware. It looks quite standard with a circular case usingÂ scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass covering the 1.1-inch LCD display. There's a built-in heart rate monitor, smartphone notifications, music controls, and about five days of battery life. Acer emphasizedÂ a feature called âstamina monitoringâ on the Leap Ware, which it describes as a measurement of âhow hard youâre workingâ during exercise. It sounds like a proprietary score that uses your heart rate and other fitness metrics to estimate how much effort youâve put into a workout. The Leap Ware syncs to Acerâs Liquid Life app, where you can analyze exercise data and connect with friends. While its $139 price tag is promising (particularly since it has a built-in heart rate monitor), weâll have to fully test it to see if it offers anything special compared to the Fitbits of the world. Now for the pricing: Acer's new Swift laptops will be available in June startingÂ at $329, while the Switch convertibles will also be available in June starting at $399. The Acer Predator Helios 300 will be available in July starting at $1,199, and the Predator Triton 700 will be available in August starting at $2,999. The Leap Ware fitness watch will be available in July starting atÂ $139.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars PC GAMING Sponsored Intelâs VR director knows the future (Hint: Itâs not about headsets) VB Staff April 27, 2017 1:00 PM Image Credit: Shutterstock Presented by Intel Virtual reality (VR) is a big-buzz topic in gaming today, but a lot of questions remain about what direction the genre will take, and how it will evolve. Attendees of the upcoming GamesBeat Summit 2017 will get a highly educated perspective on VRâs future thanks to a presentation from Kim Pallister, director of the Intel Virtual Reality Center of Excellence in Oregon. The Virtual Reality Center is part of the Intel Client Computing Group, which, according to Pallister, âdrives the business of selling Intel silicon and solutions into PCs â desktop and notebook PCs â the bread-and-butter business for us.â Within that overarching mission, Pallister and his team focus on how PCs will handle VR applications, and still provide users with the best performance possible. âItâs up to us to understand what we need to be doing to these PCs over time; what we need to do to our roadmap, and to the PCs that come out, as VR becomes another usage for this very versatile platform,â Pallister explains. âPart of our role is looking at how requirements are affected,â he continues. âPart of it is working with partners like Valve, HTC and Oculus, along with others, on where their roadmaps are going â and making sure that weâre aligned. Similarly, weâre working with Microsoft on preparing for the Windows mixed-reality effort they have coming, and the PC-connected headsets that theyâre helping their partners bring to market.â Above: Intelâs Kim Pallister Image Credit: Intel Pallister adds that the Virtual Reality Center is âdoing research and development on various technologies to help move the industry forward.â That effort comes in different forms: through best-practice software techniques; sample apps and methods for getting the most out of the CPU; and improving the user experience â such as how a VR headset could be used wirelessly, so the user doesnât need to be tethered to the PC. Â  From fiction to real life The theme for GamesBeat Summit 2017 is âHow games, sci-fi, and tech create real-world magic.â Pallisterâs talk will be geared toward how VR â as well as augmented reality (AR) and mixed-reality experiences â will change in the near future, based on how hardware and software will change. Heâll also address what game developers will need to do to stay on the bleeding edge of this swiftly evolving technology, which is still in its embryonic stages. âA lot of the talk has been about this intersection between science fiction and where the VR industry is heading,â Pallister says, âSo Iâm looking at what the potential technologies are on the near-to-medium time horizon â not just from Intel, but from the industry at large â and what they might mean to the content and experiences that get developed there. Iâm also looking at what some of the challenges will be in designing those experiences â in terms of game design, and how to steer the user experience. Thereâs a pretty rich vein of conversation that can be had there. âEverybody in both the hardware and software spaces is learning as they iterate â thereâs a lot of rapid evolution â and some of these technologies will take time for people to figure out how to wield those tools in effective ways.â Â  Whoâs driving? Pallister notes that the PC does particularly well when itâs the center of a fresh, rapidly evolving category, such as VR is now. This fast pace can create a chaotic situation at times, with numerous companies and individuals driving innovation, and trying to forge their way through this somewhat uncharted territory. Out of such chaos, however, can come a sense of order â and itâs order driven not by one self-designated, perhaps restrictive authority figure, with everyone else being forced to play âfollow the leaderâ, but by discovery, progress, and a sense of community (even if thereâs ultimately competition among those community members). âEspecially in an early space like VR, one of the advantages that the PC platform brings is that itâs an open ecosystem,â Pallister says. âIn a space where nobody knows what the future holds, youâre far better off where lots of people can make different choices and different bets, and try different things, as opposed to having a single vendor that says: âWe will decide what the future is, and you will all follow us.â â But who will be the âlots of peopleâ that Pallister says will push the VR Revolution? âNot just Intel, but the players in the industry â including the vast majority of hardware and platforms players â all recognize that the developers are going to be the ones figuring out a lot of this stuff. And so the more we can give them flexibility, and give them tools to work with, the more theyâre going to help guide us on this path.â GamesBeat Summit 2017 will be held May 1â2 at the Claremont Club & Spa Hotel in Berkeley, California, and is sponsored in part by Intel.

The notebook's svelte 18.9 mm (.74 inch), 2.6kg (5.7 pound) aluminum chassis houses a 15.6-inch FHD IPS display and best-in-class computing technologies, striking just the right balance of size and performance without sacrificing thermals, features or rigidity. Â  Â  The svelte, minimalistic design combines the right balance of size, performance and features Â  The Predator Triton 700's aluminum chassis houses a 15.6-inch FHD IPS display and best-in-class technologies for a thin yet powerful, compromise-free gaming notebook. Â  Dual Acer AeroBlade 3D Fans provides advanced thermal performance allowing for its ultrathin form factor Â  Must-have gaming tech and features include powerful 7th Generation Intel Core processors, the latest NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10-Series graphics, speedy NVMe PCIe SSDs and lightning-fast Intel Thunderbolt 3. Â  To complete the package, the Triton 700 also includes a mechanical keyboard, PredatorSense software and NVIDIA G-SYNC monitor support. Â  "Building on the highly acclaimed Predator 21 X curved gaming notebook, Acer is proud to announce the new Predator Triton 700, an incredibly thin yet powerful gaming notebook," said Jerry Hou, General Manager, Consumer Notebooks, IT Products Business, Acer Inc. "Our industry-leading AeroBlade 3D Fan with metal blades provides ultimate thermal performance, which allows us to pack massive computing power inside this ultrathin form factor without compromise." Â  As the first of the new ultrathin Predator Triton gaming notebook series, its understated black chassis features a minimalist design, with straight contours and angular front corners.

Â  Of course, no gaming notebook is complete without a mechanical keyboard, which delivers a satisfying typing experience and fast, accurate response times. The keys are RGB backlit and can be individually programmed. Â  PredatorSense software enables gamers to control and customize the Predator Triton 700's vitals from one central interface, including lighting, hotkeys, fan control and general system monitoring.

It was the first time Alibaba topped the local ranking for patent filings by foreign companies. The number of its application jumped 879 percent from the same period last year, the ministryâs data showed. Intel secured second place with 159 patent filings for last quarter, followed by Qualcomm Incâs 144, the data showed. âIt reflects Alibabaâs aggressive efforts to bolster its presence in the Taiwanese market,â Intellectual Property Office Director-General Hong Shu-min (æ´ªæ·æ) told a news conference. Alibabaâs patent applications centered on technologies that involve Internet transactions, such as identification recognition, image and voice recognition, data processing and storage, and protection from cyberattacks, Hong said. Taiwanâs Allpay Electronics Co (æ­ä»å¯¶) only filed two applications last quarter, while PChome Online Inc (ç¶²è·¯å®¶åº­), the nationâs largest online shopping Web site operator, did not file any last quarter, the ministryâs data showed. âTaiwanese e-commerce operators are less aggressive in terms of building patent walls,â Hong said, adding that it also suggests the pace of Taiwanese operatorsâ technological development is slower than Alibabaâs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, å°ç©é») beat out Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (é´»æµ·ç²¾å¯) as the top Taiwanese company with the most patent applications in the quarter for a second consecutive quarter, the data showed. TSMCâs 132 applications were followed by MediaTek Incâs (è¯ç¼ç§) 83 and Hon Haiâs 78, the data showed. Hon Haiâs patent filings used to center on electronics components, but last quarter there was a wide range of technologies in various fields, such as smart home appliances, camera lenses, stylus, robots and artificial intelligence, Hong said.

Both new Acer Switch 2-in-1 notebooks can be used with an Acer Active Pen[1] on the touch screen to sketch, take notes or annotate documents or photos with Windows Ink. The Acer Switch 5 builds on the industry-leading innovations of its predecessor, the Switch Alpha 12, providing a fanless, quiet experience through Acer LiquidLoopâ¢ cooling, and excellent performance with up to 7th Generation IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ i7 processors. Acerâs patented auto-retracting kickstand allows for easy one-handed adjustments to the viewing angle. It also supports Windows Hello with a fingerprint reader for fast and secure access. The Acer Switch 3 features a 2-in-1 design that is well-balanced with a large 12.2-inch display, Intel processors and a quiet, fanless design. âCustomers have embraced the flexibility of 2-in-1 designs to help them get more done throughout the day in both notebook or tablet modes,â said James Lin, General Manger, Commercial & Detachable Notebooks, IT Products Business, Acer Inc. âAcerâs Switch line is now able to reach more customers, whether they are looking for something that provides the latest in performance and features, or if they need a more accessible option for studies, work and play.â Fanless Switch 5 is Performance-Minded, Quiet, and Reliable The Switch 5 is Acerâs first 2-in-1 to be offered with 7th Generation IntelÂ® CoreÂ® i7 and i5 processors to deliver the top-rated performance needed for serious tasks, presentations and entertainment on the go.

Incorporated 27 Apr, 2017, 12:00 ET Share this article The svelte, minimalistic design combines the right balance of size, performance and features The Predator Triton 700's aluminum chassis houses a 15.6-inch FHD IPS display and best-in-class technologies for a thin yet powerful, compromise-free gaming notebook. Dual Acer AeroBladeâ¢ 3D Fans provides advanced thermal performance allowing for its ultrathin form factor Must-have gaming tech and features include powerful 7th Generation IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ processors, the latest NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® GTX 10-Series graphics, speedy NVMe PCIe SSDs and lightning-fast IntelÂ® Thunderbolt 3. To complete the package, the Triton 700 also includes a mechanical keyboard, PredatorSense software and NVIDIA G-SYNCâ¢ monitor support. NEW YORK, April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --Â At Acer's next@acer global press conference in New York today, the company unveiled the powerful and thin Predator Triton 700 gaming notebook. The notebook's svelte 18.9 mm (.74 inch), 2.6kg (5.7 pound) aluminum chassis houses a 15.6-inch FHD IPS display and best-in-class computing technologies, striking just the right balance of size and performance without sacrificing thermals, features or rigidity. "Building on the highly acclaimed Predator 21 X curved gaming notebook, Acer is proud to announce the new Predator Triton 700, an incredibly thin yet powerful gaming notebook," said Jerry Hou, General Manager, Consumer Notebooks, IT Products Business, Acer Inc. "Our industry-leading AeroBlade 3D Fan with metal blades provides ultimate thermal performance, which allows us to pack massive computing power inside this ultrathin form factor without compromise." As the first of the new ultrathin Predator Triton gaming notebook series, its understated black chassis features a minimalist design, with straight contours and angular front corners. A large CorningÂ® GorillaÂ® Glass plate above the keyboard serves as a window into the notebook's cooling system, showcasing the AeroBladeâ¢ 3D Fan and five heat pipes, and also functions as a touchpad. Powering the beast within is a standard-voltage 7th Generation IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ processor, latest high-performance NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® 10-Series graphics, two NVMe PCIe[1] SSDs in RAID 0 configuration and up to 32GB of DDR4 2400MHz memory.Â  "Acer is driving some incredible new products for the gaming and VR-ready category and Intel is excited to work together to push what's possible on the PC platform," said Frank Soqui, General Manager of the Virtual Reality and Gaming Group at Intel Corporation. "It's amazing what can be done with the mobile form factor these days not just at the high end but also for emerging VR in the mainstreamÂ - powered by our 7th Generation Intel Core High Performance processors." For a truly immersive gaming experience, the VR-ready Predator Triton 700 offers bright, vibrant visuals on a 15.6-inch FHD IPS display with NVIDIAÂ® G-SYNCâ¢ support for connecting to an external monitor. Â Acer TrueHarmonyâ¢ deliver immersive audio with crisp, rich acoustics, whileÂ  Skype for Business Certification ensures conversations are clear and lag-free. Rounding out the notebook's powerful features are Killer DoubleShot Pro networking and Thunderboltâ¢ 3 connectivity, which provides speeds up to 40 Gbps and supports dual 4K video output. The Predator Triton 700 also includes two USB 3.0 ports (featuring power-off USB charging), one USB 2.0 port, an HDMI 2.0 port, one DisplayPort connector and a Gigabit Ethernet port for those preferring a hard-wired connection. Networking is powered by Killer DoubleShotâ¢ Pro technology, which picks the fastest network connection (Ethernet or Wireless) and sends all high priority traffic over that interface, while standard traffic is sent over the other. Of course, no gaming notebook is complete without a mechanical keyboard, which delivers a satisfying typing experience and fast, accurate response times. The keys are RGB backlit and can be individually programmed. PredatorSense software enables gamers to control and customize the Predator Triton 700's vitals from one central interface, including lighting, hotkeys, fan control and general system monitoring. The Triton's dual fan system is powered by Acer's proprietary AeroBladeâ¢ 3D Fans with ultra-thin metal blades to keep the device running nice and cool, even when the action heats up.

And INTC stock, which has declined 2.5% in three months, is poised for a breakout north of $45 per share in the quarters ahead. Source: Shutterstock A Look Inside Intel Intel CEO Brian Krzanich â in his fifth year at the helm â seems intent on putting Intelâs cash to use. The companyâs $15.3 billion acquisition of Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) was the most recent example. This deal follows a $16.7 billion acquisition for Altera back in 2015. All told, Intel is now in the driverâs seat with autonomous vehicles, thanks to Mobileye, which will allow it to better compete with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Whatâs more, the company is no longer on the outside looking when it comes to smartphones. Aside from winning chip placement in Apple Inc.âs (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 and possibly future iPhones, Intel continues its push in the realm of Internet of Things and in the data center market. Krzanich, who has found ways to get Intelâs top line growing again, has shown to have a good pulse on what the company needs. Heâs done a solid job managing both Intelâs growth and the companyâs costs. From my vantage point, these factors make INTC stock, which pays a 3% yield, a no-brainer buy (to steal a phrase from billionaire investor Carl Icahn). And the companyâs earnings results Thursday, combined with solid guidance could be the catalyst to send INTC stock higher. For the quarter that ended March, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is expected to earn 65 cents per share on revenue of $14.81 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company earned 54 cents per share on $13.8 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending in December, EPS is expected to rise 3% year over year to $2.80 per share, while full-year revenue of $59.93 billion would rise 0.8% year over year. Beyond the revenue and EPS numbers, analysts will also focus on the extent to which the Data Center Group (DCG) segment, which contains server/networking, can offset the any pressure Intel might face this quarter in Client Computing Group, which contains its PC and mobile processor business. Bottom Line for INTC Stock Ahead of Thursdayâs result, INTC stock has risen just 2% year to date, trailing the 6% rise in the S&P 500 index, suggesting thereâs plenty of pessimism that the company, which has beaten analysts estimates on both the top and bottom lines in two straight quarters, will do so again. But with INTC stock priced at just 13 times fiscal 2017 estimates of the $2.80 per share, compared to a an 18 P/E for the S&P 500 index, these share should reach $45 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering 22% returns. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus didÂ not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Both new Acer Switch 2-in-1 notebooks can be used with an Acer Active Pen[1] on the touch screen to sketch, take notes or annotate documents or photos with Windows Ink. The Acer Switch 5 builds on the industry-leading innovations of its predecessor, the Switch Alpha 12, providing a fanless, quiet experience through Acer LiquidLoopâ¢ cooling, and excellent performance with up to 7th Generation IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ i7 processors. Acer's patented auto-retracting kickstand allows for easy one-handed adjustments to the viewing angle. It also supports Windows Hello with a fingerprint reader for fast and secure access. The Acer Switch 3 features a 2-in-1 design that is well-balanced with a large 12.2-inch display, Intel processors and a quiet, fanless design. "Customers have embraced the flexibility of 2-in-1 designs to help them get more done throughout the day in both notebook or tablet modes," said James Lin, General Manger, Commercial & Detachable Notebooks, IT Products Business, Acer Inc. "Acer's Switch line is now able to reach more customers, whether they are looking for something that provides the latest in performance and features, or if they need a more accessible option for studies, work and play." Fanless Switch 5 is Performance-Minded, Quiet, and Reliable The Switch 5 is Acer's first 2-in-1 to be offered with 7th Generation IntelÂ® CoreÂ® i7 and i5 processors to deliver the top-rated performance needed for serious tasks, presentations and entertainment on the go.

With Acer's patented auto-retracting kickstand, the Switch 5's viewing angle can be easily adjusted one-handedly, providing added convenience in any scenario. Also, the Switch 5 uses Acer's proprietary LiquidLoopâ¢ fanless cooling system to keep it running efficiently without fan noise, making it ideal for shared spaces such as meetings and open offices. Plus, the LiquidLoop cooling system doesn't require venting that can compromise reliability due to airflow issues and dust accumulation. The fanless design supports powerful 7th Generation Intel Core processors to deliver excellent performance and day-to-night 10.5-hour battery life[2]. "New, innovative, 2-in-1 PC designs continue to drive category growth," said Chris Walker, Vice President, Client Computing Group at Intel Corporation.

The Acer Switch 3 has won a Red Dot Award: Product Design 2017, one of the most prestigious product design awards. Versatile 2-in-1 Design is Sturdy, Comes with Attachable Keyboard Both the Acer Switch 5 and Acer Switch 3 come with an attachable keyboard that snaps on with ultra-secure magnets and can be adjusted to an ergonomic angle for customer preference. The Switch 5's keyboard is backlit for added convenience while working in darker environments.

The large trackpad supports convenient and intuitive navigation with Precision Touchpads supporting Windows 10 gestures to provide a smooth and responsive experience. The versatile and stable U-shaped kickstand holds up the display and can be adjusted fluidly to any angle up to 165 degrees. The anti-slip design holds the display upright when customers touch or write on the display. Plus, the Switch 5 can be adjusted effortlessly with a single hand thanks to the auto-retracting kickstand. Both systems work with the Acer Active Pen[1], which enables accurate and detailed direct-to-screen digital ink input for a natural pen-on-paper experience that's perfect for notetaking, sketching and capturing ideas and taking advantage of Windows Ink.

Everything You Need to Know by Marshall Honorof Apr 27, 2017, 7:25 AM Broadcasting photos, videos, music and other media from your mobile device or PC to your TV need not be a laborious process, fraught with wires and extra peripherals. Miracast lets you beam whatever is on your device's screen right to a television, and there's a good chance that the devices you already own have this technology built in. What Is Miracast? Miracast is a screen-mirroring protocol that lets you broadcast anything from an Android device or recent Intel computer to your TV. Whatever you see on the small screen will appear on the big screen. If everything syncs up properly, there's almost no lag, making it ideal for watching videos or using productivity software, although it's not quite reliable enough to run most games. Phones and tablets with Android 4.2 Jelly Bean or later have access to Miracast, as do most modern Windows PCs with Intel chips. While not every single Android device or Intel computer has the ability to screen mirror via Miracast, the odds are in your favor if your system is about four years old or newer. The Wi-Fi Alliance has an official list of all Miracast source devices. NOTE:Â To learn how to use Miracast, seeÂ How to Use Miracast and WiDi. Which devices use Miracast? As for receivers, many smart TVs have Miracast functionality built-in. Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices support Miracast, as do the Android TV devices and a handful of other set-top boxes and streaming sticks. You can find a full list of receivers at the Wi-Fi Alliance website. Tom's Guide has tested many Miracast receivers, but most are not worth extensive write-ups; they either work well, or they don't. Unlike set-top boxes, Miracast dongles rarely have navigable operating systems or extra features. They are simply receivers that screen-mirror a compatible source device. With that in mind, our top recommendation for a standalone Miracast receiver is the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Review $59.95 Amazon The Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter could not possibly be simpler: Just plug it into your TV and cast the screen from your Android or Windows 8 device. This gadget performed extremely well with a variety of Android smartphones and tablets as well as Windows PCs. Mirroring video, audio and productivity software was smooth and lag-free, no matter the media. Although the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter won't appeal to people who want a device with its own operating system, like a Roku or Amazon Fire TV, those who just just want to mirror their screens, plain and simple, should absolutely check it out. How we tested We review all the major devices with mirroring capabilities (usually as one part of a larger feature set) and test each by attaching it to a television and connecting (or trying to connect) using a variety of recent and popular smartphones, laptops and tablets. Our tests consist of mirroring videos (both from services like Netflix and a device's internal storage), productivity software, and a video game. The exact videos and programs vary from device to device, since we try to stream what's popular at the time of testing. MORE:Â Best Streaming Video Service Between Miracast sources and receivers, there are thousands of potential device combinations. Add in factors like individual Wi-Fi networks and broadband speeds, and Miracast is, at best, an unpredictable technology. Still, there's a good chance that you already own a device with Miracast capabilities, so if screen mirroring sounds like it could be useful to you, try it out.

The names were published by Intel in a PCN, or Product Change Notification, which makes it likely that this was an accidental disclosure. In the PCN, it details that LGA3647 CPUs (which covers Xeon Phi processors and the upcoming Skylake Xeons) will have an arrow indicating which way processors should be oriented in the socket. It seems like an arbitrary PCN, just printing an arrow on a heat spreader, which makes this published list somewhat unexpected. But these names show the key parts of the Purley platforms for servers. One of the poorly kept secrets in the industry over the last few weeks is that Intel is changing the nomenclature of its Xeon CPUs going forward. This will be a difficult change to explain, given that users are so familiar with the previous naming system, and the translation between old and new is not a simple one-to-one mapping. Skylake-SP thus introduces the new Xeon Gold and Xeon Platinum lineups for different markets of servers. We expect all these CPUs to be on LGA3647, given that the PCN seems to suggest that this singular print marking on the heatspreader was not on this socket design before. Unfortunately, the published list does not have full CPU information, but we do get names and frequencies of 34 Skylake-SPÂ processors (see details below)Â that will belong to the Xeon Gold and Xeon Platinum lineups, as well as the fact that these processors are designated with the H0 stepping. We might not see all these processors at launch (which at this time has still not officially been announced), and we expectÂ Intel to expand the Xeon Gold/Platinum family with new models over the several quarters following the launch. Based on the document, the initial Xeon Gold family will consist of 20 processors featuring 5000- and 6000-series model numbers. The Xeon Platinum lineup will feature 14 chips belonging to the 8000-series. Basic Specifications of Intel Xeon Gold and Platinum CPUs Model Freq.

Instead of E5 and E7, Intel will call its CPUs for 2P and 4P/MP servers Xeon Gold and Xeon Platinum. Moreover, the feature-sets of chips aimed at different kinds of servers will also be different, just like today. The upcoming Xeon Gold CPUs will work in 2P configurations and will thus replace the existing Xeon E5-series. Meanwhile, it is logical to assume then the replacement for the Xeon E7 will be called the Xeon Platinum, and apart from higher maximum core count will also support various additional capabilities, including RAS features. We suspect that there will be more names than Gold and Platinum coming to market to cover other aspects of Intel's product stack. In the processor stack above, we also get T and M processors in the mix. T processors have historically been lower power processors, and this is likely still the case given that the T processors have lower frequencies than most of the rest of the CPUs. Some CPUs, like the Xeon Gold 6130 and 6130T, are at 2.0 GHz for both: this is likely relating to different turbo frequencies, but also the T product is binned for lower power. The M processors are somewhat of a mystery, as we've never had M on a processor before, except in mobile. Speculating a bit on our part, this could be a reference to MCDRAM, which is a feature we see on Xeon Phi processors. Although to be clear, we have nothing to suggest that Intel will be including MCDRAM on these parts, as the Xeon CPU die itself may be big and the MCDRAM silicon is also relatively sizeable. We suspect that the M processors will have a given feature or features in common, which might come at an extra expense in the final price tag. In previous generations, Intel typically creates three different core designs for it's latest Xeons: a low core count (LCC), medium/high core count (MCC/HCC, depending on the document), and an extreme core count (XCC) version. The XCC version has the highest amount of cores, the most cache, and costs the most, but typically the per-core frequency is low. Intel sometimes offers the XCC in a small core count configuration, but with a large cache, and something like the Xeon Platinum 8156 at 3.6 GHz most likely fits that description. One of the things that should seem obvious is that the naming of each processor is not linear with clock frequency. For example, the Gold 6150 runs at 2.7 GHz base, but the Gold 6152 runs at 2.1 GHz base. Using that fourth digit extensively means that we hope Intel has a strong and obvious way to describe which part of the CPU names mean specific things. At this point it is hard to see a specific pattern, given we do not know core counts. Disclaimer: There's a significant amount of information in the ecosystem about the upcoming Skylake-SP platform, mostly from leaks that we can't personally confirm. So while we appreciate there is information out there, we've kept this analysis specifically to what is confirmed or could be inferred, as per AnandTech policy.

Reply Casper42 - Thursday, April 27, 2017 - link I like your disclaimer at the end. You know exactly what the M stands for but can't talk about it because it wasn't also leaked. It's Intel's way of squeaking out a little more cash from those very high end configs where the 2/4P ends up being a very low percentage of the overall cost. M stands for More Expensive :) Reply nathanddrews - Thursday, April 27, 2017 - link I'm guessing that Intel wants to do two things: 1. Justify outrageous prices with a "touch of elegance and sophistication that only gold and platinum can provide" 2. Distance their Xeon naming as far away as possible from consumer i3/i5/i7 naming. After Ryzen shattered the performance/dollar ratio, they rightly anticipate Naples to do the same. Reply name99 - Thursday, April 27, 2017 - link Come on, it's obvious. They are copying Apple with gold iPhones. Next year I expect Intel to be selling Rose Gold Kabe Lake Xeons! Reply GhostOfAnand - Thursday, April 27, 2017 - link I'm holding out for Xeon Rose Gold. Reply Meteor2 - Thursday, April 27, 2017 - link Right now that wouldn't surprise me. I think Intel has lost the plot. Why change an understood naming scheme for something that's a) a mouthful b) tacky? Have they forgotten these are bought by professionals? Reply CajunArson - Thursday, April 27, 2017 - link Wait, why does an official Intel document listed on its own website (and is still there, BTW, it's easy to find http://qdms.intel.com/dm/i.aspx/645B281A-2F68-4DB1... ) count as an "accidental" disclosure? Frankly the quality of reporting about Intel's upcoming product line from this website has been sub-par. That especially includes the rather bizzarre and factually unsupported statements that Cutress put into official articles about how the next-generation Xeons can't do more than 40 lanes of PCIe when Intel's own slides show that they not only exceed 40 lanes but the higher-end chips have a 48 lane PCIe implementation that has 16/8/4 lane bifurcation, which is a great feature. Reply KaarlisK - Thursday, April 27, 2017 - link Actually, this article is an improvement. In the beginning, Mr. Cutress did not separate facts from his personal speculation at all. Now he does. In the beginning, whenever he was wrong, he would perpetuate mistakes that had been pointed out before across articles, now he does not. I think we can now hope that the last step of improvement - actually admitting to mistakes and publishing corrections - will come soon, and we will finally again be able to trust Anandtech articles. Reply Cygni - Thursday, April 27, 2017 - link So you think Intel wanted to announce its next range of high-profit enterprise CPUs in an obscure technical document about an arrow on the heatspreader? One which doesn't seem to appear on the PCN list anymore? Who hurt you?

Two organisations from the Leitrim area were part of the 2016 Matching Grant Scheme and thus will receive funding in the amount of â¬3,300. These organisations are; Annaduff Community Childcare Ltd Leitrim Pool Association The Intel Involved Matching Grant Programme encourages Intel employees to engage in outreach and volunteerism in their communities by supporting employeesâ giving their time and talent to qualified nonâprofits organisations and schools. For every hour that is volunteered by an Intel employee at a school or qualified nonâprofit organisation, a donation or âmatchâ of $10 for is paid from the Intel Foundation. In 2016 Intel employees volunteered just over 54,000 hours that were eligible to be matched through this initiative resulting in a payout of â¬502,378 ($547,215) for 124 recipient organisations who are spread across 20 different counties in Ireland. Employees were recognised for these efforts at a special event held at the Intel campus in Leixlip which was attended by Mayor of Kildare Ivan Keatley along with representatives from each of the recipient organisations. The 124 organisations which were part of the Matching Grant initiative included charities such as Irish Dogs for the Disabled, the Parkinsonâs Association of Ireland and the Society of the Vincent De Paul, a variety of sporting clubs ranging from GAA to cycling, and various other organisations such as animal sanctuaries, scouting groups and schools.Â Click Here to see a full list of the organisations. The unique nature of this programme is that it empowers employees to make a difference not only through their hours but also to reward their organisations with matched funding from the Intel Foundation. This is the ninth year that Intel has implemented the current grant scheme and in that time more than â¬3.65 million has been donated to charities, schools, sports clubs, social initiatives and community schemes across Ireland. The total number of hours volunteered by employees during this times is the equivalent of having 25 people working full time in the community for the full nine years.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Fujitsu Begins Collaborative Verification of IoT-Based Visualization System in Intelâs Penang Factory TOKYO, Apr, 27 2017 â (JCN Newswire) â Fujitsu announces to begin verification of IoT-based visualization system in Intel Corporationâs semiconductor factory in Penang, Malaysia, Intelâs largest factory outside the U.S. The system can visually capture the operational status of its semiconductor production lines and environmental data such as power and water usage. This system links the FUJITSU Business Application Intelligent Dashboard, an analysis and visualization tool that supports factory-wide optimization, with the Intel based IoT Gateway and the FUJITSU Cloud Service K5 IoT Platform, a cloud-based IoT data utilization platform service. This system offers management a timely grasp on the overall situation in the factory, enabling rapid tuning on policies and processes aimed to further enhancing productivity and efficiency. Beginning in May 2017, Fujitsu will begin to offer this factory optimization solution, with a goal of 10 billion yen in revenue over the next three years. Background In May 2015, Fujitsu and Intel began to collaborate on building IoT solutions. As the first phase , the two companies launched a field trial with Shimane Fujitsu Limited, aimed at increasing efficiency by providing visibility into the manufacturing process in its factory, which produced results such as cutting shipping costs by 30%. http://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_IntelPenangfactory.jpg Intelâs Penang factory Now, as part of the second phase, Fujitsu begins verification of a system in Intelâs Penang factory using IoT to provide visibility into the factoryâs overall status, including the operational status of semiconductor production lines and energy usage. This marks the beginning of an initiative leading to improvements in productivity and efficiency. Overview of the System The system uses the Intel based IoT Gateway, from a lineup of gateway equipment for IoT systems, to collect a variety of environmental data from electricity and water meters, as well as from environmental sensors that measure temperature and humidity. This is in addition to operational status data from the semiconductor production lines, which is then centralized and managed in the K5 IoT Platform service, a platform for IoT data utilization. Based on this collected data, the system then visualizes important management indicators, such as the energy used and related costs, and the capacity utilization of manufacturing equipment through the Intelligent Dashboard, which provides a cohesive data display. Effects of Environmental Data Visualization Previously, at the Penang factory, environmental data inside the factory was collected monthly. However, management could not get a timely grasp on that data, which led to challenges in applying data to enhance factory-wide efficiency. By implementing this system, data such as energy usage can be checked daily, enabling the implementation of timely policies to improve factory operations. http://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_IoTVisualizationSystem.jpg IoT-based visualization system Effects of Visualization of Semiconductor Manufacturing Lines Previously, operational data for each piece of manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor production lines was collected, aggregated and used on a case-by-case basis, such as in determining the cause of problems with manufacturing equipment. However, because management could not check the operational status of the production lines in real time, there were difficulties in connecting that data to improvements in productivity and efficiency. Implementing this system enables a real-time view of the operational status of equipment throughout the factory, helping management to rapidly implement countermeasures in production lines facing problems. http://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_DiagramNewlyImplementedSystem.jpg Diagram of the newly implemented system Future Developments Based on the knowledge and experience gained through both the field trial at Shimane Fujitsu and this production efficiency visualization system at Intelâs Penang factory, Fujitsu will begin offering this solution for optimizing entire factories using IoT to customers in the manufacturing field in May 2017, with a goal of 10 billion yen in revenue over the next three years. In addition, the two companies also aim to expand into IoT solutions for other fields, such as distribution and retail, as well as for the public sector. Comment from Makiko Eda, President, Intel K.K. The joint demonstration with Fujitsu on âIntelligent Dashboardâ at Intel Penang Factory marks our commitment in driving IoT innovations. By processing massive data generated in a factory with Intel based IoT Gateway and Intel Xeon-powered servers, we will be able to visualize the factory in real-time and smart manner.

This rumor is said to be a response to threats from AMDâs Naples server-grade processor. Unfortunately, until now, there have been no updates on the said monstrosity from Intel. However, Intel somehow managed to launch a new line of Xeon processors without making a big fuss about it. According to German site Computerbase, Intel launched a total of 34 Skylake SP processors based on the newest Purley platform. These processors contain a minimum of ten cores to as much as 28 in one CPU. The most interesting part of the launch is the fact that Intel somehow managed to cram in a total of 28 cores on the LGA3647 package. Furthermore, the new platform supports massive scalability and impressive RAM support. Intel Xeon processor (via intel.com) According to previous reports, the new Purley platform can support a minimum of two sockets per board. Meanwhile, the maximum number of processors supported per board can go as high as eight. In terms of system RAM, the new architecture can support six channels of DDR4 type RAM as opposed to the usual four. This means that there can be as many as 18 DIMM sockets per CPU. As for performance, the top-tier Xeon Platinum 8180 can run with an impressive 2.5GHz clock speed while sporting a total of 28 cores. On the other hand, the fastest processor in the lineup is the Intel Xeon Gold 5122 which runs at 3.6GHz. It is also worth mentioning that the new lineup can have as much as 205W of TDP. For a server-grade processor stocked with 28 cores, this is indeed an impressive feat. Also, the new platform boasts direct support for Intelâs low latency Optane storage. Unfortunately, not much has been said about the possibly dates of availability for the said chip. For more updates on Intel Xeon processors, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The new series of CPUs from Intel are based on the new Purley platform, on LGA 3647. Â  Â  There's a huge line of up new Xeon processors, with up to 28 cores and 56 threads at 2.5GHz, while they are going to be slotting into the new R3 socket. The new Xeon Gold and Platinum processors are available with less cores and higher frequencies of up to 3.6GHz, while low-power Xeon processors will arrive with 2GHz speeds. Â  Â  Intel is splitting its new Xeon CPUs into four families: Platinum is the 8000 series, Gold with the 6000 and 5000 series, while the 4000 series will be Silver, and the 3000 series is Bronze. Intel will use between 10 cores on the new Xeon processors, right up to the monster 28-core chip with Hyper-Threading, rolling the CPU threads up to 56. Â  Intel is reportedly launching the new Xeon Platinum 8180 which will rock 28C/56T of CPU performance at 2.5GHz, with 38.5MB of L3 cache and a 205W TDP. This is a monster processor with its 56-threaded power, but its $12,000+ price tag sees it destined for the datacenter/AI/server markets.

Everything from social media platforms, to consumer software, and IoT gadgets to scientific research, AI can be a huge benefit, whether it be crunching data to recognise patterns or help us in our everyday life. Intel understands this fact too, as evidenced by the focus itâs putting on AI research. At the Intel AI Day in Bangalore early April, the company laid out its plans to push for AI development across various fields. From scientific researchers to software developers, various speakers espoused the benefits of machine learning technology, as well as discussing the road ahead. Intel's MD for South Asia, Prakash Mallya, at the AI Day event in Bangalore âItâs all about partnership,â says Prakash Mallya, Managing Director for Intel in South Asia. âWe want to engage the ecosystem and accelerate the usage of AI to rapidly transform everybodyâs life.â Intel estimates each person on the Internet generates 1.5GB of data each day. They believe this wealth of data can be leveraged in various ways, including for algorithm-based government administration and medical treatments. Consequently, the company is collaborating with other major players like Wipro, Hewlett Packard, Julia Computing, and Calligo Technologies, as well as other AI startups in India and abroad. India's race towards an AI future For instance, Julia Computing is working on an Ai-powered software capable of diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, a degenerative condition that affects eyesight. The developers have trained a neural network using a huge dataset of images showing infected eyes and those free from the condition. In this way, the technology could theoretically be applied in a patientâs home, using a high quality smartphone camera. This way, the patient can self-diagnose for the condition before visiting a doctor, and even track the advancement of his condition. Meanwhile, Dr Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay, details how his team is working on a translation software using AI. The team is using a combination of machine learning and natural language processing (what AI like Siri and Googleâs Digital Assistant use to understand conversational speech), to translate Indian languages. âItâs a 3D problem,â he says, describing how Indiaâs variety of languages and dialects can pose a functional problem. However, the results of a successful program could benefit us every day, allowing us to translate spoken conversation into our native tongue on the fly. Even Flipkart is getting in on the AI action, using machine learning to power its âsuggested picksâ on the ecommerce platform. âAI was like marriage in 1995 â Everyone was excited about it, but it always failed to deliver on its promises,â he says with a chuckle. According to him, that all changed over times. As Big Data emerged as a precious resource, hardware became at the same time more advanced and more accessible, and the open source community burgeoned, Deep Learning became an achievable dream. The company is currently plugging in a neural network to recognise what a customer purchases and suggest similar picks. This isnât the kind of suggestions the platform currently has, which are based solely on product type and model. Instead, Flipkart is applying this technique to even items like clothing. Still in development, their AI is capable of recognising the colour, patterns and even style of an item of clothing and then suggest others that fit the bill. In the future, this could work by you being able to just describe the item you want in a search bar, instead of relying on a catalogue or keywords. It could even be applied to a smartphone app, allowing you to scan something you see in a store or on someoneâs person, and have it look up the item on Flipkart. Even the National Institute for Smart Government in Hyderabad intends to leverage AI in the near future. According to the groupâs CEO, DN Narasimha Raju, the state government is looking to artificial intelligence as way to cope with grievance redressal.

This is different from the usual type of machine learning in one key way; none of the data the machine âlearnsâ from is labelled. In this case, the neural network isnât fed any examples of a good or bad outcome (depending on what function itâs being applied to), instead it just finds patterns and cluster the raw data accordingly. For example, in facial detection, youâd feed the AI images of faces so it can map out what a face generally looks like. On the other hand, with an AI taught by unsupervised learning, it will be able to tell a face apart from a landscape or a dog, but might be confused by a picture of a gorilla. Of course, supervised learning is more efficient, but unsupervised learning can be beneficial in a Â country like India, where vast amounts of government data has not yet been digitised and organised. In this case, an AI using unsupervised learning can sift through huge sets of digital records and classify them as groups based on what they contain. In addition, unsupervised learning also has major applications in cyber security, where an attackerâs mode of entry may differ. In this case, the neural network using this kind of learning can recognise patterns left by a hacker by noticing the difference in their movements as compared to other users. We may be more familiar with the flashier versions of AI weâve gotten used to, like smartphone digital assistants and board game-playing bots. But all the above research, being developed right here in India, is continuing in the background, gestating until the day theyâre ready to change our lives in ways we never imagined. Weâre witnessing a revolution similar to that of the birth of steam power, or the invention of computers themselves. And one day, weâll be ready to put almost our entire lives in the hands of artificial intelligence.

On Wednesday, through an update to its chip errata [PDF], Intel revealed that its Atom C2000 chip family has a new C0 stepping, up from the previous B0, meaning at least some parts of the chip have been redesigned. Version C0 fixes problems with the chip's low pin count (LPC) bus clock outputs, and introduces a new specification for the LPC interface. Specifically, the C0 stepping resolves chip bug AVR54, which describes how the "system may experience [an] inability to boot or may cease operation" permanently. As a side-effect of the C0 redesign, most of the LPC pins on the chip package cannot be reassigned by software as general purpose IO (GPIO) if they are not needed for timing signals, as was possible in previous Atom C2000 steppings. So if you've designed a device that relies on GPIO signals from the LPC pins, you'll have to redesign your motherboard if you switch from self-destructing B0 Atoms to the non-bricking C0 version, because the GPIO functionality has mostly been taken away. All in all, that's an expensive move for manufacturers. "All of the LPC interface signals are defined as muxed with GPIO signals," reads Intel's errata, dated April 2017. "This implies that if the LPC interface is not used in your design these signals can be GPIO signals. This specification change removes the muxed support of GPIO signals for all LPC signals except LPC_CLKOUT1. These signals must be left in their default (LPC) state and not de-selected via software to be GPIO pins." In January, Intel said that the Atom's LPC clock bus outputs (LPC_CLKOUT0 and LPC_CLKOUT1) could stop functioning, rendering affected devices inoperable. Without a clock signal governing circuitry, such as the boot ROM, Atom-equipped gear can't even start up. The device bricks itself, in other words. That same month, Chipzilla's chief financial officer warned of a product quality issue, noting that the company had set aside funds to cover the cost of dealing with an unspecified design flaw. The nature of the problem became clearer in early February when Cisco issued an advisory warning. A variety of its products sold prior to November 16, 2016, the network gear maker said, contained a faulty clock component that was failing at a rate greater than anticipated after 18 months of use. The common component in the Cisco hardware was an Atom C2000 line chip. As we reported in March, the failing Atom chip affected IT products from at least 21 vendors: Aaeon, ASRock Rack, Checkpoint, Cisco, Dell, Fortinet, HP, Infortrend, iXsystems, Online/Scaleway, Lanner, NEC, Newisys, Netgear, Netgate, Quanta, Seagate, Sophos, Supermicro, Synology, and ZNYX Networks. We've reached out to some of the affected organizations to see whether they've received C0 inventory yet but have not heard back. In February, an Intel spokesperson told The Register that the company had a board-level workaround for the then-current B0 production stepping of its Atom chips and said the company planned to "implement and validate a minor silicon fix in a new product stepping that resolves this issue." Intel is expected to report its Q1 2017 earnings on Thursday.

The Waymo driverless car is displayed during a Google event last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the worldâs biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced between Robert Bosch and Daimler AGâs Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator â sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp. acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV, and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-21. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. âEverybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they donât have it, theyâre going to partner, invest or purchase,â said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming, and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact.Â  Others such as General Motors Co. are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc.âs Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive PLC are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AGâs Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp. has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and âdeep learningâ software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc., competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house âÂ as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology.

Or the memory or the video card (or lack of video card). The primary reason your cheap laptop loudly chugs along at glacial speeds is because of the hard drive. Cheap laptops use cheap hard disk drives, which are much slower than the solid state drives found in better computers. But Intel's new Optane Memory changes that. This little $70 chip makes a cheap hard disk drive run as fast as a solid state drive. All images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo It does all this by using a brand new type of memory. That sounds very boring, but memory might be one of the most important components in your computer. What the hell is memory? Memory is anything in a computer that reads and writes data. There's memory in your processor, in your RAM, and all the way down to your USB drives. "It's like a pyramid," Greg Schulz, a storage analyst and operator of StorageIO told Gizmodo. "As you go down the pyramid the capacity is cheaper, but slower." So the tip of the pyramid is the memory in your CPU, then comes DRAM, then NAND-based flash storage like SSDs, then hard disk drives. At the very bottom would be the oldest and cheapest kind of memory tape drives. After you understand the pyramid there's only one other thing you really need to understand. Volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory tends to be faster â it's DRAM or the stuff built into your CPU. It's crazy speedy and writes at the smallest possible read/write level: the byte level. Yet volatile memory can't actual remember anything when it loses power. So the minute you restart your computer volatile memory forgets everything it's learned. The first time you open a big program on a computer after a restart, it takes longer than usual. Why? Your computer's DRAM has forgotten all the crucial info it needs to open the program quickly. Non-volatile memory doesn't have that problem, but it's also a lot slower, and can't write at the byte level. So what is non-volatile memory? It's the stuff that maintains all the data it learns even when it's not receiving power. It's persistent memory. As soon as something is classified as persistent memory it can take on another name: storage. Every hard drive, floppy, or thumb drive you use is persistent memory. Intel Optane memory is cool because its uses an entirely new entry on the memory pyramid: 3D Xpoint memory. 3D Xpoint slots in right between DRAM and NAND. It's as fast as the volatile stuff â capable of reading at that crucial byte level â but it's also persistent. It's the best of both worlds. What Is 3D Xpoint Memory? "Since digital memory was created, there's only been 8 major memories, the most recent being 3D Xpoint," storage analyst Greg Schulz told Gizmodo. The last big memory before 3D Xpoint? That was NAND, which was introduced back in 1999. "These things only come around every couple of decades." 3D Xpoint was announced by Intel and Micron way back in 2015, sixteen years after the last big memory leap. At the time the two companies promised that 3D Xpoint was a thousand times faster than NAND, but just as persistent. Which would mean a whole new ultrafast medium for storing data. Yet it's taken nearly two years to go from announcing the memory to actually putting it in hardware you and I can buy. What The Hell Is Intel Optane Memory? Intel's Optane memory is the first instance of 3D Xpoint being used in consumer-level products. There's already a 3D Xpoint storage drive available, taking advantage of its incredible speed, but that drive is also only 375GB and retails for $US1500. Optane memory is Intel's shot at giving consumers an affordable taste of 3D Xpoint's incredible speed. What it does it function as a cache system for your primary storage drive, storing necessary data sort of like RAM might, but holding onto that data in between restarts. The memory stick fits in the .M2 slot on Optane ready motherboards. Bring your own screw. If that concept sounds familiar that's because people have been using faster non-volatile memory as a cache system for the slower stuff for a while now. Notably, Apple has its optional Fusion drive for iMacs. That one combines an SSD and HDD, with the SSD functioning as the cache system while the HDD handles storage. While it is definitely cheaper, and larger, than a solid state drive alone, the speeds don't quite get to solid state levels. Seagate's also introduced such a drive, though it goes with the more generic "hybrid" name. A 2TB hybrid drive with 8GB of onboard flash memory is about $100, but Intel's new Optane setup is similarly cheap. A32GB Optane memory stick and 2TB hard disk drive costs around $150. The cost of a 2TB solid state drive? Nearly $1000. So why spend $150 instead of $100? Because Intel Optane is really damn fast. OK, How Good Is Intel's Optane Memory, Then? I put Intel's new hardware through a series of benchmarks to test just how much it could improve the performance of HDDs and SDDs. In the case of the former, it improves speeds so much that you'll never, ever want to use a Optane-less HDD again. This was best exemplified with Adobe Premiere and Adobe Photoshop. Both apps are notorious for taking forever to open. When I opened a project in Premiere on a regular HDD it took 52 seconds. Opening a huge project in Photoshop took 37 seconds. Yet once I'd activated the 32GB Optane memory chip, those processes took 11 seconds and 7 seconds respectively. Shockingly it actually made the HDD faster than a SSD too, and bizarrely, in the case of Premiere, the HDD with Optane was actually a full two seconds faster than the SSD with Optane. HDD with Optane inside is crazy fast, and the shorter the bar the better the performance. Opening projects in Adobe apps gave the Optane memory its most impressive results, but Optane dramatically improved the traditional rotating platter hard disk drive's performance across the board. The HDD took 5.5 seconds to open Google Chrome, but the HDD with Optane took less than two seconds. Opening a 4K video in Windows' native video player took six seconds with the HDD, but it took only 1.5 seconds to open it when the Optane memory was enabled. Again, shorter bars are better. The solid state drive combined with Optane memory didn't see the same kind of insane performance improvement as the HDD. Indeed in the case of the above productivity tests, the SSD and SSD with Optane memory were neck and neck with no real noticeable difference in speed. But that changed when we tried loading games. The storage drive has to read a lot more data when opening a video game versus opening an app like Photoshop or Google Chrome, and it takes a lot more time to read that data. Consequently, the insane speed benefits of Optane memory are much more apparent. When opening Mass Effect Andromeda the Optane memory enabled storage drives were both twice as fast as the drives without Optane memory. Speeds were less dramatic in the case of loading levels. In both cases Optane memory made the storage drive approximately 20-per cent faster. The SSD with Optane loaded a Mass Effect level in 28 seconds while the SSD without loaded it in 34 seconds. The HDD with Optane loaded the level in 49 seconds while the one without did it in 61 seconds. Overwatch, a game that takes up much less space on a storage device, also saw exceptional improvements in loading times. Though the speed improvements weren't consistent. While Overwatch loaded twice as fast on the HDD with Optane versus the HDD without, it only loaded a single second faster on the SDD with Optane versus the SSD without. I observed the same disparity when benchmarking the time it takes a computer to boot up. The HDD with Optane booted twice as fast as the HDD without, but the SSD with Optane only booted 2 seconds faster than the SSD without. If all your systems run on SSD there's really no need to go out and drop money on an Optane memory stick. While it can, on occasion, improve the speeds of an SSD it's not nearly a big enough improvement to warrant spending $US44 ($58) minimum on Optane memory. Yet if you have a computer where all the systems and apps are on a HDD? Optane memory will make your computing life better. Unfortunately, there are some pretty damn big caveats. Chief among them is that Optane memory only works with computers that have a seventh generation Intel Kaby Lake processor inside â and Kaby Lake only started shipping very late last year. This means that the big old desktop gathering dust in your garage can't benefit from Optane memory. In fact, few people can, because Optane memory currently only works with desktop CPUs and motherboards, and Optane compliant motherboards and CPUs only started shipping this year. So unless you're a computer builder, the benefits of Optane memory are still outside your grasp. But Intel has assured Gizmodo that we're going to start seeing a lot of Optane memory enabled desktops and laptops from computer makers later this year. So someday very soon, cheap is no longer going to mean slow. If you see a laptop with an Optane inside sticker slapped on the front, rest assured, that's a good thing. README Optane memory retails for about $70 for a 16GB stick and $120 for a 32GB stick. Go ahead and spend the money on the 32GB version. It makes HDDs twice as fast as they normally are, but it doesn't axe the annoying kathunk sound HDDs make. Benefits to SSDs are small now, but later generations of Optane memory could change that. A 32GB Optane memory stick and 2TB HDD costs less than a 500GB SSD. Even if storage isn't crucial to your PC build, that's a great deal. Comments dunkyboy @dunkyboy Apr 27, 2017, 4:14pm Any idea how the last result is explained? How is a HDD/Optane faster than a SSD/Optane combo. Seems counter-intuitive. Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Apr 27, 2017, 5:38pm I'd like to see the actual tests and try repeating them to see if the issue is consistent. In either case the Optane memory is basically acting as a cache storing some data for faster access. Maybe in the case of the HDD+optane all (or more) of the data was already cached than in the SSD+optane test. Maybe there was some sort of power saving going on with the SSD where it needed to wake up (although I'd expect that to affect the HDD more). Or it could be a bug/flawed test. Reply 0 Donnie H.

Reply 0 jrivis @jrivis Apr 27, 2017, 5:12pm The title of the post is a bit misleading Reply 0 Chris @chrisupjohn Apr 27, 2017, 7:51pm The single biggest issue with this product is it only works with the seventh generation Kaby Lake processors, the vast majority of people using this processor will be playing games and more than likely have have an SSD and high performance secondary HDD to cope with the loads. With octane, you wouldn't really see any improvement unless you're using a HDD from before ~2012. That said; it's hard to understand why Intel are selling it at all since it should at least support gen three processors which would greatly benefit from this assuming the motherboard has a compatible M.2 slot. Reply 0 g-man @g-man Apr 27, 2017, 8:18pm So to speed up you're crappy old pc you need one of these and a new pc that accepts m2. Reply 0 Mike22Ole Guest Apr 27, 2017, 10:02pm So I could buy Optane for $1500 or get a Samsung 960Pro which would probably be faster then the combos used in these tests for about 1/3 of that price? To top if off I can't use it on my X99 system, forget about Ryzen which is destroying intel in value for the tests in this article. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals AnnouncementÂ  â® Â Hardware Intel Quietly Launches Xeon Platinum and Gold Series Processors With Up To 28 Cores / 56 Threads By Usman Pirzada Apr 26, 2017 127Shares Share Tweet Submit In a PCN (Product Change Notification) sent to partners (via Computerbase.de), Intel has quietly launched the Xeon Gold and Platinum platforms. The lineups boast a wide variety of clock speeds and core configurations with the flagship going as high as 28 cores clocked at a hearty 2.5 GHz. The socket is LGA 3647 and this lineup is the new nomenclature of the Skylake-SP platform. Xeons previously named E5 and E7 are now going to be named according to this new nomenclature. Oh and there is still no official word on the 32-core chip we spotted earlier this year. Intel launches Xeon Gold and Xeon Platinum lineup for server market; Skylake uArchitecture, AVX-512 instruction set, H0 Stepping and more Intelâs Xeon Gold and Platinum lineups go as high as 3.6 GHz clock speed with the low core variants (think Xeon Gold 5122) and as low as 2.0 GHz for some specific low power variants. The Xeon Gold lineup has the nomenclature of 61xx while the Platinum lineup follows the 81xx nomenclature for CPU naming convention. Letâs talk about the absolutely monster CPU that is lurking in this lineup though: the 28 core, 56 thread Xeon part. Related Intelâs Flagship Xeon E5-2699 V5 Skylake-EP CPU Leaked â Features 32 Cores, 64 Threads, Will Compete With AMD Naples The Intel Xeon Platinum 8180 is the part believed to have 28 cores and is clocked at an astounding 2.5 GHz core clock. This is very impressive for a processor with this amount of cores. It also has an L3 cache of 38.5 MB as well as a TDP of just 205 watts. The architectural improvements that set Skylake apart from Broadwell can be found throughout this lineup so it would be fair to call it Intelâs Skylake rollout to the server market.

The amount of DIMMs available has been increased to 3 DIMMs per channel for a grand total of 18 DIMMs per CPU. So far Intel has four families of Xeon planned: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. The Platinum family will be the 8000 series, gold will be 6000 and 500, silver will be 4000 and bronze will be the 3000 series. Core scaling is thought to start from 10 cores all the way up to 28 cores (or even 32 cores if the processor we saw earlier ends up being part of this lineup.

Keep in mind, however, that the nomenclature is no longer accurate. I have kept the old nomenclature intact for the sake of coherencyÂ  in this passage and due to lack of information on which naming scheme translates to which naming scheme. Related Intel Launches Xeon E5-2699A V4 22 Core Processor â Skylake-EP Xeon CPUs Arriving in 2017 Advertisement The Skylake Purley platform will be divided between three major categories 2S, 4S and 8S/8S+. This includes the family range from Xeon E5 to Xeon E7. The expected nomenclature should assume the âv5â suffix thanks to the Skylake microarchitecture present in the processors and includes the Xeon E5 2600 v5, Xeon E5 4600 v5, Xeon E7 4800 v5 and Xeon E7 8800 v5. The E5 family includes the dual socket and quad socket designs (2S and 4S) whileas the E7 family includes the 8 socket design structure with the C602 chipset and a scalable memory buffer. One of the biggest advancements that Skylake will have is the Intel Omnipath Architecture integration which will be called Storm Lake (Generation 1). The PCH will be codenamed Lewisburg and will also ship with updated Ethernet controllers. Another very important point to note is that the platform will be scalable up to 8 sockets â which is frankly an absolutely insane amount for CPUs working in tandem in any given configuration. Specific SKUs have not been disclosed at this time. Since we already have in our possession the complete slide deck for this platform, I have taken the liberty to post the important bits here: Skylake EX Purley will be spread out amongst the entire scalable segment â unlike the previous iterations. The TDP will be configurable from 45W to 165W and will require Socket P. Another interesting point to note is the fact that not only will Purley update the number of PCIe slots to 48 but they will finally be configurable in x4, x8 and x16 divisions ( a major update). Previous reports had hinted on Intel working on some secret project that will prove Skylake to be quite a big architectural jump and not simply another Haswell. While we havenât seen any evidence of this revolutionary change on the mainstream side, Skylake Purley does appear to be the aforementioned jump, incarnate. According to Intelâs own slides, Skylake Purley is poised to be the biggest update since the age old Nehalem platform. Along with the improved performance per watt that comes with every article iteration, Skylake EX Purley will actually ship with 6 channels of DDR4 as opposed to 4. It will also include the AVX 512 instruction set and will boast the 100G OmniPath interconnect. Skylake Purley will also have Cannonlake graphics support not to mention FPGA integration (another important upgrade). The new platform also comes with an updated socket. The socket has been upgraded to feature 3647 pins that gives it the LGA 3647 name. The socket is surrounded by 12 DDR4 DIMM slots. This is due to support next-generation hexa-channel memory and Intelâs Optane DIMMs for faster latency solutions.Â Overall, Purley will be expanding Intelâs server platform with a range of new features.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The Best Stock to Buy in This Multibillion-Dollar Market This stock is well-positioned to benefit from the coming growth in the autonomous-car market. John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Apr 26, 2017 at 8:10PM According to market researcher PwC Strategy&, the total revenue generated by the automotive industry, ranging from carmakers to technology providers, is currently about $5 trillion. By 2030, this will grow to an estimated $7.8 trillion, and the industry's profits will grow from $400 billion to $600 billion. Much of the increase in revenue and profit will shift away from carmakers and auto suppliers to technology providers, such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as cars become more like computers on wheels and we move further along the spectrum of autonomous vehicles. NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 car computer powers the Volvo XC90 SUV. IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIA INC. Driverless cars will require highly sophisticated technology, such as sensors, software, and computer processors. Intel, NVIDIA, and Alphabet are leaders in these essential technologies and investors are eyeing them with interest. In addition to choosing a company with the best technology, it's important for investors to consider which company stands to reward shareholders the most from the coming boom in driverless cars.Â  Let's take a look at where the three tech giants mentioned above stand to determine which one is the best driverless-car stock for investors looking to get the most bang for their buck. A game of partnerships These major tech companies have been in a partnership-forming frenzy to create alliances with leading car manufacturers to accomplish the automotive equivalent of landing a rover on Mars. Alphabet has been working on self-driving cars for several years and has racked up 2 million self-driven miles, but it's not planning to build its own car. Its renamed Waymo division (which stands for "a new way forward in mobility") is working on partnerships with carmakers. For its part, Intel plans to acquire Mobileye, an Israel-based technology company purely focused on developing computer vision, data analysis, mapping, and other computer systems for driverless cars. But investors considering Intel or Alphabet as a driverless car investment should be mindful of one very important thing. Any future growth from driverless cars will only provide a marginal benefit to Intel's and Alphabet's top lines. Intel's 2016 revenue was $59.4 billion and Alphabet's was $90.3 billion. Let's compare that with the market opportunity.Â  PwC Strategy& estimates the revenue opportunity for those providing the technology that helps cars drive themselves will cross $50 billion by 2022. Intel has estimated that the market for vehicle systems, data, and services will be $70 billion by 2030. If Intel captured 100% of the $70 billion estimated to be the market opportunity in driverless cars, then its revenue would increase 118% over the next 13 years, or about 6% per year. Throw in a few more percentage points of annual growth from its existing business, and investors are looking at a company that might get 10% per year in annual revenue growth, which might be enough for Intel stock to keep pace with the S&P 500 index, but nothing more.Â  Alphabet generated $90 billion in revenue in 2016, so its potential upside from driverless cars also offers shareholdersÂ marginal benefits. And with so many companies jockeying for position in the driverless car market, it is unrealistic that one company is going to control 100% share of the market. If you're looking for a stock with plenty of return potential from driverless cars, you want to find a company that has a small amount of revenue compared to the estimated size of the opportunity. That way there is plenty of room for the company's revenue to expand exponentially by winning market share in the driverless car market and provide shareholders the potential to beat the S&P 500 index over the long term. That leads me to NVIDIA. Company Market Cap Annual Revenue in Recent Year Intel $173 $59.4 Alphabet $600 $90.3 NVIDIA $61 $6.9 Data source: SEC 10-K filings. All dollar figures in billions.Â  The best self-driving car stock A better option is NVIDIA, which is just as well-positioned in the driverless car market as Intel and Alphabet and has the room to see its top line soar. NVIDIA generated $6.9 billion in revenue in 2016 and it has the necessary expertise in developing a crucial piece of technology powering the brains of driverless cars -- the graphics processing unit (GPU). The GPU developer has been forming an impressive list of partnerships with several major automakers, including Volkswagen AG's Audi, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, Honda Motor Co, BMW, and Tesla among many others. NVIDIA is even partnering with Baidu to develop automated parking, HD mapping, and advanced automated vehicle control. NVIDIA has also signed agreements to supply its DRIVE PX 2 car computer to truckmaker PACCAR, as well as major auto suppliers such as ZF and Germany-based Bosch. NVIDIA's revenue from its automotive segment totaled $487 million in fiscal 2017, which ended in late January. The graphics specialist is not a pure-play on self-driving cars, as the company is also selling graphics processors to video game enthusiasts and cloud computing providers, among other uses of its graphics technology. But given its relatively small amount of $6.9 billion in total revenue, the company will benefit shareholders much more from any future growth of self-driving cars compared to larger peers like Intel and Alphabet.

(Seng Mai / The Myanmar Times / March 28, 2011) Distributers of computers and laptops with the latest generation of Intel motherboards in Yangon have been affected by a global recall. Ko Kyaw Htun, the sales manager of Golden Power Technology Co, which distributes Asus products that use Intel motherboards, said the company quickly contacted customers and asked them to bring their computers in. âAs soon as we heard about the announcement in the first week of February we started recalling affected products from the market. It took about a month but weâve retrieved all of them now,â he said. According to the Intel announcement, design errors in the chips could affect performance when linked with some hard disks and/or DVD drives. âPeople bought these products because they were supposed to be faster. It was a bit disappointing to find the motherboards were not actually any faster than the model they replaced,â said Ko Kaung Myat, the marketing manager of Royal Smart, which distributes MSI products. He worried that the recall might damage public opinion about MSI computers. âCustomers need to know clearly that it was not MSIâs fault â this is an Intel problem,â he said. Companies affected by the recall include Gigabyte, Asus, MSI, Elite Computer Systems and Biostar. Replacement motherboards began arriving in early March and are labelled with âNew B3 Stepping Revision Chipset Motherboardâ stickers to differentiate them from the unrecalled products. âWe were quite lucky because the products with defective motherboards were en-route to Yangon when the recall was announced and were returned. The recall did delay the arrival of our newest products by a couple of days but it was not a major problem for us,â said Ko Soe Ngwe Ya, a spokesperson for KMD computer sales and service centre.

These notebooks are available in 15.6-inch and 17.3-inch variants and were unveiled at the companyâs next@acer event in New York. The laptops come with an overclockable Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or GTX 1050Ti graphics card (GP). You also get to choose between two CPUs, the Intel Core i7 7700HQ or the Intel Core i5 7300HQ. Up to 32 GB DDR4 RAM is supported and the laptops include a Sata SSD as well as a 1 TB HDD. Acer says that the devices include a USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.0 port, two USB 2.0 ports and an HDMI 2.0 port. An ethernet port and Wi-Fi 802.11ac is also supported. As mentioned earlier, you can opt for either a 15.6-inch or 17.3-inch display. Both support Full HD resolutions (1920Ã1080 pixel) and are IPS panels. Dolby has provided the audio solution. The laptop configurations will vary by region, so donât expect India to get the same configuration as was launched in the US. Official US prices start at $1,299 (around Rs 84,000) for the 15.6-inch model and $1,399 (around Rs 90,000) for the 17.3-inch model. Products with similar specifications in India cost around Rs 1,30,000, so until India prices are confirmed, donât get your hopes up. The devices will launch in July in the US.

Revenue from Intelâs higher-margin data center business rose 6 percent to $4.2 billion in the first quarter. That was less than the 9 percent jump a year-ago and the 8 percent increase in the fourth quarter. âI think the Street was looking for slightly better than that,â Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Analysts were expecting revenue to increase 10 percent to about $4.4 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. The slowdown in revenue growth comes after Intel warned in February that businessâs margins could be hit by higher costs. However, Intel still expects the business to grow in the high single-digit percentage rate this year, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a call. Forecast Raised Intel marginally raised its full-year revenue forecast, which Krzanich said was due to average selling prices across its businesses trending ahead of expectations. The Santa Clara-based company expects 2017 revenue of about $60 billion. It had earlier forecast revenue would be flat compared with 2016 revenue of $59.4 billion. Intel increased its share buyback program by $10 billion to about $15 billion and also raised its 2017 adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents to $2.85 per share, plus or minus 5 percent. The company has previously said it expects its deal to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, announced last month, to boost adjusted profit. The acquisition thrusts Intel into the forefront of the market to develop driverless systems. The deal, along with a focus on cloud computing, will also help Intel reduce its dependence on the PC market. Intel gets most of its revenue from selling chips used in PCs. Its PC business returned to growth in 2016 as demand stabilized in the second half of the year. Demand also unexpectedly edged up in the first quarter, according to research firm IDC. That helped revenue from the client computing group, as Intel calls the business, increase 6 percent to $8 billion, matching estimates. Intelâs total revenue rose 8 percent to $14.80 billion, falling short of analystsâ estimate of $14.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income jumped 45 percent to $2.96 billion. Excluding items, Intel earned 66 cents per share, one cent above analystsâ estimate.

Razer had better watch its back: theÂ current king of thin-but-powerful gaming laptops has a new challenger. Acer's Predator Triton 700 has all the top-spec hardware you'd expect, courtesy of Intel and Nvidia, but hasn't piled on the pounds to make room for it. At just 18.9mm with the lid closed, it's positively skinny. That's because it's packing some ultra-clever fans, which keep everything cool while taking up less space. Acer's pretty proud of 'em - that's why you can actually see them underneath the touchpad. Yep - this is the first laptop I've seen that's not just running Windows, but actually has a window as well. After putting one through its paces at Acer's global press launch, I came away impressed. Here's why. OK, so it's got the mandatory ridiculous name, just like any other gaming laptop, but Acer hasn't gone crazy on the styling. The Triton is almost subtle, which isn't something I would've thought I'd be saying about a 17in laptop with a see-through glass touchpad. It sits above the keyboard, which is a little crazy, but makes sense when you think where this laptop will spend most of its life: firmly on a desk, with a mouse attached so you can get your game on. Beneath the glass, one of the two AeroBlade 3D fans and its accompanying heat sink can be seen doing its thang. They're metal, rather than plastic, with an axial fin that makes them 35% more efficient than a standard laptop fan. At full pelt, that means there's enough cooling to keep a 7th gen Intel Core i7 CPU and a Nvidia GeForce 10-series GPU (no confirmation on which one just yet) running smoothly without melting into a puddle of silicon. It certainly worked a treat while blasting gringos inÂ Ghost Recon: Wildlands, keeping frame rates smooth without any noticeable drops. The keyboard sits right at the front of the machine, and while it's great that you won't accidentally nudge the touchpad while you're gaming, it's a little bitÂ tooÂ close - without a wrist rest this looks like a one-way trip to RSI. Population: you. On the plus side, those are honest-to-goodness mechanical keys, with fantastic feedback and that recognisable clicky sound that gamers just can't get enough of. They're absolutely awesome to type on, so hopefully Acer will be bringing it to more laptops in the future. This 15.6in laptop doesn't overdo it when it comes to screen resolution, with a Full HD panel that the dedicated graphics card will be able to handle. QHD and even 4K screens are great for getting work done or web browsing, but are useless if all that matters are high frame rates. That's why you get Nvidia G-Sync, which makes even the most demanding games look smooth when the GPU can't quite hit that stable 60fps target. It's a decent enough display, although Acer's choice of venue (a rooftop terrace on a bright, if slightly overcast day) meant it was tough to get an idea of how it'll perform indoors and in the dark. Which is how most gamers will probably be using it. There are certainly enough ports to hook it up to a bigger, higher resolution display if you need, with both HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort. You get wired Ethernet, two USB3 ports and a single USB2, so you can hook up plenty of peripherals as well. ACER PREDATOR TRITON 700 INITIAL VERDICT With matte black styling and such slim dimensions, you'd have to look closely to spot that the Triton 700 was a gaming laptop. Ok, so the blue keyboard LEDs might give the same away, but it's the most restrained Acer has been when it comes to high-performance notebooks. It is genuinely powerful, too, thanks to high-end components and the cooling system to keep them running at their highest possible speeds. Gaming won't be a problem, and that keyboard is among the best we've tried in a laptop. Razer still has the edge right now, but Acer has something special here. Unfortunately, you're going to have to pay serious cash to take one home. When it goes on sale later this year, expect prices to start from$US2999. That puts it firmly up against the Razer Blade, which has the added benefit of an external graphics card for gaming at home on the big screen. Will it take down the champ? We'll have to wait until closer to launch, when we get hold of one and give it a full review.

Google's parent company Alphabet's net income rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion in the first quarter, from $4.21 billion in the same period last year. Revenue increased 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion, from $20.26 billion. Google's net income jumped 21.8 percent to $7.6 billion, from $6.24 billion; while revenue rose 21.9 percent to $24.5 billion, from $20.1 billion, during the same period. Google's ad revenue increased 18.9 percent to $21.4 billion, from $18 billion. After strong financial results, Alphabet's stock price climbed 5.1 percent to $937 a share in after-hours trading. Microsoft also saw its net income rise $27.6 percent to $4.8 billion in the January-March period this year, from $3.76 billion a year ago. Its revenue climbed 11 percent to $22.09 billion, from $20.53 billion, during that period. The results, however, missed expectations and the firm's shares fell 2.4 percent to $66.60 after the final bell. Microchip giant Intel's net income rose 50 percent to $3 billion in the first three months of the year, from $2 billion a year ago. Revenue increased 8 percent to $14.8 billion, from $13.7 billion, during the period. Intel's results also missed expectations, and its shares declined 4.4 percent to $35.83 during after hours. E-commerce giant Amazon saw its net income rise 41.1 percent to 724 million in the first quarter, from 513 million last year. Revenue rose 22.7 percent to $35.7 billion, from $29.1 billion, year-over-year. Amazon's stock price climbed to $961.44 per share with a 4.7 percent gain after the stock market closed.

He grew up mostly in Delhi, India. Under his presidency, SanDisk focused on making more robust and reliable memory chips. Noah Berger AP Business April 27, 2017 6:36 AM New CEO âuniquely qualifiedâ to lead Micron, co-founded and led successful competitor By David Staats dstaats@idahostatesman.com and Kristin Rodine krodine@idahostatesman.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The co-founder and former leader of a competitor will join Micron Technology as its next president and CEO, the Boise company said Thursday. Micronâs board chose Sanjay Mehrotra, most recently the president and CEO of SanDisk, to succeed Mark Durcan, who announced plans to retire in February once a successor was in place. Mehrotra will take over May 8. âSanjay has an outstanding track record of business success and exceptional knowledge of the memory and storage industry,â said Robert E. Switz, the chairman of Micronâs board. Shareholders greeted the news favorably, sending Micronâs stock up more than 3 percent to close at $26.63 in Thursday trading. We're excited to welcome Sanjay Mehrotra as the next CEO of Micron Technology! Read more here, https://t.co/Xw60A7PVEr. pic.twitter.com/Votd5ByZUiâ MicronTech (@MicronTech) April 27, 2017 Micron is Idahoâs largest publicly traded company. It employs about 6,000 people in Boise, more than any other for-profit enterprise. Mehrotra, 58, was one of three immigrants who co-founded SanDisk in the Silicon Valley in 1988, a decade after Micronâs founding in Boise. SanDisk makes flash memory chips, which Micron also makes. Flash memory is used in solid-state drives that have replaced many hard drives, and in smartphones and tablets. It is slower but cheaper than dynamic random-access memory, which Micron manufactures but SanDisk does not. Flash retains data when the deviceâs power is shut off, while DRAM does not. SanDisk and the larger Micron rivaled one another for years in the global flash-memory market. In the early 2000s, SanDisk sued Micron alleging patent infringement. The companies settled. In 2005, on the day Micron and Intel announced a $5.2 billion in a joint venture to make memory products in Micron plants in Utah and Virginia, SanDiskâs stock price plunged 17 percent. After Micron announced in 2015 that it and Intel Corp. had developed a new, more powerful data-storage technology that the companies named 3D XPoint, SanDisk announced that it had teamed up with Hewlett-Packard Co. to develop new technology as well. But when SanDisk put itself up for sale, Micron took interest. Around the time of the SanDisk-HP announcement, Bloomberg News reported that Micron and Western Digital Corp., which makes hard drives, were in talks with SanDisk about possibly acquiring it. Western Digital eventually bought SanDisk for $19 billion, and Mehrotra stepped down. His arrival at Micron comes as the company enjoys strong revenues and profits. Micronâs most recent quarter was one of its best ever, with revenues up 58 percent from a year earlier. âMicron is proud to initiate this change in leadership from a position of strength,â the boardâs announcement said. Born in India, Mehrotra earned bachelorâs and masterâs degrees in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley. He helped pioneer flash storage solutions, and he guided a 17-year joint venture with Toshiba in NAND flash memory technology. He holds more than 70 patents. Â  Under Mehrota, the Micron board does not anticipate major changes in direction, but instead aims to âensure we continue to invest in areas of the business that will accelerate Micronâs market and technology position and enable timely delivery of new and innovative products,â a company statement said. SanDisk is based in Milpitas, Calif., bordering San Jose in Silicon Valley. Micron has an office there. Mehotra will work there and in the Boise headquarters. Durcan, who announced his retirement after 32 years with the company, will stay on as an adviser until August. He leaves a legacy as a strong CEO, especially for someone who never planned to have the job. In early 2012, Durcan announced he was leaving his post as Micronâs president and chief operating officer to spend time with his family. Then on Feb. 3, 2012, CEO and board chairman Steve Appleton was killed in a crash of an experimental aircraft near Boise Airport. âI donât think there is any question he rescued Micron at a moment when no one knew what was going to happen next,â Boise State University President Bob Kustra said after Durcanâs retirement announcement. Durcan plans to stay in Boise. He has accepted a position on the St. Lukeâs Health System board of directors. âWe deeply appreciate the immense contributions that Mark has made to our company,â Micron said. David Staats: 208-377-6417, @DavidStaats Sanjay Mehrotra Corporate Communication and Mark Provided by Micron Technology Inc. Outgoing Micron CEO Mark Durcan will stay on as an adviser to the company until early August.

Revenue rose 8% to $14.8 billion in the first quarter. Intel benefited especially from improvement in the personal-computer business, with operating profit in the segment that sells PC chips jumping 61% from a year earlier, as sales rose 5.7% to $7.98 billion. Amid the overall strength, though, profit in the division that sells chips for the servers used in data centers was hurt by an earlier shift to a more advanced manufacturing process that can improve chip performance but initially costs more. Intel said operating profit in its data-center division narrowed by 16%, while revenue rose 5.8% to $4.23 billion. Shares fell nearly 4% in after-hours trading. Intel's share price generally has lagged behind that of its semiconductor peers, losing roughly 2% in the year to date. Intel dominates its core markets of processor chips for PCs and servers. But its overwhelming market share leaves limited room to grow, and competition lately has emerged in both areas. A revitalized Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is building momentum in the PC market and has plans to sell server chips. Meanwhile, processors from Nvidia Corp. have found a place in data centers, and chips based on technology from ARM Holdings PLC are beginning to make headway. The PC market has been in a persistent decline, but PC shipments in the first quarter were better than expected. Research by International Data Corp. showed a marginal uptick in the first quarter, year on year, compared with its forecast of a 1.8% falloff. Sales of server chips have been expected to compensate for any PC shortfalls in 2017, driven by gargantuan internet operations such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google Cloud Platform, Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Corp.'s Azure. The three cloud-computing giants together spent $31.54 billion on data centers in 2016, according to company filings -- up 22% from the previous year. Intel aims to spur growth by investing heavily in areas where it has room to gain share. In March, it agreed to spend $15.3 billion to buy Israeli car-camera pioneer Mobileye NV in a deal it expects to close by the end of the year, and it has budgeted $12 billion in annual capital expenditures, largely to build its memory business and beef up its manufacturing facilities, it has said. Opportunities in automotive, memory, mobile, and the addition of computing and communications to a wide variety of items -- a trend known as the Internet of Things -- will amount to a total market of $220 billion by 2021, Intel has said. Overall for the quarter, Intel reported net profit of 61 cents a share. Adjusted earnings, excluding restructuring charges and certain items arising from acquisitions and related taxes, were 66 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share on $14.81 billion in revenue. For 2017, Intel raised its adjusted profit projection by a nickel to $2.85 a share, and said it expects $60 billion in revenue. It had previously guided for the top line to remain flat from 2016's $59.4 billion.

Noctua confirms LGA 2066 will host Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X by Zak Killian Â 10:09 AM on April 27, 2017 We've heard rumors from pretty reliable sources, but Noctua just gave us our first official confirmation that Intel's next high-end desktop platform will use the LGA 2066 socket. In a press release about heatsink support for the new socket, Noctua says that most of its current coolers support "the new LGA 2066 socket of Intel's 'Basin Falls' X299 platform for Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs out of the box," and that it will provide updated mounting hardware for older heatsinks at no additional charge. This isn't exactly a surprise to anyone who's been keeping an eye out for rumors, but it's nice to have an official source. It's also great to see Noctua keeping up its strong post-sale support. Noctua even says the heatsink mounting mechanism on LGA 2066 is "identical" to that of LGA 2011. Going by that statement, even other companies' LGA 2011-compatible heatsinks are likely to fit LGA 2066, and the socket dimensions are likely very similar, too. If you need updated mounting hardware, just contact Noctua with your proof of purchase. Tags: Cooling Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The company's shares fell nearly 4 per cent to $35.97 in trading after the bell on Thursday. Revenue from Intel's higher-margin data centre business rose 6 per cent to $4.2 billion in the first quarter. That was less than the 9 per cent jump a year-ago and the 8 per cent increase in the fourth quarter. "I think the Street was looking for slightly better than that," Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Analysts were expecting revenue to increase 10 per cent to about $4.4 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. The slowdown in revenue growth comes after Intel warned in February that business's margins could be hit by higher costs. However, Intel still expects the business to grow in the high single-digit percentage rate this year, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a call. Forecast Raised Intel marginally raised its full-year revenue forecast, which Krzanich said was due to average selling prices across its businesses trending ahead of expectations. The Santa Clara-based company expects 2017 revenue of about $60 billion. It had earlier forecast revenue would be flat compared with 2016 revenue of $59.4 billion. Intel increased its share buyback programme by $10 billion to about $15 billion and also raised its 2017 adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents to $2.85 per share, plus or minus 5 per cent. The company has previously said it expects its deal to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV , announced last month, to boost adjusted profit. The acquisition thrusts Intel into the forefront of the market to develop driverless systems. The deal, along with a focus on cloud computing, will also help Intel reduce its dependence on the PC market. Intel gets most of its revenue from selling chips used in PCs. Its PC business returned to growth in 2016 as demand stabilized in the second half of the year. Demand also unexpectedly edged up in the first quarter, according to research firm IDC. That helped revenue from the client computing group, as Intel calls the business, increase 6 percent to $8 billion, matching estimates. Intel's total revenue rose 8 per cent to $14.80 billion, falling short of analysts' estimate of $14.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income jumped 45 per cent to $2.96 billion. Excluding items, Intel earned 66 cents per share, one cent above analysts' estimate.Â  Read More On Intel Corp | Intel | Intel Results | Intel Revenue | Reliance | International | Companies PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Cover from Natural Calamities.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login Home News Prey Spec me up: Prey PC system requirements confirmed By Alice O'Connor on April 27th, 2017 at 5:56 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit If youâve been cooing and making kissy faces through the window at the upcoming new Prey [official site], Arkaneâs sci-fi remix of Dishonored, you might have heard a demo is out today. Itâs not for us. No, the demo with the first hour-or-so of the game is only for consoles. Given how many big games launch with performance problems, itâs a shame we wonât get to have a crack on our own PCs. Publishers Bethesda have at least confirmed system requirements, which giveâ¦ a vague indication of how it might potentially run? Check your spec: Minimum CPU: Intel i5-2400, AMD FX-8320 GPU: GTX 660 2GB, AMD Radeon 7850 2GB Memory: 8 GB Recommended CPU: Intel i7-2600K, AMD FX-8350 GPU: GTX 970 4GB, AMD R9 290 4GB Memory: 16 GB Thatâs all good and well on paper but in reality, who knows? Now that Steam gives out refunds more freely, it will be possible to buy Prey, play it for up to two hours to get a sense of how it runs, then refund if itâs wonked, but that process sucks. Itâs a chore to go through, and buying a good-lookinâ game only to discover it doesnât run well is a big disappointment. Of course, it might run just dandy. It might be all sunshine and rainbows blasted into your eyes at 180fps. I do not know. But this sucks when a demo is on consoles. I have no insider knowledge but I would be surprised if this last week before the gameâs launch next Friday, May 5th, isnât being used to polish up the PC version. Given the response to Dishonored 2 â which is a neat-o game beneath its technical problems, to be clear â I canât imagine Bethesda much fancy a repeat of that. As for whatâs in the advanced graphics options menu (the most exciting part of any PC game for some, I know), Bethesda say to expect: Object Detail Shadow Quality Texture Quality Anisotropic Filtering Anti-Aliasing Horizontal Field of View Screen Space Directional Occlusion Screen Space Reflections You can always watch our Alec play that first hour (or with commentary), if youâd like.

If I remember correctly this uses the same engine as Dishonored 2, no? Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:25 G-Lord says: Itâs not the same engine (luckily). Prey uses a modified CryEngine. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:59 geisler says: Quite right. Dishonored 2 on the other hand used the Void Engine, based on a heavily modified idTech 5. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 21:03 haldolium says: luckily? CE can be even more of a disaster when it comes to optimization and performance issues as idTech. CE games frequently have a very poor performance/visual proportion and scale badly downwards. Especially these days with many proprietary engines delivering visuals equally great for what the CE once had ahead of them, I really do not welcome the choice. I highly hope PREY will have a professional touch from programmers with excellent CE knowledge. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 22:33 Earl-Grey says: Oh! Well thatâs potentially good news though, isnât it? Donât know where I got the idea that Dishonored 2 and Prey shared the same engine! Maybe I just automatically assumed Arkane used the same engine for both games.

I watched some footage but am interested in playing the first hour or whatever myself. Looking forward to reviews of this one. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:18 brucethemoose says: I donât like it when they only use high end, old hardware as the only baseline. To me, that says âYeah, we had some equipment from 2011 lying around. We dusted it off, and the port starts up and runs on that! So itâs ready for PC!â. I know thatâs not the reality, but reguardless, for a company thatâs done VERY well (sales wise) on PC before, they donât seem to have much enthusiasm for the platform. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:31 Veav says: They had my pre-order until they left PC off the demo list. I couldnât handwave that. :/ Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:36 Scelous says: I took it more from a marketing standpoint as, âWe donât want to alienate our PC base, especially casuals or poor people, so letâs not even go near the newer high-end stuff.â Thatâs how I received it, anyways. Which I donât think is bad. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 23:54 fish99 says: 970 isnât exactly top end, and never was, and thatâs recommended not minimum. Minimum is a 660 which was mid-range when it was new, which is a long time ago now. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 19:22 ColonelFlanders says: Iâm sceptical about the PC release of this. Dishonored 2 didnât exactly run like butter when it came out, and frankly isnât even with the updates. I will be holding fire on this one for a few weeks after release I think Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 19:26 phuzz says: Nice to see my graphics card is still hitting ârecommendedâ spec. Log in to Reply 28/04/2017 at 00:06 ColonelFlanders says: I think the GTX970 will be the card to have for at least another 18 months. When I finally have to retire mine I think Iâll go for a 2nd gen ryzen while Iâm at it. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 19:44 Unclepauly says: That sad part is the specs are 480P for the min and 720P for the recommended, ultra will require 12 core i7âs/36gb/dual 1080tiâs.

The Data Center Group had sales of $4.2 billion in the three months ending April 1, Intel said in a statement Thursday. Thatâs below the companyâs long-term goal of double-digit percentage growth and points to more weakness in corporate buying of equipment. Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, Intel is trying to spread its bets away from a personal computer market thatâs been declining since it peaked in 2011. Sales of server chips, which have helped it make up for that fall off in its main market, arenât expanding as quickly as Intel projected as corporate demand remains stagnant. âItâs all going to be about data center,â said said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. âThe cloud guys have been building. Intelâs problem is that enterprise has been weak.â Intelâs division that provides chips for the PC business again showed growth, expanding revenue by 6 percent to $8 billion. Its memory chips sales jumped 55 percent to $866 million. Intel Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said the company is sticking to its long-term target of âlow-double digitâ percentage growth for the data center unit. For this year the company is predicting expansion in the âhigh single-digits.â The company is seeing strong orders from cloud data center operators -- a group that includes Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.âs web services division -- and networking customers, while corporations and government buyers are delaying purchases. âThat continues to be a challenge for us given that itâs the biggest portion of the business,â said Swan. Overall the company âfeels good about where we are.â Intel said the earnings period in the first quarter of 2016 included one more week than this year. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Revenue will be $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million, in the current period, the Santa Clara, California-based company said. Analysts had projected $14.3 billion, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Intel also lifted its annual revenue prediction by $500 million and added 5 cents to its earnings-per-share forecast for 2017. Itâs allocating an addition $10 billion to its stock repurchase plan. First-quarter net income was $3 billion, or 61 cents a share, compared with $2 billion, or 42 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales rose 8 percent to $14.8 billion. On average analysts had estimated a profit of 57 cents on $14.8 billion of revenue. Excluding certain items, profit was 66 cents a share. On that basis, analysts had projected 65 cents a share. PC shipments recorded their first quarterly growth in five years, researcher IDC said earlier this month. While that was a break in a multi-year slide for the whole industry, the gain of less than 1 percent from a year earlier underscored persistent weakness in demand, especially from consumers. Still, thatâs better than Intelâs prediction of a decline in the mid-single-digit percent range in 2017. Intel shares fell in extended trading following the announcement. The stock has lagged its peers this year, gaining 3.2 percent, compared with a 13 percent advance by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. In March Intel said it would acquire Mobileye NV for about $15 billion, paying one of the highest takeover premiums this century to play catch-up in the market for technology that helps cars drive themselves. The offer, the largest ever for an Israeli company, was a 34 percent more than Mobileyeâs closing price before it was announced. Intel estimates the market for vehicle systems, data and services will be worth as much as $70 billion by 2030. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Gen. Michael Flynn Registers as Foreign Agent Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn Registers as Foreign Agent Duration: 01:55s - Published: on March 10, 2017<Â >Â Embed Donald Trump Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn's firm filed the paperwork for work conducted between August and November 2016. 1 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost onÂ  RedditShare by Email Â  Transcript: Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn Registers as Foreign Agent DespiteÂ  his firing Â last month, President Trump's former National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has raised more questions for White House press secretary Sean Spicer to answer. "Was the president aware that Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was acting as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be the national security adviser?" Fox News correspondent John Roberts asked Spicer at aÂ  press briefing Â Thursday. Spicer responded, "I don't believe that that was known." On Wednesday, several outlets reported Flynn's firm registered him as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice for work that "could be construed to have principally benefitted the Republic of Turkey." Though Flynn's firm's lobbying for Inovo BV wasÂ  previously known Â and drew concerns since he was gettingÂ  classified intelligence briefings Â with the Trump campaign, the most recent filing provides new insight into Flynn's contacts. In August 2016, Flynn Intel Group Inc. was retained by the Netherlands-based consulting firm Inovo BV for research into Fethullah GÃ¼len and his associations with U.S. charter schools. It was paid $530,000 for its work.Â  According toÂ  the filings , which areÂ  available online Â through theÂ  Department of Justice , Inovo BV hired Flynn's firm to work on a project that "focused on improving U.S. business organizations' confidence regarding doing business in Turkey." The information would potentially be shared with third parties. GÃ¼len's the former Turkish Muslim cleric who is living in Pennsylvania. The Turkish government blames him for last summer'sÂ  failed coup Â and isÂ  seeking his extradition . Flynn, at the invitation of Inovo's founder, met with Turkish officials including the ministers of foreign affairs and energy in New York in September. The meeting, as described in the filings, was to provide a better understanding of Turkey's political climate "as background for the project." The filings state Flynn Intel Group's work with Inovo ended Nov. 15, 2016. It shut down later that month after President Trump tapped Flynn to be his national security adviser. The filings say to the best of the firm's knowledge, the information wasn't shared with third parties â like, say, the Turkish government. But to play it safe, it decided to file the necessary paperwork under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Flynn Intel Group Inc.Â  registered under Â theÂ  Lobbying Disclosure Act Â in September 2016 after it was retained. SEE MORE: Trump Says He Would Have Told Flynn To Discuss Sanctions Flynn wroteÂ  an op-ed Â published on Election Day that said the U.S. "should not provide [GÃ¼len] safe haven." Inovo didn't direct Flynn to write the article, but it did get a copy ahead of its publication, according to the filings. The filings state Flynn only made "technical edits" to the article "based on feedback from Inovo." The firm doesn't believe Inovo shared information regarding the op-ed with the Turkish government. In aÂ  series of tweets Â Wednesday, Inovo's founder, Ekim Alptekin, called the foreign agent filing "flawed." HeÂ  also said Â Flynn "never engaged in lobbying work for me or my firm. And I never lobbied or contracted lobbyist on behalf of the Turkish Government." The fillings come in the wake of numerous reportsÂ  that Trump Â and members of his team â including Flynn âÂ  didn't disclose Â meetings with Russian officialsÂ  during the campaign Â and theÂ  presidential transition .Â  Spicer said of Flynn on Thursday: "He wasn't being compensated as part of the transition as far as I am aware, and so he was a private citizen at the time. ... There's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed."

(NASDAQ: INTC) released its most recent earnings report after markets closed on Thursday. The chip manufacturing giant had $0.66 in earnings per share (EPS) and $14.8 billion in revenue, compared to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates which called for $0.65 in EPS and $14.81 billion in revenue. Last yearâs first quarter had $0.54 in EPS and $13.8 billion in revenue. In terms of the outlook for the second quarter, Intel expects to see revenues around $14.4 billion, give or take $500 million, and EPS in the range of $0.63 to $0.73. The consensus estimates for the coming quarter are calling for $0.64 in EPS and $14.34 billion in revenue. The company reported its business segment revenues as: Client Computing Group revenue increased 6% to $8.0 billion. Data Center Group revenue was up 6% to $4.2 billion. Internet of Things Group revenue jumped 11% to $721 million. Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue increased 55% to $866 million. Intel Security Group revenue of $534 million, down 1%. Programmable Solutions Group revenue was up 18% to $425 million. During the first quarter, Intel also generated about $3.9 billion in cash from operations, paid dividends of $1.2 billion, and used $1.2 billion to repurchase 35 million shares of stock. The board of directors also has approved a $10 billion increase to Intelâs share buyback program, which brings the amount currently available for future buybacks to approximately $15 billion. Brian Krzanich, Intelâs CEO, commented: The first quarter was another record quarter, coming off a record 2016. We continued to grow our company, shipped our disruptive new Optane memory technology, and positioned Intel to lead in new areas like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. The ASP strength we saw across nearly every segment of the business demonstrates continued demand for high-performance computing, which will only increase with the explosion of data. Shares of Intel closed Thursday up 1.4% at $37.43. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $29.50 to $38.45 and a consensus analyst price target of $39.97. After earnings were released the stock was initially down 3.5% at $36.13 in the after-hours session.

(AP Photo/John Locher) The Trump Russia investigation has spread in so many directions, and sparked so much crazy commentary, that it's hard to keep track of it all. So here is a guide to help you keep your eye on the ball: 1) Substance is what matters, Part 1. From the very beginning, there was only one central question in the investigation: Did Donald Trump or his associates collude with Russians in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election? So far we've seen evidence of some in the Trump circle having contact with Russians â see the Roger Stone DMs with Guccifer 2.0 â but we have seen nothing to prove, or even lend much support to, the contention that anyone on the extended Trump team coordinated election interference with Russians. Related Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2619071 2) Substance is what matters, Part 2. In recent weeks, a second Big Question has emerged: Did the Obama administration spy on the Trump campaign and/or transition team? That's the issue at the heart of the Devin Nunes brouhaha, and the answer â did this happen or not? â is more important than where or how Nunes got his information. 3) When either side yells about process, they're holding a weak hand. Some Republicans have tried to distract from the was-there-collusion question by focusing on the leak of classified information regarding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador. That's a legitimate issue â and indeed, the only known crime committed so far â but it doesn't get to the main issue of whether or not TrumpWorld colluded with Russians. Likewise, when Democrats yell about the methods House Intel Committee chairman Nunes employed to obtain evidence that might point toward Obama administration spying â that means they don't want to talk about Obama administration spying. 4) Everyone should see the Nunes documents. In a smart â and belated â move Thursday, White House counsel Don McGahn invited the chairmen and ranking members of both House and Senate intelligence committees to come to the White House to view the documents Nunes saw. House Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff took McGahn up on it, but the Senate is making noise about demanding the documents be brought to the Senate. Enough with the turf battles; the investigation will be better off if both Senate Intel chairman Richard Burr and vice chairman Mark Warner go see the documents. 5) Mike Flynn's request for immunity is no big deal. Of course the former national security adviser wants immunity; he's under investigation by the FBI. But the public does not know exactly what Flynn is under investigation for. It is known that the Obama Justice Department used a possible violation of the never-successfully-prosecuted Logan Act as the reed-thin pretense for going to the White House with its concerns about Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador during the transition. It's also known that there was nothing wrong with Flynn talking to the ambassador, even talking specifically about U.S. sanctions on Russia. What is not known is how the Flynn investigation might have spread into other areas â Turkey? â or whether it focuses on an alleged process crime like making a false statement to investigators. In any event, the House and Senate investigations can go forward without Flynn's testimony. 6) Don't fetishize "sources and methods." If it has been said once, it's been said a thousand times in this investigation: This or that potentially critical bit of information cannot be made public because to do so would compromise the intelligence community's "sources and methods." The problem is, this is an investigation of the highest priority; some Democrats hope it will result in removing President Trump from office. Resolving it is of great national concern. And if "sources and methods" would indeed be damaged, well they have been damaged at times in the past, to be repaired later. Yes, it is not something to be done lightly, but it is time for the intelligence community to release more, not less, information on the Trump-Russia matter. 7) Don't forget Manafort and Stone. Given what is publicly known now, the two prime suspects in the Russia collusion investigation are former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has long had business dealings in that part of the world, and Roger Stone, who just likes to mix things up in the course of campaigns. Both have volunteered to testify before the House and Senate â Stone is demanding to do so publicly, while Manafort's representatives have not yet said whether he wants to do the same or testify in some sort of closed session. In either event, congressional investigators should get their testimony, and soon, and as publicly as possible. 8) Say yes to Clapper, Brennan, and Yates. House chairman Nunes famously canceled a hearing planned for last Tuesday in which two former top intelligence officials and a former top Justice Department official were scheduled to testify. Nunes' stated reason was that he wanted to receive closed-door testimony from the FBI's James Comey and the NSA's Michael Rogers before going ahead. Comey slowed things down by demanding an invitation signed by both Nunes and Schiff â and then the Democrat chose not to sign until the Clapper, Brennan, and Yates hearing was re-scheduled. The solution is easy: Make everybody testify. And if there are more questions, make them testify again. 9) Watch what the Senate Judiciary Committee does on the issue of the Christopher Steele dossier. On February 28, the Washington Post published an intriguing story, reporting that last fall the FBI reached an agreement to pay Trump dirt-digger Christopher Steele, who had been working for supporters of the Hillary Clinton campaign, to continue his work for the FBI. The idea that the FBI would foot the bill for oppo research during a campaign struck many as amazing. One of those was Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley. On March 6, Grassley wrote a letter to Comey demanding more information. So far, he's received no answer. Then, on Tuesday, Grassley wrote another letter with more questions, focusing heavily on FBI number-two Andrew McCabe. Grassley is patient and persistent. Look for him to discover something. 10) Yes, what Evelyn Farkas said is important. Democrats are pooh-poohing Republican excitement over a just-noticed March 2 MSNBC interview in which former Obama Defense Department official Evelyn Farkas â she left the administration in 2015 â described how, during the transition, she urged her former colleagues to compile and distribute classified information regarding the Trump team. Farkas said she feared "that the Trump folks â if they found out how we knew what we knew about their, the Trump staff, dealing with Russians â that they would try to compromise those sources and methods." Farkas' statement clearly supports the Obama-Trump "breadcrumbs" theory, and the "if they found out how we knew what we knew" suggests â doesn't prove, but suggests â that the Obama team used some sort of irregular methods in its Trump information collection. Investigators need to know more about what Farkas said, and to whom. 11) In the end, it's probably all going to be about process. This is not a guarantee, but in the past, a lot of Washington "scandals" that seemed very hot for a while ended in a whimper. No one was charged with any underlying crime. If anyone was charged, it was with process crimes like making false statements to investigators or withholding information from Congress. What seemed world-shaking at one moment ended up much less. It could turn out that the Russia-helped-Trump-and-Obama-spied-on-Trump twin scandals end much the same way.

With XOM stock now trading near 52-week lows, investors who have waited for a good entry point now have their chance. Source: Shutterstock The recent decline in oil prices hasÂ pressured the entire sector, sending the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF)Â (NYSEARCA:XLE) down 10% year to date and 9% over the past three months. And, XOM stock, which closed Friday at $80.69, has been one of the hardest equities hit, falling 10.6% on the year. Concerns about a global oil supplies glut has sent oil prices below $50 per barrel, heightening fears about the sustainability of several large energy players, including Exxon peers such as BP plc (ADR) (NYSE:BP) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). But, with almost $4 billion in cash on the balance sheet and another $22 billion in operating cash flow, the Texas-based integrated oil giant isnât going anywhere, despite being one of the worst-performing equities in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. And, when Exxonâs earnings are released, much of the fear will subside, making its 3.68% annual dividend yield an attractive quality to own ahead of Fridayâs results. For the quarter that ended in March, Wall Street expects Exxon to earn 87 cents per share on revenue of $67.34 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 102% and 38.3%, respectively. For the full year that ends December, analysts forecast earnings of $3.92 per share, compared to $2.37 per share last year, while full-year revenue of $294.46 billion would mark an increase of 31% year over year. Whether youâre looking at it from the current quarter or full year, there is nothing conservative about these numbers. Oil prices may be trending in the wrong direction at various points of the year, killing hopes of prices reaching $60 or $80 per barrel at some point in 2017. But, with Exxonâs quarterly earnings per share expected to surge more than 100% year over year, the company is doing more than making the best of a bad situation. Bottom Line for XOM Stock XOM stock, which is tied to the price of oil, is not going to impress with breathtaking gains over the next 12-18 months, but with cash flow still on the rise combined with 3.68% annual yield, patience is still the best strategy. And with the XOM stock price at just 17 times fiscal 2018 earnings-per-share estimates of $4.62, XOM stock should reach $100 in the next 12-18 months, delivering 24% returns. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Gen Michael Flynn gestures as he arrives with his son Michael G. Flynn, left, at Trump Tower in New York. (Carolyn Kaster / Associated Press) By Dan Lamothe and Ed OâKeefe Washington Post Twitter Facebook Â Email Â Reddit Â SMS The Pentagonâs top watchdog has launched an investigation into money that former national security adviser and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn received from foreign groups, members of the House Oversight Committee said Thursday. The Pentagon office will try to determine whether Flynn âfailed to obtain required approval prior to receivingâ the payments, according to an April 11 letter from Defense Department Inspector General Glenn Fine to Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the committee chairman. In the past, the Pentagon has advised retiring officers that because they can be recalled to military service, they may be subject to the Constitutionâs rarely enforced emoluments clause, which prohibits top officials from receiving payments or favors from foreign governments. Flynn received $45,000 to appear in 2015 with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a gala dinner for RT, a Kremlin-controlled media organization. He also worked as a foreign agent representing Turkish interests for a Netherlands-based company, Inovo BV, which paid his company, Flynn Intel Group, $530,000 in the fall. Defense Department guidelines warn that the departmentâs top financial officer, the comptroller, âmay pursue debt collectionâ if a retired officer does not seek permission to accept foreign payments before doing so. Any debt collection due to an emoluments clause violation is capped at no more than what an individual makes in retirement pay during a period of unauthorized employment. In Flynnâs case, that is more than $35,000 for the three months of the Inovo project. Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after revelations that he misled Vice President Pence about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The pugnacious retired officer, who once led âlock her upâ chants about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during Donald Trumpâs White House campaign, filed paperwork as a foreign agent about three weeks later, on March 7. Flynnâs lawyer, Robert Kelner, has argued that the retired general briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency, from which he retired in 2014, before and after his 2015 Russia trip. But a letter DIA sent the House committee said that the agency has no record of Flynn seeking permission or approval to accept money from a foreign source, potentially countering Kelnerâs argument. He could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. Flynn also did not seek permission from the U.S. government to work as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interests, U.S. defense officials said last month, raising the possibility that the Pentagon could dock his retirement pay. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said then that the Defense Department was reviewing the issue. The issue involving Turkey emerged after Flynn retroactively registered in March with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for work that his company, Flynn Intel Group, carried out on behalf of Inovo BV. It is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin, who is not a part of the Turkish government but has links to it. Flynnâs company received three payments between September and November from Inovo BV before Trump was elected president and the arrangement was discontinued, according to Flynnâs filings. Flynn is the majority owner and chief executive officer of the Flynn Intel Group. On Thursday, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, Md., the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, also released an Oct. 8, 2014, letter in which a Defense Department lawyer warned Flynn upon his retirement from military service that he was forbidden from receiving payments from foreign sources without receiving permission from the U.S. government first. âThese documents raise grave questions about why Gen. Flynn concealed the payments he received from foreign sources after he was warned explicitly by the Pentagon,â Cummings said. âOur next step is to get the documents we are seeking from the White House so we can complete our investigation. I thank the Department of Defense for providing us with unclassified versions of these documents.â Bruce Anderson, a spokesman for the Defense Department inspector general, said Thursday that the investigation into Flynn began April 4. The watchdogâs office did not discuss the investigation publicly until after the House Oversight Committee released documents about it, and it typically does not disclose what it is reviewing while an investigation is underway. âWhat I saw today confirms we ought to keep digging,â Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., said after reviewing documents in a basement-level room. He declined to share specifics about what the documents entail, but said Republican members of the oversight panel should be pushing the White House to release more information about what top administration officials knew about Flynn during the presidential campaign, transition and in the early days of Trumpâs presidency. The latest revelations from the Pentagon came as congressional Democrats put more pressure on Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to make good on vows to investigate the Flynn matter. Democrats on the panel reminded Chaffetz that for years he has warned witnesses that complying with committee requests âis not an optional exercise.â âYour decisions on this investigation will have a profound impact on the faith that the American people have in Congress to act in an even-handed manner and fulfill our duty under the Constitution to exercise robust oversight of the Executive Branch, regardless of who occupies the White House,â the Democrats added. Chaffetz announced on Wednesday that he is planning to take a medical leave of up to four weeks to repair screws implanted in his foot years ago after an accident. It is likely that House GOP leaders will appoint an interim chairman in his absence.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login Home News Prey Spec me up: Prey PC system requirements confirmed By Alice O'Connor on April 27th, 2017 at 5:56 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit If youâve been cooing and making kissy faces through the window at the upcoming new Prey [official site], Arkaneâs sci-fi remix of Dishonored, you might have heard a demo is out today. Itâs not for us. No, the demo with the first hour-or-so of the game is only for consoles. Given how many big games launch with performance problems, itâs a shame we wonât get to have a crack on our own PCs. Publishers Bethesda have at least confirmed system requirements, which giveâ¦ a vague indication of how it might potentially run? Check your spec: Minimum CPU: Intel i5-2400, AMD FX-8320 GPU: GTX 660 2GB, AMD Radeon 7850 2GB Memory: 8 GB Recommended CPU: Intel i7-2600K, AMD FX-8350 GPU: GTX 970 4GB, AMD R9 290 4GB Memory: 16 GB Thatâs all good and well on paper but in reality, who knows? Now that Steam gives out refunds more freely, it will be possible to buy Prey, play it for up to two hours to get a sense of how it runs, then refund if itâs wonked, but that process sucks. Itâs a chore to go through, and buying a good-lookinâ game only to discover it doesnât run well is a big disappointment. Of course, it might run just dandy. It might be all sunshine and rainbows blasted into your eyes at 180fps. I do not know. But this sucks when a demo is on consoles. I have no insider knowledge but I would be surprised if this last week before the gameâs launch next Friday, May 5th, isnât being used to polish up the PC version. Given the response to Dishonored 2 â which is a neat-o game beneath its technical problems, to be clear â I canât imagine Bethesda much fancy a repeat of that. As for whatâs in the advanced graphics options menu (the most exciting part of any PC game for some, I know), Bethesda say to expect: Object Detail Shadow Quality Texture Quality Anisotropic Filtering Anti-Aliasing Horizontal Field of View Screen Space Directional Occlusion Screen Space Reflections You can always watch our Alec play that first hour (or with commentary), if youâd like.

Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:59 geisler says: Quite right. Dishonored 2 on the other hand used the Void Engine, based on a heavily modified idTech 5. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 21:03 haldolium says: luckily? CE can be even more of a disaster when it comes to optimization and performance issues as idTech. CE games frequently have a very poor performance/visual proportion and scale badly downwards. Especially these days with many proprietary engines delivering visuals equally great for what the CE once had ahead of them, I really do not welcome the choice. I highly hope PREY will have a professional touch from programmers with excellent CE knowledge. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 22:33 Earl-Grey says: Oh! Well thatâs potentially good news though, isnât it? Donât know where I got the idea that Dishonored 2 and Prey shared the same engine! Maybe I just automatically assumed Arkane used the same engine for both games.

To me, that says âYeah, we had some equipment from 2011 lying around. We dusted it off, and the port starts up and runs on that! So itâs ready for PC!â. I know thatâs not the reality, but reguardless, for a company thatâs done VERY well (sales wise) on PC before, they donât seem to have much enthusiasm for the platform.

Which I donât think is bad. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 23:54 fish99 says: 970 isnât exactly top end, and never was, and thatâs recommended not minimum. Minimum is a 660 which was mid-range when it was new, which is a long time ago now. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 19:22 ColonelFlanders says: Iâm sceptical about the PC release of this.

Acer's latest Surface-style device, the Switch 5, offers a couple of advantagesÂ but lacks in other areas. I had a chance to play with the Switch 5 at an Acer event in New York City, where new PCs and tablets were announced. The Switch 5 is a tablet first, but a keyboard attachment can be hooked up to make it a laptop. As a tablet, the Switch 5 is quite light, about the equivalent of the Surface Pro 4. The device doesn't look as polished as the Surface Pro, nor does it have the premium finish. But it does have solid technologies, like the latest Intel processor and liquid cooling, that set it apart from rival devices. Acer has priced the Switch 5 at US$799 for the U.S. market, which is higher than the $749 starting price of the Surface Pro. Surprisingly, the Switch 5 is priced starting at a ridiculous â¬1,099 ($1,192) -- almost $400 more -- for the European market. It will be available in the U.S. and Europe in June, and it will ship in China in July. The Switch 5 runs Intel's Kaby Lake chips, putting it a full generation ahead of Surface Pro 4, which has the slower Skylake chips. The Acer tablet also has a USB-C port, giving it an edge over Surface Pro, which has a USB 3.0 port. It's not entirely clear if Microsoft will release a Surface Pro 5 based on Kaby Lake, but if so, it could include a USB-C port. The 12-inch Acer tablet has a 2160 x 1440 display, and the screen was sharp. It was hard to do instant benchmarking of the Switch 5 unit, which had a Core i7 chip. But the programs loaded instantly, and the graphics were flawless. In an eye test, the performance was similar to the Dell XPS 13 I use on a daily basis. The magnetic keyboard attachment clipped on to the tablet much like the keyboard for the Surface Pro 4. Inside the tablet is 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM, which is slower from the DDR4 memory going into the latest laptops.Â That's a disappointmentÂ and an area where Acer decided to cut corners. The Switch 5 can be configured with 256GB to 512GB of solid-state drive storage. Acer promoted the device's hinge -- which allows the tablet to stand on a table -- as being a difference maker, but it felt cheaply made. The Surface 4 hinge feels more solid and offers more flexibility for positioning the device. The Switch 5 was silent, and there was no sound of a fan. That's because it has liquid cooling technology inside, using a pipe inside to move water to keep components cool. That has helped reduce the size of the device, and also make it lighter. The tablet is just 9.6-millimeters thick. The Surface Pro 4, by contrast, has a fan to dissipate heat generated by components. The Acer tablet has 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and offers battery life about 10.5 hours, according to the company. It also has a 2-megapixel front camera and a 5-megapixel rear camera. It's priced similar to the Surface Pro 4, so a buying decision comes down to what you want. It's worth buying partly for the Kaby Lake processor and USB Type-C port, but if Microsoft upgrades its Surface Pro, then that decision becomes tougher. The Switch 5 will be a good 2-in-1 device for running productivity software, but it seems overpriced partly because it has some weak features, including DDR3 memory and low-resolution cameras. âCIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Source: Wikimedia (Modified) Once Canadaâs most valuable company, with VRX stock trading north of $300 in the summer of 2015, Valeant Pharmaceuticals has become synonymous with corporate greed. The company has shot itself in the foot on multiple occasions for precisely the sort of thing that happened on Friday. In this case âprice gouging.â And investors saw it right away. VRX stock, which had already plunged 41% year to date, closed Friday at $8.52, down 4.17%. The company thinks Siliq â rights for which it acquired from AstraZeneca plc (ADR) (NYSE:AZN) â is the answer to its financial problems. Siliq is an injectable drug intended for patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms of the chronic skin condition, who havenât responded to other medications. But at $3,500 per month, Valeant is pricing Siliq in a range where the people who need it may struggle to get it. Valeant, however, proclaimed that $3,500 price tag was âthe lowest injectable biologic psoriasis treatment currently on the market.â The company, which plans to start selling and marketing Siliq in the second half of this year, insists that the price was evaluated and approved by its Patient Access and Pricing Committee â a group formed a year ago by Valeant after it suffered a spate of negative publicity related to questionable drug pricing practices. With some $30 billion in debt on its balance sheet, Valeant is desperate for cash and Siliqâs aggressive price speaks to that despair. But there is time and many expenses between now and when the drugâsÂ sales get to aÂ level that can help Valeant boost its operating income. Even then â and as a matter of making âends meetâ â Valeant would still need to successfully renegotiate down its debt covenants. Bottom Line for VRX Stock With VRX stock falling more than 96% from its all-time high, some value investors might think Fridayâs decline was a buying opportunity. But VRXÂ stock â which finally lost long-time supporter, activist hedge fund manager Bill Ackman â is still as toxic today as it was a year ago. Although there are still those drawn to the appeal of a cheap price, there is no indication that VRX can avoid tanking all the way to zero. Simply put, until Valeant can demonstrate it can consistently execute to grow revenue and profits, investors should stay away from VRX stock. The company, which is looking to sell off assets to grow cash, has not shown that it can be trusted. And, as it has done for the past year, the sharesÂ will continue to attract short sellers, who have been the only ones making money here. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 27, 2017 3:00pm Â  Comments Share: If you live for tech earnings, today is your day. Weâre wrapping up this weekâs round of earnings previews with a couple of older tech giants,Â  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). Both companies release quarterly results after market close today. On top of MSFT and INTC, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOG) are also reporting at the end of the day. Microsoft Earnings Around the Corner Since assuming the role of CEO at MSFT, Satya Nadella has focused on developing a strategy to lead the company forward as the industry increasingly shifts to cloud computing and companies look to develop a seamless, integrated user experience across platforms. MSFT is focused on a âcloud-first, mobile-firstâ strategy, according to Nadella. But when he says âmobile firstâ, heâs not referring to mobile devices. In 2014, he told CNBCâs Jon Fortt âwhen I say mobile-first, cloud-first, itâs not actually the mobility of the device, itâs the mobility of the human experience across devicesâ. He added that the cloud is what orchestrates that consumer experience. The companyâs intelligent cloud segment is expected to grow 8% thanks to strength in Azure, its cloud computing platform, according to Stifel analysts. They also project better-than-expected server transactional revenue due to recent Windows releases and new SQL server products. This will be the first full quarter that includes results from the LinkedIn acquisition. MSFT is reporting fiscal Q3 results today with expectations for earnings of $0.69 per share, up from $0.62 in fiscal Q3 2016, on revenue of $23.55 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. It has beat top and bottom-line expectations in the past three quarters. The stock is just off its all-time high of $68.31 hit on April 26. The options market has priced in about a 3.5% potential stock move in either direction around MSFTâs earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on theÂ thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading at the April 28 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 69 and 70 strike prices while puts were active at the 63 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 64th percentile. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Intel Earnings: Focus on Semiconductors The semiconductor industry that INTC is a part of has been a big focus this year in the tech sector. First-quarter earnings in the industry are expected to grow 48% year-over-year, according to FactSet Research. A lot of stocks in the industry rallied substantially and are close to record highs, possibly reflecting the expected future earnings growth. One thing to keep in mind is this can be a volatile, cyclical industry that changes at a rapid pace based on demand across many sectors. Depending on what type of semiconductors are in high demand, the expected earnings growth could be distributed unevenly throughout the industry. For the first quarter, INTC is expected to report earnings of $0.65 per share, up from $0.54 in Q4 2016, on revenue of $14.81 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. Revenues came in much higher than analysts expected in the last quarter, but earnings were only $0.03 higher than estimates, at $0.79 per share. The options market has priced in just over a 3% potential stock move in either direction around INTCâs earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator. In short-term options trading at the April 28 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 38.5 strike price while puts were active at the 34.5 and 37 strikes. Volume has been heavier on the call side. The implied volatility sits at the 58th percentile.

Its contents reveal how much space and what kind of rig youâll need to play the game. Letâs begin with the PC specs.Â  PreyÂ PC System Requirements & Video Settings Minimum CPU: Intel i5-2400, AMD FX-8320 GPU: GTX 660 2GB, AMD Radeon 7850 2GB Memory: 8 GB Recommended CPU: Intel i7-2600K, AMD FX-8350 GPU: GTX 970 4GB, AMD R9 290 4GB Memory: 16 GB Settings Object Detail Shadow Quality Texture Quality Anisotropic Filtering Anti-Aliasing Horizontal Field of View Screen Space Directional Occlusion Screen Space Reflections PS4 & XBOX ONE FILE SIZES PS4 : 42 GB recommended Xbox One: 38 GB recommended PRELOADING PS4 : 12 a.m. EDT (U.S.)/Midnight by territory (Europe) Friday Xbox One: 12 a.m. EDT Friday PC: Monday Console unlock times are midnight by territory. PC unlocks occur at 12:01 a.m. EDT. As expected, Bethesda says video drivers will be available for PC graphics cardsÂ before release. No further details were provided. We can only hope the PC build is optimized better than the developerâs previous game, Dishonored 2. These requirements donât appear outlandish enough to suggest a lackluster port job, but the 2016 gameâs poor performance is reason enough to be cautious. Read: Prey Gets Free Demo Just In Time For Its Release Date Prey is the next title in the Arkane Studios portfolio, and itâs intended to be a spiritual successor to 1994âs System Shock while also taking aÂ cue from Dishonored and BioShock. Its story follows a researcher named Morgan Yu. As he or she explores the space station on which they live, the character realizes not all is as it seems. Hostile aliens have taken over the craft. Are you a human fighting for survival, or are you one of them? Prey comes to PC, PS4 and Xbox One next Wednesday. A free demo can be downloaded now. Hereâs how to do it. How do these system requirements look to you? Is your PC good enough to run Prey? Tell us in the comments section!

The Mele PCG03 Apo features an Intel Celeron N3450 quad-core processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC storage, and Windows 10 Home 64-bit software. It also has an M.2 slot for an optional solid state drive, 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, a Gigabit Ethernet jack, USB 3.0 and USB Type-C ports, a 3.5mm headset jack, HDMI 2.0 and VGA ports. With a 6 watt, quad-core processor that supports 4K video output, the Mele PCG03 Apo could be used as media center, a digital signage system or point-of sales computer, or a general-purpose PC for folks that would rather have a small, quiet, inexpensive, and not-that-fast computer rather than a high-performance machine. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Mele said it planned to release Apollo Lake models like the PCG03 Apo in 2017, as well as higher-performance models with 15 watt Intel Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 Skylake and Kaby Lake processors. All of the companyâs Apollo Lake and Kaby Lake systems are expected to be fanless. via AndroidPC.es Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 1 Comment on "Mele PCG03 fanless Apollo Lake mini PC launches for $159" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by: Â  newest | oldest | most voted Guest Jerry Rioux Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open Â«Comment ReportingÂ» form.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login Home News Prey Spec me up: Prey PC system requirements confirmed By Alice O'Connor on April 27th, 2017 at 5:56 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit If youâve been cooing and making kissy faces through the window at the upcoming new Prey [official site], Arkaneâs sci-fi remix of Dishonored, you might have heard a demo is out today. Itâs not for us. No, the demo with the first hour-or-so of the game is only for consoles. Given how many big games launch with performance problems, itâs a shame we wonât get to have a crack on our own PCs. Publishers Bethesda have at least confirmed system requirements, which giveâ¦ a vague indication of how it might potentially run? Check your spec: Minimum CPU: Intel i5-2400, AMD FX-8320 GPU: GTX 660 2GB, AMD Radeon 7850 2GB Memory: 8 GB Recommended CPU: Intel i7-2600K, AMD FX-8350 GPU: GTX 970 4GB, AMD R9 290 4GB Memory: 16 GB Thatâs all good and well on paper but in reality, who knows? Now that Steam gives out refunds more freely, it will be possible to buy Prey, play it for up to two hours to get a sense of how it runs, then refund if itâs wonked, but that process sucks. Itâs a chore to go through, and buying a good-lookinâ game only to discover it doesnât run well is a big disappointment. Of course, it might run just dandy. It might be all sunshine and rainbows blasted into your eyes at 180fps. I do not know. But this sucks when a demo is on consoles. I have no insider knowledge but I would be surprised if this last week before the gameâs launch next Friday, May 5th, isnât being used to polish up the PC version. Given the response to Dishonored 2 â which is a neat-o game beneath its technical problems, to be clear â I canât imagine Bethesda much fancy a repeat of that. As for whatâs in the advanced graphics options menu (the most exciting part of any PC game for some, I know), Bethesda say to expect: Object Detail Shadow Quality Texture Quality Anisotropic Filtering Anti-Aliasing Horizontal Field of View Screen Space Directional Occlusion Screen Space Reflections You can always watch our Alec play that first hour (or with commentary), if youâd like.

If I remember correctly this uses the same engine as Dishonored 2, no? Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:25 G-Lord says: Itâs not the same engine (luckily). Prey uses a modified CryEngine. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:59 geisler says: Quite right. Dishonored 2 on the other hand used the Void Engine, based on a heavily modified idTech 5. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 21:03 haldolium says: luckily? CE can be even more of a disaster when it comes to optimization and performance issues as idTech. CE games frequently have a very poor performance/visual proportion and scale badly downwards. Especially these days with many proprietary engines delivering visuals equally great for what the CE once had ahead of them, I really do not welcome the choice. I highly hope PREY will have a professional touch from programmers with excellent CE knowledge. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 22:33 Earl-Grey says: Oh! Well thatâs potentially good news though, isnât it? Donât know where I got the idea that Dishonored 2 and Prey shared the same engine! Maybe I just automatically assumed Arkane used the same engine for both games.

I watched some footage but am interested in playing the first hour or whatever myself. Looking forward to reviews of this one. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:18 brucethemoose says: I donât like it when they only use high end, old hardware as the only baseline. To me, that says âYeah, we had some equipment from 2011 lying around. We dusted it off, and the port starts up and runs on that! So itâs ready for PC!â. I know thatâs not the reality, but reguardless, for a company thatâs done VERY well (sales wise) on PC before, they donât seem to have much enthusiasm for the platform. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:31 Veav says: They had my pre-order until they left PC off the demo list. I couldnât handwave that. :/ Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 18:36 Scelous says: I took it more from a marketing standpoint as, âWe donât want to alienate our PC base, especially casuals or poor people, so letâs not even go near the newer high-end stuff.â Thatâs how I received it, anyways. Which I donât think is bad. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 23:54 fish99 says: 970 isnât exactly top end, and never was, and thatâs recommended not minimum. Minimum is a 660 which was mid-range when it was new, which is a long time ago now. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 19:22 ColonelFlanders says: Iâm sceptical about the PC release of this. Dishonored 2 didnât exactly run like butter when it came out, and frankly isnât even with the updates. I will be holding fire on this one for a few weeks after release I think Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 19:26 phuzz says: Nice to see my graphics card is still hitting ârecommendedâ spec. Log in to Reply 28/04/2017 at 00:06 ColonelFlanders says: I think the GTX970 will be the card to have for at least another 18 months. When I finally have to retire mine I think Iâll go for a 2nd gen ryzen while Iâm at it. Log in to Reply 27/04/2017 at 19:44 Unclepauly says: That sad part is the specs are 480P for the min and 720P for the recommended, ultra will require 12 core i7âs/36gb/dual 1080tiâs.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 27, 2017 1:08pm Â  Comments Share: There are several heavy hitters reporting earnings in the tech sector after market close today. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), are all releasing first-quarter results later today. GOOG has been in the spotlight as it launches YouTube TV and shares hit all-time highs in trading yesterday, joining Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) as the one of only two companies in the United States worth more than $600 billion. GOOG recently started rolling out YouTube TV, the companyâs direct competitor to monthly cable, in several major cities over the past several weeks. It costs $35 per month and gives subscribers access to channels such as ESPN, Bravo, ABC, and CBS to name a few. Itâs still too new to have any sizable impact on its results in the near future, but the company has said it plans to expand it to more cities. In addition to GOOG, other tech companies are focused on the movie and TV business; AMZN offers Prime Video as a standalone service and AAPL has Apple TV. As competition grows, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) remains the leader in Internet TV with over 100 million subscribers, according to its recent earnings press release. Another area of focus is GOOGâs Other Bets division, which includes companies Nest, Waymo and Verily. Like the name implies, these are its bets on companies with future growth potential. These companies are focused everything from home automation and autonomous driving to life sciences. This division is a smaller portion of the company and advertising still makes up the bulk of the companyâs earnings. In the first quarter, GOOG is expected to report earnings of $7.48 per share, down slightly from the $7.50 earned in Q1 2016, on revenue of $19.65 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. Last quarter, revenues topped expectations, but earnings missed analystsâ estimates due to the company earning less per click across its advertising properties. Googleâs costs-per-click, the amount it receives from advertisers, fell 16% year over year.Â  Alphabet Inc. Trading and Recent Options Activity GOOG shares closed at $871.73 yesterday, just off the new all-time high of $876.05, potentially indicating high expectations for todayâs earnings results. When expectations are high though, there can be more volatility if results disappoint. The stock is up almost 13% year-to-date, roughly in line with just under a 12% gain for the NASDAQ (COMP). Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The options market has priced in about a 3% potential stock move in either direction around GOOGâs earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on theÂ thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading at the April 28 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 852.5 and 910 strike prices while puts were active at the 830 and 840 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 61st percentile. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

Â While most current Noctua heatsinks support the new LGA2066 socket of Intelâs âBasin Fallsâ X299 platform for âSkylake-Xâ and âKaby Lake-Xâ CPUs out of the box, older models can be upgraded with the NM-I2011 or NM-i20xx kits at no additional cost. "Weâre determined to provide the best possible support to our customers and, over the years, weâve sent many thousands of mounting kits free of charge to users who wanted to upgrade to new platforms", says Roland Mossig (Noctua CEO). "With Skylake-X just around the corner, weâre pleased to announce that weâll extend this offer for LGA2066. Owners of older Noctua retail heatsinks that donât support LGA2011/LGA2066 out of the box will be able to upgrade to the new socket free of charge!" Due to the heatsink mounting mechanism being identical on LGA2011 and LGA2066, Noctuaâs SecuFirm2â¢ mounting systems for LGA2011 also support Intelâs upcoming âBasin Fallsâ X299 HEDT (High End Desktop) platform for âSkylake-Xâ and âKaby Lake-Xâ processors. Most current Noctua coolers already include SecuFirm2â¢ mounting systems for LGA2011 and can thus be used on LGA2066 motherboards without any upgrades or modifications. Users of older Noctua retail models that donât include a SecuFirm2â¢ mounting system for LGA2011 can obtain the NM-I2011 kit free of charge on Noctuaâs website in order to make their heatsinks compatible with LGA2011 and LGA2066. In order to reflect that the NM-I2011 is compatible with both LGA2011 and LGA2066, the kit will be renamed to NM-i20xx and will be sold under this name, starting in Q3/Q4. The kit is compatible with most Noctua retail coolers produced since 2005 except for the NH-L9i and NH-L9a low-profile models. To order the NM-I2011/NM-I20xx kit, a proof of purchase (electronic version, screenshot, photo or scan of the invoice) of both an eligible Noctua CPU cooler and either an LGA2066 motherboard or LGA2066 CPU will be required. Users who have lost the invoice for their Noctua CPU cooler may write their full name and the current date on a piece of paper, take a photo of the paper next to their CPU cooler and upload this as proof of purchase. The kit can also be purchased in stores for a low service charge. More info here. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Acer Rolls Out New Ultrathin Gaming Notebooks, Detachables, and All-in-One PCs with Advanced Thermal Technology next@acer global press event in New York invites guests to experience latest Windows Mixed Reality and StarVRâ¢ NEW YORK, April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ âÂ AcerÂ (TWSE: 2353, LSE: ACID) today introduced its full 2017 back-to-school product lineup at the next@acer global press event in New York, and highlighted its advanced thermal technologies that enable thinner form factors in new gaming notebooks, detachables, and all-in-one PCs without compromising on performance. next@acer hosted over 400 international media, influencers, and partners in front of the worldâs largest IMAX screen. Innovative thermal technologies such as the new AeroBladeâ¢ 3D metal fan enabled the development of an ultrathin form factor for the Predator Triton 700 gaming notebook without compromising on performance, while the patented LiquidLoopâ¢ liquid cooling system has allowed the powerful Switch 5 detachable 2-in-1 notebook and Aspire U27 all-in-one PC to both operate quietly and maintain a slender profile. In addition, Acer gave the worldâs first public hands-on demonstrations of Windows Mixed Reality with the Acer Windows Mixed Reality head-mounted display, providing guests experiences that fuse together the physical and digital worlds. StarVR virtual reality headsets were also on hand with their industry-leading resolution and a field-of-view close to natural vision. Attendees were entertained with ultra-immersive John Wick Chronicles VR gameplay complete with realistic rifles and full motion tracking. âWeâre thrilled to be here in New York to continue our conversation beyond hardware and about how weâre taking technology to the next level,â said Jason Chen, Corporate President and CEO, Acer Inc. âForty years ago, Acer set out with a mission to break barriers between people and technology, and today we continue that tradition by providing technologies that empower users to create and experience their world like never before.â Blending Physical and Digital Universes with Windows Mixed Reality Joining Acer on the stage, VR pioneer Mark Bolas, Director of Program Management, Windows Mixed Reality at Microsoft, shared with the audience how the platform blends physical and digital worlds to produce new environments. In these environments the physical and digital co-exist and interact with one another to enable a new way of harnessing technology. By combining the physical universe and the digital universe, based on bits and digital logic, the latter is no longer constrained to computers, phones, and TV screens as it is now. Acer partnered with Microsoft to deliver the worldâs first Windows Mixed Reality development kits in March, helping developers realize the potential of the Windows Mixed Reality platform. Developers are already hard at work to further enrich the experience when Acerâs Windows Mixed Reality headsets for consumers and commercial customers ship later this year. Expanded Predator Gaming Lineup with New Notebooks and Quantum Dot Displays As Acer pursues multiple growth engines for its core business, it has expanded its Predator gaming lineup with an eye on the great potential in the gaming market. Continuing its focus on thermal technology to push the limits of gaming hardware, Acerâs new AeroBlade 3Dâ¢ fans were introduced to enable the new Predator Triton ultrathin gaming notebook series and accessible Predator Helios notebooks. The first device from the new Predator Triton ultrathin gaming notebook series, thae Predator Triton 700 packs standard-voltage 7th Generation IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ processors and latest NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® GTX 10-Series graphics in an aluminum chassis at just 18 mm (0.74 inch) in height, thanks to dual AeroBlade 3D metal fans that increase airflow by 35%[1] yet take up less space within the device. As a world leader in gaming monitors, Acer introduced the Predator X27 which takes gaming displays to a new level with NVIDIA G-SYNCâ¢ HDR and Acer HDR Ultraâ¢ technology. Leveraging Quantum Dot technology, the Predator X27 offers a wider color range with higher brightness, deeper saturation and better accuracy to offer dramatically more vivid visuals. Acer also revealed that starting in May, its performance-oriented Aspire GX desktops will be available with powerful new AMD Ryzenâ¢ 7 1700X processors capable of handling graphic-intensive tasks for smooth everyday entertainment and gaming. LiquidLoopâ¢ Cooling System Silences Powerful Detachables, and Now All-in-Ones Building on the great reception of the Switch Alpha 12, which was Acerâs first detachable 2-in-1 equipped with the innovative LiquidLoopâ¢ cooling system, Acer has launched the new Acer Switch 5. Like its predecessor, this 2-in-1 notebook with powerful IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ processors operates without fans. Acer also took the fanless technology and created the quiet and ultrathin Aspire U27 all-in-one PC, which won a 2017 iF Design Award. The Switch 5 is Acerâs first 2-in-1 to be offered with 7th Generation Intel Core i7 and i5 processors to deliver the top-rated performance needed for serious tasks, presentations and entertainment on the go. With Acerâs patented auto-retracting kickstand, the Switch 5âs viewing angle can be adjusted effortlessly with just one hand, providing added convenience in any scenario. The Aspire U27 boasts an impressive ultrathin 12 mm (0.5 inch) chassis with an elegant diamond-cut v-shaped metal stand, bringing a new dimension of sophistication to home computing and entertainment. With a 27-inch Full HD wide viewing angle display, and a specially designed subwoofer that offers powerfully deep bass, this all-in-one provides entertainment with a punch. Extended 4K Display Portfolio with Professional Monitors and HDR-Compatible Projectors With 4K content becoming increasingly popular and available with the rise of streaming services, Acer extended its display portfolio for both media consumption and content creation. It announced the new H7850 and V7850 4K projectors for home cinema enthusiasts as well as the new ProDesignerâ¢ PE320QK 4K LED monitor for creative professionals. The Acer H7850 and V7850 projectors feature 4K Ultra High-Definition (UHD) resolution and HDR compatibility to deliver exceptional value and performance to mainstream audio/video enthusiasts. The new ProDesigner PE320QK monitor incorporates Acer HDR Xpertâ¢ technology for exceptional contrast, and features an attractive ZeroFrame design to appeal to design-minded professionals.Â Â  To learn more about availability, product specifications and prices in specific markets, please contact your nearest Acer office via www.acer.com.

Peter Bright - Apr 27, 2017 4:30 pm UTC Intel Skylake die shot. Intel reader comments 47 Share this story While Intel's desktop and laptop processors are using the latest generation Kaby Lake core, the multisocket high-end Xeon processors, used in servers and workstations, are still using the much older Broadwell core. The full range is due to be refreshed soon, with a whole range of new chips using a derivative of the Skylake core. There's still not much known about these long-awaited processors, but Intel has let slip one thing: an all-new naming scheme. Currently, Xeons have a series nameâone of E3, E5, and E7âa model numberâa four digit numberâand a version number. The version number denotes the basic architecture, with the current version 4 meaning Broadwell. The series name indicates the core variantâin general, E7 has more RAM capacity, more cores, and more reliability features than E5, and E3 is used for parts that are essentially rebranded standard desktop chips. The first digit of the model number denotes the number of sockets supported (from the single socket 1xxx parts up to the eight socket 8xxx parts), with the remaining three digits having no particular systematic meaning, but being used to distinguish between all the different core count and clock speed options. Enlarge Intel The new naming, which Intel has disclosed in a change notification document (spotted by Computerbase), appears to discard this scheme entirely. At the top are 14 processors branded "Xeon Platinum" at base speeds from 2.0 to 3.6GHz and 8000-series model numbers. These are presumed to be counterparts to the current E7 range. Exact socket and core counts remain unknown. Most of the Platinum series is expected to offer between 22 and 28 cores, with the exception of the 3.6GHz part; this will use the same design, but with far fewer cores enabled, to offer a high-cache, high-clock option. Below the Platinum parts are 20 "Gold" brand chips, with base clock speeds from 2.0GHz to 3.6GHz. All of these are listed with a 6000-series model number except one with a 5000-series number. This suggests, if nothing else, that the lead digit of the model number no longer denotes the number of supported sockets. Core counts for the Gold parts are believed to be in the 14-22 range, though again there will be a high-clock, high-cache, low-core version. Both Gold and Platinum chips will also include variants with a T and M suffix. The T suffix has been used before to indicate a low power version; the M suffix has traditionally implied a mobile part, but its meaning here is unknown. The Gold and Platinum processors are both using a Skylake variant called Skylake-SP. This will include features not found in the regular desktop and mobile Skylake processors, most notably the inclusion of AVX512. AVX512 extends the existing 256-bit AVX vector instructions to be twice as wide. Intel is also developing a variant known as Skylake-X, along with a Kaby Lake variant named Kaby Lake-X. Skylake-X is anticipated to carry Xeon Bronze and Xeon Silver branding, and both Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X are likely to have consumer-oriented versions when Intel refreshes its high-end desktop processors. Update: In an e-mail sent after publication, an Intel spokesperson wrote "Your article contains material that has not been disclosed by Intel and we strongly request you remove this article from your site." Intel has since removed the document this story is based on from its website. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing AMD Updates Ryzenâs Windows Power Plan, Boosts Performance With New Chipset Driver AMD Updates Ryzenâs Windows Power Plan, Boosts Performance With New Chipset Driver By Joel Hruska on April 27, 2017 at 9:15 am Comment When AMD launched Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 earlier this year, it recommended that reviewers test with Windows 10âs power plan set to âHigh Performance,â as opposed to the âBalancedâ configuration we typically prefer for testing and that Windows uses by default. Now, the company has released a new chipset driver that will add and automatically activate a power profile that gives Ryzen more control over its own power states. The problem initially occurred because of a mismatch in how AMDâs SenseMI technology operates compared with Windowsâ native power management. SenseMI is AMDâs brand name for a set of technologies related to power management, fine-grained clock speeds, and prefetch behaviors. In this case, AMD designed SenseMI to make changes to the CPUs clock and voltage with as little as 1ms latency between frequency and voltage shifts. The problem is, this runs counter to Windows 10âs own power management, which sets higher thresholds and longer timers when transitioning in and out of P-states (Performance States). To understand whatâs happening here it helps to understand a bit more of the power management landscape. Once upon a time (the late 1990s), computers ran at whatever steady clock rate they were ordered to run at, whether they took their marching orders from BIOS settings or from the CPU itself. Intel first introduced SpeedStep in mobile as a way to improve Pentium III battery life. Over the past two decades, Windowsâ ability to manage the systemâs overall power state has advanced significantly, even as AMD and Intel implemented more nuanced capabilities of their own. At times, what CPUs are capable of can outpace integrated OS capabilities â Intel has its own power management drivers that it distributes with its products, and what AMD is doing with SenseMI and this new chipset driver is aimed at accomplishing a similar goal. In this case, AMDâs new power plan reduces the thresholds for moving in and out of idle states and disables core parking to improve overall performance. The CPU, in other words, is now running more of the show. AMDâs new power plan AMDâs new chipset driver adds support for a new Ryzen Balanced power plan and activates it by default. The impact of this new plan will vary from game to game and workload to workload, but AMDâs own results suggest a reasonable uplift in a variety of titles. Data and graph by AMD Total War: Warhammer, Alien: Isolation, Crysis 3, Gears of War 4, Battlefield 4, Project Cars, are also listed as seeing performance improvements from this new driver, though no specifics are given. AMD wonât share its Q1 results until next Monday, but we expect to see good â though not exceptional things. Ryzen was only available for one month in Q1 2017 (Q2 will be the first quarter with full availability), only debuted at the upper end of the market, and will be fighting back against the ordinary seasonal slump. CPU and GPU sales are typically highest in Q4 while console sales (from AMDâs position) peak in Q3; Q1 is an off-season for both categories. Given these initial conditions, AMD wonât need to deliver major quarter-on-quarter sales improvements to see a noticeable uptick in revenue from Ryzen 7. Weâve been watching AMDâs performance on Amazonâs Top 20 bestselling CPU list to see how the company is faring, and the results look strong so far. Ryzen sales have slipped a bit, with the Ryzen 7 1700 topping out at #7 (AMDâs FX-8350 is, for some reason, holding strong at #4 and the FX-6300 is at #8), but the Ryzen 5 1500X, 1800X, 1600X, 1600, and 1700X are all still in the Top 20 (#14, 15, 17, 18, and 19, respectively). AMD currently holds 9 of the Top 20 spots overall, with the A8-7600 anchoring 20th place. Previous spot checks prior to Ryzenâs launch showed AMD holding 3-4 spots, so if nothing else the data suggests significantly more AMD chips are selling into the retail channel. Exactly how many? Weâll get an inkling of that on Monday. You can read more about AMDâs Ryzen Balanced power profile in the companyâs blog post and download the new chipset driver here.

Cloudera has contributed to the development of Hadoop, with the company's engineers providing 18 of its 26 integrated platforms. Hadoop's co-founder, Doug Cutting, also works for Cloudera. As Cloudera is focused on business managers, its software is designed for professionals. Its focus stands in contrast to Hadoop-oriented company Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP), which is more of a pure open-source company geared toward data scientists, according to IDC analyst Carl Olofson. How big is the opportunity? Cloudera believes it has a large potential market. The company combines the end markets of dynamic data-management systems, artificial intelligence (AI), and predictive analytics software. According to the company's S-1, IDC estimates that in aggregate these markets will grow from $8.7Â billion in 2015 to $22.1Â billion in 2020. That's a growth rate of over 20%. Moreover, Cloudera thinks it may disrupt the traditional database-management markets, which would take the total addressable market up to $65 billion by 2020. In a recent article, however, IDC raised the outlook for AI markets to $47 billion by itself in 2020, which would be a 55% growth rate. Cloudera targets companies in the Global 8000, a group of large-cap companies worldwide that capture and use a majority of the world's data. The company currently has 500 of the Global 8000 as clients, which accounted for 73% of its total revenue in the past fiscal year. Public-sector clients accounted for 10%. A look at the books Revenue in fiscal 2017 grew 57.1% to $261 million year over year, with gross margin expanding from 54.6% to 66.6%, a great sign that there's leverage in the business model. It gets murkier on the bottom line, however, as sales, marketing, and general and administrative costs skyrocketed, leading to a loss from operations of $187 million. That figure was an improvement over a $204 million loss the year before, but it's still a long way from profitability. Intel insideÂ  In 2014, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) invested a large position in Cloudera at a $4 billion valuation. That's a far cry from the $1.66 billion to $2.2 billion Cloudera estimates that the IPO will bring in, and Intel will still own 19.4% of the company following the IPO. While this means the company took a roughly $400 million hit on its investment (20% of a $2 billion loss), that's not the whole story, as Cloudera has optimized its technology to run on Intel architecture today and "is expected to achieve differentiated performance on future Intel platform technologies." Therefore, it's entirely possible Intel will come out on top if it can sell vast amounts of its data-center chips. Intel's data-center business brought in $17.2 billion in 2016, up 8% year over year. Should you buy? A "down-round" IPO is nothing to cheer about. At the current valuation, the company would be valued at 6.37 times sales. That's well below other recent IPOs, such as those for Mulesoft and Okta, but it's still above the closest public market peer in Hortonworks,Â which trades at roughly 3.5 times sales. The discount to other tech IPOs is probably attributable to the huge operating losses for both Cloudera and Hortonworks. To me, this could be good news or bad. It could be good if the growth opportunity is as large as the Cloudera has stated and it solidifies its first-mover status in the field aggressively. However, bottom-line losses indicate the company won't be profitable anytime soon, which means investors would need to believe in the end story. To that end, co-founder Mike Olson wrote, "You should expect us to make significant disruptive technology bets in the future." It's hard for me -- or even for techies, based on what I've read -- to know whether Cloudera's proprietary software or Hortonworks' more open model is better. Still, the the opportunity is so large that speculative investors may want to take a small position at half the price Intel paid, as the opportunity in Hadoop applications seems to be huge.Â  Billy Duberstein has no position in any stocks mentioned.

As CEO of McAfee, which popularized antivirus software in the 1980s and 1990s, he has to prove to investors that his company can operate on its own following a $4.2 billion spinout from Intel in April. He needs to show peers that McAfee can succeed in a new era. And he must teach customers that the company can once more be on the cutting edge. Hereâs what Young had to say ahead of his companyâs spinoff. Fortune: McAfee is three decades old in an industry where age can be a liability. How will you change this perception? Chris Young: The prior McAfee had a little bit of a supermarket strategy: You come and you buy one of anything âcyberâ from us. In my view that wasnât what the industry needed from us. It needed us to be more of a player that could deliver them an architecture. So we shrank the product portfolio, and weâre investing more in some areas. One of the newest areas is machine learningâthis is the big buzz right now in the industry. Since resigning from the company, founder John McAfee made headlines for his political views and clashes with law enforcement. Does it impact the brand? First of all, John McAfee hasnât been involved in this company for over 20 years. In fact, I did a Google [search] on McAfee, and half the time I get Pat McAfee, the punter for the Colts. But in all seriousness, we did a lot of research to really understand what the brand means to people. And hereâs where we came out: Weâre already doing something thatâs hard, which is to spin a company out of another company. We happen to have a brand that because weâve been around, itâs got positives and itâs got negatives. Under Intel, McAfee was a division of a large semiconductor company. Now itâs independent. What are the opportunities? Challenges? Being private is a path to independence. And as far as getting access to capital, we no longer have to compete with other parts of the Intel business for investmentâwhether that investment is about M&A or investments we want to make internally. Intel is a 100,000-person company with nearly $60 billion in revenue. And itâs mostly building semi-conductors. Now weâll just have a little bit more freedom and flexibility. What keeps me up at night or gets me up early in the morning is worrying about how I make this a place that is good for our people and good for our customers. Because if we donât do that right, nothing else is going to matter. A version of this article appears in the May 1, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline "Securing McAfee."

Supplier MSI www.msi.com Price $6999 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel 7th Gen Core i7-7820HK (quad-core, HyperThreaded, 3.9GHz Turbo) â¢ 64GB DDR4 2400MHz â¢ 4 x 128GB S SDs in RAID 0 mode â¢ 18.3-inch 1080p 60Hz display Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Raw horsepower that lacks image quality. You know a gaming laptop is going to be rather powerful when it ships with not one, but two power bricks. Theyâre joined together via a special Y-shaped adaptor which plugs into the rear of this brute of a laptop, suggesting that it sucks down oodles of power. The huge 18.3-inch screen dominates the overall form factor of this beast, but itâs also darned thick, at 69mm at its deepest point. Breaking your back at 5.5kg, itâs not the kind of machine youâll be taking in your check-in luggage. Obviously itâs this big for a reason, and MSI has absolutely crammed it with cutting edge hardwareâ¦ for the most part. If thereâs one rather strange oversight, itâs the screen. Sure, it apparently covers the full 100% sRGB colour range, though it doesnât appear as punchy as other IPS screens weâve seen. However, itâs only 1920 x 1080, with a maximum refresh rate of a mere 60Hz. Seriously? Whatâs the point in having the incredible horsepower within when youâre limited to such a stock-standard display? Itâs possible to plug in up to three external 4K displays, but youâre still going to be stuck looking at a 1080p screen in the middle, and when itâs this big, the pixel structure is rather obvious.Â  That aside, the rest of the machine is admirable indeed. A SteelSeries keyboard with Cherry MX switches resides right on the edge of the machine, so you donât need to wrest your hands on a hot palm wrest. Thereâs also a small touchpad that doubles as a numpad at the tap of a button the right. Given the size of this thing, we expected a decent set of speakers; while theyâre rather loud, there is very little bass, so youâll be needing to use headphones. Thereâs also another very good reason for using headphones; under full load this thing sounds like a hurricane. It measured 54dB under 4K load (we used Nvidiaâs DSR to enable 4K playback on the 1080p screen), which isnât uncommon on such powerful gaming machines. That doesnât mean we have to enjoy all that fan-noise though.Â  Under the hood is arguably the most powerful gaming laptop weâve yet seen. Obviously Intelâs new 7th Gen Core i7-7820HK does the CPU work, and itâs a beast. With quad HyperThreaded cores, it peaks out at 3.9GHz under load, and has a hefty 8MB cache. With a top TDP itâs no wonder this thing is loud. Memory hogs will love the 64GB of DDR4 2400MHz, but itâs the storage solution that is ridiculously amazing. Four independent PCIe SSDs are tied together in RAID 0 mode, along with a single 1TB hard drive. Yep, youâre going to be the first into the server, every time.Â  But the real kicker here are the twin GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs running in SLI mode. As the benchmarks show, they obliterate pretty much anything you can throw at it, in any resolution. Unlike previous Nvidia mobile GPUs, these are basically identical to the desktop model, so youâre getting true desktop power in a partially portable design.Â  Networking is taken care of via Killerâs Killer DoubleShot Pro, which combines Killerâs E2500 Gigabit Ethernet controller and one Killer Wireless-AC 1535 chipset for 802.11ac. Thereâs also a plethora of USB ports, including a Thunderbolt-enabled USB Type-C port. It might be the worldâs most powerful gaming laptop, yet the choice of a low resolution, low refresh rate display is puzzling to say the least. If all you care about is stratospheric frame rates, then itâs a fine solution, but it seems a shame to waste all that horsepower on a HD resolution. Hopefully the next version has a 2560 x 1440, 120Hz panel at the least.Â  Related Reviews Review: MSI X99A Tomahawk motherboard hits close to the mark Review: MSI Z170A Mpower Gaming Titanium motherboard Review: MSI GTX 1070 Gaming X 8GB Source: Copyright Â© PC & Tech Authority.

Owens Published: Apr 27, 2017 10:36 a.m. ET Share Three of the four most valuable tech companies highlight busiest afternoon of earnings season after frenzy of early reports Getty Images These guys need a few more monitors to follow all of Thursdayâs earnings action. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor If you care about corporate earnings, you should cancel any plans for Thursday. In what will likely be the busiest day of the current earnings season, some of the most prominent and highly valued companies in the world will issue reports Thursday, with the total market capitalization of the companies easily topping $2 trillion and likely approaching $3 trillion. In fact, just the six largest U.S.-based corporations divulging financial performance from the first calendar quarter top $2 trillion in combined market cap, based on Wednesdayâs closing prices: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.26% GOOG, +0.29% Â , which just became the second $600 billion company in the U.S.; Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.65% Â , worth $524.2 billion; Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.00% Â , which has jumped more than 21% so far in 2017 for a $434.6 billion market cap; Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +2.06% Â , worth $183.9 billion; Intel Corp. INTC, +1.35% Â , valued at $174.2 billion; and Abbvie Inc. ABBV, +1.58% Â , with a market cap of $103.7 billion. Combined, those companies are worth $2.03 trillion. That list includes three of the four most valuable tech companies, missing only the most valuable, Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.08% which plans to report May 2. Appleâs main rival in smartphones actually got the party started on Wednesday in the U.S., as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, +1.78% Â reported earnings before Korean markets opened and posted its best quarterly profit in more than three years. Samsung wasnât even the only Korean electronics giant planning to release earnings Thursday, as LG Electronics Inc. 066570, -4.43% Â plans a report after trading in that country ends. In Japan, Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974, +2.11% NTDOY, -3.40% Â predicted it would sell 10 million Switch consoles in the fiscal year, but shares declined. Stateside, Comcast beat expectations ahead of the bell and jumped 3%, while Abbvie performed similarly. Those companies were joined by railroad company Union Pacific Corp. UNP, +3.05% Â , which also gained 3% in early trade, and another pharmaceutical giant, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, +3.53% Â , that jumped thanks to strong numbers. Other post-earnings gainers included KKR & Co. KKR, +5.40% Â and Dominoâs Pizza Inc. DPZ, +2.54% Â  The biggest disappointments in the early going came from two airlines and a car maker. American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -5.22% Â fell more than 7% after operating expenses rose as the airline looks to pay employees more, and Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, -2.09% also declined amid rising expenses. Ford, the No. 2 U.S. carmaker worth more than $45 billion, fell in early trading as profit beat expectations but still declined 35% year-over-year. After the regular trading session closes, the schedule might be even more packed. Joining tech heavyweights Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Intel is Starbucks Corp. SBUX, -0.42% Â , the Seattle-based coffee chain valued at $89.7 billion, and Expedia Inc. EXPE, +0.33% Even smaller tech companies should command interest, like GoPro Inc. GPRO, -2.19% Â , the Silicon Valley action-camera company that has struggled through a series of gaffes that helped drive its $14 billion market cap down to just $1.3 billion. On top of established public companies issuing earnings numbers, at least two rookies are expected to give a price for their first batch of shares. Big-data software company Cloudera Inc., which has been a big investment target for Intel, and Carvana Co., which operates actual car vending machines in Texas, are expected to price initial public offerings Thursday evening. MarketWatch will do its best to keep up with all the news flying around Thursday, so check back for coverage of the results. In the meantime, settle in with some previews of the afternoon reports, in order of market cap: Alphabet earnings: A new approach arrives amid YouTube ad controversy Microsoft earnings: Strength in Office expected to lead to a meet or beat Amazon earnings: Will AWS decelerate again? Intel earnings: While waiting for Mobileye, an eye on competition Starbucks earnings: Same-store sales are the big second-quarter question GoPro earnings: Will the $799 Karma drone pay off? The S&P 500 SPX, +0.06% Â has gained 6.6% in 2017 so far.

Owens Published: Apr 27, 2017 10:36 a.m. ET Share Three of the four most valuable tech companies highlight busiest afternoon of earnings season after frenzy of early reports Getty Images These guys need a few more monitors to follow all of Thursdayâs earnings action. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor If you care about corporate earnings, you should cancel any plans for Thursday. In what will likely be the busiest day of the current earnings season, some of the most prominent and highly valued companies in the world will issue reports Thursday, with the total market capitalization of the companies easily topping $2 trillion and likely approaching $3 trillion. In fact, just the six largest U.S.-based corporations divulging financial performance from the first calendar quarter top $2 trillion in combined market cap, based on Wednesdayâs closing prices: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.26% GOOG, +0.29% Â , which just became the second $600 billion company in the U.S.; Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.65% Â , worth $524.2 billion; Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.00% Â , which has jumped more than 21% so far in 2017 for a $434.6 billion market cap; Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +2.06% Â , worth $183.9 billion; Intel Corp. INTC, +1.35% Â , valued at $174.2 billion; and Abbvie Inc. ABBV, +1.58% Â , with a market cap of $103.7 billion. Combined, those companies are worth $2.03 trillion. That list includes three of the four most valuable tech companies, missing only the most valuable, Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.08% which plans to report May 2. Appleâs main rival in smartphones actually got the party started on Wednesday in the U.S., as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, +1.78% Â reported earnings before Korean markets opened and posted its best quarterly profit in more than three years. Samsung wasnât even the only Korean electronics giant planning to release earnings Thursday, as LG Electronics Inc. 066570, -4.43% Â plans a report after trading in that country ends. In Japan, Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974, +2.11% NTDOY, -3.40% Â predicted it would sell 10 million Switch consoles in the fiscal year, but shares declined. Stateside, Comcast beat expectations ahead of the bell and jumped 3%, while Abbvie performed similarly. Those companies were joined by railroad company Union Pacific Corp. UNP, +3.05% Â , which also gained 3% in early trade, and another pharmaceutical giant, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, +3.53% Â , that jumped thanks to strong numbers. Other post-earnings gainers included KKR & Co. KKR, +5.40% Â and Dominoâs Pizza Inc. DPZ, +2.54% Â  The biggest disappointments in the early going came from two airlines and a car maker. American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -5.22% Â fell more than 7% after operating expenses rose as the airline looks to pay employees more, and Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, -2.09% also declined amid rising expenses. Ford, the No. 2 U.S. carmaker worth more than $45 billion, fell in early trading as profit beat expectations but still declined 35% year-over-year. After the regular trading session closes, the schedule might be even more packed. Joining tech heavyweights Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Intel is Starbucks Corp. SBUX, -0.42% Â , the Seattle-based coffee chain valued at $89.7 billion, and Expedia Inc. EXPE, +0.33% Even smaller tech companies should command interest, like GoPro Inc. GPRO, -2.19% Â , the Silicon Valley action-camera company that has struggled through a series of gaffes that helped drive its $14 billion market cap down to just $1.3 billion. On top of established public companies issuing earnings numbers, at least two rookies are expected to give a price for their first batch of shares. Big-data software company Cloudera Inc., which has been a big investment target for Intel, and Carvana Co., which operates actual car vending machines in Texas, are expected to price initial public offerings Thursday evening. MarketWatch will do its best to keep up with all the news flying around Thursday, so check back for coverage of the results. In the meantime, settle in with some previews of the afternoon reports, in order of market cap: Alphabet earnings: A new approach arrives amid YouTube ad controversy Microsoft earnings: Strength in Office expected to lead to a meet or beat Amazon earnings: Will AWS decelerate again? Intel earnings: While waiting for Mobileye, an eye on competition Starbucks earnings: Same-store sales are the big second-quarter question GoPro earnings: Will the $799 Karma drone pay off? The S&P 500 SPX, +0.06% Â has gained 6.6% in 2017 so far. More from MarketWatch Film Trailer: 'Dunkirk' Randomly selected?

Owens Published: Apr 27, 2017 10:36 a.m. ET Share Three of the four most valuable tech companies highlight busiest afternoon of earnings season after frenzy of early reports Getty Images These guys need a few more monitors to follow all of Thursdayâs earnings action. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor If you care about corporate earnings, you should cancel any plans for Thursday. In what will likely be the busiest day of the current earnings season, some of the most prominent and highly valued companies in the world will issue reports Thursday, with the total market capitalization of the companies easily topping $2 trillion and likely approaching $3 trillion. In fact, just the six largest U.S.-based corporations divulging financial performance from the first calendar quarter top $2 trillion in combined market cap, based on Wednesdayâs closing prices: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.26% GOOG, +0.29% Â , which just became the second $600 billion company in the U.S.; Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.65% Â , worth $524.2 billion; Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.00% Â , which has jumped more than 21% so far in 2017 for a $434.6 billion market cap; Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +2.06% Â , worth $183.9 billion; Intel Corp. INTC, +1.35% Â , valued at $174.2 billion; and Abbvie Inc. ABBV, +1.58% Â , with a market cap of $103.7 billion. Combined, those companies are worth $2.03 trillion. That list includes three of the four most valuable tech companies, missing only the most valuable, Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.08% which plans to report May 2. Appleâs main rival in smartphones actually got the party started on Wednesday in the U.S., as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, +1.78% Â reported earnings before Korean markets opened and posted its best quarterly profit in more than three years. Samsung wasnât even the only Korean electronics giant planning to release earnings Thursday, as LG Electronics Inc. 066570, -4.43% Â plans a report after trading in that country ends. In Japan, Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974, +2.11% NTDOY, -3.40% Â predicted it would sell 10 million Switch consoles in the fiscal year, but shares declined. Stateside, Comcast beat expectations ahead of the bell and jumped 3%, while Abbvie performed similarly. Those companies were joined by railroad company Union Pacific Corp. UNP, +3.05% Â , which also gained 3% in early trade, and another pharmaceutical giant, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, +3.53% Â , that jumped thanks to strong numbers. Other post-earnings gainers included KKR & Co. KKR, +5.40% Â and Dominoâs Pizza Inc. DPZ, +2.54% Â  The biggest disappointments in the early going came from two airlines and a car maker. American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -5.22% Â fell more than 7% after operating expenses rose as the airline looks to pay employees more, and Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, -2.09% also declined amid rising expenses. Ford, the No. 2 U.S. carmaker worth more than $45 billion, fell in early trading as profit beat expectations but still declined 35% year-over-year. After the regular trading session closes, the schedule might be even more packed. Joining tech heavyweights Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Intel is Starbucks Corp. SBUX, -0.42% Â , the Seattle-based coffee chain valued at $89.7 billion, and Expedia Inc. EXPE, +0.33% Even smaller tech companies should command interest, like GoPro Inc. GPRO, -2.19% Â , the Silicon Valley action-camera company that has struggled through a series of gaffes that helped drive its $14 billion market cap down to just $1.3 billion. On top of established public companies issuing earnings numbers, at least two rookies are expected to give a price for their first batch of shares. Big-data software company Cloudera Inc., which has been a big investment target for Intel, and Carvana Co., which operates actual car vending machines in Texas, are expected to price initial public offerings Thursday evening. MarketWatch will do its best to keep up with all the news flying around Thursday, so check back for coverage of the results. In the meantime, settle in with some previews of the afternoon reports, in order of market cap: Alphabet earnings: A new approach arrives amid YouTube ad controversy Microsoft earnings: Strength in Office expected to lead to a meet or beat Amazon earnings: Will AWS decelerate again? Intel earnings: While waiting for Mobileye, an eye on competition Starbucks earnings: Same-store sales are the big second-quarter question GoPro earnings: Will the $799 Karma drone pay off? The S&P 500 SPX, +0.06% Â has gained 6.6% in 2017 so far.

Yes, it is. But the fact that these two gigantic technology roadmaps are converging and colliding isnât just a coincidence. 5G is helping automotive industry in dealing with the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) conundrum that has long been shadowing the connected car promise: Who will pay for the roadside infrastructure? Automotive industry or governments? Now connected cars can utilize the 5G signals to scope out road and weather conditions and draw up more accurate maps. And for the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication part, 5G frees up the automotive industry from the obligation of developing a specialized infrastructure based on the dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology. [Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications â serving as the foundation of the connected car movement â is also becoming a key enabling technology for the autonomous vehicles. Image courtesy of Qualcomm] The next frontier after getting cars fully connected is automated driving, a.k.a. autonomous cars. According to Intelâs CEO, Brian Krzanich, an autonomous car can generate as much as four terabytes of data in a day, so a robust and pervasive communications infrastructure is imperative in moving more data at higher speeds and lower latency with utmost reliability. The 5G network will help vehicles keep tabs on cars, cyclists, and pedestrians in the vicinity while serving as glue between the key building blocks of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and self-driving cars. In other words, it will facilitate split-second connectivity for cameras, radars, and other in-vehicle sensors providing the 360-degree view. Then, there are machine learning tasks for image and speech recognition that require faster and ultra-reliable data links along with greater compute power and data synthesization capabilities. The autonomous car brings forth massive data challenges, so 5G is most likely going to become part of the automated driving ecosystem by facilitating large chunks of data via roadside communication infrastructure. There isnât much automotive connectivity in play right now, and many industry observers attribute this to the lack of automotive friendly features in the 4G LTE networks. The 5G systems claim to offer five times lower latencies than predecessor 4G networks while enabling the more intelligent use of the radio spectrum through software-defined networks (SDN), network slicing, and virtualization techniques. The creation of the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) is clearly a harbinger of the convergence between mobility and connected automated driving. The multi-industry body is carrying out cross-sector collaboration to facilitate road safety and intelligent transportation for autonomous cars.

By Chad Day and Stephen Braun / Associated Press WASHINGTON â Investigations intensified into President Donald Trumpâs ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn, on Thursday as the Pentagon watchdog joined lawmakers in probing payments he accepted from foreign sources including a Russian state-sponsored TV network. At the same time, documents released by the top Democrat on a House oversight committee showed Mr. Flynn was warned by authorities after he retired from the military in 2014 not to take foreign government-sourced money without âadvance approvalâ from the Pentagon. Mr. Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general and Defense Intelligence Agency chief, later accepted tens of thousands of dollars for his work on behalf of foreign interests, including RT, the state-supported Russian television network, and a Turkish-owned company linked to Turkeyâs government. The Pentagonâs acting inspector generalâs office confirmed Thursday he has launched an inquiry into whether those payments qualify as coming from foreign governments and whether Mr. Flynn properly informed military authorities about them. The White House defended its hiring of Mr. Flynn and attempted to shift blame for any problems with his vetting onto the Obama administration, which handled the reissuance of his security clearance in January 2016. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who released the documents, said during a news conference that Mr. Flynn had been clearly informed he needed to get permission to receive foreign payments and thereâs no evidence he did so. âThe Pentagonâs warning to Gen. Flynn was bold, italicized and could not have been clearer,â Mr. Cummings said. In a key 2014 document, Mr. Flynn was told by a Defense Intelligence Agency official that the U.S. Constitutionâs emoluments provision prohibits any monetary payments or gifts âfrom a foreign government unless congressional consent is first obtained.â The Oct. 8, 2014, letter â which was sent to Mr. Flynn at his request â explained that such âadvance approvalâ would need to come âfrom the relevant service secretary.â Earlier this week, Mr. Cummings and Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House committee, said that they had found no evidence Mr. Flynn asked the Army for permission to receive foreign payments or informed the military he had accepted them. Army spokeswoman Cynthia O. Smith said the Army had no records that Mr. Flynn requested that permission. One episode in question involves a trip he took to Moscow in 2015 for RTâs anniversary celebration. He was paid at least $33,750 to attend the gala at which he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. âGen. Flynnâs attorney says he discussed his trip to Moscow with DIA, but we have no evidence, not a shred, that he disclosed his payments,â Mr. Cummings said Thursday. In a statement, Mr. Flynnâs attorney Robert Kelner said the Defense Department âwas fully aware of the trip,â citing his previous statements that his client briefed DIA officials before and after the RT trip. Mr. Kelner also pointed to a letter, released in redacted form by Mr. Cummings, that notes that Mr. Flynn provided a thumb drive to the agency containing documents detailing the RT event, including that Leading Authorities, a speakers bureau that handled Mr. Flynnâs paid speeches, was handling the event for him. Mr. Kelnerâs statement did not address other payments Mr. Flynn received from foreign sources. Mr. Flynn has previously disclosed he got between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his personal stake in $530,000 that his company, Flynn Intel Group, received for consulting work last year for a Turkish businessman. Last month Mr. Flynnâs firm filed as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for its consulting work and acknowledged the work may have benefited the government of Turkey. Mr. Flynnâs client, Inovo BV, is owned by a businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkeyâs finance ministry. In comments to the AP, Utah Republican Mr. Chaffetz, chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said that Mr. Flynn âhad an obligation to seek approval to take money from a foreign government. We found no evidence that he did that.â Mr. Chaffetzâs office released a letter he sent on Thursday to the Army, asking the serviceâs acting secretary to make a final determination as to whether Mr. Flynn violated federal law by accepting the payments, and if so, to start the process of recovering that money. Mr. Chaffetz also asked the Army to say why it hasnât yet made a determination as to the legality of Mr. Flynnâs payments from RT given that they have been widely reported for at least two years. He also wants the Army to disclose any other investigations itâs launched since 2010 into similar legal violations. The committeeâs inquiry is one of several congressional investigations into Mr. Flynnâs contacts with foreign officials. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Flynn in February for failing to inform senior administration officials about his contacts with Russian officials â contacts that are being examined as part of the wider inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Thursday, 18 House Democrats on the oversight committee signed a letter calling on Mr. Chaffetz to do more to pressure the White House to release documents regarding Mr. Flynn. âThere is obviously a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow,â the Democrats wrote in the letter. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer rebuffed criticism from Mr. Cummings that the White House was covering up. Asked about Trump administration vetting, Mr. Spicer appeared to shift blame onto the Obama administration, which had fired Mr. Flynn as head of the DIA. âWhy would you re-run a background check on someone who is the head of the Department of Defense Intelligence Agency that had and did maintain a high-level security clearance?â Mr. Spicer asked. He noted that Mr. Flynnâs security clearance was renewed during the Obama administration âwith all of the information thatâs being discussed that occurred in 2015.â The White House recently told the committee that documents the lawmakers sought would not be turned over because they contained classified information or were not relevant to the committeeâs investigation. Senate confirms Acosta The Senate on Thursday confirmed Alex Acosta as Labor secretary, filling out Mr. Trumpâs Cabinet. The 60-38 vote confirms Mr. Acosta â the only Latino to join Mr. Trumpâs CabinetÂ â to the post. Once sworn as the nationâs 27th Labor secretary, the son of Cuban immigrants will lead a sprawling agency that enforces more than 180 federal laws covering about 10 million employers and 125 million workers. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., spoke for many Republicans with a statement issued just after the vote saying he hopes Mr. Acostaâs focus will be âpromoting labor policies that are free of unnecessarily burdensome federal regulations.â Mr. Scott said he wants Acosta to permanently revoke rules governing financial advisers and adding Americans eligible for overtime pay. Democrats said any Labor secretary should advocate for the American workers to whom Mr. Trump promised so much during his upstart presidential campaign. They said Mr. Acosta has given no such commitment. Labor secretary is the last Cabinet post for Mr. Trump to fill. Mr. Trumpâs choice for U.S. trade representative, a job considered Cabinet-level, is awaiting a Senate vote. Tax overhaul push A senior administration official speaking anonymously said Thursday the White House plans to push its tax overhaul without any support from congressional Democrats. Meanwhile, asked on âGood Morning Americaâ on Thursday whether everyone in the middle class would see their taxes reduced, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin admitted that itâs possible they wonât. New office at VA Mr. Trump on Thursday created an office at the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve accountability and protect whistle-blowers, calling it a âbold step forward.â March for climate Thousands of environmentalists will once again rally in the nationâs capital this weekend, this time for the Peopleâs Climate March. CoalÂ pollution case The Trump administration has successfully delayed a legal fight over enforcing Obama-era restrictions on pollution from coal-fired power plants.

The good news is that Optane screams in PCs: the firm cites a Gamespot review to assert that a PC with Optane and a 1TB, 7,200 RPM spinning rust hard was four to eight times faster than a solid state disk at read-heavy tasks data. The combination wasn't as fast as solid state disks when it came to writes, but did beat spinning rust write times by 80 per cent. As the 32GB Optane module costs has a list price of US$77 and you can pick up a 1TB drive for US$50, that combination doesn't cost much more than a 256GB solid state disk, but slays the latter on capacity. And also on reads, which are important for applications beyond gaming. That Optane gives you the chance for a quick and cheap PC performance boost leads TrendFocus to suggest that scenario as the most likely short-term value adder to users, as âenterprise solutions using Optane are a long-term development project, requiring significant re-architecting of server platforms if the technology is used either as straight storage, or some kind of storage class memory.â The firm's John Chen also says Intel and Micron believe 3D Xpoint âwill not likely reach cost levels to become a direct replacement for NAND in the long run.â Chen of course notes that Optane only works with seventh-generation Core processors and the motherboards that support them, so is only going to help those making new PC purchases. So hands up who doesn't want the combination of super-fast reads and hard disk capacity? Bueller?

"It's just a question of which psychology is going to have more effect on the market," said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. Patti Domm | @pattidomm 7 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Strong earnings momentum could drive the S&P 500 back to its all-time high in the very near future â if not Friday. Earnings beats by big tech names could help boost the market, but the "Friday-afternoon effect" may short-circuit their run, as traders watch Washington and consider geopolitical concerns, like North Korea, ahead of the weekend. Brendan McDermid | Reuters Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Big oil reports earnings Friday, with both Exxon Mobil and Chevron expected before the bell. General Motors, Goodyear Tire, Synchrony Financial, Spirit Airlines and Colgate-Palmolive also report before the bell, as do Barclays, UBS, Sanofi, Sony, and Honda. But traders are watching to see if Thursday's after-hours movers carry the morning. Alphabet and Amazon.com both surged nearly 4 percent, driving Nasdaq futures higher late Thursday. But after-the-bell earnings disappointments from Microsoft and Intel weighed on their stocks and tugged on Dow futures. "Amazon and Alphabet stole the show. It's just a question of which psychology is going to have more effect on the market," said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, who follows short-term technicals. Starbucks also reported profits but missed on its revenues. Its stock was down nearly 5 percent late Thursday. Wunderlich Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said earnings should certainly help drive the S&P back to 2,400 soon. "It feels like the earnings season on balance is remarkably good; not just good, but remarkably good. You have 80 percent of the companies in the S&P beating estimates," he said. He said the market may not be able to hold its gains into the afternoon, even if it opens higher. "Fridays are tough. It's the Friday effect. What do you do Friday afternoon, ahead of a weekend where you don't know what's going on around the globe?" he said. There is also first quarter GDP Friday, expected to show sluggish growth below 1 percent when it is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. "It's much about the rear-view mirror. The hard data you want to focus on is the earnings, not the GDP report," Hogan said. Congress could approve a stop-gap measure Friday to allow it to work on a continuing resolution into next week. If not, the government would run out of funding and shut down, but traders do not expect to see that scenario. The S&P 500 closed up 1 point at 2,388 Thursday, and the Nasdaq was up 23 at 6,048, a new high. The Dow rose 6 to 20,981. Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, slipped. The 10-year was at 2.29 percent in late trading, and bond traders said the market was eyeing economists' cuts to first-quarter GDP forecasts, ahead of the report, as well as the action in Washington over the budget extension. The oil market was also a concern. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell more than 1 percent, to $48.97, before dipping lower on supply concerns. Hogan said oil's recent drop won't be reflected in the reports of Exxon and Chevron but the oil majors could comment on the outlook. "I'd love to see oil catch a bid here. It broke technically. It's really dragging the energy sector down. I don't know what the catalyst is going to be to get that to firm up," said Hogan. Besides GDP, other data includes the employment cost index at 8:30 a.m. ET, Chicago PMI at 9:45 a.m. and consumer sentiment at 10 a.m. Patti DommCNBC Markets Editor Related Securities Symbol Price Â  Change %Change S&P 500 --- XOM ---

Ahead of the open, NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit of 53 cents per share and revenue also above forecasts. Shares climbed nearly 4 percent, tracking for their best day since Feb. 3, 2016. Information technology was among the top S&P 500 performers in morning trade, while energy was the worst, dropping more than 1 percent as oil prices fell 2 percent on oversupply concerns. U.S. crude oil futures for June delivery hit their lowest since March 29 and were last trading near $48.46 a barrel. While the summer driving season has historically helped drive oil prices higher, domestic inventory levels "remain elevated by historical standards," Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA, said in a Thursday note to clients. "We remain hard pressed to get excited for the prospect of higher oil prices in a sub-two percent GDP growth environment as production in the U.S. continues to increase and rig counts rise," Bell said. "Incremental demand from emerging markets would be necessary to more substantially drive down inventory levels." Alphabet, Amazon.com (AMZN), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), and Starbucks (SBUX) are among companies set to report after the closing bell. "It's policy grabbing the headlines but the earnings still drive the market and the matter of the fact is, the earnings have been pretty good," said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade.Â  Technology, a key part of the so-called growth trade, has led the U.S. market rally so far this year. The major U.S. stock indexes closed marginally lower Wednesday, holding within 1 percent of their intraday highs, after the announcement of President Donald Trump's tax plan. Top officials called the proposal the "biggest tax cut" in U.S. history but remained vague on highly anticipated details such as the tax rate on repatriation of overseas profits. "I just think we're a little extended after the two-day move [earlier this week]," said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. "Everybody's anticipating the tax plan. Although they gave some detail it wasn't very specific." Durable goods orders rose a less-than-expected 0.7 percent in March. Weekly jobless claims increased more than expected to 257,000. Pending home sales fell 0.8 percent in March. Treasury yields traded mostly lower. The euro held below $1.090. The European Central Bank kept its benchmark interest rate at zero percent and monetary policy unchanged. ECB President Mario Draghi said in an opening statement that net asset purchases at a new monthly pace of 60 billion euros (nearly $65.6 billion) would "run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary." In morning trade, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 24 points, or 0.12 percent to 20,951. United Technologies and Cisco had the greatest positive impact, while Goldman Sachs and Caterpillar contributed the most to losses. Gold futures for June delivery climbed $2.90 to $1,267.10 an ounce.

Hot Topics: Fatal Longmont crash Firestone house explosion AAA Electric fire Sanctuary city Boulder County Business Hall of Fame News tips As Firestone investigation continues, state won't shut down other operators' older wells Investigators looking at Anadarko well near site of fatal house explosion By Amelia Arvesen Staff Writer Posted: Â  04/27/2017 02:28:21 PM MDT Updated: Â  04/27/2017 09:08:34 PM MDT Erin and Mark Martinez (Courtesy Photo) Related Firestone house explosion Apr 26: Anadarko shuts 3,000 wells in Colorado after deadly Firestone house explosion Apr 20: Coroner officially IDs brothers-in-law killed in Firestone fire Apr 19: Brothers-in-law died in Firestone blaze Not only is the Frederick-Firestone Fire Protection District investigating the cause of a deadly blast at a Firestone home last week, but the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and an international petroleum company has confirmed their involvement in the probe. Fire investigators, police and environmental consultants as well as oil and gas crews continue to look for clues in the rubble at 6312 Twilight Ave., where the blast and fire killed two men in the basement and a woman was seriously burned. Meanwhile, construction workers continue work on future apartments behind the neighborhood. Joey Irwin (Saddleback Golf Course / Courtesy Photo) Less than 200 feet from the southeast corner of the house sits a vertical oil and gas well owned by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. It has since been shut off among more than 3,000 of the company's older wells in response to the tragedy, according to the company Wednesday. On Thursday, state officials said the company's decision was voluntary, and therefore the state will not require other oil and gas operators in Colorado to shut their wells. Boulder County commissioners called for other operators to shut vertical wells in their county. Advertisement Matt Lepore, the commission's director, said in a press briefing that the Oak Meadows neighborhood has been deemed safe from methane and hydrocarbon gases, based on an environmental investigation. But he said a consultant on Wednesday conducted follow-up testing for gases in the soil surrounding the rubble of the home. Those findings have not yet been released. Similarly, the Frederick-Firestone Fire Protection District has not yet released an origin or cause of the deadly explosion, and the multi-agency investigation led by the local fire district is ongoing. Lepore said the commission's role "is limited to our jurisdiction, which would not include all of the aspects of the investigation." The bodies of brothers-in-law Mark Martinez and Joey Irwin, both 42, were discovered in the basement one day after the explosion. Martinez's wife, Erin, was seriously injured and continues to heal in the hospital. A child, believed to be her 11-year-old son, was also injured. Family and friends said Irwin had been called to help the Martinez family with the hot-water heater in their two-story home that they had lived in since 2015. Both Martinez and Irwin were experienced handymen, working as a public works foreman and as a plumber, respectively. Investigators are seen working on Thursday at the scene of a fire that killed two people and injured two others on the 6300 Block of Twilight Avenue in Firestone. (Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer) The fire protection district has not commented specifically on whether the water heater has anything to do with the investigation, but spokeswoman Summer Campos said in a text message Thursday that they have to "look at everything and slowly mark things off the list as we rule them out." Anadarko â the largest Weld County oil and gas producer in 2014, according to state data obtained by Natural Gas Intel â also did not directly link its well to the explosion when it announced its shutoff Wednesday. "When we have a more complete understanding of the circumstances involved here, we will be considering whether near-term actions will be required by operators on a field-wide basis or on a statewide basis to address specific issues identified as a result of this investigation," Lepore said. He said there are 11 wells in the area of the explosion, and seven were active and recently shut in by Anadarko. He said he believes the shuttering of the wells began in the days immediately after the blast, even though Anadarko didn't announce that until Wednesday. The wellhead near the site of the blast â primarily producing gas, but also some oil â is located 178 feet from the southeast corner of the house, and reaches a depth of 7,912 feet. It was drilled in 1993 by Gerrity Oil and Gas, and was acquired by several companies over the subsequent years, most recently Anadarko in 2014. The well had been inactive and was restarted in January, according to state records reviewed by The Denver Post. Lepore said that the well's lines once flowed to tank batteries â or storage tanks â to the east and north, with an active, existing flow line to the west tank battery closer to the house that exploded. It is unclear at this time how far the tank is from the house, and he did not provide the distance. The well is vertical, meaning it taps into a hole just below the surface, rather than today's horizontal drilling through several layers underground. Lepore said the well last was inspected by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in August 2014. Joe Ryan, University of Colorado environmental engineering professor and faculty director of research network "AirWaterGas," said shutting down a well has the same effect whether it's a vertical well or a horizontal well. "The flow of oil and gas is being stopped," he said. Ryan said in his opinion, the temporary shutoff makes him think that Anadarko is concerned there is some kind of leak from a wellhead, which would blow into the air, and shutting it accompanied by inspection would hopefully identify where a leak is. "That whole issue of the connection from the oil well to a nearby tank battery is something that we can't detect â it's underground," Ryan said. "You don't know how much might be lost in some leaky pipe in between." He said it's unlikely, but possible, and only professional measurements would be able to tell what's happening under the surface. The well is normally one of about 55,000 total active wells in Colorado. Lepore said out of 5,700 horizontal wells, about 5,400 are active. He said the rest are the traditional vertical or directional wells. The commission, Lepore said, acts upon a risk-based inspection protocol, responding to wells based on proximity to populations, proximity to environmental sensitive impacts and records of violations and inspections. The commission has recorded two explosions â one in 2005 and one in 2007 â though Lepore could not recall where. He said one resulted from a home that was built directly on top of an abandoned well and one resulted from a mobile home built very close, if not on top of, an abandoned well. The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission regulates the distance between new wells and existing buildings, but the agency does not regulate the distance that a home can be constructed from an older, existing well â such as what happened in the Firestone neighborhood where the explosion took place. "The distance that homes are built from wells is under the jurisdiction of local governments at this time and I don't have an opinion on how local governments should regulate," he said.

The reason why we say âwe reckonâ is because neither Acer or AMD chose to make any song and dance out of what is actually a fairly big piece of news. Ryzen was mentioned once at the Next@Acer press event on Thursday, and the only place to find it written down is on the company's spec sheet brochure. AMD-powered gaming PCs from big companies such as Acer, Dell, Lenovo and HP have been incredibly rare over the last few years, with Intelâs efficient Core i chips and strong marketing cloud keeping a decent monopoly over so-called âbig boxâ PC builders. See, there it is! Related: Best desktop PCs That domination looks to be over, as Acerâs GX-281 coming equipped with a choice of four new Ryzen processors on the spec sheet. Thereâs two eight-core chips listed in the form of the Ryzen 7 1700X and 1700, one six-core Ryzen 5 1600 and a quad-core Ryzen 5 1400. Other GX models will also come with Intel parts, so don't get too exicted, AMD fans. Most buyers probably wonât even notice, but for computing enthusiasts like us and (hopefully) you this is a much-needed bit of spice for a PC market thatâs been dominated by Intel/Nvidia combo system for years. There it is again! The system in question tops out at Nvidiaâs 1440p friendly GTX 1070, but can be specified with an AMD RX 480 for an all-team-red gaming PC. Thereâs no word on pricing or UK availability so it may well be this machine doesnât come to the UK, especially as AMD faces the challenge of getting regular, everyday folk to recognise its brand. That task might be harder than developing Ryzen itself. 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

The presence in those two countries accounted for 25 per cent of the companyâs overall operational costs while representing only 4.5 per cent of business operations. The bosses in Nairobi decided to cut their losses and focus on strengthening the companyâs position at home. It was a blatant admission of failure. Uchumiâs misfortune, however, was an exception not the norm. In general, the Kenyan service sector has enjoyed a period of massive growth, dragging the rest of the economy along. Despite evidence to the contrary, many African economists still dismiss the service sector as a tiny section of the economy with limited potential to provide jobs or spur competition. They instead encourage us to embrace agriculture and manufacturing. Kenya, on the other hand, has chosen to invest in the service sector and the results are very positive. According to The World Bank, in 2015/2016, the service sector grew at a rate of 5.2 per cent ahead of manufacturing (3.6) and agriculture (2.5). The overall GDP growth rate for the year was 5.3 per cent. That left the service sector as the number one foreign exchange earner. The Kenyan government understands the great potential. It is aggressively supporting high-tech upstarts in a bid to make Nairobi the Silicon Valley of Africa. In my opinion, they have already succeeded. Tech giants like Google, Intel and Microsoft have sites in Nairobi while the city also hosts the IBM Innovation Centre (the companyâs first research lab on the continent). Construction of a new techno-city at Konza (60 km from Nairobi) is already underway. Whereas tourism remains the rock upon which the service sector hinges, Kenyans have also found a passion for banking and they are doing it profitably. Their banks have branched into the region and are commanding a respectable market share. According to results posted this month, Diamond Trust Bank Tanzania (a subsidiary of DTB Kenya) made a respectable TShs31b in pre-tax profits last year. The year before, those profits stood at TShs27.3b. All of this shows that there is massive potential for growth in Tanzaniaâs banking sector. And the DTB success story is just one among many. KCB, which operates in all East African states (with 250 branches) is promising a 14 per cent surge in profits for the first half of this year. Equity bank is also performing quite well and has spread its tentacles all over the region â including South Sudan. The retreat of Uchumi left other Kenyan enterprises flying the flag in the Tanzanian and Ugandan markets, with remarkable success. These Kenyan regional success stories expose the deplorable absence of Ugandan, Tanzanian (besides Azam) or Rwandan companies doing well in the region. Should we blame it on a lack of ambition, comfortable market access at home or lack of capacity? We need to realise that the more the private sector grows, the more liable they are to pay more taxes (repatriated profits are also taxable). As such the government stands to benefit. Money earned from outside the primary economy also boosts foreign exchange reserves. Profits made from elsewhere can be a source of capitalisation for local expansion. This improves access to customers, enables better service provision and leads to job growth. Cross-border business will also improve people to people contact and thereby strengthen regional integration. It will also provide competition which increases innovation and service quality. We should welcome Kenyan businesses but we need to challenge our own investors to look beyond borders for investment opportunities. Government can help by offering low interest capital and diplomatic manoeuvering. When these businesses take off regionally and start making profits, then it can recoup its investment, tax accordingly, and impose higher cash reserve requirements. It can also lean on them to diversify their investment in the economy. In the end everybody wins. The outlook in other regional economies needs to change. They need to look beyond agriculture and manufacturing. We need to realise that a big hotel can employ as many people as a juice factory. A successful bank that brings in profits earned from other countries can contribute as much in foreign exchange as a sisal â exporting business.

REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo By Narottam Medhora Intel Corp reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue due to an unexpected slowdown in growth at its data center business, on which the world's largest chipmaker is banking to reduce its reliance on the personal computer market. The company's shares fell nearly 4 percent to $35.97 in trading after the bell on Thursday. Revenue from Intel's higher-margin data center business rose 6 percent to $4.2 billion in the first quarter. That was less than the 9 percent jump a year-ago and the 8 percent increase in the fourth quarter. "I think the Street was looking for slightly better than that," Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Analysts were expecting revenue to increase 10 percent to about $4.4 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. The slowdown in revenue growth comes after Intel warned in February that business's margins could be hit by higher costs. However, Intel still expects the business to grow in the high single-digit percentage rate this year, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a call. FORECAST RAISED Intel marginally raised its full-year revenue forecast, which Krzanich said was due to average selling prices across its businesses trending ahead of expectations. The Santa Clara-based company expects 2017 revenue of about $60 billion. It had earlier forecast revenue would be flat compared with 2016 revenue of $59.4 billion. Intel increased its share buyback program by $10 billion to about $15 billion and also raised its 2017 adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents to $2.85 per share, plus or minus 5 percent. The company has previously said it expects its deal to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, announced last month, to boost adjusted profit. The acquisition thrusts Intel into the forefront of the market to develop driverless systems. The deal, along with a focus on cloud computing, will also help Intel reduce its dependence on the PC market. Intel gets most of its revenue from selling chips used in PCs. Its PC business returned to growth in 2016 as demand stabilized in the second half of the year. Demand also unexpectedly edged up in the first quarter, according to research firm IDC. That helped revenue from the client computing group, as Intel calls the business, increase 6 percent to $8 billion, matching estimates. Intel's total revenue rose 8 percent to $14.80 billion, falling short of analysts' estimate of $14.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income jumped 45 percent to $2.96 billion. Excluding items, Intel earned 66 cents per share, one cent above analysts' estimate.

Yesterday when Call of Duty: WW2 was revealed, a teaser image for Nazi Zombies was released showing a typical, rotting, undead fella wearing a German military helmet. When the image is brightened, on the inside rim of the zombieâs helmet you can see some letters. These letters, per reddit are: IUFDJ BHLOP JMUBA. Upon entering these numbers on the typewriter, the three lights go green and a message pops up: âA New Horror Risesâ before three images appear: a document folder with signatures and letters and numbers on the side of it; a worn image of Holy Roman Emperor and King of Burgundy and Germany, Frederick Barbarossa (Frederick I); and an image of Raphaelâs famous painting, Portrait of a Young Man. Between reddit and Charlie Intel, a few things have been figured out. First up, the numbers on the typewriterâs serial plate are coordinates to Dunkirk, France where the Battle and Siege of Dunkirk took place in 1944. The image of Frederick Barbarossa likely points Operation Barbarossa, which was the codename of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Raphaelâs painting seen in the fith image, was one of many works of art stolen by the Naziâs during World War 2. The painting was stolen from the Czartoryski Museum in Krakow, Poland in 1945 and its whereabouts are still unknown. The numbers and letters on the side of the folder, which can be seen much better when viewing the Call of Duty: WW2 website on mobile, show the following: FORM â YMF â 212514 â 12123 â 131. This doesnâtâ seem to have been cracked yet, and I have looked everywhere. If you or someone else has figured it out, let me know in the comments. When plugging the numbers into the typewriter on the website, I canât seem to get the green light in the middle to appear no matter how many times I punch in BHLOP (because Iâm dumb, apparently) so I will take everyoneâs word for all of the aforementioned information. Give it all a go yourself through the official website, and keep checking back with it, because we expect more ARG type of fun in the coming days and weeks leading up to the Zombie and multiplayer reveal at E3 2017.

The South Korean company's stellar financial results beat expectations and reflect its ability to overcome the fiasco over its Galaxy Note 7s, which it pulled from the market when its batteries were found to be prone to overheating. That cost Samsung at least $5 billion. The secrets to its crisis-defying performance: microchips. "The semiconductor business will continue to see a boom for at least a year ahead and its earnings result is on a roll," said Park Ju-gun, chief executive at CEO Score, a private corporate watchdog. Samsung Electronics is the world's largest memory chipmaker and second-largest semiconductor company after Intel. Its semiconductor department generated 6.3 trillion won ($5.6 billion) in operating income during the first three months of this year, more than double a year earlier. So nearly two-thirds of Samsung's operating income during the first quarter was generated by its semiconductor business. The first quarter is typically a slow season for chipmakers but market circumstances were especially favourable for companies like Samsung that are positioned to quickly and efficiently mass produce microchips. Global supplies were tight and consumer demand for more sophisticated and high-density mobile devices that can quickly multitask and process more images, videos and other data was strong. Data centres on the world are also handling growing amounts of data, with more and more gadgets connected to the Internet. The tight supplies and solid demand, pushed prices for Samsung's key microchip products called NAND and DRAM up sharply, giving it fat margins. Such market conditions are unlikely to change in coming months, so analysts expect Samsung to rake in its best ever earnings in 2017. For the January-March period, Samsung's profit jumped 46 per cent over a year earlier to 7.7 trillion won ($6.8 billion), compared with 5.3 trillion won a year earlier. For the full year, Samsung said its components business such as memory chips and mobile-phone screens known as OLED will drive profits. Samsung is betting on the Galaxy S8 smartphone, which uses curved OLED screens that wrap around its corners. The S8 and S8 Plus with larger screens went on sale last week with strong preorders. Samsung is still facing some acute headaches. Five of its top executives, including Lee Jae-yong, the de-facto leader and the only son of its chair, were indicted on corruption charges in a political scandal that brought on months of public protests and resulted in the ouster of the South Korean president. The trial is expected to continue until August. Samsung launched sales of Galaxy S8 smartphones last week, and says preorders were strong. The company responded to complaints from some consumers that the screen appeared to have a pink hue by saying it is releasing a software update to allow subtle adjustments of screen colours. Apart from its earnings, Samsung announced that after months of review it would not change the company's structure into a holding company. That may disappoint investors who had thought such a change could boost share prices and increase transparency in dozens of Samsung businesses that are controlled by the Lee family despite owning only small stakes in each company, thanks to a web of complicated cross-shareholdings. Concern over transparency in the chaebol, as big South Korean family-controlled businesses are known, has intensified with the scandal over political donations that resulted in the indictments of Lee and other top executives.

Friday, April 28, 2017 Politics White House Congress Campaigns All Politics Policy Defense / National Security Energy Healthcare Finance / Economy Tech / Cyber Budgets / Spending Courts Foreign All Policy News Opinion Editorials Columnists Contributors Op-Eds Editorial Cartoons All Opinion Magazine Beltway Confidential Washington Secrets Byron York: Schiff mum on what he saw at White House by Byron York | Apr 3, 2017, 11:04 AM Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email this article Share on LinkedIn Schiff slammed Nunes for viewing the documents by himself and not sharing them with Democrats on the committee. (Graeme Jennings/Examiner) Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has been sharply critical of the panel's Republican chairman, Devin Nunes, for visiting the White House to view classified documents that Nunes says show the Obama administration intercepted the communications of Donald Trump associates before the president took office in January. Among other things, Schiff slammed Nunes for viewing the documents by himself and not sharing them with Democrats on the committee. So last week, White House counsel Don McGahn invited Schiff to come see the documents for himself. Schiff did so on Friday. Now, both the Republican chairman and the Democratic ranking member on the Intel Committee have seen the documents. And now, the public has a chance to hear another assessment to balance Nunes' claim that he saw "dozens" of intelligence reports involving the incidental collection of Trumpworld figures in Obama administration intercepts, with the names of some of them "unmasked," and that none of it had to do with Russia. In other words, Nunes suggested the Obama administration misused its wiretapping powers to gather information on the Trump team. So with Schiff's visit to the White House, a chance for balance. But after viewing the documents, Schiff has gone nearly completely silent about what he saw. He has kept up his criticism of how Nunes came to view the material, but on what's actually in the documents, Schiff has said virtually nothing. On Friday, immediately after viewing the documents, Schiff released a statement in which he declined to say anything about substance and repeated earlier criticisms of Republicans' handling of the matter. "While I cannot discuss the content of the documents," Schiff said, "if the White House had any concern over these materials, they should have been shared with the full committee in the first place." Schiff made no public comments on Saturday, and then on Sunday morning appeared on CNN, where Jake Tapper asked Schiff if, having seen the documents, "can you understand why Chairman Nunes might have some issues with the surveillance that was going on?" "I can't go into the contents of the documents, Jake," Schiff said, before a quick pivot to Nunes' methods. "I can say I don't agree with the chairman's characterization, which is exactly why it's so important you don't share documents with just one person or even two people. They need to be shared with both full committees." Continuing, Schiff said "the most important thing" about the documents is not what is in them but how they were handled: But the most important thing people need to know about these documents is not classified, and it's a couple of things. First, the deputy assistant to the White House informed me when I went to see them that these are exactly the same materials that were shown to the chairman. Now, this is a very interesting point. How does the White House know that these are the same materials that were shown to the chairman, if the White House wasn't aware what the chairman was being shown? And the second point was also made to me. And this is â I think was also underscored by Sean Spicer â and that is, it was told to me by the deputy assistant that these materials were produced in the ordinary course of business. Well, the question for the White House and for Mr. Spicer is the ordinary course of whose business? Because, if these were produced either for or by the White House, then why all of the subterfuge? There's nothing ordinary about the process that was used here at all. All the talk about intercepts, Schiff said, was just an attempt by Trump and Republicans to distract from questions about Trump and Russia. By that time, anyone interested in the substance of the issue â Do the documents show that Obama administration officials picked up Trumpworld figures in electronic intercepts and then identified them by name? â was entirely frustrated. Schiff appeared determined to say nothing about substance. "I guess the question that Nunes is asking or suggesting that we should be asking in the media," Tapper said to Schiff, "[is] who unmasked these Trump advisers, and is it possible that any of this unmasking was being done for political reasons, instead of for legitimate ones?" "Well, first of all, I can't talk about, as I mentioned, the contents of any documents," Schiff said. "So at this point, I can't say whether anything was masked or unmasked improperly." Schiff then pivoted again to criticize Republican procedures. Monday morning, Bloomberg's Eli Lake reported that former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice "requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter." If that is accurate, it seems unlikely that the "most important" thing about the documents is how they were handled. After seeing the documents with his own eyes, Schiff had a chance to shed some light on what has become a key question in the Trump-Russia matter. He didn't take it.

The Justice Department told Bank ofÂ America that Stratfor would be ideally suited toÂ conduct these operations. As the tales ofÂ corporate espionage emerged, Brown reported onÂ the leaks, which made waves due toÂ the operations coinciding withÂ the Occupy Wall Street movement.Â  Â© Photo: Pixabay Endless Black Hole: Americaâs Top Spies Donât Know Full Dangers of US Intel Capabilities, Says Barrett Brown The government tried toÂ paint Brown asÂ the person who leaked these documents, though heâd only reported onÂ them. He initially faced a 100-year sentence. After pleading guilty toÂ two charges pertaining toÂ obstruction ofÂ justice and threatening an FBI agent, Brownâs sentence was knocked downÂ to five years and three months. In sum, Brownâs helped spark the war onÂ leaks that persists toÂ this day. Brown was put inÂ handcuffs duringÂ a routine check-in, beforeÂ being taken toÂ an unknown facility. Since being released early fromÂ jail, Brown has not missed a single meeting withÂ prison authorities. Following his arrest, Brown told his mom he believes authorities brought him intoÂ custody overÂ failure toÂ gain âpermissionâ toÂ provide interviews withÂ news outlets afterÂ he was released inÂ November. Brownâs first exclusive interview was given toÂ Radio Sputnikâs By Any Means Necessary withÂ the ever-affable Eugene Puryear. âBrown also spoke toÂ Vice News last week and was slated toÂ go onÂ PBS Friday forÂ another interview, and these appearances may be what landed him back inÂ jail. So much forÂ free speech.Â  âIf this were happening inÂ another country, [the US government] would deplore it,â former CIA clandestine operative Barry Eisley tweeted. Â  According toÂ his mother, Brown said that the Bureau ofÂ Prisons never informed him that he would need toÂ get special permission toÂ do TV or radio interviews. Brownâs point ofÂ contact withÂ the BOP, Luz Lujan, refused toÂ give Brown âcopies ofÂ program statement rules saying this is a requirement duringÂ halfway house and/or home confinement status.â When Lujan finally got back toÂ Brown afterÂ a week ofÂ not returning his calls, Brown received a form forÂ reporters visiting an inmate inÂ prison, the Intercept reported. The BOP also never showed Brown the document stating why he had toÂ get permission.Â  Â© AP Photo/ Kirsty Wigglesworth 'Preemptive Defense': Assange Explains What Prompted CIA Chief's Angry Attack on WikiLeaks In other words, according toÂ Brown, he was never provided a copy ofÂ the form he is now being arrested forÂ not having filled out.Â  âYou guys are going toÂ carry outÂ this, you guys are going toÂ characterize this asÂ a refusal ofÂ an order that theyâre not giving me inÂ writing,â Barrett said inÂ a recorded conversation withÂ his case manager. If failing toÂ cooperate withÂ BOP restrictions onÂ interviews is the reason Brown was stripped ofÂ his freedoms duringÂ a routine meeting, that would be âdisgusting,â his lawyer said, noting that the so-called restrictions seem toÂ have been created onÂ an improvised basis. UPDATE: "This is a terrible affront toÂ the First Amendment," Leiderman told Sputnik News inÂ an exclusive interview. Ironically, Brown was never required toÂ get permissions toÂ do interviews while he was previously inÂ federal custody, Leiderman added.Â  Within the pastÂ two days, Brown was asked toÂ produce "prior authorizations" toÂ conduct interviews. "It came outÂ of the blue," Leiderman continued. Brown never actually said no toÂ getting the prior authorizations, butÂ simply requested that the BOP furnish the policy manual which Lujan said was the reason Brown was being asked toÂ get the permissions. The counselor is "not aware" ofÂ any existing precedent where the BOP deployed this policy manual, which adds fire toÂ the claim that this policy measure is being used againstÂ Brown personally. Brown's words "are weapons ofÂ mass education, which is why they are targeting him."Â  ...

Ahead of the open, NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit of 53 cents per share and revenue also above forecasts. Shares climbed nearly 4 percent, tracking for their best day since Feb. 3, 2016. Information technology was among the top S&P 500 performers in morning trade, while energy was the worst, dropping more than 1 percent as oil prices fell 2 percent on oversupply concerns. U.S. crude oil futures for June delivery hit their lowest since March 29 and were last trading near $48.46 a barrel. While the summer driving season has historically helped drive oil prices higher, domestic inventory levels "remain elevated by historical standards," Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA, said in a Thursday note to clients. "We remain hard pressed to get excited for the prospect of higher oil prices in a sub-two percent GDP growth environment as production in the U.S. continues to increase and rig counts rise," Bell said. "Incremental demand from emerging markets would be necessary to more substantially drive down inventory levels." Alphabet, Amazon.com (AMZN), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), and Starbucks (SBUX) are among companies set to report after the closing bell. "It's policy grabbing the headlines but the earnings still drive the market and the matter of the fact is, the earnings have been pretty good," said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade.Â  Technology, a key part of the so-called growth trade, has led the U.S. market rally so far this year. The major U.S. stock indexes closed marginally lower Wednesday, holding within 1 percent of their intraday highs, after the announcement of President Donald Trump's tax plan. Top officials called the proposal the "biggest tax cut" in U.S. history but remained vague on highly anticipated details such as the tax rate on repatriation of overseas profits. "I just think we're a little extended after the two-day move [earlier this week]," said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. "Everybody's anticipating the tax plan. Although they gave some detail it wasn't very specific." Durable goods orders rose a less-than-expected 0.7 percent in March. Weekly jobless claims increased more than expected to 257,000. Pending home sales fell 0.8 percent in March. Treasury yields traded mostly lower. The euro held below $1.090. The European Central Bank kept its benchmark interest rate at zero percent and monetary policy unchanged. ECB President Mario Draghi said in an opening statement that net asset purchases at a new monthly pace of 60 billion euros (nearly $65.6 billion) would "run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary." In morning trade, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 24 points, or 0.12 percent to 20,951. United Technologies and Cisco had the greatest positive impact, while Goldman Sachs and Caterpillar contributed the most to losses. Gold futures for June delivery climbed $2.90 to $1,267.10 an ounce.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 27, 2017 1:03 PM PT Credit: Acer More like this The best laptops of 2017: Ultrabooks, budget PCs, 2-in-1s, and more Lenovo's cutting-edge Miix 720 challenges Microsoft's Surface Surface Book vs. Porsche Design Book One: A specs comparison Video Microsoft Surface Studio review: A magnificent, pricey all-in-one PC Microsoft has set the gold standard for tablet-style 2-in-1 devices with its Surface Pro, and other PC vendors have followed suit with their own designs. Acerâs latest Surface-style device, the Switch 5, offers a couple of advantagesÂ but lacks in other areas. I had a chance to play with the Switch 5 at an Acer event in New York City, where new PCs and tablets were announced. The Switch 5 is a tablet first, but a keyboard attachment can be hooked up to make it a laptop. As a tablet, the Switch 5 is quite light, about the equivalent of the Surface Pro 4. The device doesnât look as polished as the Surface Pro, nor does it have the premium finish. But it does have solid technologies, like the latest Intel processor and liquid cooling, that set it apart from rival devices. [ Further reading: Our picks for best PC laptops ] Acer has priced the Switch 5 at $799 for the U.S. market, which is higher than the $749 starting price of the Surface Pro. Surprisingly, the Switch 5 is priced starting at a ridiculous â¬1,099 ($1,192)âalmost $400 moreâfor the European market. It will be available in the U.S. and Europe in June, and it will ship in China in July. The Switch 5 runs Intelâs Kaby Lake chips, putting it a full generation ahead of Surface Pro 4, which has the slower Skylake chips. The Acer tablet also has a USB-C port, giving it an edge over Surface Pro, which has a USB 3.0 port. Itâs not entirely clear if Microsoft will release a Surface Pro 5 based on Kaby Lake, but if so, it could include a USB-C port. The 12-inch Acer tablet has a 2160 x 1440 display, and the screen was sharp. It was hard to do instant benchmarking of the Switch 5 unit, which had a Core i7 chip. But the programs loaded instantly, and the graphics were flawless. In an eye test, the performance was similar to the Dell XPS 13 I use on a daily basis. The magnetic keyboard attachment clipped on to the tablet much like the keyboard for the Surface Pro 4. Inside the tablet is 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM, which is slower from the DDR4 memory going into the latest laptops.Â Thatâs a disappointmentÂ and an area where Acer decided to cut corners. The Switch 5 can be configured with 256GB to 512GB of solid-state drive storage. Acer promoted the deviceâs hingeâwhich allows the tablet to stand on a tableâas being a difference maker, but it felt cheaply made. The Surface 4 hinge feels more solid and offers more flexibility for positioning the device. The Switch 5 was silent, and there was no sound of a fan. Thatâs because it has liquid cooling technology inside, using a pipe inside to move water to keep components cool. That has helped reduce the size of the device, and also make it lighter. The tablet is just 9.6-millimeters thick. The Surface Pro 4, by contrast, has a fan to dissipate heat generated by components. The Acer tablet has 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and offers battery life about 10.5 hours, according to the company. It also has a 2-megapixel front camera and a 5-megapixel rear camera. Itâs priced similar to the Surface Pro 4, so a buying decision comes down to what you want. Itâs worth buying partly for the Kaby Lake processor and USB Type-C port, but if Microsoft upgrades its Surface Pro, then that decision becomes tougher. The Switch 5 will be a good 2-in-1 device for running productivity software, but it seems overpriced partly because it has some weak features, including DDR3 memory and low-resolution cameras.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Stick PC Market: Future Demand and Growth Analysis up to 2024 Global Stick PC Market Industry Analysis, Stick PC Market Size A stick PC is a single board computer resembling a stick cased in a small casing much like a USB flash drive. Stick PC or PC on a stick can be plugged directly into an HDMI compatible monitor or TV to provide complete experience of a personal computer. It is mainly designed for programs which are light along with social networking, media streaming, web browsing, and video chatting. Also called compute sticks, stick PC devices can be paired with Bluetooth wireless mouse and keyboard for user inputs. However, we can also use USB port on stick PC as an input for USB wired mouse and keyboard. Powered by Atom system on a chip by Intel or ARM, the PC on a stick device use either Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 or Linux distribution, especially Ubuntu as the operating system for the device. Stick PC was introduced first in 2003. One of the disadvantages of PC on a stick is lack of the full power and functionality of laptop, PC, and traditional desktop. Obtain Report Details @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/stick-pc-market.html The market can be segmented based on the geography which are North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, and Latin America. Asia Pacific is projected a high growth in the global market during the forecast period. Major contributors to the increase in market demand for stick PC are the developing countries such as India and China. These countries are still adopting digital infrastructure in the K-12 segment which is likely to be driving the demand to provide instructors and students some digital learning facilities using these necessary devices. This factor is expected to further augment the market for PC on a stick in these countries.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Rep. Jason Chaffetz's surprise announcement Wednesday that he would not seek re-election in 2018 inspired a Democratic National Committee staffer and a former Obama aide to circulate a conspiracy theory alleging the Russians might have compromised the Utah congressman. DNC deputy communications director Adrienne Watson highlighted an April 13 tweet from former British MP Louise Mensch, whose star in the U.S. has risen directly proportional to her willingness to accuse everyone and everything of being part of some shady Russian conspiracy. Mensch wrote last week, "Sources say there is kompromat on [Rep. Chaffetz] that this is why he turned and that [FBI] know it. #traitorinthehouse." The former member of Parliament provided exactly zero evidence to back her claim the Russians have compromising information on Chaffetz. However, this lack of proof didn't stop Watson from sharing the tweet Wednesday as news of the congressman's abrupt retirement surprised both journalists and politicos. "Chaffetz not seeking re-election will raise more questions about this," the DNC staffer tweeted, linking to Mensch. Elsewhere on social media, Ned Price, who served as a special assistant to former President Obama, circulated a blog post rehashing Mensch's original conspiracy tweet. "Interesting, if single-sourced, article from a few days ago. Just getting around to sharing it now cause, well â¦," Price said Wednesday afternoon. He linked to a separate Twitter account called the "Trump Diaries." That account had tweeted an article titled, "Intel source: FBI discovers Kremlin is blackmailing Jason Chaffetz over Donald Trump and Russia." The blog post hinges entirely on Mensch's unfounded allegation. "According to an intel community source, the FBI has learned that Russia has 'kompromat' blackmail material on Chaffetz and has been using it to keep him in line with regard to Trump's Russia scandal," the post reads. "The intel source comes by way of political pundit Louise Mensch, whose inside sources have a history of being correct about FISA warrants and other matters." It concluded, "Now comes the question of just what the FBI will do with the apparent knowledge that Jason Chaffetz, a sitting Congressman, is a traitor acting on behalf of Russia. Will Chaffetz eventually end up among the arrests?" Like Mensch's original tweet, the blog post provides no evidence of an actual link between Chaffetz and the Russians. The congressman, for his part, clarified Wednesday that his looming retirement is about himself and his family and nothing else. "For those that would speculate otherwise, let me be clear that I have no ulterior motives. I am healthy. I am confident I would continue to be re-elected by large margins," he said in a statement posted to his Facebook page. "I have the full support of Speaker Ryan to continue as Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. That said, I have made a personal decision to return to the private sector," it added.

Friday, April 28, 2017 Politics White House Congress Campaigns All Politics Policy Defense / National Security Energy Healthcare Finance / Economy Tech / Cyber Budgets / Spending Courts Foreign All Policy News Opinion Editorials Columnists Contributors Op-Eds Editorial Cartoons All Opinion Magazine Beltway Confidential Washington Secrets Workers suffer when militarized police and Big Green get together by Ron Arnold | Aug 19, 2014, 5:00 PM Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email this article Share on LinkedIn A debate about the militarization of Minnesota police forces has been renewed in light of the shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. (AP Photo/The St. Cloud Times, Jason Wachter) While all eyes turn to the gunfire and Molotov cocktails of War Zone Ferguson, Mo., many minds turn to questions of mindless faith in the political establishment. Whatâs happening to us? One such mind belongs to basketball champion turned actor and best-selling author, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, whose Monday commentary on Ferguson for Time Magazine bore the chilling headline, "The Coming Race War Wonât Be About Race." It will be about class warfare, he predicted, the powerful and wealthy elite against the 50 million Americans who are poor â black, Latino and white. âFifty million voters is a powerful block if they ever organized in an effort to pursue their common economic goals,â Abdul-Jabbar wrote. This great iconâs class warfare insight reaches farther than he knows, into the multimillions of marginalized, demonized and despised workers of the resource class â loggers, coal miners, cattle ranchers, commercial fishermen, oil rig roustabouts, tunnel blasters, heavy equipment operators, and on and on, every one of us who gets dirty hands making the stuff of elite splendor and majesty â and, yes, I once shoveled foundation trenches and shouldered kegs of ten-penny brights (nails) for a living. All these hardworking people are mocked, devalued and destroyed by Big Greenâs privileged few, as told in the recent Senate report, âHow a Club of Billionaires and Their Foundations Control the Environmental Movement and Obamaâs EPA.â Itâs a class warfare warning. Natural Resources Defense Council President Frances Beinecke (heiress of the Sperry & Hutchinson fortune) doesnât help the poor with their economic goals using her $427,595 annual compensation or the groupâs $241.8 million assets, but ruins every resource worker possible. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundationâs chief investment officer, Denise Strack, doesnât help the poor with their economic goals using her $1.6 million annual compensation or the foundationâs $5.6 billion assets from the Intel fortune, but helps ruin every resource worker possible. Big Green conducts class war with its power over the federal government. If that sounds impossible, let me tell you a story. On July 27, 1991, 30 U.S. Forest Service agents on horseback, some armed with semi-automatic weapons and wearing bulletproof vests, raided rancher Wayne Hageâs cattle in Meadow Canyon in the Toiyabe National Forest, high in the mountains of central Nevada. The cows were drinking from disputed water and were to be impounded that day, destroying Hageâs livelihood â and dooming some of the meat supply that gave minimum-wage urban burger flippers something to flip. The agents hoped to infuriate Hage into violence and kill him. However, he showed up with a camera, immortalized them on film, sued them, and after years in a federal court, won a ruling that he owned the water. The Forest Service had no right to impound his cattle. A court document showed that David Young, special agent in charge of the raid, had personally brought with him several Remington Model 870 pump-action 12 gauge shotguns, Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifles, Sig Sauer P220 .45 caliber semi-automatic pistols and a Smith & Wesson Model 36 .38 caliber revolver. On April 2, 1990, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Forest Service James C. Overbay sent a letter to his subordinate regional foresters, urging support of environmentalists in return for their help supporting larger Forest Service fish and wildlife budgets, removal of ranchers, and expansion of USFS authority and power. It said: âConservation groups representing the organized wildlife and fish interests across the country have given considerable effort, time, and money to help the Forest Service promote these important programs. We need the support of these groups to avoid possible reductions in fish and wildlife budgets. They would like to see the results of these efforts. We owe this to them.â A little over a year later, the Forest Service paid off rich environmentalists by ruining Wayne Hage. The service's culture of resource stewardship was drifting far from its conservation roots to political obsequiousness and ostentatious zeal. Overbay had already devastated other ranchers with less publicity, but it was the Hage raid that reinforced Cliven Bundyâs misguided beliefs about federal authority and led to President Obamaâs Bureau of Land Management storming the Bundy ranch from attack helicopters duded up in military-grade body armor, flashing short-barreled assault rifles, and crashing around in armored vehicles â enough combat equipment to remove the tinfoil hat stigma from the black helicopter crowdâs collective head. As John Steinbeck famously wrote in The Grapes of Wrath: âRepression works only to strengthen and knit the oppressed.â A rabble in arms materialized from all over the West to protect the Bundy ranch â ready to die. It was blatant armed insurrection, but federal prudence prevailed and the BLM stood down â prosecutors are dealing with it now. The militarization of federal agencies has a long history but should have a short future. Big Greenâs federal power grip needs to be smashed and its storm troopers disarmed. In June, Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, introduced the Regulatory Agency Demilitarization Act, to stem the trend of federal regulatory agencies developing SWAT-like teams. Maybe itâs unrealistic, but perhaps Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could recommend a diplomatic mission from the poor to the reviled workers of the resource class, put aside any past hurts and hates for a while, and organize in an effort to pursue their common economic goals.

The notebook sports a 15.6 inch display and a body thatâs just 18.9mm (0.74 inches thick). Itâs not exactly the lightest laptop around, weighing in at 2.6kg (about 5.7 pounds), but itâs a powerful computer with an overclockable Intel Kaby Lake processor, NVIDIA GeForce 10-series graphics, and an unusual design with a glass touchpad above the keyboardâ¦ and when I say glass, I mean itâs clear glass that lets you see the AeroBlade cooling system thatâs under the touchpad. The Triton 700 features a full HD IPS display, support for two NVMe PCIe solid state drives, and up to 32GB of DDR4-2400 memory. It has Thunderbolt 3 support, two USB 3.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, and HDMI 2.0. And the system has a mechanical keyboard with programmable RGB lighting. Thereâs also a fan control system that lets users adjust the system cooling policy manually for performance that best meets their gaming needs. The Predator Triton 700 gaming laptop is set to hit the streets in August, but it wonât be cheap: Pricing starts at $2,999 in North America and 3,399 Euros in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Iâve got an R7 572 with the same layout and it feels great for how I use it. It looks odd at first but with a touchscreen and a mouse I never use the trackpad anyway, and the forward placement of the keyboard is very comfortable. Wish theyâd come out with a new laptop with the same Ezel hinge as the R7 57X line.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Acer Swift 1 notebook with FHD display, Apollo Lake CPU coming this summer for $329 and up 04/27/2017 at 2:21 PM by Brad Linder 3 Comments acer, acer swift 1, Acer is expanding its Swift line of thin-and-light laptops with a new entry level model called the Swift 1. Powered by an Intel Apollo Lake processor, this 13.3 inch laptop measures about 0.7 inches thick, weighs about 2.9 pounds, and has an all-metal case and a fanless design. It also features a full HD IPS matte display and a starting price of $329. For that price, what you get is a portable Windows notebook with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of eMMC storage, and a Celeron N3350 processor. Acer will also offer higher-priced models with up to a Pentium N4200 processor and 128GB or 256GB SATA solid state drives. Each version includes 802.11ac WiFi, three full-sized USB ports, HDMI and headset jacks, and up to 10 hours of battery life from a non-removable battery. Thereâs also an integrated fingerprint sensor. Acer will offer models in silver, pink, and gold colors, and the Acer Swift 1 should be available for purchase starting in June. While Acer is showing off notebooks and tablets with significantly more horsepower, this may be one of my favorite new laptops from the company thanks to its bang-for-the-buck factor. Itâs a pretty nice looking machine with a matte display thatâs easy(ish) to view outdoors and which has wide viewing angles. Thereâs a large touchpad, a decent keyboard, and a compact design. The Apollo Lake CPU and 4GB of RAM may keep it from being your primary computer if you need to perform anyÂ resource-intensive tasks on a regular basis. But it seems like a nice option for a secondary computer that you can use to work (or play) on the go. It could also make a decent first-time PC for a kid or someone else who may not need bleeding-edge hardware.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) Posted: Thursday, April 27, 2017 5:01 pm | Updated: 7:30 pm, Thu Apr 27, 2017. Pentagon joins intensifying probe of former Trump aide Flynn Associated Press | WASHINGTON (AP) â Investigations intensified into President Donald Trump's ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn, on Thursday as the Pentagon watchdog joined lawmakers in probing payments he accepted from foreign sources including a Russian state-sponsored TV network. At the same time, documents released by the top Democrat on a House oversight committee showed Flynn was warned by authorities after he retired from the military in 2014 not to take foreign government-sourced money without "advance approval" from the Pentagon. Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general and Defense Intelligence Agency chief, later accepted tens of thousands of dollars for his work on behalf of foreign interests, including RT, the state-supported Russian television network, and a Turkish-owned company linked to Turkey's government. The Pentagon's acting inspector general's office confirmed Thursday he has launched an inquiry into whether those payments qualify as coming from foreign governments and whether Flynn properly informed military authorities about them. The White House defended its hiring of Flynn and attempted to shift blame for any problems with his vetting onto the Obama administration, which handled the reissuance of his security clearance in January 2016. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who released the documents, said during a news conference that Flynn had been clearly informed he needed to get permission to receive foreign payments and there's no evidence he did so. "The Pentagon's warning to General Flynn was bold, italicized and could not have been clearer," Cummings said. In a key 2014 document, Flynn was told by a Defense Intelligence Agency official that the U.S. Constitution's emoluments provision prohibits any monetary payments or gifts "from a foreign government unless congressional consent is first obtained." The Oct. 8, 2014, letter â which was sent to Flynn at his request â explained that such "advance approval" would need to come "from the relevant service secretary." Earlier this week, Cummings and Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House committee, said that they had found no evidence Flynn asked the Army for permission to receive foreign payments or informed the military he had accepted them. Army spokeswoman Cynthia O. Smith said the Army had no records that Flynn requested that permission. One episode in question involves a trip he took to Moscow in 2015 for RT's anniversary celebration. He was paid at least $33,750 to attend the gala at which he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "General Flynn's attorney says he discussed his trip to Moscow with DIA, but we have no evidence, not a shred, that he disclosed his payments," Cummings said Thursday. In a statement, Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner said the Defense Department "was fully aware of the trip," citing his previous statements that his client briefed DIA officials before and after the RT trip. Kelner also pointed to a letter, released in redacted form by Cummings, that notes that Flynn provided a thumb drive to the agency containing documents detailing the RT event, including that Leading Authorities, a speakers bureau that handled Flynn's paid speeches, was handling the event for him. Kelner's statement did not address other payments Flynn received from foreign sources. Flynn has previously disclosed he got between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his personal stake in $530,000 that his company, Flynn Intel Group, received for consulting work last year for a Turkish businessman. Last month Flynn's firm filed as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for its consulting work and acknowledged the work may have benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn's client, Inovo BV, is owned by a businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In comments to the AP, Utah Republican Chaffetz, chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said that Flynn "had an obligation to seek approval to take money from a foreign government. We found no evidence that he did that." Chaffetz's office released a letter he sent on Thursday to the Army, asking the service's acting secretary to make a final determination as to whether Flynn violated federal law by accepting the payments, and if so, to start the process of recovering that money. Chaffetz also asked the Army to say why it hasn't yet made a determination as to the legality of Flynn's payments from RT given that they have been widely reported for at least two years. He also wants the Army to disclose any other investigations it's launched since 2010 into similar legal violations. The committee's inquiry is one of several congressional investigations into Flynn's contacts with foreign officials. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to inform senior administration officials about his contacts with Russian officials â contacts that are being examined as part of the wider inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. On Thursday, 18 House Democrats on the oversight committee signed a letter calling on Chaffetz to do more to pressure the White House to release documents regarding Flynn. "There is obviously a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow," the Democrats wrote in the letter. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer rebuffed criticism from Cummings that the White House was covering up. Asked about Trump administration vetting, Spicer appeared to shift blame onto the Obama administration, which had fired Flynn as head of the DIA. "Why would you re-run a background check on someone who is the head of the Department of Defense Intelligence Agency that had and did maintain a high-level security clearance?" Spicer asked. He noted that Flynn's security clearance was renewed during the Obama administration "with all of the information that's being discussed that occurred in 2015." The White House recently told the committee that documents the lawmakers sought would not be turned over because they contained classified information or were not relevant to the committee's investigation. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Bridging Wikimedia and âeducation for allâ at UNESCO Mobile Learning Week Photo by the UK Department for International Development, CC BY 2.0. Today, one out of every 113 people on the Earth today is an asylum seeker, refugee, or has been forced to move within their own country due to conflict, crisis, or political persecution. Having left their homes and support networks behind, educational opportunities for these people are often sparse to nonexistent. Before I started working at the Wikimedia Foundation, I supported education projects for Syrian refugees in Jordan. Iâve also worked with refugee teachers and schools in Lebanon and Malaysia. My experiences have made one thing clear: for refugees, education represents stability and gives them hope for the future. In 2016, I wrote about Mahmoud, a young teacher living in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. He said: â When I first arrived [to Zaatari], I thought our stay would be temporary, and that soon enough weâd all be back home. When that appeared to be far-fetchedâ¦ I gathered up the neighbourhoodâs children and conducted classes for them. I felt like I needed to help the children, since they werenât getting their education anywhere else. â Â  Late last month, educators, tech professionals, and policy makers came together in Paris for Mobile Learning Week, an annual four-day conference that this year was devoted to people like Mahmoud and the problem of âeducation in emergencies.â Mobile Learning Week, held at UNESCOâs headquarters and co-hosted by the United Nationsâ High Commissioner for Refugees, examined how information and communication technologies can help provide learning opportunities for these displaced people. With Wikipedia being synonymous with learning, the Wikimedia Foundationâs Wikipedia Education Program (WEP) engages educators around the world to empower their students to edit on Wikimedia projectsâcontributing not only to knowledge production, but also to student learning around vital standards in digital and information literacy, and 21st century skills. We have a lot to offer in terms of helping people globally, from policy makers to classroom teachers, achieve the goal of âeducation for all.â For the education team, Mobile Learning Week was a golden opportunity to learn more about needs and trends in education technology, advocate for the Wikipedia Education Program, and to foster relationships with potential partners. âââ â[Information and communications technologies have] the potential to change the world by promoting access to education and digital skills.â âBrahima Sanou, Director of the Telecommunication Development Bureau The conference was rife with themes that overlap with our work with the Wikipedia Education Program. Chief among these was the importance of knowledge productionârecognizing the value of local knowledge and creating resources that are relevant to the people of a community. The Education Minister of Norway committed to developing a framework for digital literacy that includes components on young people developing their own content, something that several people agreed with. Rosalind Hudnell, President of the Intel Foundation added that âThe key is not to just have young people use technology, but to create technology. We need to rethink how education is being delivered. We need to train young people for the jobs of tomorrow. Young people will be job creators.â A cornerstone of the Education Program is that programs are designed and implemented on a local level, helping to increase contributions to Wikipedias in their local languages and ensure that the participants are invested in them. For example, program leaders in the Philippines hosted Waray language edit-a-thons in local high schools and universities, and in Israel students at a Jerusalem college wrote articles about Shtetls that were destroyed in the Holocaust. In a sense, we are already leading in this field. âââ Another major theme of the conference was that of the importance of teacher education, on which there is somewhat of a disagreement on this topic among educators and tech developers. A tech companyâs representative said at the conference that âif technology can replace a teacher, then it shouldââbut for educators, this exemplifies a lack of understanding on what actually happens in schools and classrooms: students are actively taught what is in curriculum, but they also learn what is not in the curriculum, and they each have their own background, needs, preferences, and abilities. There is no computer program that can replace a good teacher; the problem is that, around the world, putting a good teacher in the classroom is a significant challenge. This is where technology can help, and Mobile Learning Week demonstrated this by highlighting teacher training programs that used simple technology to help teachers meet the needs of their students, even in refugee camps, some of the most under-resourced places in the world. We can help in this area. One point made by Ita Sheehy, a Senior Education Officer at the UNâs High Commissioner for Refugees, was the importance of improving teachersâ digital competencies. Many students, regardless of background or current status, are digital natives; their older teachers are not. The Wikipedia Education Program improves the digital competencies of educators; this conference has made us think about how this happens and if or how we can measure it. âââ One final topic consistently discussed at the conference was the importance of recognizing learning and certification. Steven Duggan, the Director of Worldwide Education Strategy at Microsoft, said that âFormal education cannot bear the strain of the refugee crisis. With informal education everything begins with the teacher. This is why Microsoft provides a global community for teachers to collaborate, with training and free software.â With Microsoftâs training programs, teachers can become certified on their technologies. I see this as an opportunity for us as well. I hope the education community will think more about what are the competencies needed to successfully use Wikipedia in the classroom, and I hope Â my team can strategize a way to certify teachers in these competencies. The need to recognize learning was reiterated by Roland Kalamo Lyadunga, a refugee learner from South Sudan: âYou learn for yourself, but you need to prove to others what you know. A refugeeâs life is unpredictable, they need to be able to continue with their education wherever they go.â âââ Mobile Learning Week presented the challenges of achieving âeducation for allâ within the context of education in emergencies, and the unique opportunity to use technology to help solve them. The problems and solutions are not only relevant to situations of conflict and crisis, and we have taken away many useful ideas for the Wikipedia Education Program. Beyond that, it was clear from these discussions that what our program leaders are already doing is addressing some of these problems, and that we need to better measure and communicate our impact. Nichole Saad, Program Manager, Wikipedia Education Program Wikimedia Foundation You can find more themes and outcomes from the conference in our full report in the upcoming edition of âThis Month in Educationâ.

Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon At the same time, documents released by the top Democrat on a House oversight committee showed Flynn was warned by authorities after he retired from the military in 2014 not to take foreign government-sourced money without "advance approval" from the Pentagon. Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general and Defense Intelligence Agency chief, later accepted tens of thousands of dollars for his work on behalf of foreign interests, including RT, the state-supported Russian television network, and a Turkish-owned company linked to Turkey's government. The Pentagon's acting inspector general's office confirmed Thursday he has launched an inquiry into whether those payments qualify as coming from foreign governments and whether Flynn properly informed military authorities about them. The White House defended its hiring of Flynn and attempted to shift blame for any problems with his vetting onto the Obama administration, which handled the reissuance of his security clearance in January 2016. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who released the documents, said during a news conference that Flynn had been clearly informed he needed to get permission to receive foreign payments and there's no evidence he did so. "The Pentagon's warning to General Flynn was bold, italicized and could not have been clearer," Cummings said. In a key 2014 document, Flynn was told by a Defense Intelligence Agency official that the U.S. Constitution's emoluments provision prohibits any monetary payments or gifts "from a foreign government unless congressional consent is first obtained." The Oct. 8, 2014, letter - which was sent to Flynn at his request - explained that such "advance approval" would need to come "from the relevant service secretary." Earlier this week, Cummings and Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House committee, said that they had found no evidence Flynn asked the Army for permission to receive foreign payments or informed the military he had accepted them. Army spokeswoman Cynthia O. Smith said the Army had no records that Flynn requested that permission.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) WASHINGTON â The investigations into President Donald Trumpâs ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn intensified Thursday as the Pentagonâs watchdog joined lawmakers in scrutinizing the legality of payments he accepted from foreign sources including a Russian state-sponsored television network. Also, new documents released by the ranking Democrat on a House oversight committee showed Flynn was warned by authorities when he retired from the military in 2014 not to take foreign government-sourced money without âadvance approvalâ from the Pentagon. Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general and Defence Intelligence Agency chief, later accepted tens of thousands of dollars for his work on behalf of foreign interests, including RT, the state-supported Russian television network, and a Turkish-owned company linked to Turkeyâs government. MORE: Lawmakers suggest former Trump aide Michael Flynn broke U.S. law The Pentagonâs acting inspector generalâs office confirmed Thursday he has launched an inquiry into whether those payments qualify as coming from foreign governments and whether Flynn properly informed military authorities about them. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who released the documents on Flynn, said during a news conference that Flynn was clearly informed that he needed to get permission to receive foreign payments and thereâs no evidence he did so. âThe Pentagonâs warning to General Flynn was bold, italicized and could not have been clearer,â Cummings said. Both Cummings and Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, have previously said they planned to ask the Army to rule on whether Flynn properly informed and asked permission for the payments from Russian and Turkish entities. A key document released Thursday by Cummings showed that Flynn was warned by a Defence Intelligence Agency official in October 2014 that he would need clearance from the Army before he could accept any earnings linked to foreign governments. Flynn was told in the document that the U.S. Constitutionâs emoluments provision prohibits any monetary payments or gifts âfrom a foreign government unless congressional consent is first obtained.â The letter explained that such âadvance approvalâ would need to come âfrom the relevant service secretary.â MORE: Trump team was aware Flynn might register as foreign agent Flynn received at least $33,750 for his appearance in Moscow in 2015 for RTâs anniversary celebration, a gala where Flynn sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The U.S. House committeeâs leaders reported earlier this week that they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission for foreign payments he received or informed the military that he had accepted them. Army spokeswoman Cynthia O. Smith Thursday also said âwe have found no records of LTG(R) Flynn requesting permission from the Army for foreign employment.â In comments to the AP, Chaffetz said that Flynn âhad an obligation to seek approval to take money from a foreign government. We found no evidence that he did that.â Chaffetz, however, did not join Cummings at the Thursday news conference, unlike their bipartisan appearance earlier in the week announcing the results of the committeeâs inquiry into Flynnâs dealings with authorities before and after his foreign earnings. RELATED: Trump has âno intentionâ of releasing his tax return Chaffetzâs office released a letter he sent on Thursday to the Army, asking the serviceâs acting secretary to make a final determination as to whether Flynn violated federal law by accepting the payments, and if so, to start the process of recovering that money. Chaffetz also asked the Army to say why it hasnât already made a determination as to the legality of Flynnâs payments from RT given that they have been widely reported for at least two years. He also wants the Army to disclose any other investigations itâs launched since 2010 into similar legal violations. The committeeâs inquiry is one of several congressional investigations into Flynnâs contacts with foreign officials before and during his brief stint as Trumpâs top national security aide. Trump fired Flynn for failing to inform senior administration officials about his contacts with Russian officials â contacts that are being examined as part of the wider inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. âThese documents raise grave questions about why General Flynn concealed the payments he received from foreign sources after he was warned explicitly by the Pentagon,â Cummings said.âOur next step is to get the documents we are seeking from the White House so we can complete our investigation.â On Thursday, 18 House Democrats on the oversight committee signed a joint letter calling on Chaffetz to do more to pressure the White House to release documents regarding Flynn. RELATED: Trump backs off threat to terminate NAFTA â for now âThere is obviously a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow,â the Democrats wrote in the letter. So far, the committee has not received any information on how the Trump White House vetted Flynn, they said.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Hot Switch Sales Boost Nintendo Sales, Trim Quarterly Loss By Yuri Kageyama PUBLISHED: APRIL 27 2017 Nintendo Co.'s Switch, a new hybrid game machine that works as both a console and a tablet, is selling well, helping the Kyoto-based company behind the Super Mario and Pokemon franchises trim its quarterly losses. Nintendo said Thursday it has sold 2.74 million Switch machines [pictured above] and 5.46 million units of Switch software since sales began in March. It had expected to sell 2 million Switch machines by the end of March. The company anticipates selling another 10 million Switch machines in the fiscal year that ends in March 2018. The company's January-March loss was 394 million yen ($3.5 million), improved from a 24 billion yen loss a year earlier. Quarterly sales jumped to nearly 178 billion yen ($1.6 billion) from 79 billion yen. Nintendo has lagged amid competition from smartphones, and also at times has been slammed by an unfavorable exchange rate. A strong yen cheapens the value of overseas earnings of Japanese exporters like Nintendo. In the fiscal year that ended in March, Nintendo's profit jumped more than six times from the previous fiscal year to 102.6 billion yen ($924 million), up from 16.5 billion yen. But that result included extraordinary income from the sale of part of Nintendo's stake in the Seattle Mariners. Nintendo, which also makes the 3DS portable console, is projecting its profit for the fiscal year through March 2018 at 45 billion yen ($405 million). Nintendo said the Switch was off to a "promising start," with consumer demand strong for its "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" and "1-2-Switch" games. Many new machines do well initially as hard-core fans tend to buy them. Then sales taper off. So the test for Nintendo is how long the momentum will persist. It is promising Switch games that include "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe," which goes on sale in April, "ARMS," in June and "Splatoon 2" in July. "We aim to stimulate the platform and expand sales going into the holiday season this year," it said. Nintendo has also begun to offer games for smartphones, such as its smartphone action game "Super Mario Run," reversing its earlier policy of shunning them.

Next Article > Fitbit Data Connects Husband to Wife's Murder By Jamiles Lartey PUBLISHED: APRIL 27 2017 Wearable technology is revolutionizing the way people keep active, and if prosecutors in Connecticut have their way, it may help put a suspected murderer behind bars. Officials say that the timeline given by Richard Dabate, accused of killing his wife in the couple's Ellington, Connecticut, home in 2015, is at odds with data collected from her Fitbit, a wearable device that tracks physical activity. "To say it is rare to use Fitbit records would be safe," Lancaster, Pennsylvania, district attorney Craig Stedman told the Hartford Courant. Dabate told police that a masked assailant came into the couple's suburban home at around 9am on 23 December 2015 and subdued Dabate with "pressure points" before shooting his wife, Connie Dabate, with a gun that Richard Dabate owned. He said that the man killed his wife as she returned through their garage from a workout at the local YMCA. Dabate claimed that he eventually chased the assailant off with a blowtorch. But the Fitbit tells a different story. According to data from the device, which uses a digital pedometer to track the wearer's steps, Connie Dabate was moving around for more than an hour after her husband said the murder took place. Not just that -- it also showed she had traveled more than 1,200ft after arriving home, contrary to Dabate's story that she was killed as she arrived. The distance from her vehicle to the location she died is "no more than 125ft", according to police documents. "It is an electronic footprint that tracks your movements," Stedman said. "It is a great tool for investigators to use." The arrest warrant shows a detailed breakdown of all her movements and locations from waking up through the time she was killed. From the sync locations and activity monitor, investigators were able to produce a timeline down to the minute of when she left for the gym, the duration of her trip home, when she walked into the garage, her intermittent moving around in the home, and when her body stopped moving. The Fitbit is far from the only challenge Dabate faces in his legal fight. Computer records show that he lied about where he was when he sent an email to his employer that morning. He said he was on the road when he was really at home. Digital -- especially mobile device data -- is increasingly becoming a critical aspect of criminal investigations. "As the types and sophistication of electronic media from which digital evidence can be gleaned increase, this type of evidence will become an essential part of investigating and prosecuting most crimes," said a 2015 report from the National Institute Justice. More traditional investigation methods found no signs of forced entry or a struggle, and police canines detected no scent of the stocky 6ft 2in man with a "Vin Diesel voice" that Dabate described. Dabate is out on bail, and facing trial on charges of murder, tampering with evidence and making a false statement. Investigators say his marriage was "in trouble" and that a month before the killing Dabate had texted his pregnant girlfriend to let her know that he and his wife were "on the same page" in terms of an impending divorce. Dabate attempted to claim a $475,000 life insurance policy on his wife five days after the murder and withdrew $90,000 from an investment account in her name the next month. He is due back in court on 28 April. Â© 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Youkyung Lee. Updated April 27, 2017 9:42AM SHARE ALSO SEE Samsung Memory Chips Samsung Electronics reported its best quarterly profit in more than three years Thursday and forecast improvement for the full year as its semiconductor division posted its highest income ever. The South Korean company's stellar financial results beat expectations and reflect its ability to overcome the fiasco over its Galaxy Note 7s, which it pulled from the market when its batteries were found to be prone to overheating. That cost Samsung at least $5 billion. The secrets to its crisis-defying performance: microchips. "The semiconductor business will continue to see a boom for at least a year ahead and its earnings result is on a roll," said Park Ju-gun, chief executive at CEO Score, a private corporate watchdog. Samsung Electronics is the world's largest memory chipmaker and second-largest semiconductor company after Intel. Its semiconductor department generated 6.3 trillion won ($5.6 billion) in operating income during the first three months of this year, more than double a year earlier. So nearly two-thirds of Samsung's operating income during the first quarter was generated by its semiconductor business. The first quarter is typically a slow season for chipmakers but market circumstances were especially favorable for companies like Samsung that are positioned to quickly and efficiently mass produce microchips. Global supplies were tight and consumer demand for more sophisticated and high-density mobile devices that can quickly multitask and process more images, videos and other data was strong. Data centers around the world are also handling growing amounts of data, with more and more gadgets connected to the internet. The tight supplies and solid demand, pushed prices for Samsung's key microchip products called NAND and DRAM up sharply, giving it fat margins. Such market conditions are unlikely to change in coming months, so analysts expect Samsung to rake in its best ever earnings in 2017. For the January-March period, Samsung's profit jumped 46 percent over a year earlier to 7.7 trillion won ($6.8 billion), compared with 5.3 trillion won a year earlier. According to data provider FactSet, analysts had expected a net income of 7.1 trillion won. Sales rose just 2 percent over a year earlier while operating profit surged 48 percent to 9.9 trillion won ($8.7 billion). For the full year, Samsung said its components business such as memory chips and mobile-phone screens known as OLED will drive profits. Samsung is betting on the Galaxy S8 smartphone, which uses curved OLED screens that wrap around its corners. The S8 and S8 Plus with larger screens went on sale last week with strong pre-orders. Samsung is still facing some acute headaches. Five of its top executives, including Lee Jae-yong, the de-facto leader and the only son of its chairman, were indicted on corruption charges in a political scandal that brought on months of public protests and resulted in the ouster of the South Korean president. The trial is expected to continue for several months. The Galaxy S8 smartphones has gotten favorable initial reviews, though some consumers complained that the screen appeared to have a pink hue. Samsung said it was not a product quality issue and it will release a software update to allow subtle adjustments of screen colors. Apart from its earnings, Samsung announced that after months of review it would not change the company's structure into a holding company. It said such a change carried more risks than benefits. That may disappoint investors who had thought such a change could boost share prices and increase transparency in dozens of Samsung businesses that are controlled by the Lee family despite owning only small stakes in each company, thanks to a web of complicated cross-shareholdings. Concern over transparency in the chaebol, as big South Korean family-controlled businesses are known, has intensified with the scandal over political donations that resulted in the indictments of Lee and other top executives. In a separate announcement, Samsung said that it would cancel treasury shares valued more than 40 trillion won ($35 billion). That will improve share prices and ease worries that those shares might have been used for the benefit of the Lee family, rather than for all shareholders.

MORE IN MOBILE INDUSTRY NEWS BlackBerry To Launch KEYone in May Cisco Intros Automated EMM Service Hot Switch Sales Boost Nintendo AT&T Takes Heat over Its 5G Network 1st Twitter Revenue Drop Since IPO Next Article > Cisco Launches Automated Enterprise Mobility Management Service By Jef Cozza / Mobile Tech Today. Updated April 27, 2017. Networking giant Cisco announced plans this week for an expansion of its Jasper Internet of Things service that will include a new capability that will allow enterprises to more easily connect and manage their employees' mobile devices. The expansion includes the launch of a new platform called Control Center for Mobile Enterprise. The company is marketing the new platform primarily as a way for enterprises to lower their telecom costs and ensure those costs are consistent and predictable by providing real-time visibility into the amount of data employees are using on their devices. No More Surprise Charges One of the biggest challenges for companies trying to keep their mobile costs down is the unpredictable nature of usage charges. Companies frequently don't learn that their employees have exceeded their data plans until 30 to 60 days later, according to Cisco. And that lag between data use and reporting can make it difficult to manage connection costs. Cisco said that the Control Center for Mobile Enterprise will allow managers to see, in real time, exactly how much data an employee is currently consuming on a device, and how much the company is being charged for that data by the carrier. By providing that usage data faster and more transparently, Cisco said it will be easier for companies to control their employeesâ data usage and prevent overage charges before they're incurred. Rather than reviewing months' worth of past invoices to figure out how to avoid service charges, enterprises can use the Control Center to create and enforce roaming policies that can detect when employees are about to go over their allotted minutes and automatically upgrade them to the next service tier. The platform can also be used to detect when a SIM card has been removed from a device and block it to prevent fraudulent use. Simpler Management But reducing overage charges is not the only selling point Cisco is using to market its new enterprise mobility management platform. The company is also pitching it as a way for companies to reduce inefficiencies in managing mobile devices by automating many of the more labor-intensive requirements. For example, basic tasks such as adding new features, suspending subscriptions, swapping SIM cards, and upgrading devices can be labor-intensive and require the cooperation of multiple IT personnel. Cisco said the Control Center can reduce much of the work that goes into these tasks, allowing a smaller IT department to manage the devices of larger groups with only a few clicks. "In the next two years, business smartphones will grow to over 1 billion subscribers globally," said Jeff Orr, research director at ABI Research, in a Cisco statement. "There is an immediate market need for solutions that help enterprises automate device connectivity, usage accounting, and service management, to curtail unnecessary mobility expenses." Cisco said it plans to first launch the platform in Canada through a partnership with Telus, a Canadian telecom company. The company plans to partner with additional service providers in other countries as it expands into other markets.

The Ticker Tape , TD Ameritrade Â  {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} April 27, 2017 1:08pm Â  Comments Share: The NASDAQ (COMP) broke through the 6,000 mark on Tuesday right before one of the most important days in tech earnings. Whatâs so important about today? The combined market cap of the four mega cap companies reporting today is about $1.75 trillion. Three of the companies are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). The fourth company releasing first-quarter results after the bell is ecommerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Since its 1997 IPO, AMZN has emerged as a global market leader in ecommerce through CEO Jeff Bezosâ direction and a relentless focus on the customer. In his 2016 letter to shareholders, he wrote âthere are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but hereâs the big one: customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is greatâ. That obsessive focus on customer wants, led AMZN to develop Primeâthe companyâs $99 annual membership that offers free two-day shipping on over 50 million items and other perks. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) recently tested a similar program, ShippingPass, but decided to scrap it in favor of offering free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more. WMT also just announced it would start offering variable discounts on items that customerâs purchase online and choose to pick up in store, leveraging its brick and mortar locations. Taking a page out of WMTâs playbook, AMZN is heavily investing in distribution. Itâs in the process of building multiple 1 million square foot distribution centers throughout the United States. To reduce its reliance on third-party distribution, it also announced it would lease 20 Boeing 767 widebody freighter jets to operate its own air-cargo network.Â  Â âRevenue growth and profitability of Amazon has been difficult for analysts to estimate as the company continues to invest heavily in areas that include its web services operation, fulfillment centers and media content,â according to a recent Investorâs Business Daily article. For the first quarter, AMZN is expected to earn $1.03 per share on revenue of $35.39 billion, up 21% from Q1 2016, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates.Â  Amazon Trading and Recent Options Activity AMZN shares just hit an all-time high of $923.72 on April 5; the stock remains close to those highs, $909.29 at yesterdayâs close, as the company gets ready to report Q1 earnings. Itâs up just over 20% year-to-date compared to just under a 12% gain for the NASDAQ (COMP). Â  The options market has priced in about a 3.5% potential stock move in either direction around AMZNâs earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on theÂ thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading at the April 28 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 900, 910, and 920 strike prices while puts were active at the 900 and 910 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 60th percentile, towards the higher end of the range. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

The GPU that empowers it has now been spotted including a GPU die photo and AOTS results. Earlier rumors stated that that NVIDIA would release a low end card budget friendly card titled GeForce GTX 1030 (GP108) but we know that the budget oriented low end cards by NVIDIA never used the title GTX. Following the previous trend of naming lower end cards by NVIDIA we can say that the card would be named GT 1030. It is rumored to have 512 shader processors and gets 1 and/or 2 GB framebuffer partitions. Â  Â  This card would be based on the new Pascal architecture and would be a good upgrade option to those who are low on budget. it is however unknown if NVIDIA would using the GP107 core from the GTX 1050 cards or would be using the unreleased GP108 core. It is also rumoured that GT 1030 will have an big brother named GT 1040 which would feature the same core but with bumped up features. The exact release date is unknown but is rumored to roll out in mid-May, the pricing is unknown, it is estimated to be at par with the AMD RX 550 graphics card. Pricing should also be similar to the RX 550. It'll be faster than a discrete iGPU but 12 FPS in Ashes of the Singularity on 1080p well, unuff said there. Thye product is likely to launch in a week or two. Source:Â Expreview,Â Videocardz Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

If you want a super budget card for a bit of light gaming or video editing, go for a 1050 or 1050ti. If you want a card for gaming, get 1060 or above. RedSquirrel Newbie Posts: 23 Joined: 2017-03-06 #5425256 Posted on: 04/27/2017 08:05 PM Intel's Iris and Iris pro are actually viable for gaming! (mobas, mmorpgs, all older stuff, etc). I think the purpose for the lowest end discrete gpus should be equally to add media abilities like x265 which is miiiles better than x264, along with very low power usage (compatible with everything) and gaming ability. A modern version of the 750ti would be nice though, that card was an ace price/perf/power usage for the time. Ricepudding Member Guru Posts: 51 Joined: 2017-02-17 #5425270 Posted on: 04/27/2017 08:25 PM These cards can only be good for older machines for people who want a video output... maybe there motherboard video output has gone or they need something for 4k output for example... beyond that they are useless.

High quality 40 mm drivers win over not just computer gamers with its precise and powerfully specific audiophile sound. Optimum voice transmission is promised thanks to the pop filter microphone, which is also detachable. The Sharkoon B1 Stereo Headset is all-black and leaves a solid, purist impression with its materials and workmanship. The reinforced headband, with synthetic leather and stylish stitching, is comfortably padded for optimum wear comfort. The massive height adjustors of the ear cups are made from brushed aluminium and promises corresponding longevity. Mesh metal covers decorate the outside of the matte finished ear cups. But it is the sound quality of the B1 which leaves a lasting impression. High quality, powerful 40 mm drivers are used, offering brilliant highs and sonorous bass with an audiophile sound. Thick pads from soft synthetic leather completely surrounds the ear and efficiently contributes to suppress ambient noise. The detachable microphone is equipped with a pop filter, providing optimum voice transmission. The position of the microphone can always be individually customized, thanks to its flexible microphone arm. Without the microphone, the headset is also suitable as a headphone. Thanks to its TRRS stereo jack, the B1 is not only compatible with smartphones, but also with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One controllers as well as notebooks and Ultrabooks with modern TRRS ports. The headset cable is deliberately kept short at 110 cm and is practical for mobile usage or for connecting to a controller. The headset can also connect to computers by use of its included extension cable with TRRS port and two 3.5 mm stereo jacks. An inline controller is integrated into the extension cable for convenient access to both the volume control and microphone mute. When using the extension, the total cable length is 255 cm. All connectors on B1 are gold-plated; all cables are textile braided. Transport the headset and its accessories safely and securely within the included hardcase, with recesses and mounts provided.Â The Sharkoon B1 Stereo Headset is now available for the suggested retail price of 59 euros from authorized retailers.

Acer's big reveal here is the fanless LiquidLoop cooling system, which ensures you get all the performance possible from the 7th generation Core i7 or i5 processor, without overheating, and without fan noise. The fanless cooling has other benefits too, in that it doesn't require any ventilation, so no risk of those pesky dust bunnies getting in and clogging up the internals. Keeping the processor cool efficiently also means the battery is capable of going 10.5 hours of use before needing to be charged up again.Â  The Switch 5 also features the company's auto-retracting kickstand, which enables users to adjust the the screen with one hand, easily. Â  Acer This kickstand is built on to a solid anodized aluminium chassis which measures just 12mm thin and weighs under 1.3kg with the keyboard attached. On the front, it boasts a 2160 x 1440Â wide-view IPS 12-inch touchscreen display which also supports the Acer Active Pen stylus.Â  While the Switch 5 is easily the flagship of the 2-in-1 range, the Switch 3 seeks to offer good performance at a lower cost.Â  Switch 3 comes with Intel Pentium and Celeron inside, which offer up to 8 hours of battery life from a fanless device that features a 12.2-inch 1920 x 1200 resolution display. It also has front facing speakers and a metallic cover, etched at the edges to give it that extra bit of flair.Â  As you'd expect from a 2-in-1, both Switch models come with an attachable keyboard that snaps on using magnets, and is adjustable to suit the user's preference. It's backlit, measures just 5.85mm thin and features 1.4mm of travel.Â  Acer The Switch 5 and Switch 3 will be available in Europe from June, with prices starting at â¬1,099 and â¬499 respectively. Switch 5 will be configurable with either 256GB or 512GB of SSD storage and up to 8GB RAM. Switch 3 will be sold with 32GB, 64GB or 128GB storage and up to 4GB RAM.Â  Acer Swift 1 and Swift 3 Joining the Switch series 2-in-1 is a range of affordableÂ ultrabooks. The Swift 1 and Swift 3 are thin, lightweight and don't cost the earth.Â  Starting with the budget-friendly Swift 1, is a slim laptop featuring a 13.3-inch full HD IPS display, 802.1ac wireless with 2x2 MIMO technology for fast, reliable connectivity. Acer claims it can work for 10 hours straight, and comes with either Pentium or Celeron processing power and 4GB RAM.Â  The 0.7-inch metallic chassis weighs just 1.3kg and comes in a choice of three different colours: pink, gold and silver. Acer The Swift 3 is more high-end and features more powerful 7th gen Intel Core processors, NVIDIA GeForce or Intel HD graphics and up to 10 hour of battery life. More importantly, the Swift 3 comes in a 14-inch or 15.6-inch full HD model with IPS anti-glare displays, USB 3.1 Type C port and an HD webcam. Â  Both support Windows Hello through fingerprint sensors, and will be available in June. The Swift 1 will be configurable with 64GB, 128GB or 256GB storage with prices starting at â¬399.Â  Swift 3 comes with the option of 256GB SSD storage or 1TB HDD, and even a special edition version with Corning Gorilla Glass on the top cover. Prices start at â¬649 in June, when the laptop is due to hit the EU.Â  Sections Acer Laptops Best laptops 2017: The best laptops you can buy today Which Apple MacBook is best for you?

The Triton 700 appears to be Acerâs response to laptops like the Razer Blade, a similarly slim, aluminum-cased gaming laptop that still packs some serious power. At 18 mm (0.74 inches) thick, itâs not the thinnest gaming laptop out there, although itâs still dramatically thinner than most traditional gaming computers. (For reference, Appleâs nongaming-focused MacBook Pro is 0.61 inches thick, while the more comparable Razer Blade is 0.7 inches.) Acer isnât skimping out on hardware, either: the Triton 700 offers a seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, NVIDIA GTX 10-series graphics cards (the company has yet to specify exact configurations for either), two PCIe SSDs, and up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM. The only real disappointment is the 15.6-inch 1080p display, which should be fine for maximizing performance while gaming, but still pales in comparison to some of the more pixel-dense laptops on the market. And, of course, itâs still a gaming laptop, so thereâs a mechanical keyboard with LED-illuminated keys. Curiously, Acer has taken the interesting approach of moving the keyboard to the very front of the laptop, moving the trackpad toward the top of the laptop where itâs hidden under a Gorilla Glass panel. This should make it easier to reach the keys, and realistically, you probably shouldnât be using the trackpad for games anyway. The Predator Triton 700 is expected to go on sale in August starting at â¬3,399 (roughly $3,692.84, although exact US pricing hasnât been announced). Update April 27th, 4:30PM: Added screen size.

The plugfest, held March 27-28 in Barcelona, Spain, in conjunction with the MIPI Alliance Member Meeting, provided the first opportunity for early adopters of the new MIPI I3C sensor interface to perform interoperability testing of their designs for smartphones, IoT, automotive and other applications. The event drew participants from semiconductor, IP and test equipment firms, demonstrating industry commitment to MIPI I3C and paving the way for commercialization of products and devices based on the specification. It highlighted the importance of interoperability testing early in the design cycle to ensure seamless functionality between devices and speed up time to market. âPlugfests are an essential step in the product development process because the testing and debugging activities take place in real-world system integration environments, helping companies ensure interoperability of their components, improve product quality, speed the development process and optimize the manufacturability of their designs,â said Ken Foust, chair of the MIPI Alliance Sensor Working Group. âParticipants found it extremely valuable to share lessons learned about the use and implementation of MIPI I3C,â Foust added. âWe strongly encourage member companies to take part in these activities and look forward to offering more plugfests later this year.â Companies tested four master devices and six slave devices during the event. Participating companies include: BitifEye Digital Test Solutions GmbH, Intel Corporation, Kionix, Inc., A ROHM Group Company, Lattice Semiconductor Corp., NXP Semiconductors, Qualcomm Incorporated, Silvaco, Inc., STMicroelectronics, Synopsys, Inc. and Tektronix, Inc. Join MIPI Alliance at Upcoming Events MIPI Alliance plans to offer additional plugfest opportunities later this year in conjunction with member meetings in Atlanta, Ga., USA and Bangalore, India. Please visit http://bit.ly/2p0Sf0F for future plugfest updates and information. Developers can learn more about MIPI I3C at the Internet of Things Developers Conference April 26-27 in Santa Clara, Calif. MIPI Alliance is a sponsor of the event, and member companies will be onsite to offer table-top demos of product implementations based on MIPI I3C and other MIPI Alliance specifications. Ken Foust will deliver a presentation on April 27 at 9:30 a.m. PDT: âA Developerâs Guide to MIPI I3C Implementation.â To discover more about MIPI Alliance and to connect with its social networks, follow its Twitter page and join its LinkedIn group. To join MIPI Alliance, use the Join MIPI link on the organizationâs site. Quotes from MIPI I3C Plugfest Participants BitifEye Digital Test Solutions GmbH âBitifEye provides solutions for physical layer tests. MIPI I3C is an opportunity to enhance our long-lasting engagement within MIPI Alliance,â said Sascha Kirch, hardware and software engineer, BitifEye Digital Test Solutions GmbH. âThe plugfest was a valuable event to test our technologyâs performance with potential customer products. MIPI I3C performs well and is fairly straightforward to work with. If youâve already been working with I2C, MIPI I3C feels more like an update. From our point of view, we see plenty of applications for this âlow-speedâ interface within the industry.â Kionix, Inc., A ROHM Group Company âWe make MEMS sensors. The MIPI I3C Plugfest has given us our first opportunity to test future generations of our technologies in the real world and the event has been extremely valuable from Day 1,â said Alex Chernyakov, applications engineer, Kionix. âWe tested our products with devices from three other companies. The experience was beneficial to all of us, whether we discovered bugs, confirmed that our implementations were correct, or validated our deviceâs ability to interoperate with others.â Lattice Semiconductor Corp. âLattice has been providing production-ready MIPI interface solutions for the mobile industry with our low cost, low power and small form factor FPGAs,â said Satwant Singh, senior director of strategic planning, Lattice Semiconductor. âWith significant improvements over the popular I2C interface, the MIPI I3C specification is expected to become an important interface for mobile and mobile-influenced applications. MIPI I3C Plugfest provided Lattice with an early opportunity to actively work with the MIPI Alliance and its member companies to evaluate our implementation and ensure interoperability.â NXP Semiconductors âNXP has been very committed to MIPI I3C, and it was great to finally see it in action,â said Paul Kimelman, platform architecture, NXP Semiconductors. âNXP was able to bring both master and slave devices , and we were very pleased with excellent results that give us good confidence across a wide range of I3C features. These plugfests are extremely valuable for each company and the industry because good interoperability will help speed adoption and ensure I3C is available on a wide range of silicon parts much more quickly than is typical.
