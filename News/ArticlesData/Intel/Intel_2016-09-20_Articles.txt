Credit: Oakley More like this Google Glass strikes back 12 new or soon-to-be-released fitness devices worth a look Finally: Smart glasses that don't look dumb Video 10 tablets for under $500 For wearables to succeed, many people believe technology should be inconspicuous, not popping out and making a fashion statement of its own. Google Glass may have gotten it wrong, and Oakley and Intel may have done it right with the new Radar Pace. At first glance, Oakley's Radar Pace sunglasses look undeniably cool. But hidden inside is technology that turns the sunglasses into a voice-activated coach that answers questions and provides fitness training recommendations. It's like having Siri in your sunglasses. The sunglasses are expensive. At US$449, they have a hefty markup, but Oakley sunglasses and cool technology won't come cheap. The glasses will be handy for hard-core athletes, but Oakley is also targeting casual athletes. The smart glasses will start shipping on Oct. 1 in the U.S. and other countries. [ Also on CIO.com: Wearables in the enterprise? Yes, really! ] Radar Pace has sensors that can track heart rate, distance, cadence, speed, and other vital workout information. The data is synced with a smartphone connected to Radar Pace via Bluetooth, where an app called Radar Pace App monitors the workout, answers questions, and provides voice recommendations. Users hear the information through earphones in the sunglasses. A cool feature is the ability to ask questions through a microphone, with users getting answers back. The questions are passed on to the smartphone app, which formulates and sends back an answer to Radar Pace. The voice-activated system can convey daily workout plans, or answer questions that will provide real-time information on speed, race, metrics, and heart rate to people wearing Radar Pace. The smartphone app can analyze workout data in real time. For example, the glasses can advise a runner to increase the pace, slow down, or end a workout. The mobile app interprets and answers queries through a natural-language processing engine developed by Intel called Real Speech. For example, a runner can ask questions like, "what's my heart rate?" or "what's my pace?" Voicing "time" or "distance" will prompt the app to convey the answers. The smart glasses are a result of a two-year alliance between Luxottica, which owns Oakley, and Intel, which developed the core technology and architecture. Intel has pushed for technology to be invisible in wearables, and that design philosophy was the main focus when designing Radar Pace. Many smart sunglasses for fitness are hitting the market. A notable competitor is Solos, which is a kind of Google Glass for athletes. Solos has a tiny heads-up display that shows metrics like heart rate, pace, distance, and cadence so athletes can see data in real time. It was used by U.S. cyclists in the recent Rio Olympics. But unlike Google Glass and Solos, the Radar Pace doesn't have a screen. A voice-activated system works better because information on a screen can be distracting when cycling or running, Oakley officials said. Also, the added-on tech hasn't looked cool in some smart glasses. The technology protruding out of Google Glass was so visible that it upset people who thought they were being spied on. Oakley and Intel came up with a design where the technology is as hidden as possible, though the headsets are clearly visible on the side. The smartphone app that works with Radar Pace also can pull data from other fitness apps and devices to formulate workouts. That's handy, especially when people like using Fitbit and other devices to track fitness data. The sunglasses weigh 56 grams and run for about four to six hours on a single battery charge. They have an accelerometer, gyroscope, and sensors to measure pressure, humidity, and proximity. The glasses have some cool add-on features. They can play your favorite music on the smartphone. You can take phone calls via Radar Pace, and the app works with Android and iOS devices. For Intel, the Radar Pace is a breakthrough in wearables. The chipmaker has a handful of wearable products on the market, but Radar Pace is the most important for the company. Unfortunately for Intel, the glasses don't use an x86 chip, but an embedded processor based on another architecture that Intel wouldn't specify. That also highlights a  problem -- Intel's chips aren't used in many wearables partly because the company doesn't have the right processors in its portfolio. Intel is committed to developing chips for wearables, a representative said. To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter.

This primer will help you make sense of CPU jargon. By Erik Eckel | September 21, 2016, 12:59 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus 12-inch MacBook (left) and 13-inch MacBook Air (right) Image: Sarah Tew/CNET When shopping for a new Mac, here's how to make sense of common processor terms—such as dual-core performance and Turbo Boost—and better decide whether an upgrade over Apple's default configuration might prove warranted. SEE: Research: Apple's Growing Role in the Enterprise (Tech Pro Research) The CPU's role A computer's central processing unit (the CPU) is a critical component. Think of the processor as the engine that drives the computer. Faster processors typically equate to quicker execution of commands. What does that mean for Mac users? A faster processor is capable of completing Photoshop edits, for example, more quickly than a slower processor. What's Hot at TechRepublic The antique computers that just won't quit Windows 10: The Sirius A is a full desktop PC that fits in your pocket If there's a tech skills shortage, why are so many computer graduates unemployed? Subscribe to TechRepublic's Tech News You Can Use newsletter Don't confuse a faster processor with more memory, however. While a faster processor helps a computer execute commands more quickly, memory is responsible for temporarily storing data for processes and executions the CPU is executing. Thankfully, Apple professionals need not fully appreciate the complexities connecting CPU and memory performance; Mac users can trust that Apple's engineers have specified optimal computer configurations, while providing customization options. The purpose of this discussion is to help ensure Mac users understand basic CPU terms and make the best choices when selecting from the customization options Apple offers, especially as CPUs (for all practical purposes) can't be upgraded once a Mac is purchased. Processor jargon explained Likely the first thing most customers notice about a Mac's CPU when considering which model to buy is the processor's speed, measured in gigahertz, commonly abbreviated as GHz. The higher the number, the faster the performance. Thus, a 3.1Ghz typically performs remarkably faster than a 1.6GHz CPU. Here's where it gets tricky. Modern Mac CPUs possess multiple cores. These multiple cores are two or more independent processing units capable of operating simultaneously. Most Macs possess multi-core processors now. Default MacBook CPU configurations possess dual-core Intel chips. Default MacBook Air CPU configurations, for both 11" and 13" models, possess dual-core Intel chips. Default 13" MacBook Pro CPU configurations possess dual-core Intel chips, while the 15" models boast quad-core Intel processors. Default 21.5" iMac CPU configurations provide a choice of either dual-core or quad-core chips, while 27" iMac models pack quad-core processors. Default Mac Pro CPU configurations provide a choice of either quad-core or six-core higher-end Intel CPUs. Default Mac mini CPU configurations possess dual-core chips. If you're unfamiliar with processor specs, the Mac mini's 2.8GHz Intel Core i5 chip may not appear that much slower than the Mac Pro's 3.5GHz Intel Xeon processor, but a tremendous performance gap separates the two chips. While the Mac mini's Intel Core i5 chip boasts two cores, the Mac Pro's Intel Xeon chip packs six cores. And, before hardcore technicians begin weighing in on clock speed, motherboard performance, memory configuration, hard disk specifications, capacity requirements, multi-threading advantages, and L3 cache dependencies, the purpose of this piece is to help laymen better understand basic CPU terminology. That said, the Intel Xeon chip also boasts significant capacity improvements that place the CPU in a wholly different category designed to better power intense computer processing tasks and applications. SEE: The new MacBook Pro: Will it solve the Apple laptop shopper's dilemma? (CNET) Most Mac users will find the system they're considering purchasing—whether it's a MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, or Mac mini—possesses either Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 processors intended for common computing or, in some cases, mobile operation. In the case of mobile processors, typically noted by an "m" in the name (such as the MacBook's Intel Core m3 chip), Intel tweaks processor performance to better manage mobile computing needs and better accommodate battery life requirements, among other elements. But the Mac Pro packs the Intel Xeon chip, an enterprise-grade CPU capable of accommodating intensive audio and video production tasks, fulfilling demanding scientific and engineering calculations, and rendering 3D graphics, as is required by manufacturers, architects, and others. Most laymen only need to remember that a quad-core processor running at 2.8GHz is exponentially faster than an older single-core CPU that may have run at 4.4GHz, by virtue of additional cores being available to essentially each run at the same speed and therefore complete more calculations simultaneously. Then there's Turbo Boost, a concept that confuses some Mac users. Apple professionals shopping for a new Mac will note that Apple lists the Turbo Boost speed for the system's processor. For example, the standard MacBook Air includes a 1.6GHz Intel Core i5 CPU that possesses Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz. That's quite a GHz leap. Mac users can rest assured there's nothing they need to do to receive the benefit of the faster 2.7GHz processing technology. Turbo Boost is just a fancy method Intel uses to describe the chip's ability to automatically run at faster speeds when demand requires and when power, temperature, and thermal design limits are all within an accepted range. SEE: How to navigate Apple's repair and support programs using these quick tips Should you opt for a CPU upgrade? So, how do you make sense of these specifications and determine whether you should accept a CPU upgrade Apple offers for the Mac you're considering purchasing? Ask yourself whether you intend to use the Mac according to how it was designed. If you're buying a MacBook Air, which prioritizes mobile operation and portability, and you intend to edit video or perform demanding scientific calculations (tasks better managed by a MacBook Pro or a Mac Pro), you should definitely consider accepting Apple's CPU upgrade option. On the other hand, if you're purchasing an iMac (or any other Mac, for that matter) and intend to use it only as a client workstation for powering common Office applications such as Word and Excel, processing email, and surfing the internet, the standard configuration will work well. If CAD drawing, architecture, three-dimensional rendering, and similar demanding video tasks are common requirements, opt for a CPU upgrade. If audio and video creation, editing, and publishing are planned, opt for the CPU upgrade. In such cases, I also recommend buyers consider purchasing the memory upgrade, too. Based on my experiences As a technology consultant supporting hundreds of businesses over more than a decade, clients have almost never, if ever, complained of performance issues when they've accepted my recommendation to purchase the fastest CPU and most memory they can afford. The two meld together in an elegant, complex dance that speed performance and accelerate the everyday routine of starting and shutting down a system, opening and closing applications, and completing common edits and processes.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Apple A10 teardown sheds light on quad-core SoC, confirms Intel won modem contract Apple A10 teardown sheds light on quad-core SoC, confirms Intel won modem contract By Joel Hruska on September 21, 2016 at 4:59 pm Comment Every time a new Apple device ships, it’s interesting to see how manufacturing technology has advanced. This year is no exception. The Apple device teardown revealed a number of interesting details and confirmed a rumor we’d heard before — Intel did indeed win at least some of the iPhone 7’s modem business (Intel builds the modem inside the AT&T and T-Mobile devices, denoted as the A1778 and A1784). The Verizon and Sprint products (A1660 and A1661) use a Qualcomm modem. Chipworks, which performed the teardown and analysis, doesn’t dive into the implications of a dual-sourced modem between Intel and Qualcomm, but this may have practical repercussions depending on how you intend to use the device. Because Intel’s modems don’t support CDMA, you won’t be able to take AT&T or T-Mobile devices to non-GSM networks. The Qualcomm modems, in contrast, support both GSM and CDMA, meaning they should be compatible on any carrier network across the country. Still, this is a huge feather in Intel’s cap. The company hasn’t had great luck pushing its XMM modems into high-profile device wins — at least, none it has prominently discussed. Apple’s sheer volume should drive materially higher profits for Chipzilla’s networking division. Unlike the iPhone 6s, which featured dual-sourcing between Samsung and TSMC, the iPhone 7 may be a TSMC-only design. Die size on the new chip is 125mm sq, a 20% size increase over the A9’s 104.5mm sq (at TSMC, the Samsung variant was smaller). According to Chipworks, the A10 is considerably more dense than the A9 thanks to better packing on Apple’s part — a straight scale-out of the A9 would’ve left Apple with a chip nearly 150mm sq, as compared to a relatively svelte 125mm sq. The chip is built on TSMC’s 16FFC process. The “C” stands for compact, and the new node is intended for use in mainstream and low-power markets. Compared with 16nm FF+ (second-generation FinFET), FFC reduces SRAM area, leakage, and supports ultra-low power voltage modes (down to 0.6v). The diagram above shows Chipworks estimate on where specific features are located, after Anandtech helped them narrow down potential feature locations on the “little” CPU cores. The battery is a 1960mAh unit, compared with the 1810mAh pack used in the iPhone 6s. The batteries that failed on Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, in contrast, are nearly twice this size. Overall, the iPhone 7 is a significant manufacturing step forward for Apple, a solid debut for TSMC’s 16FFC process node, and a major win for Intel, which can claim a significant design win for its own modem technology.

This is sensationalist, untrue and distracts from a genuine problem. The background is straightforward. Intel platforms allow the storage to be configured in two different ways - "standard" (normal AHCI on SATA systems, normal NVMe on NVMe systems) or "RAID". "RAID" mode is typically just changing the PCI IDs so that the normal drivers won't bind, ensuring that drivers that support the software RAID mode are used. Intel have not submitted any patches to Linux to support the "RAID" mode. In this specific case, Lenovo's firmware defaults to "RAID" mode and doesn't allow you to change that. Since Linux has no support for the hardware when configured this way, you can't install Linux (distribution installers will boot, but won't find any storage device to install the OS to). Why would Lenovo do this? I don't know for sure, but it's potentially related to something I've written about before - recent Intel hardware needs special setup for good power management. The storage driver that Microsoft ship doesn't do that setup. The Intel-provided driver does. "RAID" mode prevents the Microsoft driver from binding and forces the user to use the Intel driver, which means they get the correct power management configuration, battery life is better and the machine doesn't melt. (Why not offer the option to disable it? A user who does would end up with a machine that doesn't boot, and if they managed to figure that out they'd have worse power management. That increases support costs. For a consumer device, why would you want to? The number of people buying these laptops to run anything other than Windows is miniscule) Things are somewhat obfuscated due to a statement from a Lenovo rep:This system has a Signature Edition of Windows 10 Home installed. It is locked per our agreement with Microsoft. It's unclear what this is meant to mean. Microsoft could be insisting that Signature Edition systems ship in "RAID" mode in order to ensure that users get a good power management experience. Or it could be a misunderstanding regarding UEFI Secure Boot - Microsoft do require that Secure Boot be enabled on all Windows 10 systems, but (a) the user must be able to manage the key database and (b) there are several free operating systems that support UEFI Secure Boot and have appropriate signatures. Neither interpretation indicates that there's a deliberate attempt to prevent users from installing their choice of operating system. The real problem here is that Intel do very little to ensure that free operating systems work well on their consumer hardware - we still have no information from Intel on how to configure systems to ensure good power management, we have no support for storage devices in "RAID" mode and we have no indication that this is going to get better in future. If Intel had provided that support, this issue would never have occurred. Rather than be angry at Lenovo, let's put pressure on Intel to provide support for their hardware.

So they should be blamed for choosing an hardware with windows-only drivers. They could also have added an option in the BIOS/UEFI that, once the secure boot has been disabled, allows the user to also disable this RAID mode.

It did not boot properly though. Since these are notebook systems with a single disk anyway, is that what they are treating the system as? (i.e. RAID 0 with a single disk) Is there any way to update GRUB to boot off of such a thing? All that said, I think Intel absolutely should be held responsible, they certainly push themselves as a Linux friendly company, and disk controllers should be a basic device I should always be able to access. Link Reply Thread Hide 2 comments Show 2 comments Re: RAID level?Date: 2016-09-21 10:52 pm (UTC) From: (Anonymous) GRUB can certainly boot off the thing, but the problem is that the kernel itself cannot detect the drive at all while it's in RAID mode (and it's currently STUCK in RAID mode, even though the Intel hardware fully supports run-of-the-mill vanilla AHCI, because of Lenovo's short-sighted and quite intentional BIOS modification that locks users out from changing their BIOS setting).

Linux boots fine. > Even if the device would get worse battery life (which we don't know that it would, and nobody who booted up Linux on the ISK model or Live on the ISK2 reported their laptop "melting"), it should be up to the user. Why should it be up to the user? Should the user be able to program every memory timing option, even if by doing so they introduce occasional crashes? Should they be able to set every thermal threshold, even if by doing so they're reducing their hardware life expectancy? All hardware vendors restrict the options available to users. > You say that if your guess is right, it's a cheap hack to work around crappy power management in Windows.

It came with NVMe hard drive configured in a RAID setting which was not recognised by the Ubuntu installer. In the BIOS settings I was able to change that to something normal instead (it was listed as AHCI or some such), after that NVMe based installation worked with Ubuntu, but Windows 10 failed to boot. To resolve that, I had to reboot Windows 10 in safety mode, switch from raid to AHCI, boot into safety mode again, which I guess regenerated the "kernel modules included in the Windows boot process" or some such. After that, both Ubuntu and Windows 10 boot happily ever after. This is unfortunately well documented https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Host_Controller_Interface#Boot_issues I wish windows would always include AHCI driver and/or the OEMs/Vendors did. Are we sure that it's not just the standard Intel Matrix Raid configuration which is supported by MDADM? Ubuntu Desktop installer doesn't support Intel Matrix RAID configuration out of the box at the time.

As you point out, that's not a laptop thing. The issue is that Intel have not told anybody how to properly-manage power in their hardware; instead, they have released a binary-blob driver for Windows that just does it right. However, for the driver to do things right, Microsoft's driver mustn't bind to the hardware first. The easiest way for Lenovo to achieve this is to put the hardware into RAID mode, and not to let it come out. That means the MS driver examines the hardware, decides it can't deal with it, and ignores it, leaving the Intel driver to come along and claim it. Presumably the Intel driver is perfectly happy to run in single-disc JBOD mode, but it does it with the right power management. The end result, according to Matthew, is "correct power management configuration, battery life is better and the machine doesn't melt". I'm not saying it's a good thing, and I don't think Matthew is either. It's just the easiest way for Lenovo to deal with Intel's stupid secret-sauce power management, in a Windows context.

Such patches are unnecessary, as mdadm already supports Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST - http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/architecture-and-technology/rapid-storage-technology.html ) for simple RAID (e.g. levels 0, 1, 10) arrays, allowing them to be assembled as md or dmraid devices under Linux. However, it would appear that the version of mdadm in shipping versions of Ubuntu (at least - maybe other distros too) doesn't support the Smart Response Technology (SRT - http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/smart-response-technology.html ) feature that's a part of RST and is used by Lenovo to build a hybrid one-stripe RAID0 device from the HDD with a cache on the SSD (I'm sure Lenovo have a good reason for not using a SSHD). Dan Williams of Intel submitted a series of patches to mdadm to support SRT back in April 2014: https://marc.info/?l=linux-raid&r=1&b=201404&w=2 . Perhaps now there's shipping hardware that requires them, there'll be the impetus for distro vendors to get them integrated into mdadm, and their auto-detection in their installers to use the functionality provided sanely.

BTW, I don't know if mdadm would detect the RAID controller/disk immediately upon installation, or it would require a reboot. In the latter case you may wish to use a USB key with enough spare room to save the system status and reboot. I'd use UNetBootin to prepare such a USB key. The main issue here is, a user who doesn't even see a disk, probably wouldn't know to go as far as installing mdadm. IMHO, given the broadening diffusion of NVMe and RAID devices, Debian, Canonical, REDHAT, Fedora etc. might wish to make mdadm part of their live images by default (and eventually strip it from the installed system if it's unnecessary).

Why we have a standard like AHCI then? The real problem here is that AHCI firmwares are crap, and RAID will not solve problems with overheating, neither make better power consumption counters. RAID is doing the right thing in this specific case, because a lot of companies create AHCI firmware with no optimizations at all, so forcing a "default sane" for power consumption makes the sensation that RAID mode is a better standard. Until proven wrong, this is still a move to let Linux out of the market, and if Lenovo is not the one to blame, is the one guilty of colluding with Intel to delay Linux support on this equipment.

Is this an option? Sorry if this is obviously not an answer. As for the power management thing, Dell lets you turn off the same "RAID" mode and boot Linux. What kind of runtime loss are we talking here? Can't be that bad or someone would have said something. SSDs use like 2 watts?

Link Reply Thread Hide 6 comments Show 6 comments no subjectDate: 2016-09-23 05:26 am (UTC) From: mjg59 If you wanted to try that, the best place to do it would be the UEFI setup code in the kernel under arch/x86/boot/compressed/eboot.c - that way you can do it independent of bootloader. Grub's able to read files anyway since it's using the firmware calls to do that. The power management thing isn't about the SSD itself, it's about ensuring that the controller is programmed correctly so that the entire CPU package can enter deep sleep states. Modern systems should idle at around 4W at most, so small amounts make abig difference here.

While this looks like an attention seeking headline, it's true. The first laptop I installed Linux on was about 15 odd years ago - while I had some trouble I got it going eventually. Most follow up laptops where from a variety of suppliers (dell, toshiba, acer etc) and I never had a problem to get any of the hardware working. The last two laptops are two rather new laptops, both with UEFI/LEGACY, both with AHCI, both with INTEL hardware and all INTEL hardware known to work. One is a Lenovo Yoga, the other one is a Dell XPS 12. It took me about 1 hour to get it to go on the Dell, I did that in a number of steps. I first made some space at the end of the drive creating a 30GB space, then tried Fedora 23 without UEFI in Legacy mode - it worked first go. I then wiped that partition again, changed back to full UEFI, installed Fedora 23 with full UEFI enabled. Grub has taken over and I can easily switch between Linux and Windows 10, all hardware working albeit the touch pad being touchy - but that's the case too in Win10. Not so the Lenovo - I tried everything for a week. I did RTFM, I read so many articles on the web, I followed every trick of the trade I have learned with myriads of kernel switches, debugging - you name it. I tried. I have given up, my first failure to ever get a computer to work with Linux. Luckily there is VmWare and Kali Linux. Sorry, Lenovo sucks.

Taking his numbers (which might not be for Skylake) the change in 'idle time' for a 66Wh battery (like in the Yoga 900) between 5W and 8.5W is 13.2 hours and 7.7 hours. Going to go out on a limb here and say that Skylake is probably more efficient. Any activity on the machine will of course make it use more power. I've had mine running all week with Ubuntu and off the charger for several days... so sleep works obviously. I'm not noticing any thermal issues which would worry me more. I'm about to start compiling kernels on it so we'll see how that goes... if anything is going to push the thermal management it's that. I guess what annoys me about all of this is that Lenovo could have just stated this up front; made the patched BIOS available and with the disclaimer it might negatively affect battery performance and cause more thermal throttling. I would be perfectly happy with that... I don't do many eight hour solid sessions on a laptop away from power. YMMV. What's more annoying is that if you go and read the Intel forums they say go and talk to the Linux kernel developers... and then the kernel developers say Intel doesn't provide the details.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Shuttle XPC nano NC02U machines pack Skylake SoCs by Zak Killian  11:00 AM on September 21, 2016 Shuttle, the company that can be named responsible for the original explosion of small-form-factor desktop computing, is bringing out a new series of XPC SFF PCs. However, unlike the XPCs you might be familiar with from the days of yore, these little computers are more akin to the Intel NUC than something like those Syber Cs from yesterday. Shuttle describes its XPC nano NC02U series as "palm-sized 4K portable" PCs. These machines come in four separate bare-bones configurations, all revolving around Intel Skylake SoCs. The base NC02U model uses the Celeron 3855U, a dual-core unit clocked at 1.6GHz. Things get a little more interesting going up the range. The NC02U3 packs a Core i3-6100U with two cores and four threads clocked at 2.3GHz, while the NC02U5 goes with a Core i5-6200U that's roughly similar to the previous model but can hit Turbo speeds up to 2.8GHz. Finally, the high-end NC02U7 contains a Core i7-6500U SoC, a dual-core, four-thread unit with 4MB of cache, 2.5GHz base clocks and Turbo clocks up to 3.1GHz. Aside from the SoC used, all four configurations are equivalent. Graphics are handled by the Intel SoC, and the little barebones machines support up to 32GB of DDR3L-1600 via a pair of SODIMM slots. An Intel I211 adapter handles Gigabit Ethernet duties, while Realtek supplies the chips for the audio section and the M.2 802.11n Wi-Fi card. Users can store data on M.2 SSDs (residing on a slot separate from the Wi-Fi adapter), or use a 2.5" SATA disk. Unusually, the NC02U offers support for 15-mm-tall 2.5" devices, too. While the modern Intel SoCs on offer can certainly pull HTPC duty in the living room, the inclusion of a decidedly old-school DB9 serial port on one side marks the NC02U series as potentially ready for commercial and industrial markets. Shuttle says that these little PCs are well-suited for signage, kiosks, and point-of-sale systems. Besides the retro serial port, the NC02Us include four USB 2.0 ports as well as USB 3.0 Type-A and Type-C connectors. Video output comes by way of HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, although Shuttle doesn't specify version numbers for those. A regular old 3.5mm audio jack rounds out the external connectivity. Shuttle says the XPC nano NC02U mini-PCs are available now.

After $5 in basic manufacturing costs are added, Apple’s total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 rises to $224.80. The unsubsidized price for a 32GB iPhone 7 is $649. IHS Markit has not yet performed a teardown analysis on the larger iPhone 7 Plus. This preliminary estimated total is $36.89 higher than the final analysis of the iPhone 6S published by IHS in December 2015. “Total BOM costs for the iPhone 7 are more in line with what we have seen in teardowns of recent flagship phones from Apple’s main competitor, Samsung, in that the costs are higher than in previous iPhone teardown analyses,” said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit. “All other things being equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past.” iPhone 7 in Jet Black   Same shape. No 3.5mm audio jack. While the overall shape and physical design of the iPhone 7 is similar to the iPhone 6S that preceded it, the new display has wider color gamut, including DCI-P3 as well as traditional sRGB, which improves the rendering of photos and videos. The device’s haptic engine, which provides the “click” feel for users, has also been improved for longer-duty cycles and better dynamic response. The home button is now static and mimics the MacBook in terms of a solid-state button design. Apple has also eliminated the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, allowing a larger battery and haptic motor. “Where there was an audio jack in the previous design, Apple replaced it with a symmetrical grill — not for speakers, but for the waterproof microphone, leaving more room for the larger battery and Taptic Engine,” Rassweiler said. Increased base-model storage Apple has increased the iPhone 7’s storage density. For the first time, the base model starts at 32 gigabytes (GB) – which is only the second time Apple has upgraded the base storage in the iPhone. From a cost perspective, the shift from 16GB/64GB/128GB iPhones to 32GB/128GB/256GB is a big jump. “Despite significant cost erosion in NAND flash over the last year, this increase in the overall memory cost definitely puts pressure on the bill of materials costs — and therefore margins — from Apple’s perspective,” Rassweiler said. Intel returns The Intel design win, and six years of absence that Intel had from the iPhone, is important to note. Even so, Intel still shares the processor business with Qualcomm. “Whereas Apple strives to have ‘one iPhone model for all carriers and markets,’ there are a number of different hardware permutations supporting various countries and carriers,” Rassweiler said. “Apple will likely look for ways to simplify the design moving forward, which means one supplier – whether Intel or Qualcomm – will likely dominate, as part of supplier and SKU streamlining.” According to Wayne Lam, principal analyst of smartphone electronics, IHS Markit, “Largely left behind in the 4G LTE market, Intel has finally worked itself back into the iPhone, which is a huge win, but not one that is going to be financially significant in the near term for Intel.” RF paths Apple has also eliminated segmented antenna bands, which means the company is pushing all radio-frequency (RF) paths to the very ends of the phone – both on the top and bottom. The aluminum uni-body construction and design forces all RF paths into those two locations. Whereas other smartphones use a glass back and RF components with antennas mounted on the ample back spaces, Apple is restricted to just two physical antennas. “This design limitation may force Apple to go back to an all-glass design again so that they can fit in 4x4MIMO LTE antennas and more features like wireless charging in the next iPhone iteration,” Lam said. Modem moved The baseband thin modem has been moved next to the A10 processor. Prior to the iPhone 7, the thin modem was always on the other side of the SIM card receptacle. “This is a subtle change but likely shows us where Apple wants to take this,” Lam said, “eventually putting the thin modem right on the apps processor package or even integrating it into the A-series processor.” Officially water resistant iPhone 7 is now officially rated as water resistant. “We also saw evidence of this water proofing design evolution in the earlier iPhone 6S, which included additional gasketing around critical connectors, as well as the use of WiFi antenna at the end of the primary speaker box,”Lam said. “Doing so pushes the antennas near the only other opening, for better reception and transmission.” Jet-black polished case Jet black polish is a new option on 128GB and 256GB models. “This is a new feature that produces a whole new look for the iPhone,” Lam said. “It is a lower yielding, time-intensive manufacturing step that adds cost, as well as considerable value, pushing the retail price higher for those requesting this option.” Antenna speaker design The antenna speaker design on the iPhone 7 came from the WiFi antenna packed into the speakers of Apple’s MacBook. “Apple likes to reuse these unique designs throughout their product lines,” Lam said. In a first for the iPhone series, the headset speaker now doubles as a stereo speaker. Upgraded camera While not as groundbreaking as the two optical paths in the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 7 camera has now been upgraded to optical image stabilization (OIS), for better low light performance. Improved battery life The battery has been increased to 1960mAhr capacity from 1715mAh in the previous iPhone 6s. This change is consistent with Apple’s claims of improved battery life.

We have Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus units and they pick up fingerprints like crazy (but, the finish is worth the extra effort to keep them clean). The weirdness of washing them under a running faucet and simply drying them off is exceeded only by the joy of being able to do so and the sparkling results such simple cleaning delivers!

Maybe it is generational, but I see a cell phone as a necessary pain in the ass and an iPad as a compromise only marginally better than a real computer. I will take a Mac any day over any touchscreen phone or tablet. I never hardly use either at home or at work. When I see millenials preferring a cell phone over a real computer I wonder how much strain they are putting on their eyes that will come back to bite them in the ass years from now. KingMel Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - 1:04 pm · Reply I used my iPad a lot. And, now that I actually have an iPhone (albeit an iPhone 4), I use it a decent amount. It is actually a good way to scan through emails and clear out the inbox because it offers convenience when I find a few spare minutes waiting in the car for a kid, etc. I still love Macs…always will. But I find it interesting how seldom I power up my old iMac anymore. For the basics – web, email, etc. – I just don’t need it. Col. Panic Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - 1:00 pm · Reply “only the second time Apple has upgraded the base storage in the iPhone” Nope. The first iPhone came in 4gb, so this is the third storage bump for the base model (4->8, 8->16, 16->32). KingMel Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - 1:05 pm · Reply Way to keep them honest, Colonel!

After $5 in basic manufacturing costs are added, Apple’s total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 rises to $224.80. The unsubsidized price for a 32GB iPhone 7 is $649. IHS Markit has not yet performed a teardown analysis on the larger iPhone 7 Plus. This preliminary estimated total is $36.89 higher than the final analysis of the iPhone 6S published by IHS in December 2015. “Total BOM costs for the iPhone 7 are more in line with what we have seen in teardowns of recent flagship phones from Apple’s main competitor, Samsung, in that the costs are higher than in previous iPhone teardown analyses,” said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit. “All other things being equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past.” iPhone 7 in Jet Black   Same shape. No 3.5mm audio jack. While the overall shape and physical design of the iPhone 7 is similar to the iPhone 6S that preceded it, the new display has wider color gamut, including DCI-P3 as well as traditional sRGB, which improves the rendering of photos and videos. The device’s haptic engine, which provides the “click” feel for users, has also been improved for longer-duty cycles and better dynamic response. The home button is now static and mimics the MacBook in terms of a solid-state button design. Apple has also eliminated the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, allowing a larger battery and haptic motor. “Where there was an audio jack in the previous design, Apple replaced it with a symmetrical grill — not for speakers, but for the waterproof microphone, leaving more room for the larger battery and Taptic Engine,” Rassweiler said. Increased base-model storage Apple has increased the iPhone 7’s storage density. For the first time, the base model starts at 32 gigabytes (GB) – which is only the second time Apple has upgraded the base storage in the iPhone. From a cost perspective, the shift from 16GB/64GB/128GB iPhones to 32GB/128GB/256GB is a big jump. “Despite significant cost erosion in NAND flash over the last year, this increase in the overall memory cost definitely puts pressure on the bill of materials costs — and therefore margins — from Apple’s perspective,” Rassweiler said. Intel returns The Intel design win, and six years of absence that Intel had from the iPhone, is important to note. Even so, Intel still shares the processor business with Qualcomm. “Whereas Apple strives to have ‘one iPhone model for all carriers and markets,’ there are a number of different hardware permutations supporting various countries and carriers,” Rassweiler said. “Apple will likely look for ways to simplify the design moving forward, which means one supplier – whether Intel or Qualcomm – will likely dominate, as part of supplier and SKU streamlining.” According to Wayne Lam, principal analyst of smartphone electronics, IHS Markit, “Largely left behind in the 4G LTE market, Intel has finally worked itself back into the iPhone, which is a huge win, but not one that is going to be financially significant in the near term for Intel.” RF paths Apple has also eliminated segmented antenna bands, which means the company is pushing all radio-frequency (RF) paths to the very ends of the phone – both on the top and bottom. The aluminum uni-body construction and design forces all RF paths into those two locations. Whereas other smartphones use a glass back and RF components with antennas mounted on the ample back spaces, Apple is restricted to just two physical antennas. “This design limitation may force Apple to go back to an all-glass design again so that they can fit in 4x4MIMO LTE antennas and more features like wireless charging in the next iPhone iteration,” Lam said. Modem moved The baseband thin modem has been moved next to the A10 processor. Prior to the iPhone 7, the thin modem was always on the other side of the SIM card receptacle. “This is a subtle change but likely shows us where Apple wants to take this,” Lam said, “eventually putting the thin modem right on the apps processor package or even integrating it into the A-series processor.” Officially water resistant iPhone 7 is now officially rated as water resistant. “We also saw evidence of this water proofing design evolution in the earlier iPhone 6S, which included additional gasketing around critical connectors, as well as the use of WiFi antenna at the end of the primary speaker box,”Lam said. “Doing so pushes the antennas near the only other opening, for better reception and transmission.” Jet-black polished case Jet black polish is a new option on 128GB and 256GB models. “This is a new feature that produces a whole new look for the iPhone,” Lam said. “It is a lower yielding, time-intensive manufacturing step that adds cost, as well as considerable value, pushing the retail price higher for those requesting this option.” Antenna speaker design The antenna speaker design on the iPhone 7 came from the WiFi antenna packed into the speakers of Apple’s MacBook. “Apple likes to reuse these unique designs throughout their product lines,” Lam said. In a first for the iPhone series, the headset speaker now doubles as a stereo speaker. Upgraded camera While not as groundbreaking as the two optical paths in the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 7 camera has now been upgraded to optical image stabilization (OIS), for better low light performance. Improved battery life The battery has been increased to 1960mAhr capacity from 1715mAh in the previous iPhone 6s. This change is consistent with Apple’s claims of improved battery life.

We have Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus units and they pick up fingerprints like crazy (but, the finish is worth the extra effort to keep them clean).

Maybe it is generational, but I see a cell phone as a necessary pain in the ass and an iPad as a compromise only marginally better than a real computer. I will take a Mac any day over any touchscreen phone or tablet. I never hardly use either at home or at work. When I see millenials preferring a cell phone over a real computer I wonder how much strain they are putting on their eyes that will come back to bite them in the ass years from now.

They have become powerful enough to be the primary computing platform for many households. However, consumers looking for UCFF PCs for specialized applications and industrial usage have been contending with high prices and lack of suitable options. GIGABYTE's BRIX family has emerged over the last several years as a compelling alternative to the Intel NUCs. With Skylake-U, GIGABYTE's BRIX family has expanded with multiple options catering to various market segments. This review will take a look at the GB-BSi7HAL-6500, a Skylake-U UCFF PC with two gigabit LAN ports. Introduction The Skylake-U platform for mini-PCs has turned out to be an interesting one. Numerous challenges were faced by the first one in the market - the Intel Skylake NUC. Eventual BIOS fixes made the platform realize its full potential. All these aspects made Intel's partners take it a bit slow when it came to promoting their Skylake-U mini-PCs. GIGABYTE's Skylake-U BRIX series first came into the news late last year for being one of the first OEM PCs to sport the Alpine Ridge Thunderbolt 3 / USB 3.1 Gen 2 controller. The product took a long time to appear in the market after the announcement. GIGABYTE, in the meanwhile, worked upon slightly tweaking various aspects of the platform to create new SKUs that could cater to a wider market. A look at the GIGABYTE BRIX listings shows more than 20 different Skylake-U units (models starting with GB-BS). Readers might find it useful to narrow down the offerings with the following guide to parsing the model numbers. Each barebones Skylake BRIX SKU has a model number fitting the following format: GB-BS<CoreSeriesIdentifier-01>(H)(T|A)(L|C)-<CoreSeriesIdentifier-02> The CPU in the SKU can be determined using the CoreSeriesIdentifier. For example, our review sample, the GB-BS<i7>HAL-<6500> has the Intel Core i7-6500U. The other parts of the model number are optional. For example, we have the GB-BSi7-6500, which is essentially a Skylake-U NUC clone with no bells and whistles, but, just sporting a CPU option that the Intel NUC lineup doesn't provide. The optional components indicate the presence of the following features: H = 2.5" drive support T = Thunderbolt 3 / USB 3.1 Gen 2 using the Alpine Ridge chipset A = Dual USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports (1x Type-A and 1x Type-C) using the ASMedia 1142 USB 3.1 Gen 2 controller L = Dual RJ-45 gigabit LAN ports C = COM (RS-232) port (RJ-45 slot similar to the L SKU, and a RJ-45 to COM cable bundled) GIGABYTE sampled us the barebones version of the GB-BSi7HAL-6500. We completed the configuration using a Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD and 2x16 GB Crucial Ballistix Sport LT DDR SODIMMs. Though the SODIMMs are capable of operating at 2400 MHz, the BRIX set it to operate at 2133 MHz. The specifications of our review configuration are summarized below.

In any case, we ended up installing the latest drivers downloaded off GIGABYTE's product support page. In addition to the main unit, the other components of the package include a 65 W (19V @ 3.42A) adapter with a US power connector, a VESA mount (along with the necessary screws), a driver CD and USB key, and a quick-start guide. The unit also supports a 2.5" drive. The appropriate SATA cable (data and power together in the typical notebook form factor) is pre-installed inside the main unit (as can be seen in the gallery below). Gallery: GIGABYTE GB-BSi7HAL-6500 Chassis Design & Internals The metal frame on the inside of the bottom lid (which holds the 2.5" drive in place) also has a thermal pad positioned to aid in the dissipation of heat from any M.2 SSD used in the system. Platform Analysis The GB-BSi7HAL-6500 is based on the standard Skylake-U platform with the Sunrise Point-LP PCH integrated in the same package as the CPU. There are a maximum of 16 possible high-speed I/O lanes in a Skylake-U system, and they can be configured in a flexible manner. The PCIe lanes in our configuration of the GB-BSi7HAL-6500 are distributed as follows: PCI-E 3.0 x2 port #1      In Use @ x2 (ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 xHCI Controller) PCI-E 3.0 x1 port #3      In Use @ x1 (Intel I210 Gigabit Network Connection) PCI-E 3.0 x1 port #6      In Use @ x1 (Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 AC HMC WiFi Adapter) PCI-E 3.0 x4 port #9      In Use @ x4 (Toshiba OCZ RD400 M.2 NVMe Drive) In the table below, we have an overview of the various systems that we are comparing the GIGABYTE GB-BSi7HAL-6500 against. Note that they may not belong to the same market segment. The relevant configuration details of the machines are provided so that readers have an understanding of why some benchmark numbers are skewed for or against the GB-BSi7HAL-6500 when we come to those sections.

Reply ddriver - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link More like mockery. Reply nagi603 - Thursday, September 22, 2016 - link Yeah, for the same price, (well, actually quite less, but with "only" 16GB ram and a 256GB SSD) I put together a mini-ITX box with a proper desktop-class i7.... And thanks to the bigger size, it is quite silent. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link You know, I actually got rather excited when I saw it'd be a dual LAN mini PC on Skylake, as this would work out very well for a pfSense router-box. >$591. >$1030 as configured. No thanks... Might be better to stick with one of those cheap chinese dual lan mini-PCs instead... Reply barleyguy - Thursday, September 22, 2016 - link The Zotac ZBox EN760 has GTX 960 graphics as well as the dual lan ports, and could easily be configured comparably to this. That probably falls in your "cheap Chinese mini PCs" category, though I think Zotac is Tawainese. It's possibly on a lower quality tier than the Intel NUC or Gigabyte Brix. That said, I have the older version of it (EN860) and it works great as an HTPC box. I have actually considered the Intel NUC for use with Thunderbolt pro audio. If you're pairing it up with thousands of dollars of studio gear the price seems less egregious. But if the Thunderbolt port is going to go unused, there's really no reason to choose that direction. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Thursday, September 22, 2016 - link The discrete graphics adds additional heat and cost that isn't useful for a pfSense box. It essentially acts as a server/router, using one LAN port as a WAN directly from a modem, then routes packets out accordingly from the other LAN port(s). Many Chinese fanless versions exist, but they use anemic celerons and atom CPUs. When you start using many extra features of pfSense, like squid (as a webproxy) the router's maximum throughput drops. Now this isn't an issue unless you have some kind of insane symmetrical 1gpbs up/down connection, where processor would fail to saturate the entire pipe. I'd prefer to not have to worry, so I'd be all in for a fanless Mini-STX case and socketing in my own 6300T or something, but there are no fanless Mini-STX cases, and no Mini-STX motherboards with dual LAN. There are fanless thin Mini-ITX cases from Akasa, but I wasn't able to source a cheapish i3 + thin Mini-ITX mobo with dual LAN. Reply fanofanand - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link $1030 using an iGPU. Pass. Reply fanofanand - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link Had to post a second comment, comparing this to the Skull Canyon, which has a better GPU/CPU, better wi-fi, and a better SSD really hurts the Brix. $3 less for nearly every component being better except 16 GB of RAM vs 32 GB. What use case does this box have where 32 GB of RAM becomes a factor? Are people running dozens of VMs off a box like this? I don't know about profiteering, but I don't see them selling many of these. Reply kmmatney - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link I can't see running too many VMs. The i7-6500U performs worse than an i3-6100 (uses a lot less power, but still...). I know going into these reviews that the prices will shock me, yet I'm still shocked when I see them.

After $5 in basic manufacturing costs are added, Apple’s total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 rises to $224.80. The unsubsidized price for a 32GB iPhone 7 is $649. IHS Markit has not yet performed a teardown analysis on the larger iPhone 7 Plus. This preliminary estimated total is $36.89 higher than the final analysis of the iPhone 6S published by IHS in December 2015. “Total BOM costs for the iPhone 7 are more in line with what we have seen in teardowns of recent flagship phones from Apple’s main competitor, Samsung, in that the costs are higher than in previous iPhone teardown analyses,” said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit. “All other things being equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past.” Same shape. No jack. While the overall shape and physical design of the iPhone 7 is similar to the iPhone 6S that preceded it, the new display has wider color gamut, including DCI-P3 as well as traditional sRGB, which improves the rendering of photos and videos. The device’s haptic engine, which provides the “click” feel for users, has also been improved for longer-duty cycles and better dynamic response. The home button is now static and mimics the MacBook in terms of a solid-state button design. Apple has also eliminated the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack, allowing a larger battery and haptic motor. “Where there was an audio jack in the previous design, Apple replaced it with a symmetrical grill -- not for speakers, but for the waterproof microphone, leaving more room for the larger battery and Taptic Engine,” Rassweiler said. Increased base-model storage Apple has increased the iPhone 7’s storage density. For the first time, the base model starts at 32 gigabytes (GB) – which is only the second time Apple has upgraded the base storage in the iPhone. From a cost perspective, the shift from 16GB/64GB/128GB iPhones to 32GB/128GB/256GB is a big jump. “Despite significant cost erosion in NAND flash over the last year, this increase in the overall memory cost definitely puts pressure on the bill of materials costs -- and therefore margins -- from Apple’s perspective,” Rassweiler said. Intel returns The Intel design win, and six years of absence that Intel had from the iPhone, is important to note. Even so, Intel still shares the processor business with Qualcomm. “Whereas Apple strives to have ‘one iPhone model for all carriers and markets,’ there are a number of different hardware permutations supporting various countries and carriers,” Rassweiler said. “Apple will likely look for ways to simplify the design moving forward, which means one supplier – whether Intel or Qualcomm – will likely dominate, as part of supplier and SKU streamlining.” According to Wayne Lam, principal analyst of smartphone electronics, IHS Markit, “Largely left behind in the 4G LTE market, Intel has finally worked itself back into the iPhone, which is a huge win, but not one that is going to be financially significant in the near term for Intel.” RF paths Apple has also eliminated segmented antenna bands, which means the company is pushing all radio-frequency (RF) paths to the very ends of the phone – both on the top and bottom. The aluminum uni-body construction and design forces all RF paths into those two locations. Whereas other smartphones use a glass back and RF components with antennas mounted on the ample back spaces, Apple is restricted to just two physical antennas. “This design limitation may force Apple to go back to an all-glass design again so that they can fit in 4x4MIMO LTE antennas and more features like wireless charging in the next iPhone iteration,” Lam said. Modem moved The baseband thin modem has been moved next to the A10 processor. Prior to the iPhone 7, the thin modem was always on the other side of the SIM card receptacle. “This is a subtle change but likely shows us where Apple wants to take this,” Lam said, “eventually putting the thin modem right on the apps processor package or even integrating it into the A-series processor.” Officially water resistant iPhone 7 is now officially rated as water resistant. “We also saw evidence of this water proofing design evolution in the earlier iPhone 6S, which included additional gasketing around critical connectors, as well as the use of WiFi antenna at the end of the primary speaker box,”Lam said. “Doing so pushes the antennas near the only other opening, for better reception and transmission.” Jet-black polished case Jet black polish is a new option on 128GB and 256GB models. “This is a new feature that produces a whole new look for the iPhone,” Lam said. “It is a lower yielding, time-intensive manufacturing step that adds cost, as well as considerable value, pushing the retail price higher for those requesting this option.” Antenna speaker design The antenna speaker design on the iPhone 7 came from the WiFi antenna packed into the speakers of Apple’s MacBook. “Apple likes to reuse these unique designs throughout their product lines,” Lam said. In a first for the iPhone series, the headset speaker now doubles as a stereo speaker. Upgraded camera While not as groundbreaking as the two optical paths in the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 7 camera has now been upgraded to optical image stabilization (OIS), for better low light performance. Improved battery life The battery has been increased to 1960mAhr capacity from 1715mAh in the previous iPhone 6s. This change is consistent with Apple’s claims of improved battery life.

(Mark Graves/The Oregonian) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 19, 2016 at 1:45 PM, updated September 22, 2016 at 6:52 AM comments Bob Swan.  Intel has again gone outside the company for a top executive, hiring former eBay chief financial officer Bob Swan as the chipmaker's new CFO. Intel announced in May that longtime CFO Stacy Smith would leave that job for a newly created post overseeing two disparate parts of the company – its manufacturing and sales operations. That move came amid a broad shakeup that included the exit of two top vice presidents, the hiring of a new corporate president, and the elimination of 12,000 jobs in a major restructuring to prepare Intel for long-term decline in PC sales. The new CFO, Swan, was most recently a partner at the private equity firm General Atlantic. Before that he was eBay's CFO for nine years, CFO of Electronic Data Systems, and chief executive of the short-lived online grocery service Webvan. Swan, 56, will receive an annual salary of $850,000 plus a bonus with a target payout of $1.1 million and a $5.5 million hiring bonus, paid out over two years. Additionally, Intel management will recommend to the board he receive a restricted new-hire stock grant worth $9.5 million, vesting over three years, plus annual stock grants forecast to be worth $6.5 million in the first year. Since Intel promoted Brian Krzanich to CEO in 2013, the company has reversed its longstanding practice of promoting from within and increasingly looked outside the company for new leadership. Soon after he got the CEO job Krzanich said the company was too "insular" and in the years since has repeatedly touted his penchant for finding leadership outside Intel. Prominent external hires include: Steven Fund, a former Procter & Gamble executive, hired in 2014 as Intel's chief marketing officer. Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, hired last November from Qualcomm to be president of Intel's PC and wireless groups. Paula Tolliver, chief information officer, hired last month from Dow Chemical. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Report: Estonian retailer accepting Kaby Lake CPU preorders by Wayne Manion  4:23 PM on September 20, 2016 Intel began shipping a limited selection of its new Kaby Lake CPUs to OEMs in July, and a few manufacturers have already announced products with the new chips. Desktop CPUs based on Kaby Lake architecture, part of the "optimize" phase of Intel's process-architecture-optimize cadence of product launches, aren't expected until the first quarter of 2017.  The three-month gap separating the present from 2017 hasn't stopped Estonian retailer Faunder from accepting pre-orders for the line-topping Core i7-7700K CPU. The Core i7-7700K, like its Skylake Core i7-6700K forebearer, is a quad-core, eight-thread CPU fabricated using Intel's 14-nm process technology. The Kaby Lake and Skylake parts fit the same LGA 1151 socket and have unlocked multipliers for Intel-sanctioned overclocking, when paired with an appropriate motherboard. The Core i7-7700K is clocked at 4.2GHz (200 MHz more than its Skylake predecessor) and packs 8MB of L3 cache, all in a 95W TDP. Faunder's Core i7-7700K product page lists a 4.5GHz Turbo Boost frequency, a 300 MHz increase compared to the current-generation chip.  Faunder is accepting pre-orders for Intel's latest desktop CPU for just over 360€. At current exchange rates, that figure comes to just over $400. For the sake of comparison, today's Core i7-6700K will drain a wallet of a little less than $350. U.S. prices for desktop Kaby Lake parts have not yet been announced, but new Intel parts are rarely substantially more expensive than outgoing SKUs.  Based on past releases, the upcoming Kaby Lake "optimization" step is likely to deliver the meager performance improvements along with reduced power consumption. Kaby Lake's video component will offer improved video hardware encoding and decoding support. Intel claims that Kaby Lake can pull as little as 0.5W while decoding 4K HEVC (H.265) video, compared to 10.2W for the same task on an equivalent Skylake chip.

It tucks inside a sleek metallic body a nice screen, the latest Intel low-power platform and a 30 Wh battery. It's not perfect, but it's a great device for what it costs, so if you're in the market for such a compact slate/mini-laptop, you should have it on your list. The good nice looking and well built, available in 4 different colors, packs a good screen, modern hardware available in multiple configurations, good IO, long battery life, loud speakers, great price The bad some minor design flaws, cramped keyboard with quite a lot of flex, rather slow Wi-Fi, charges slowly Asus will update the popular Transformer Book series with a new model this fall, the T100HA. It’s scheduled for release at the beginning of October, with the base models starting at around 300E here in Europe ($299 in the US), and includes, among others, an updated Intel CherryTrail hardware platform, an USB Type-C port and a slightly redesigned outercase and dock. I’ve spent a few weeks with a pre-release version of the T100HA, identical in pretty much every way to those models you’ll be able to buy in stores in a few weeks, and I’ve gathered my impressions and thoughts in the following paragraphs. In very few words, the Transformer Book T100HA is a light and compact 10-inch Windows 10 tablet with a good screen, which is fast enough for your daily activities as long as you keep multitasking to a bare minimum and is able to last for between 8 to 10 hours of daily use on a single charge. A keyboard dock is included in the pack. If these have sparked your interest and if you’re interested in more details about this Transformer Book T100HA, then the long story awaits you in the rows below. This is the new 10-inch Asus Transformer Book T100HA Asus Transformer Book T100HAN Screen 10.1 inch, 1280 x 800 px, IPS, touchscreen Hardware Intel Atom CherryTrail  X5-Z8500 CPU 1.44 GHz CPU and Intel HD graphics Memory 2 GB RAM Storage 64 GB eMMC Connectivity Wireless N, Bluetooth Ports micro-HDMI, micro-USB, USB 3.1 Type-C gen1, microSD card reader, headphone jack Cameras 2 MP front, 5 MP back Battery 30 Wh OS Windows 10 64-bit Size Tablet: 265 x 175 x 8.5 mm (10.4” x 6.9” x 0.33”) Tablet + Dock: 265 x 175 x 18.5 mm (10.4” x 6.9” x 0.72”) Weight Tablet: 580 g (1.27 lbs) Tablet + Dock: 1140 g (2.51 lbs) Others docking station included, with keyboard, trackpad and USB 2.0 slot, available in 4 different colors Design, exterior and first look There are quite a few ultra-slim tablets out there these days, like the iPads, the Android slates or the magnesium built Microsoft Surface 3. But most of them sell for 400-500 bucks or more. Asus have a sleek Transformer Book as well, the T100 Chi we reviewed a while ago. The T100HA on the other hand is more affordable, but that’s not something you could tell based on the first impression, as this device feels like a more premium model. The tablet is slim, fairly light (1.27 lbs) and its outer case is mostly metallic, with an aluminum shell stretching around the back and the sides, while a shinny plastic rim acts as a liaison between the metal and the glass on the front face. The slate feels nice in hand and the rounded edges make it quite comfortable to hold and use. The build quality is pretty good as well, although the case does squeak when grabbed firmly, which suggests that the metallic shell is slim and not very sturdy. Overall though, the T100HA is a evolution when compared to the T100TA and T100TAM launched in the previous years. It’s smaller and lighter, it feels stronger and it’s going to be available in a bunch of different colors: White, Gray, Blue and Red. I’ve spent time with the Blue model and I think it’s a head turner, especially among kids. The color scheme is matched on the dock and some models are paired with a white, others with a black keyboard. On the other hand, when it comes to the IO, not much has changed, except for the addition of an USB TypeC port. That’s a first generation USB 3.1 slot though, so it won’t work with Thunderbolt peripherals, but will allow faster connection speeds (up to 5 Gbps) than the microUSB slot. It’s worth noting that the USB 3.1 slot is placed on the left side, while all the others are on the right. I was expecting to see the tablet bundled with an USB 3.1 charger, but this particular unit came with a standard microUSB cable in the box. That means that charging times are still a concern, on one hand, while on the other it means that using the tablet while charging is going to be difficult, since the included cable is very short (3 feet, less than 1 m long) and has to stretch all the way to the slate’s right edge. These issues could be addressed if the final retail versions will ship with an USB TypeC cable, but I’m pretty sure that’s not going to be the case here. Dock, keyboard and trackpad While the T100HA feels nice for a device that sells for under $300, the dock doesn’t exactly match it in terms of quality, as it’s made from a matte plastic and it feels somewhat hollow, cheap. I for one found it a bit weird that the dock is millimetrically shorter than the tablet, so the two don’t fit perfectly on top of each other. The fact that the tablet is a bit longer makes lifting the screen much easier than on other tablets, so perhaps that’s the reason why the two parts aren’t perfectly symmetrical. The dock latches to the tablet magnetically and the whole process of binding and unbiding the two is smooth and fast. You can easily attach the slate to the dock with a single hand, but you’ll need both hands to detach them, since the magnets are fairly strong. The hinge is solid and made from plastic as well. As a small detail, the dock rises on this hinge when the device is used as a mini laptop, thus the manufacturer designed two tiny feet on the hinge, which are also made from hard plastic. As a result, the T100HA will slide quite easily on a desk, as these feet on the hinge lack proper grip. Older Transformer Books had softer rubber feet on the hinge, from what I can remember, thus were more stable on a flat surface. Now, we’ve seen a similar hinge on the T100 Chi, however with this tablet there’s an actual connector that physically ties the tablet and the dock together. That means we don’t have a Bluetooth Keyboard dock on the T100HA, so it will only work when the slate is attached, but also means you’ll find a full-size USB slot on this dock (USB 2.0 only). Some of the older Transformer Books offered room for a HDD inside the dock, but that’s not the case here. In fact, the dock is so slim that a 2.5″ drive won’t be able to physically fit inside. There’s one more thing I have to add before moving on. The T100TAM and the T100 Chi were both top heavy when the tablet was connected to the dock and leaned back as much as possible. This newer T100HA no longer falls on its back, but at the same time the opening angle is limited to only about 130 degrees, so you will struggle to watch the screen head-on in certain conditions. These aside, let’s turn out attention on the keyboard and trackpad. You probably noticed by now that Asus went with a white keyboard on this color scheme and it looks beautiful. It allows the keys to be visible in dimmer conditions, which is extremely important, since they are not backlit. Aesthetics aside though, the keyboard is pretty much identical to those on the previous 10-inch Transformer Books. We’re talking about small rectangular keys with little space between them, but a full layout with all the important keys. The feedback is decent and the stroke fairly deep for such a thin device, but even so, I struggled to type accurately on this configuration, since the entire keyboard is so cramped. If you have smaller hands and you’re willing to spend the time to get used to the layout, you’ll probably pull it off though. As a side note, the keys are rather loud, thus typing in a quiet room can get a bit annoying for those around you, plus there’s a fair amount of flex and bounce in the keyboard’s frame, mostly because the dock is thin and made out of plastic. The trackpad is fairly spacious for a 10-incher and feels nice to the touch, despite being made out of plastic. It handles taps and gestures well most of the time, but if you need to press for clicks you’ll find the surface stiff and noisy. Screen Asus went with a 10.1 inch IPS touchscreen on this device and it’s a good one. The HD resolution (1280 x 800 px) might not be high enough for this day and age, and you’ll notice the pixels when readings texts or browsing, but it’s a detail I can live with on such an affordable device, especially since the screen’s other characteristics are above average. Those include the brightness, contrast, viewing angles and color reproduction, although you’ll need to use some sort of calibrating tool to correct the blueish tint that the panel gets out of the box. Check out the rows below for extra details: Panel HardwareID: AUOptronics AUO20D4; Coverage: 83% sRGB, 62% NTSC, 64% AdobeRGB; measured gamma: 2.1; max brightness in the middle of the screen: 460 cd/m2 on power; contrast at max brightness: 790:1; white point: 8100 K; black on max brightness: 0.59 cd/m2; average DeltaE: 1.87 uncalibrated, 0.79 calibrated . Now, I should add that the brightness readings seem a bit odd to me, as the panel does not appear to be as bright as my Spyder4 sensor claims. This could be due to the fact that the T100HA is running Windows 10 and the Spyder utility might have some issues with the new OS. So for now, take that reading with a grain of salt. That aside, is worth adding that there’s no active digitizer on this display, thus the T100HA is not going to be an ideal slate for inking and taking notes. Overall though, you’ll have little to complain about this display. Yes, premium tablets offer overall better high-resolution panels, but if you’re on a budget you’ll just have to settle for an HD only option, which should not be very hard in this case. Hardware and daily use experience The Transformer Book T100HA is built on Intel’s latest to-date hardware platform for low-power devices. In other words, it bundles an Atom CherryTrail X5-Z8500 processor, paired with 2 GB of RAM and 64 GB of eMMC storage on this tested model. Other configurations include 4 GB of RAM and a choice of either 32 or 128 GB of storage space. Software wise, the tablet comes with Windows 10 Home (64bit), but Windows 10 Pro might be bundled on some configurations as well. The T100HA is fairly capable, as long as you know what to expect and keep multitasking to a minimum The version I got to spend time with came with little to no bloatware, but I expect at least a few programs bundled with the final releases. Among those, an 1-year license for Microsoft’s Office 365 should be included, something you can find on all the other 10-inch slates available in stores these days. Now, Windows 10 performs pretty smoothly on this low-power configuration. Everyday performance is alright, as long as you know what to expect from such a device and don’t mind occasional sluggishness. I advise you to keep multitasking to a bare minimum and not use Chrome, which is known to be a memory hog. I’ve used Firefox instead, which performed well, but once you have more than 8-10 tabs open the device will start to struggle. On the other hand, I had no problems editing documents on the T100HA or watching all sorts of video content, including 4K clips on Youtube (on Edge, as on chrome the same clips were choppy) and 1080p/4K MKV and HEVC clips stored on the device itself. I used the default Movies and TV app and these movies barely put the processor to work, while with VLC Player the same files did not play smoothly. The good screen and the fairly loud speakers help with the multimedia experience, just don’t expect much in terms of sound quality. The speakers peak up at 80 dB (at ear-level) while playing Pharell’s Happy song of Youtube, and as a side note, they cause the slate’s metallic back to vibrate, even at lower volumes, which can be annoying when holding the tablet and playing music or videos. Now, my model came with only 2 GB of RAM and that takes a major toll on performance, especially since 0.8 GB are already occupied by Windows by default and some of it is used by the graphics, which leaves around 1 GB available for everyday use. The other issue is the rather slow storage eMMC storage solution, so don’t expect to launch programs instantaneously on this machine. I should also add that this particular unit did not perform as well as I was expecting in benchmarks. Immature drivers are usually to blame with these pre-production samples, but that means the final retail versions should be snappier. I did run a few tests and the results are listed below. 3Dmark 11: P405; 3DMark 13:  Ice Storm – 18977, Cloud Gate – 1825, Sky Diver – 951, Fire Strike – 223; CineBench 11.5: OpenGL 9.29 fps, CPU 1.20 pts, CPU Single Core 0.39 pts; CineBench R15: OpenGL 11.79 fps, CPU 110 cb, CPU Single Core 35 cb; x264 Benchmark 4.0: Pass 1 – 40.67 fps, Pass 2 – 7.86 fps; Octane 2.0 on Chrome: 7805 points. As you can tell, the numbers aren’t very good. But like I said, take them with a pinch of salt, the final units will be faster. In fact, this T100HA performed poorer than the Atom Z3795 powered Asus T100 Chi tested a while ago and is quite far from the Surface 3, which is one of the few other tablets powered by Intel Atom CherryTrail hardware available right now. Still, while the Transformer Book T100HA does not excel when it comes to performance, it does run cool most of the time and does last for many hours on each charge. The slate’s case barely reaches 30-33 Centigrades with everyday use, although it will get a bit hotter if you’ll play games (from the store) or perform other demanding activities. The inner components on the other hands reach temperatures of over 80 degrees often, but that’s no something you should be concerned about. *Daily Use – 1080p Youtube clip in EDGE for 30 minutes I should also add that the Wireless chip inside the Transformer Book isn’t very fast. Asus went for a Wi-Fi N only Broadcom chip, capable of reaching maximum speed of 72 mbps. In reality you should only expect around 50 Mbps right near the router and about 25-30 Mbps at 30 feet with two walls in between. That’s enough for daily browsing and enough to stream content from Youtube, Netflix or other sources, even in 4K. On the other hand, if you’ll need to copy content of and on the tablet, you’ll need to be patient, as both the Wi-Fi and the eMMC storage are slow. Last on the list there are the cameras, inherited from the previous Transformer Books: 5 Mpx on the back, 1.2 MPx on the front. I haven’t used the back shooter much, but I did try to use the front-camera for a quick Skype call in the evening and it proved to be pixelated and grainy. It will perform better in brighter conditions, but don’t expect much. The sound came out clean though and the two microphones are placed on the tablet’s top edge. Battery Life There’s a 30 Wh battery inside the T100HA and that’s enough to push the tablet for 6-10 hours of everyday use, as you can see from the few situations mentioned below (I’m using HW Monitor to record the average discharge for 30 minutes in each case, while the screen is set at around 120 nits – 40% brightness in this case). 1.6 Wh (~19 h of use) – idle, screen at 0%, Wi-Fi OFF; 4 Wh (~7 h 30 min of use) – very light browsing and text editing in Google Drive, screen at 30%, Wi-Fi ON; 3.2 Wh (~9 h 30 min of use) – 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in EDGE, screen at 30%, Wi-Fi ON; 4.8 Wh (~6 h  min of use) – 1080p fullscreen .mkv video in Videos and TV, screen at 30%, Wi-Fi ON; 5.5 Wh (~5 h 30 min of use) – heavy browsing in EDGE, screen at 30%, Wi-Fi ON; 5.9 Wh (~5 h min of use) – 1080p fullscreen video on Youtube in Chrome, screen at 30%, Wi-Fi ON. It’s worth noting that the T100HA did not last as long as the T100 Chi in out battery tests. Once again keep in mind this is a pre-production version and the final release models might behave a bit differently both in terms of performance and in terms of efficiency. However, comparing these result to those of the Surface 3, which is powered by very similar hardware, we can conclude the CherryTrail platform is not as efficient as the previous BayTrail-T hardware. The device came with a microUSB charger, as I mentioned above, and that means it will take more than 3 hours for a 10 to 100% recharge. The included microUSB to USB 2.0 cable is short (3-feet) and that means charging and using the tablet at the same time can be rather uncomfortable, unless you have a wall-socket right next to where you use it. There’s also the slim chance that the final retail units will ship with an USB 2.0 to USB 3.1 cable and you could charge the slate via the USB 3.1 slot, but I’m 99% sure that’s not going to be the case here, because it would mean that Asus implemented two different charging systems on this tablet. The long battery life is one of this slate’s best selling points Since the device is USB powered, you can also charge it from an external battery. Pricing and competition The Asus Transformer Book T100HA is expected to start at $299 (299E in Europe) and the base configuration will include the Intel Atom X5-Z8500 processor, 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. Other configurations will get up to 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, with the most expensive options selling for a little over $400. Now, if you plan to use this thing lightly and rely mostly on online services, the base model could be an option. Personally, I’d rather get a configuration with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage, it should handle everyday tasks much smoother and won’t run out of space as quickly. As for the competition, right now there are very few other slates built on Intel CherryTrail hardware, except for the more premium and more expensive Microsoft Surface 3. But there will be alternatives from Acer, Lenovo, HP, Dell and a few other OEMs in the next few months. On the other hand, there are plenty of BayTrail devices out there and most of them are discounted these days. The Asus Transformer Book T100, the HP Omni 10 and the Acer Aspire Switch 10E are just some of the options to consider, while the Asus T100 Chi and the Acer Aspire Switch 10 2015 come in as more premium 10-inch options. Follow this link for more details on the available 10-inch Windows tablets and mini laptops. Wrap-up After spending a few weeks with the Asus Transformer Book T100HA, I’m sure this is one of the best 10-inch slates you can get these days in the $300 to $400 price range. It looks beautiful and is strongly built, it packs a good screen, modern hardware and a large enough battery so it can last for 8-10 hours on each charge. It’s not drastically better than the competition in any way, but it is a more polished device and does not have any major quirks, anything that could turn you away from it. The T100HA is not for everyone though, as the performance might be lacking for some users and it’s really compact, which means it has a small screen, miniaturized ports and a shrunk-down keyboard. The Asus T100HA is one of the better 10-inch affordable tablets out there There is something else to consider as well. On one hand the T100HA is a more refined version of the older Transformer Books and other BayTrail devices, but it’s not a significant improvement in terms of performance, battery life or even features. And when we look at it from this angle, there’s a fair chance you will find better deals for your money among those previous generation 10-inchers in the months to come. Still, if you want a recent model and especially the redesigned case and the USB TypeC port, the T100HA is going to be hard to beat. In fact, I think this is a better pick for the money than the more premium Asus T100 Chi, and I’d have it on my shortlist for the end of this year, especially since I expect to see it discounted in quite a few places around Christmas and the Sales period.

Quite a nice Devise… Reply Stephen September 29, 2015 at 6:29 pm As reported not much difference to TA and I like the full sized USB 3 in dock and Office that doesn’t run out. You can put sd cards in up to 256gb and Windows 10 runs fine. Still if the price drops low enough Reply Mark October 3, 2015 at 9:31 am But this is much better in terms of hardware for the same price of the TA. For the same price as with TA with the 500GB dock, I think you would get the 128GB/4GB HA version, with the RAM upgrade being the most compelling reason for an upgrade. The back camera is also very important if you’re a student or an office worker as it would be occasionally useful for taking pictures of whiteboards and documents and such. Office 365 (assuming it’s Personal)… if the thing expires there’s always the Windows 10 Office apps to fall back. Or at least for a year ASUS may again release a better T100. 🙂 BTW, AFAIK the T100TA only supports up to 32GB microSDs, and speeds are also very limited. Reply Andrei Girbea October 9, 2015 at 7:02 pm The 4 GB of RAM is the only significant upgrade and I’d say it’s worth paying extra for if you plan to keep this thing for a while. Isaac October 6, 2015 at 2:15 pm Wich is better,the T100HA or the T100TAM? In terms of performance. Thanks. Reply Anand February 11, 2016 at 2:46 pm Thanks for the Review. I have one question. Does it support “Expandable Storage” ? it has card reader slot but no where it is clearly mentioned that storage can be expanded via Micro SD card Reply Andrei Girbea February 12, 2016 at 12:43 am It does Reply Anand February 12, 2016 at 9:08 am Hi Andrei, Thanks for your response. As you mentioned it supports Expandable Storage. Will I be able to install apps on the micro SD card ? Will there be an option to choose install location for Applications ? This feature will be really helpful. This will increase the storage space. Andrei Girbea February 24, 2016 at 12:25 am Well, yes, but the card is slow and I would advise against this. lucca March 16, 2016 at 2:09 am What makes you think, that the external SD-Card will be slower, than the internal SD-Card? (there is no real SSD inside, it’s just a embedded MemoryCard) Faye February 15, 2016 at 8:13 pm Would you recommend this laptop for blogging/photo editing for a traveller looking for a small and lightweight computer? Reply Andrei Girbea February 24, 2016 at 12:25 am Photo editing, not that much, unless it’s really basic stuff like cropping Reply lucca March 16, 2016 at 2:14 am Since the Modell is surprisingly fast for that size, weight and price, I would say yes (and you are not a Photoshop Pro who needs to works with many layers and filters) But be sure to take at least the 4 GB Modell … If you want much more Power (but be fine with less battery life) take a look at the surface pro 2 + . They are really fast (and expensive) But for basic needs the t100ha is fine. I develop WebApps with mine and I am happy with it.

Those include the front-facing dual-speaker system, the recent Intel Moorefield hardware platform powering it, the 3G modem included, the dual-SIM support and, for sure not least, the price. But is the FonePad 7 FE375CG worth your hard earned buck and does it have any hidden flaws? Well, stick with me till the end of this review and you’ll find out. This is the Asus Fonepad FE375CG – a dual-SIM Moorefield powered 7 inch tablet that sells for roughly $200 But first, have a look at the specs sheet, so you’ll get a larger picture of what we’re dealing with here. Asus Fonepad 7 FE375CG spec sheet Screen 7 inch, 1280 x 800 px, IPS Hardware Intel Atom Moorefield Z3560 1.83 GHz, quad-core + PowerVR 6430 graphics Memory 1 GB RAM Storage 16 GB (11.1 available) Connectivity Wireless N, Bluetooth, GPS, 3G – HSPA (dual-sim) Sensors accelerometer, compass, gyroscope, light-sensor Ports micro-USB, microSD card reader (up to 64 GB card), headphone jack Cameras 5 MPx back camera, 2 MPx front camera Battery 15 Wh OS Android 4.4.2 KitKat with ZenUI Size 194.3 x 108.9 x 9.8 mm (7.65 x 4.29 x 0.39 inches) Weight 299 g (0.66 pounds) Others dual front-facing speakers, available in a bunch of colors, matching cases offered Price $199 Design and first impression On the outside this FonePad looks like a standard 7 inch tablet. It’s fairly compact and fairly light, pretty much like the Asus Memo Pad ME176C tested a while ago, although a bit thinner (as shown by the narrower lateral bezel around the screen) and longer. There’s glass covering the front face, with two individual cuts on top and below the display for the front-facing speakers, which are actually quite good and loud, as long as you don’t keep the device on the Power Saving option from the included Audio Wizard app. I believe it actually ships (at least this tested unit did) with this option selected by default, that’s why you might think the speakers are pretty bad when you’ll get the slate out of the box, but make sure you switch to Music or something else in Audio Wizard and you’ll be fine. The back is made from what looks like painted plastic and I have the Gold version for this review, which I’m really not a fan of. Luckily there are other colors available as well, but the coating seems fragile, somewhat cheap, and I worry it’s going to scratch and dent easily, so you might want to keep this inside a case. Asus does have a few of them available and I’ve tested the one called View Folio Cover, made of some sort of textured faux-leather, with a circular cut that pairs smartly with the software interface and shows various details, like the time and date, or who’s calling you. Other from that, you’ll fidn the standard features on the device, including the fornt and rear-cameras, the microUSB port placed on the top lip, plus the Power button and volume rocker on the right, again too close together, so you might end up turning off the screen while looking to turn down the volume. Phone and 3G abilities Back to what I said earlier, yes, this thing can be used as a phone. In fact, it offers room for two different SIMs and an up to 64 GB microSD card, all hidden behind an accessible plastic cap on the phone’s left edge. You can use either of the SIMs at the same type. When having only only inserted, it will be used for both voice and data services. When having both, you can select which one of them is used for data and then you can make/take calls or send/receive text-messages on either of them. The dialer is smartly designed to show you the available SIMs. For instance, when there are two inserted, you can select which one you want to use, when there’s only one, it only displays it and tells you if it’s inserted in the 1st or the 2nd SIM slot. I was satisfied with the cellular performance of this Fonepad. It does not support 4G/LTE speeds, but it’s still going to be fast enough for daily use. I also haven’t encountered any problems while taking calls on it, although the earpiece is not very loud, so you’ll have a hard-time hearing the other person in a noisy room, and the microphones don’t do a great job at catching your voice, so you’ll sound somewhat muted on the other end of the call. Besides that, the proximity sensor that turns OFF the screen when having the tablet at your ear is really slow and takes 1-2 seconds to react and turn the display back ON, which is going to be annoying if you want to let’s say quickly access something on the device while in a conversation. Add these to the weird looks you’ll get when talking on a 7 inch device and you’ll probably conclude this thing is not the greatest phone there. But it gets the job done if needed. And you can always tend to a Bluetooth headset and forget about those inconveniences. Screen There’s a 7 inch IPS otuchscreen on this Fonepad, fairly bright (Auto brightness is also available) and capable of painting nice looking colors. Some of you might complain about the 1280 x 800 px resolution and it’s true that pixels are visible when looking closely and especially when browsing and dealing with fonts, that looks somewhat fuzzy. But let’s not forget this is an affordable tablet and adjust out expectations accordingly. Yes, a 1080p display would have been great, but this one will do fine and helps extend the battery life while keeping the price down. If you do care a lot about pixel density and panel sharpness though, you’d better look somewhere else (and be prepared to spend extra). There’s a good 7 inch IPS screen on this phone, but some of you might not appreciate the HD resolution Hardware and software This is one of the first tablets powered by Intel’s new Moorefield hardware released into the wild, while most other tested lately were powered by BrayTrail-Z hardware. I’m not getting in depth here, but the Z3560 is basically a quad-core CPU clocked at 1.86 GHz with PowerVR 6 Series graphics. These are only paired with 1 GB of RAM, but even so, the tablet feels fast in daily use and scores highly in most benchmarks. (Keep in mind that this is still an early sample and results might actually improve on final retails units.)  Antutu v5.0 Beta 1 – got inconsistent results, ranging between 30000 and 47000 points; Quadrant – 17921; 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited: 14765; Manhattan – 1201 (19.4 fps, 1080p Manhattan Offscreen – Out of Memory , T-Rex – 2287 (40.8 fps), 1080 T-Rex Offscreen (1658 – 29.6 fps). MooreField is not majorly different from BayTrail-T though. They are both 22 nm platforms, but the Z3560 is a natively quad-core Silvermont based SoC with improved PowerVR (Rogue) G6430 graphics, hence the performance boost (mostly visible in the graphics department). The limited amount of RAM does drag down this particular implementation and is occasionally noticeable in everyday use. I will put up together a more detailed post comparing Intel’s BayTrail-T and Moorefield hardware platforms in the near future, so stay tuned for that. Software wise, the Fonepad FE375CG runs Android 4.4.2 with Asus’s ZenUI skin on top, which redesigns and enhances most interface elements, from the homescreens to the multitasking panel. And I do appreciate some of the changes, like the Quick Settings panel that also allows you to adjust the screen’s brightness and Free RAM in case performance gets poor or the app drawer where you can list only the downloaded apps or have them sorted based on popularity. On top of these, Asus does bundle some software on this FonePad, like they do on all their other slates. And that includes a File Manager, the Audio Wizard, the Splendid app that lets you adjust the screen’s white balance and color intensity, the Do it Later to-do list and task manager or the Webstorage, that includes some free cloud storage space for the first year with your tablet. There’s also the ZenLink suite that allows to easily share content between different devices and connect wirelessly to a big screen or remotely to a computer. Follow this link for more details on Asus’s software package. Long story short though, the Asus FonePad FE375CG does provide an enjoyable everyday experience. It’s fairly snappy, offers access to plenty of apps and can handle decently well most of the things you’ll throw at it, including games like Asphalt 8 or Real Racing 3. The nice screen and punchy speakers also add to the overall impression, as well as the impressive battery life and I’d say this does run mostly smoother than the Asus BayTrail-T Memo Pads I’ve tested recently. However, you should know that the tablet gets a bit warm on the back when pushed, in the middle, beneath the camera’s lens, and Intel’s Moorefield is still only a mid-range platform, so don’t expect this thing to be the fastest out there and get used to the idea that it will occasionally choke if you’ll push it heavily, especially since it only packs only 1 GB of RAM. Battery life This FonePad gets a 15 Wh battery and Intel’s platform is really efficient. A single charge will get you countless hours of stand-by time, with the Wi-Fi syncing in the back, and you can roughly expect 8 hours of daily use from this one or about 6 with the cellular modem continuously turned ON. If you plan on using it as a phone, the FE375CG will easily get you through the day as long as you let it rest from time to time. I did had to rush through this part of the review though and lacked the time to properly test the battery life under various circumstances, so I can’t exactly tell you how much it will last while running games or movies. I’ll hopefully update this part in the near future, but for now, take the numbers with a grain of salt. My overall impression on this slate’s battery life is solid though and I believe the Moorefield platform is a step forward from the Baytrail-T tested on the MemoPad ME176C and ME181C. Oh, and you also get several Power Saving Modes in case you actually want to squeeze the most out of this FonePad, while limiting performance and connectivity. Price and availability From what I can tell right now, the Fonepad FE375G will be soon available in stores in select regions, including Asia and Eastern Europe. I can’t say for sure though if the Western countries, South America or the US will get it as well, but I will update this section once I know more. My contacts at Asus suggest a price-tag of around $200 (200 euros), which is definitely not bad for what this thing has to offer. Wrap-up The FonePad FE375CG is imh the go-to option for an A-Brand tablet with cellular connectivity right now IF you’re on a limited budget. You can probably find cheaper 7 inch slates with a 3G modems from various OEMs, but I can’t comment on these, they vary from region to region. I can however recommend this FonePad. I own the original FonePad (the ME371MG, if I’m not mistaken) and this newer model is a major improvement in terms of performance, software package and battery life. And then you get those other goodies on top: it can take two SIMs, one for voice, one for data, it gets front-facing speakers, it’s available in different colors and Asus offers a handful of matching cases for it. The Asus FOnePad FE375CG has no major issues and is a solid pick if you’re after an affordable 7 inch tablet with 3G connectivity On the other hand, if you don’t need a cellular tablet, the Asus’s MemoPad ME176C remains a more affordable options, selling for just under $150. However, this Fonepad performs overall smoother and lasts slightly longer on a charge, but a Moorefield version of the Memo Pad will probably hit the shelves in the near future as well. Anyway, to wrap this up, I can hardly complain about anything on this tablet, and you know me, I always complain about something. There are minor aspects that Asus could improve, like the painted plastic case that feels a bit cheap or the overall Wi-Fi speed, which is not on par with the other (more expensive) slates I have around, but let’s not forget this is a 200 bucks device and it just can’t be spotless. On the other hand, some of you might complain about the low resolution screen and limited amount of RAM, and I agree that the latter can be a problem sometimes, but again, 200 bucks won’t get you those right now, at the time of this article (September 2014), not in an A-brand slate. So if you do want them, be prepared to pay extra for something like the Nexus 7 2013 LTE ($300+) or any of the new devices that will be launched in the near future (keep in eye on the new Nexus slate). To conclude, this is a good buy. But I’d like to know what you guys think about the Asus Fonepad FE375CG, if you like it or not, if you think it’s worth you money or you’d rather get something else instead.

 Intel is paying over $23 million to bring in eBay's former CFO Eugene Kim Sep. 20, 2016, 1:20 PM 4,349 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel CFO Bob SwanIntel Intel tapped Bob Swan to be its new CFO, replacing Stacy Smith who will now oversee the company's sales, manufacturing, and operations. Swan's hiring was a bit of a surprise, given his lack of experience in the chip business. He was most recently a partner at private equity firm General Atlantic, and before that, has spent 9 years as eBay's CFO. But perhaps what's more surprising is his lofty pay package that exceeds $23 million in total, according to a regulatory filing. Swan will get an $850,000 base salary, but is eligible for an annual bonus of $1.2 million and a hiring bonus of $5.5 million. On top of that, his new hire stock grant and annual equity award could each be worth $9.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Swan's compensation package is particularly interesting because it shows Intel's willingness to pay big bucks to bring in outside executives, even as the company's going through a massive cost cutting plan that involves its biggest layoff in history. Just last year, Intel gave a $25 million pay package to former Qualcomm exec Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala to hire him as the company's number two executive. Tricky timing "We do note a continuation of high pay for new talent however, with Mr. Swan's package coming in at a bit over $23 million," Bernstein's analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note. It'll be interesting to see how Intel's current employees take these high compensation packages given that the rest of the company is going through a painful reorganization process. We did previously hear rumblings from a number of current and former employees who questioned the logic behind these big pay packages. Still, Rasgon says Swan's hiring is a "reasonably positive" move given his experience in restructuring at a private equity firm. At eBay, he also oversaw more than 30 acquisitions and helped with the spinoff of PayPal. “Mr. Swan's most recent role in private equity (Operating Partner at General Atlantic), may enable him to bring a skillset to bear on Intel's ongoing restructuring and refocusing, as well as investing for growth…Overall our initial (outside-in) impressions of this hire are reasonably positive," Rasgon wrote.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Intel hints it's quietly planning a return to mobile processors Listen | Print By James Walker     Sep 20, 2016 in Technology Earlier this year, Intel suddenly bowed out of the mobile processor market. It ceased development of its Atom chips for smartphones and tablets, ceding defeat to the likes of Qualcomm and MediaTek. It has now hinted it could return in the future. Intel has scrapped its next-generation Atom processors that would have found their way into future phones, tablets and convertible PCs. Instead, it has refocused its mobile ambitions on modem manufacturing, a business that appears to be more successful than creating processors. Intel has attracted Apple to its modems for the iPhone 7. This week, Venkata Renduchintala, president of Intel's Client and IoT division, addressed the company's departure from mobile in an interview with PCWorld. Renduchintala said the decision to axe the Atom chips was a result of rationalising the company's R&D spending. However, he said the current lack of mobile development doesn't mean Intel's out of the market for good. He hinted the company is already back at work, creating new products out of the public eye. "We had a couple of mobile SoC products that I don't think were worthy to continue to conclusion," Renduchintala said in the interview. "That doesn't mean we're no longer doing mobile platforms. On the mobile platform side, my commitment is to talk less and do more. When we have something to say we'll talk about it." Renduchintala described modems as a "fundamental technology" that's "as indelible for us as our competence in CPU or GPU." He said the company has a long-term road-map for its modem business and has already established itself with "credibility, relevance and importance" in the modem market. Intel's processors dominate desktop machines but have never achieved the same success in mobile devices. Only a handful of smartphones have used an Intel chip. Intel was caught out by the rise of smartphones and didn't have a suitable processor design ready when manufacturers started to source CPUs. They turned to companies such as ARM which was touting low-power, high-efficiency designs far more suited to products requiring an all-day battery life. Since then, Intel's technology has progressed considerably. Its ARM-rivalling Atom chips are a competent offering with considerable performance and efficiency. However, it came too late to the game and has never attracted significant manufacturer or developer attention. Its chips use a different architecture to ARM's ones and a lot of Android was never optimised for Intel's platform, due to a lack of demand. If Intel returns to mobile processors, it will need a more compelling product than its recent generations of Atom chips. It could run into the same problems as before though, creating an architecture but failing to convince phone manufacturers to use it. An alternative would be to license a design from ARM, creating a processor that's based on the same underlying structure as the CPUs already in Android and iOS phones and tablets. That could be an uncomfortable partnership for Intel but one that would at least give it a foothold in the mobile industry. Renduchintala also touched on Intel's other new frontiers of development. The company is moving away from desktop processors towards opportunities such as self-driving cars and the Internet of Things. Renduchintala said autonomous urban transportation is probably "about a decade away." Intel is aiming to build a mainstream computing system "that dwarfs anything that exists in a car today" to power these new vehicles.

Coreboot Is Being Ported To A New Intel Skylake-Y System Written by Michael Larabel in Coreboot on 20 September 2016 at 12:12 PM EDT. 16 Comments Those wishing to use Coreboot on a modern Intel system (albeit with the closed-source FSP) will soon have another option to consider with an open-source, physically secure computer powered by a Skylake-Y SoC moving ahead with a port to Coreboot. Coreboot is being ported to the ORWL. ORWL is the "first open-source, physically secure computer" that is currently being crowd-funded on CrowdSupply. The ORWL has already raised $30k of its $25k USD goal with 16 days remaining. The ORWL will be powered by an Intel Skylake M3 or M7 SoC, Intel 515 graphics, and various storage options and other configurations. Ubuntu and Windows 10 are among the supported systems. What makes the ORWL physically secure is having a Cortex-M3 powered secure micro-controller built onto the motherboard, a secure key via NFC is also needed for booting, and any physical tampering with the unit will cause the auto-encrypted SSD to be erased. An active clamshell mesh around the computer ensures that the computer cannot be physically opened. The ORWL is planned to be open-source down to all schematics plus the relevant controller and key fob firmwares, etc. Those wishing to learn more about the ORWL can find the details via this Crowd Supply page. Pricing on this "secure" computer starts out at $699 USD. What's new to report on now is that ORWL/Design-Shift is moving forward and financing their Coreboot port for this system -- unlike some other vendors that just hope the community does the port, etc. ORWL has made public their statement of work with Eltan B.V. for ensuring Coreboot can power this system and it will work with both Linux and Windows operating systems. Those interested can read the SoW. The port will be open-source but like other modern Intel systems will rely upon the closed-source FSP (Firmware Support Package). While the binary blob from Intel is a disappointment, at least Coreboot will be running on another modern system. 16 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Electronic Arts and DICE have unleashed those details, and unsurprisingly, you’ll need a relatively beefy PC to run Battlefield 1 as it is intended. You’ll want at least a GeForce GTX 660 2GB or a Radeon HD 7850 2GB working in tandem with either an Intel Core i5 6600K or an AMD FX-6350. While those are pretty affordable specifications, keep in mind those are the lowest-tier CPUs and GPUs that will run Battlefield 1. Regardless of what kind of setup you’re running, you’ll need 50GB of free space and 8GB of RAM, though to get the most out of Battlefield 1, 16GB of RAM will be required. Here are the full minimum and recommended system specifications: Minimum Specifications OS: 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Processor (AMD): AMD FX-6350 Processor (Intel): Intel Core i5 6600K Memory: 8GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB Graphics card (NVIDIA): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 2GB DirectX: 11.0 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Hard-drive space: 50GB Recommended Specifications OS: 64-bit Windows 10 or later Processor (AMD): AMD FX 8350 Wraith Processor (Intel): Intel Core i7 4790 or equivalent Memory: 16GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon RX 480 4GB Graphics card (NVIDIA): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB DirectX: 11.1 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Hard-drive space: 50GB Battlefield 1 ended up being the largest beta in EA’s history, showing that players are definitely interested in this new World War 1 shooter. Electronic Arts also recently detailed the Season Pass for Battlefield 1, and it looks like players will have to plop down quite a bit of cash to get the full experience. Battlefield 1 is due out on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC on October 21.

Guy Erez and Reuters Sep 20, 2016 4:59 PM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon Customers checking out the new Apple iPhone 7 at the Apple Store at the Grove in Los Angeles on Friday, Sept. 16, 2016. Richard Vogel/AP Analysts smile on Ceva after record Q4 results Ceva may be only Israeli company involved in producing iPhone Is Ceva inside? It will have to buy an iPhone to find out Like every new iPhone launch, Apple's release of the iPhone 7 created a worldwide buzz. After its release, experts physically dissemble the device, known as a "teardown" to discover which components the company used to create its latest flagship product. A big winner of these teardowns was Israeli firm Ceva, which licenses its designs to chipmakers such as Intel and Samsung, which in turn embed its digital signal processors within their chip sets, reducing the time and cost it takes them to bring products to market. The teardowns showed that for the first time Intel's thin modem, which uses Ceva's design, is in some versions of Apple's new smartphone. For the last several years Intel's competitor Qualcomm dominated the market for these chips. Ceva has not commented what royalties it expects for the sale of each iPhone, but industry observers value them at 9 cents per device. The good news for the company, which last had its products in Intel's chip sets five years ago in the iPhone 3 and iPhone 4, continued Monday when Canaccord Genuity raised its price target for Ceva from $38 per share to $40 per share. Its stock price on Nasdaq jumped 10.3% to a record $34.99 on turnover of $571,000, four times its average daily turnover, in wake of the news. The investment firm, as well as Benchmark, which kept its price target at $36, and Wunderlich all rated Ceva a buy. Concord analysts also raised their profit projections for Ceva, stating in their recommendation that they expect company royalties to continue to pour in during 2017 and beyond. Revenue for the company grew 28% to $17 million in the second quarter of 2016. The company was valued at $733 million following the  surge in its stock price.

By: Anthony Garreffa | HT & Movies News | Posted: Sep 20, 2016 2:46 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Begin rant: I'm sitting in front of my computer looking at the price of the Xbox One S console, as I'm about to buy my first console since the PS3. I never owned an Xbox 360, Xbox One or PS4, but the new Xbox One S has me convinced. I'm moving back to consoles for a very big thing: 4K Blu-ray, which doesn't exist on the PC right now - the mightiest platform of them all.     Seriously, it doesn't make sense.   Years later, I went to a PC store in my state and purchased a Pioneer DVDROM with an MPEG2 decoder card, and getting The Matrix on DVD right after. That night, I launched into the next generation of entertainment, with my PC at the center of it. The quality was on another level, but having my PC power by DVD drive was really something else for entertainment at my desk.   Fast forward to 2016, in a world of incredibly powerful smartphones, high-res/refresh rate displays, massively fast graphics cards, SSDs and CPUs - 4K Blu-ray is completely dead on the PC. What. The. Hell.   Intel pushes its next-gen Kaby Lake processors for 4K video, except there's no 4K Blu-ray support on PC right now. Our resident CPU lord Steven Bassiri talked about 4K video being very important for Intel in his overview of the Kaby Lake architecture. In the article, Steven said that Intel briefed him Kaby Lake, and that their new processor is in some ways a response to the "growing number of 4K capture devices". Steven added:"Most people know that the very popular GoPro cameras capture in 4K, but now with improvements to Intel's integrated graphics, working with them on-the-go should be much easier".     We can see in Intel's slide on Kaby Lake and the new media engine is built upon a Gen9 graphics architecture, and look to the left - 'input' with 4K HEVC 10-bit support, as well as the VP9 codec. Intel notes you'll have "improved media experiences with HEVC 10-bit, VP9".   Intel isn't the only company parading around that 4K is super important, futureproofing their products - except there's no 4K Blu-ray support, guys. NVIDIA and AMD are also pushing 4K, but it's more for the gamers - and not so much for 4K media playback. NVIDIA is definitely more pro-4K in the media side of things, with their awesome Shield TV device powering 4K content with providers like Netflix and YouTube.   But the question remains: where the hell is 4K Blu-ray on the PC? What's stopping the likes of Sony, Panasonic and Samsung making 4K Blu-ray drives for the PC?   Even smaller external USB 3.0-powered drives that could plug into laptops, too?   Nowhere. I demand answers, people. Recommended for You Star Wars: Episode 9 to be shot in 65mm, primed for... 'The Get Down' costs Netflix $16 million per episode...

The nation's second-largest telecom company said Monday it has demonstrated IoST services over its long-term evolution (LTE) mobile network, based on Intel's narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) technology. Besides Intel, KT has teamed up with Nokia, Kolon Industry and Daejeon Metropolitan City for the world's first IoST demonstration. "Through the world's first NB-IoT demonstration, we confirmed both the technological and business value of the new services," said Kim Hyoung-wook, executive vice president of the KT Platform Service Planning Office, in a statement. "We will expedite establishment of a nationwide NB-IoT network and push for partnerships with more than 500 enterprises under the GiGA IoT Alliance, aiming at taking the lead in the expansion of the IoST service market." KT said it is working with Kolon Sport, the outdoor apparel brand of Kolon Industry, to develop what it calls the IoT Safety Jacket. The jacket embeds Intel's NB-IoT communication module and sensors that detect unnatural movements of a user in distress and automatically transmit signals to rescuers even in remote areas with poor network infrastructure. It also has LEDs and acoustic sensors to help rescuers find the location of the missing person. KT also demonstrated a prototype IoT Smart Tent that can detect fire in or around the tent to automatically alert people inside. NB-IoT is one of the standard telecommunication technologies for IoT devices and services. It operates in the narrow bandwidth of 200 kHz and covers a wide area reaching more than 10 kilometers under low transmission speed. NB-IoT has been increasingly adopted for IoST in particular, as devices based on this technology consume less energy and cost less. KT worked with Nokia last month to demonstrate equipment synchronization of base stations and NB-IoT core networks. The latest demonstration of Intel's NB-IoT module and Kolon's outdoor activity products is expected to help KT provide diverse IoT services through its LTE network. "The demonstration is a very important achievement under the IoT partnership with KT," said Andrew Cope, head of Nokia's business in Korea. "Through partnerships, we will prove that the NB-IoT technology will realize diverse IoT services and public safety." Meanwhile, KT said it is also planning to cooperate with Daejeon Metropolitan City for public IoT services based on NB-IoT technology. "Daejeon will work with KT on NB-IoT to expand urban IoT services to smart city and environmental projects," an official at Daejeon Metropolitan City said. yoonsw@ktimes.com 1.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson By Tova Cohen | TEL AVIV TEL AVIV Shares in Israel's Ceva Inc hit a record high after firms specializing in dissecting and analyzing electronic devices revealed its chip technology is used in Apple Inc's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus phones. Ceva licenses its designs to chipmakers such as Intel and Samsung, who embed its digital signal processors within their chip sets, reducing the time and cost it takes them to bring products to market. These "teardowns", as they are known in the electronics industry, showed that for the first time Intel's thin modem, which uses Ceva's design, is in some versions of Apple's new smartphone. For the last several years Intel's competitor Qualcomm dominated the market for these chips. "Since 2012 our numbers were down because of Qualcomm," Ceva Chief Financial Officer Yaniv Arieli told Reuters on Tuesday. "This year that's changing and our customers are successful in launching their own LTE chips," he added, referring to the chips used in 4G mobile communications. Ceva's Nasdaq-traded shares jumped 10.3 percent to a record $34.99 on Monday in more than four times its daily average volume. Analysts raised their forecasts for the company, citing the teardowns, which can be found on the websites www.chipworks.com and www.ifixit.com. "We view Ceva as one of the main beneficiaries from the launch of the iPhone 7/7+," said Benchmark analyst Gary Mobley. He estimated that Intel and Qualcomm may equally split the thin modem supply for the iPhone, which could boost Ceva's adjusted earnings per share in 2017 by as much as 25 cents. Analysts on average forecast Ceva will earn 84 cents a share in 2016. Canaccord raised its price target for Ceva to $40 from $38 and its adjusted earnings per share estimate to $1.11 from $1.05. Ceva estimates its designs will be included in almost 200 million LTE phones in 2016 and is targeting 400-500 million phones annually within three years. Arieli said this was not just from high-end Apple and Samsung phones but from emerging economies where smartphones costing under $100 are more popular.

The European Court of Justice confirmed on Thursday the 1.4 billion dollars fine that the European Commission imposed on Intel after an antitrust investigation. In 2009, former EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes accused Intel of abusing its market position on CPU’s. After the EU’s top court ruling on Thursday, Almunia said that the decision in the Intel case “is extremely important”.  “The fact that the Court of Justice confirms all our decisions, from the penalty to all our objections to an anti-competitive behavior is something extremely important even more in the IT sector, the new digital economy, which is moving so fast and needs clear criteria, not only in our own decisions but also with the ones that comes from the law. It is a success of the European Commission, particularly of my predecessor Commissionaire Neelie Kroes, it is a success of the Directorate General of Competition, and it is a success for all the users that will find they can obtain computers and important parts of them at the lowest possible price, they will have a bigger choice, and with the guarantee that the European Commission is always supervising the good behavior of the markets.” Almunia added.  Print Related Tags Topics EU antitrust European Court of Justice fine Intel People Joaquín Almunia Sections Competition Digital Efficacité et Transparence des Acteurs Européens 1999-2016.

Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict Dell's refreshed XPS 13 is immaculately crafted, sports a sharp QHD+ touchscreen, Intel 7th Generation processors and a rose gold color...but opting for the premium color scheme is going to cost you. For New Intel Kaby Lake processors Svelte, sexy 11-inch form factor Ultrasharp QuadHD+ screen Against Rose gold price hike non-upgradable GPU Dell's taken a page from Apple's playbook with this year's XPS 13 model – now offering its powerful 13-inch Ultrabook in gorgeous rose gold. Sure, some might still consider the XPS series a cheap shot on Apple's MacBook Air, but this is a laptop even the team in Cupertino could learn a few lessons from. Take, for instance, the InfinityEdge Display that almost entirely eliminates the bezel, or the UltraSharp QuadHD+ screen with a stunning 3200 x 1800 resolution, just two of the many smart design decisions Dell continues to offer on this year's line-up. Oh, and Dell's got its own version of "one more thing" – the 2016 XPS 13 models are packing heat under the hood: a full range of Kaby Lake Intel processors. If this isn't the MacBook killer, I don't know what is. Design If the XPS 15 series is a butcher's knife – all business and cuts straight to the chase – the XPS 13 is the butterfly knife; it's slimmer and sleeker, but no less effective in the right hands. The non-touch version of the XPS 13 measures in at 0.33 x 11.98 x 7.8 inches (9 x 304 x 200mm; H x W x D), while the touch version comes in at a slightly larger 0.6 x 11.98 x 7.8 inches (15 x 304 x 200mm; H x W x D). At half an inch thick, the XPS 13 is in the running for the smallest laptop on the market. Smallest, but not slimmest. The HP Spectre holds that honor with its skeleton-thin 10.4mm-thick screen. But even if it doesn't quite claim the top spot, this year's model is as thin and light as it's ever been. Weight-wise, the XPS 13 is a totable 2.7 pounds (1.2kg). It's something you could toss in a bag between classes or take with you on your next business trip and barely notice it's there. (That said, it's probably for the best if you cover your new investment with a case just to be safe.) The screen itself is Dell's new InfinityEdge Display. Images go nearly to the edge of the screen with only a thin strip of plastic separating the glass from the edge. The distance separating the two, for the record, is a measly 5.2mm. The XPS 13 can be outfitted with an UltraSharp QuadHD+ screen with a brilliant 3,200 x 1,800 resolution, capable of displaying 2.5 times the number of pixels than a Full HD display. It's all shown on a 400 nit screen, making it as bright as the average LCD LED TV. But, if touch isn't your thing, there's also a standard FHD (1920 x 1080) InfinityEdge display as well. Looking at inputs, Dell's definitely taken to Apple's minimalist approach. All said, there are only two USB 3.0 ports, an SD card reader, a headphone jack, a lock slot and one USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port. If that port configuration sounds familiar, it's because it's almost identical to the inputs available on this year's MacBook Air, with the only exception being that the Dell XPS uses Thunderbolt 3 for faster 10GB/s file transfers. Then there's the fully backlit keyboard surrounded by a carbon fiber palm rest and precision touchpad. The keys felt comfortably spaced and the pad spacious enough to poke, pull and prod without feeling cramped – something that can be a real problem on 13-inch laptops working with limited real estate. Last up is the HD webcam that Dell snuck into the lower righthand corner of the XPS 13's display. It's strange placement to be sure and seems, to an outsider, like it was the sacrifice the team made in order to keep the bezel as trim as possible along the top of the screen. Performance and specs The exterior is nice, but there's no correlation between a carbon fiber palm rest and how well programs like Photoshop and Adobe Premier are going to run. Thankfully, to run those programs as smoothly as possible, the XPS 13 rocks Intel's 7th Generation Kaby Lake Core processors – the Intel Core i3-7100U processor that has a 3M Cache, up to 2.4 GHz; Intel Core i5-7200U processor with a 3M Cache, up to 3.1 GHz and Intel Core i7-7500U processor with a 4M Cache, up to 3.5 GHz. It's a decent assortment that should appease both the web surfing, word processing crowd and the power users alike. Memory options include 4GB, 8GB and 16GB Dual Channel LPDDR3 SDRAM running at 1866MHz, while on the storage side of things you can pick from a 128GB, 256GB, 512GB or 1TB PCIe SSD. (Can't decide how to build out your machine? It depends what your needs are, but 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD should see you through the next three or four years just fine.) Let's talk graphics for a second. Here's where the Dell XPS 13 could run into a problem. If you're looking to do anything more than light gaming on the XPS 13, you might have to look somewhere else – while Kaby Lake promises a number of advantages, the on-board Intel HD Graphics 620 GPU probably isn't going to hold a candle compared to a proper dedicated Nvidia mobile GPU. That said, every app I saw running on Windows 10 looked gorgeous on the QHD+ display. While most versions of the XPS 13 will ship with Windows 10, Dell also offers a developer edition of the series that trades out Microsoft's operating system for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and shaves $50 off the sticker price – a good deal if you're, say, a computer science student looking to cut some costs or working at a startup that's short on cash. The last stop on our tour of the specs sheet is the new Killer 1535 Wireless-AC 2x2 network card that supports Bluetooth 4.1 that offers two external 5GHz signal amplifiers to improve your performance at longer distances and boosts speeds to 867mbps. So all these components and 400 nit screen must mean that the XPS 13 has a shortened battery life, right? Wrong. Dell says that you can expect up to 22 hours from the 2016 models with the FHD screen or around 13 hours from a single charge on the QHD+ panel, thanks in no small part to the new processors and reduced physical space. Worth its weight in (rose) gold? Until now, I've carefully avoided talking about price. That's not done in an attempt to disguise the final cost of the machine, but more importantly I wanted to give myself enough space to talk about its value-to-dollar ratio. The silver edition of the XPS 13 starts at $799 (about £610, AU$1,060) for the base configuration out there. But to get the rose gold model you'll have to shell out at least $1,149 (about £880, AU$1,520). The rose gold version does have a few upgrades on top of the gilded exterior, but the price of admission is still higher than most Ultrabooks. Colors are nice, but is rose gold really worth an extra $350? We can't be that addicted to this whole rose gold fad. Can we? For $799 the price is right. The XPS 13 is a well-oiled, well-spec'd machine that emphasizes processor power for the most frequent tasks like web browsing. Loaded up with the right components, the XPS 13 is a workhorse that could theoretically last the next few years without suffering any massive slowdown – though I'll need to put it through its paces before I can make that call with any authority. Early verdict The Dell XPS 13 squeezes a 13-inch laptop – packed to the gills with the latest Kaby Lake hardware and stunning QuadHD+ display – into an 11-inch form factor. It's a feat of engineering and worthy of all the praise we've given it these last few years. To that end, this year's models are just as svelte as their predecessors but they have the added bonus of extra processing power and a beautiful – if somewhat overpriced – rose gold exterior. The Dell XPS 13 with Intel 7th Generation Processors goes on sale October 4 and starts at $799 for the silver version, $1,149 for the rose gold version and $949 for the developer edition that ships with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Scythe Byakko slices into compact dimensions by Wayne Manion  2:40 PM on September 21, 2016 Japanese PC cooling specialist Scythe has announced a new compact tower-style CPU cooler called Byakko, a word that translates to White Tiger. The Byakko HSF packs a trio of 6-mm heatpipes and a 92mm fan into an overall height of merely 130mm (5.12" for Americans). The base of the heatsink assembly is constructed from nickel-plated copper, and the heatpipes are curved assymetrically to allow additional clearance for installed DIMMs. The Byakko is equipped with a single Scythe Slip Stream 92mm sleeve bearing fan, which has an operating range of 300 to 2300 RPM and can generate airflow of 46.6 CFM and 18.9 Pa of static pressure. The heatsink has grooves for fan mounting on either side, so users requiring a push-pull fan configuration simply need to acquire a second fan and mounting clip. On the Intel side, Scythe's product page lists compatibility with desktop sockets from LGA775 up to LGA1151. The old LGA1366 socket is also supported, but owners with newer Intel high-end desktop platforms must look elsewhere, as Intel's giant LGA2011 socket is not present on the support list. The Byakko uses the same pushpin-based mounting as the Intel stock coolers. All AMD AM2, AM3, and FM socket variants are supported. AMD's new unified AM4 socket is rumored to retain compatibility with existing CPU coolers, so AM4 may be added to the support list at a later date. Mounting to AMD-based motherboards is achieved via the familiar clip mechanism. The Scythe Byakko is available immediately in Europe for 20.5€ + VAT, which works out to roughly $23.

OpenGL ES 3.2 Officially Enabled For Intel Mesa Driver, Limited To Skylake+ Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 21 September 2016 at 02:18 PM EDT. 12 Comments Intel's Mesa driver has supported all of the extensions required by the OpenGL ES 3.2 specification, but only today is the support being officially advertised. Today's commit by Kenneth Graunke of Intel explains, "It's already advertised because the version.c extension checks are fulfilled, but we didn't actually claim support, so trying to create a ES 3.2 context would fail. It's all done, and the CTS results look good, so let's turn it on." In part due to needing ASTC texture compression, OpenGL ES 3.2 is only turned on for "Gen 9" Skylake graphics hardware and newer. 12 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

They are also willing to quit their jobs if they view the technology provided by their employer as substandard Dell and Intel’s Future Workforce Study, has shown results that almost half of employees in Europe and South African regions believe their current employer is not effectively making use of the latest technology advances. Dell unveiled the European and South African findings of the 2016 Future Workforce Study, conducted by research firm PSB, polled nearly 4,000 full-time employees from small, medium and large businesses in 10 countries. Of those polled in the UK, Germany, France and South Africa, many do not believe that they will be working in a smart office within the next five years and perceived their current workplace technology as lagging behind personal devices on innovation. With the research showing that the influx of new technology is having a significant impact on what workers expect from their employer, workplaces which don’t enact these new advances may be left behind. Technology has already had a huge impact on how we interact in the workplace, with, many employees – most notably a staggering 67% of millennials in South Africa – believing that face-to-face meetings will become obsolete. Innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual reality (VR), could also become vital to the workplace of the near future, affecting how we collaborate and work more efficiently. “Today’s workforce has a growing expectation that their employers integrate the latest technologies seamlessly and securely into their working lives,” said Chris Buchanan, Client Solutions Director, Dell South Africa. “Employees have seen first-hand the ways new technologies can help them do their jobs better, and are hungry to use the latest advancements to be more productive. While this may seem daunting to many employers, it’s a business-critical opportunity for companies to be at the forefront of the future workplace and enable the future workforce.” Study highlights: · Regional results show that employees, especially in South Africa (67%) and the UK (47%), feel their office technology is not smart enough (compared to 44% of employees worldwide). While workers are ready for businesses to implement the latest technologies to make their offices smarter, with data used to control office temperature, lighting, etc., expectations are mixed on whether it will happen within the next five years. · Despite the attraction of new technologies, people still prefer in-person workspace communications, though they fear this will soon be a thing of the past. 61% of South Africans agree that the growing popularity of remote working, together with improved technology, will lead to face-to-face interactions becoming obsolete. · Remote working is increasingly viewed as providing both quality of life and productivity benefits, and technology is seen as an essential enabler.66% of South Africans who work remotely compared to 50% who work in offices say their job is a core part of their identity. Technology has allowed people to change their lifestyles and, in turn, this has affected their work styles and preferences. With these changes, employers should think about offering more flexible work arrangements to keep up with this evolution to cater to the mobile worker. Employees are also aware that the advances that allow these new working arrangements to exist will require new security and infrastructure; European and South African respondents list advanced security protection as the single most important technology to be implemented in their workplace. · Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) innovations could impact the workplace sooner than we think as 61% of employees in South Africa would be willing to use VR/AR in their professional lives. The most frequently cited user cases for the new technologies include training on new skills in realistic virtual environments (25%), problem solving or coming up with new ideas through 3D visualisation (18%) and presenting to clients using immersive technologies (15%). Additionally, over half of employees in South Africa (52%) believe that the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) will make their jobs easier. · When it comes to acquiring and retaining talent, technology matters, especially for millennials in South Africa with 1 in 3 willing to quit their jobs if the technology provided by their employer is substandard. Millennials in South Africa (up to 39% in South Africa) also say that a new job’s available technology would affect their decision on whether to take or decline the position. · South Africans recognise and are attracted to the entrepreneurial spirit of the sharing economy. 76% of South Africans will participate in the sharing economy by next year.   Staff Writer 2016 Future Workforce Studydellintel Comments are closed. « Google Allo takes chat to the next level Lagos real estate startup closes $1.2 million funding deal » Search Tags Africa Airtel apple BlackBerry Broadband cloud computing Egypt facebook Gadgets and Gaming Ghana Google Huawei ict ict news internet IT News IT News Africa IT Security kenya Microsoft Mobile Mobile and Telecoms MTN news Nigeria Nokia Opinion Safaricom samsung SAP Security Software South Africa tech news technology technology news Telecom telecom news telecoms Telkom Uganda vodacom west africa Zain zimbabwe News Alerts Sign up for our FREE News Alerts       Like us In the news Forex Rates Latest Headlines South Africa: Vega offers a new degree course in gaming November 17, 2016 Dell Rose Gold with Intel 7th GEN processor now in SA November 17, 2016 What Microsoft’s HoloLens means for the future of Augmented Reality November 17, 2016 #datafalls as Vox crashes cost of its Fat Pipe DSL packages November 17, 2016 Huawei wins 2 awards at AfricaCom 2016 November 17, 2016 Wipro launches Open Banking API platform November 17, 2016   UPCOMING EVENTS   Principles of IT Leadership | 23 & 24 November 2016, Jhb     Selling to the CIO | 15 & 16 February 2017, Jhb Company Press Offices Press Offices Alcatel Lucent Condyn ContinuitySA Eset Fujitsu Huawei Interactive Intelligence MCI MTN OutSystems Resolve SAP Tom TomUSAASA Veeam MOST POPULAR TWITTER Twitter Tweets by @ITNewsAfrica Photos on flickr SAP Africa announces new appointments November 10, 2016 Microsoft appoints new GM for WECA region November 9, 2016 Future-proof your business – or risk becoming irrelevant November 8, 2016 Bytes Managed Solutions appoints new Operations Executive October 28, 2016 Yahsat appoints Farhad Khan as new CCO October 26, 2016 Ugandan appointed DG of International Telecommunications Satellite Organization October 18, 2016 GetBucks snaps up former Barclays digital chief September 21, 2016 Deloitte Digital appoints new Digital Transformation Practice Leader September 19, 2016 GBI appoints two Vice Presidents – Sales August 30, 2016 Nikki Popoola joins WIOCC as Sales Director August 30, 2016 Newsletter Would you like to receive the latest African technology news and analysis delivered to your e-mail inbox every morning?

Call options volume was three times higher than the put options volume on Tuesday and there was a one large trade that caught Nathan's attention. When the stock was trading at $37.15, a trader bought 50,000 contracts of the November 41 calls for $0.16. The trade breaks even at $41.16 or 10.82 percent higher from the current stock price. Nathan explained that the November 41 call is far out of the money, with a delta of 11. He thinks the trader is probably looking at Intel's Q3 earnings results and he or she may be levering up an existing long position.

Price $6899 AUD > Pricing info Specs Quad-core 2.8GHz Intel Xeon E3-1505M v5 • 32GB RAM • Intel HD P530/Nvidia Quadro M1000M graphics • 512GB NVMe SSD • 15.6in 3,840 x 2,160 IPS display • 802.11ac Wi-Fi (2 x 2 MIMO antenna) • Bluetooth 4 • 720p webcam • 3 x USB 3 • 2 x Thunderbolt 3/USB Type-C • HDMI 1.4 • SD slot • 64Whr Li-ion battery • Windows 10 Pro • 3yr RTB warranty • 375 x 255 x 18mm (WDH) • 2.1kg Tweet Email this Print this Feedback The iron fist of a workstation clad in a velvet glove of stylish design. T his is a 15in laptop with serious poke. Just take a look at the specs and try not to whimper with excitement: a 2.8GHz quad-core mobile Xeon processor with Hyper-Threading, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB PCI Express-based NVMe SSD, and Nvidia Quadro M1000M graphics driving a 15.6in, 3,840 x 2,160 HP DreamColor display.  Given such a specification, you might forgive HP for neglecting design. Thankfully, the ZBook is as tempting in the flesh as its specs are in black and white. From its dimpled, aluminium-clad lid to its glass-topped touchpad and gleaming chamfered edges, this laptop is a joy to behold. It’s comfortable to use, too. The keyboard is flanked by Bang & Olufsen stereo speakers, and has a key action that’s light to the touch and has just the right amount of travel and feedback. The smooth, frosted-finish touchpad is large and responsive, and while I’m not generally a fan of integrated buttons, these ones work well with a solid, positive click.  The most impressive design achievement, however, is how much power HP squeezes into so little space. The HP ZBook Studio G3 is closer in weight and slenderness to an Ultrabook than to your average lumpen workstation. You still won’t want to lug it around all day – it weighs 2.1kg – but compared with most laptops in its class, it’s positively limber. Moreover, at 21mm thick it’s surprisingly slender. It doesn’t quite match the 17mm Dell XPS 15, but it’s not far away. Despite its compact size, you’ll find plenty of ports and sockets arranged around the edges. On the left sit a Gigabit Ethernet connector, two USB 3 ports and an SD card slot. On the right are two Thunderbolt 3/USB Type-C ports, plus an HDMI output, another USB 3 port and a 3.5mm audio jack. Wireless connectivity, meanwhile, stretches to 2x2 stream 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4. Power on The exterior is all very lovely then, but the true appeal of the ZBook lies beneath its aluminium shell. The beating heart of this beast is its mobile Xeon processor – this is the first time we’ve seen one in the wild. Before you get too excited, it’s important to realise that this isn’t a true Xeon to match the ones you’ll find in desktop workstations. Instead, it’s a beefed-up version of Intel’s consumer-grade Skylake chips. In our review sample we have a 14nm quad-core, Hyper-Threaded 2.8GHz Xeon E3-1505M v5 that will Turbo Boost up to a maximum frequency of 3.7GHz. HP has also packed in a dual graphics setup encompassing Intel’s integrated HD Graphics P530 and Nvidia’s Quadro M1000M for heavy-duty CAD/CAM and industrial design work. Performance-wise, this is quite the package. In our laptop benchmarks, which run a series of heavy-duty image-conversion, 4K video-encoding and multitasking tests, the ZBook achieved a score of 120, meaning it steals the title of “fastest laptop we’ve ever seen” from the Dell XPS 15 with its score of 111. Even more importantly for a machine that’s likely to be dealing with heavy-duty apps and big files, the storage subsystem is super-quick. HP has endowed the ZBook with one of its Z Turbo drives – a PCI Express-based NVMe drive with a 512GB capacity and speeds fast enough to embarrass many a desktop drive. Tested with CrystalDiskMark, it hit sequential read and write speeds in excess of 2GB/sec and 1.5GB/sec respectively, which is nothing short of astonishing. Whether you’re launching apps, loading large video files into your timeline or rendering big video projects straight to disk, this laptop will keep up – and then some. With such high-end hardware on board, you might expect battery life to suffer; and so it does, but perhaps not as badly you might think. In our looping video-playback test, in which we calibrate the screen to a brightness of 170cd/m2 and put the laptop in flight mode, the ZBook Studio G3 lasted 5hrs 25mins. That should be enough to deliver around half a day of light duties. Bear in mind, though, that as soon as you start pushing the processor, the battery life will drop significantly. And with this much power on offer, it’s quite easy to get carried away. Sound and vision HP hasn’t ignored the screen. It’s a wide-gamut, non-touchscreen, high-DPI display with a matte finish. At first glance it looks sharp, colourful and punchy in all the right ways. Under the beady eye of our X-Rite colorimeter, the contrast ratio hit a high 1,212:1, which ensures punchy images and an inky black level. I was also suitably pleased by the panel’s sRGB coverage of 99.2%. However, colour accuracy isn’t up to same level, with an average Delta E figure of 2.96 seeing it fall behind its main rival, the Dell XPS 15’s (1.48), by quite a long way. Meanwhile, maximum brightness reaches only 259cd/m2, which is some way short of the Dell XPS 15’s 363cd/m2. As long as you don’t venture outdoors with it, though, that shouldn’t prove too much of a problem. I was considerably less taken with the speakers. Although Bang & Olufsen-branded, they’re nothing special. They’re clear and deliver music with plenty of atmosphere, but there isn’t much warmth or body to the sound, and precious little bass. High price... but worth it The HP ZBook Studio G3 is a beast of a 15in laptop, and has a price to match. Our review sample costs an eye-watering $6,899. While it’s possible to cut down the price, this is still a top dollar machine, which is reflected in the specifications. For that you’re getting a hugely impressive machine that’s ISV-certified and ready for serious work. The monstrous specification of our test system delivers faster performance than any other laptop we’ve put through our benchmarks, and it’s all squeezed into a chassis that’s slimmer and lighter than you have any right to expect. Is it worth the money? If you need a portable ISV-certified notebook, then certainly. No workstation laptop we’ve tested combines a chassis this slim and light with performance this fast. It stands at the pinnacle of workstation laptop design, with only the Dell Precision M3800 for (distant) company, a 3.2kg workstation laptop that can currently only be specified with a Haswell Intel Core i7. I know which I’d choose.  Related Reviews Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Review: Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 delivers quality over battery Review: Dell's XPS 15 is on the best Windows 10 laptops we've seen Review: HP EliteBook Folio G1 - great looks, terrible battery life Review: Dell Latitude 13 7370 Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  dell xps  |  hp zbook studio g3  |  laptop  |  review  |  workstation  |  xeon processor   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   Gallery: The PCs of PAX Australia 2016     How should we teach our kids to use digital media?     Report identifies path from online gaming to cyber-criminality     How inkjet cartridges are made     New screens and art from Dark Souls 3   NOTE: You must be a registered member of PC & Tech Authority to post a comment.

Although it utilizes the most optimized version of the Frostbite game engine to date, you’ll still need a reasonably stout machine to play Battlefield 1 as the developers intended. Minimum hardware specifications are as follows: OS: 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Processor (AMD): AMD FX-6350 Processor (Intel): Core i5 6600K Memory: 8GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon™ HD 7850 2GB Graphics card (NVIDIA): nVidia GeForce® GTX 660 2GB DirectX: 11.0 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Hard-drive space: 50GB The recommended hardware, naturally, will need to be a bit more powerful: OS: 64-bit Windows 10 or later Processor (AMD): AMD FX 8350 Wraith Processor (Intel): Intel Core i7 4790 or equivalent Memory: 16GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon™ RX 480 4GB Graphics card (NVIDIA): NVIDIA GeForce® GTX 1060 3GB DirectX: 11.1 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Available Disk Space: 50GB In a blog post accompanying the specs reveal, the game’s lead world designer, Daniel Berlin, outlined some of the adjustments and changes being made based on feedback from beta participants. Of note is a change to the Conquest game mode ticket system, balancing of various weapons and vehicles, multiple tweaks to the Rush game mode and more tools to deal with vehicles earlier. Battlefield 1 launches on October 21 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows PC with pricing ranging from $59.99 for the standard edition all the way up to $209.99 for an exclusive Amazon collector’s edition.

(DTSI), FedEx Corporation (FDX), and Tobira Therapeutics Inc (TBRA) Are 3 of Today’s Best Stocks The Fed is on many investors' minds, but these stocks had minds of their own today and that's a good thing. By Todd Shriber, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Sep 20, 2016, 5:34 pm EST     Popular Posts: 3 Income ETFs That Deliver 5%-Plus Yields Recent Posts: 3 Income ETFs That Deliver 5%-Plus Yields Why Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. (BRCD), Davita Inc (DVA) and Moneygram International Inc (MGI) Are 3 of Today’s Best Stocks Why Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI), Dean Foods Co (DF) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL) Are 3 of Today’s Best Stocks View All Posts Investors seemed comfortable with what will come of this week’s Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan meetings, bidding stocks higher Tuesday. Oil rose and Treasury yields fell. Ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting, the S&P 500 added 0.03% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.05%. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.12%. Tuesday’s star stocks included DTS Inc. (NASDAQ:DTSI), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), and Tobira Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:TBRA). DTS Inc. (DTSI) Shares of DTS Inc. surged 23% on more than 25 times the average daily volume after Tessera Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSRA) said it will acquire the company for $850 million in cash. DTSI provides audio technology for mobile devices and automobiles, among other products. Tessera is a technology licensing firm with a presence in the semiconductor industry, among other businesses. “Tessera said it expects the deal to immediately add to its earnings per share and free cash flow,” reports Reuters. DTSI technology is licensed in over 2 billion products, according to Reuters. FedEx Corporation (FDX) Shipping giant FedEx Corporation gained 0.86% on above-average volume after the company said it will hike package shipping rates for 2017. 3 Mid-Caps for Retirement: 1 Stock, 1 ETF and 1 Mutual Fund Rates on FDX’s ground and home delivery services could rise by 4.9%, while the company’s air shipping Express service could see rates go up 3.9%. FDX also plans to boost rates for customers shipping large packages. “Effective 2/6/17 FedEx Express and FedEx Ground fuel surcharges will be adjusted on a weekly basis. Currently, adjustments are made on a monthly basis with a two month lag between the US Government published fuel indexes and the fuel surcharges. Adjusting on a weekly basis will reduce lag time from two months to two weeks, which provides a closer alignment between fuel costs and fuel surcharges at the time of shipment,” according to an Oppenheimer note posted by Barron’s. Tennessee-based FedEx reports earnings after the close of U.S. markets today. Tobira Therapeutics Inc (TBRA) Shares of Tobira Therapeutics Inc surged more than eight-fold on volume that was more than 35 times the daily average after Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) said it will acquire the company for $1.7 billion. That is a massive takeover premium, representing nearly 20 times TBRA’s previous market value. TBRA makes treatments for liver disease, and also focuses on therapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. Allergan’s offer values Tobira at $28.35, or more than six times where the stock closed yesterday. “Tobira holders also will each receive one contingent value right to receive as much as $49.84 per share, linked to certain development and regulatory milestones,” according to the Wall Street Journal. As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

should buy Intel due to strong cloud growth in its data center business, according to Susquehanna, which initiated coverage on the chipmaker with a positive rating. "We view Intel as more than just a PC company, and alternatively as a 'Moore's law' company with its ability to extract value through process leadership and the best wafer manufacturing in the world," analyst Christopher Rolland wrote in a note to clients Monday. "Furthermore, we recognize a large economic transfer from their PC end market to their Data Center Group, driven by explosive cloud, carrier (NFV & SDN) and HPC expansion."

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion MacBook Pro 2016 Latest News, Release Date and Rumors: Apple Laptop to Have Flatter Keyboard and Come with Bluetooth AirPods? Specs and Features By Neal A. Lasta Sep 20, 2016 | 6:51 AM Apple's much-awaited MacBook Pro 2016 is the subject of many rumors to date. The speculations range from specs to release date and so much more. Here are the latest. Specs The specifications of the newly released Apple iPhone 7 may provide hints about what the MacBook Pro might look like or how it may perform from an internal standpoint. Specifically, the iPhone 7 now uses an A10 Fusion processor instead of the Intel processors found in previous iPhones. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit As such, there is a good chance that other upcoming Apple products will use A10 Fusion chips as well, such as the MacBook Pro 2016. On the other hand, A10 Fusion chips may only work well with mobile devices like the iPhone 7, and Intel X86 processors may still be the better choice when it comes to MacBooks. The Apple iPhone 7 design doesn't include a headphone jack, and some ponder on the possibility that the MacBook Pro will botch the jack as well. Along with this, MacBook Pro 2016 users might be introduced to Bluetooth-powered AirPods. The MacBook Pro 2016 will have a flatter keyboard; on top are function keys that are displayed digitally and have the ability to change into different options depending on the application on screen. Other rumored features of the MacBook Pro 2016 include OLED touchscreen panel and Touch ID, a slimmer and lighter body, 13-inch screen, and larger trackpad that showcases Force Touch Technology. The MacBook Pro 2016 will have a USB Type-C port that has a very fast data transfer capabilities thanks to Thunderbolt 3.There will be two kinds as rumored; one that has an 8GB RAM and another that has a 16 GB RAM. Release Date Many people thought the MacBook Pro 2016 will be launched alongside the iPhone 7 last September 16. That never materialized, so the new rumors point to a new release date which falls within the last quarter of this year. However, Apple has not even provided the least bit of details regarding any plans to develop any new laptop. With Apple keeping silent about any release date or any development whatsoever, the MacBook Pro 2016 is far from being a certainty. Mark Gurman of Bloomberg reports that the new MacBook Pro will be released on October. iPad Mini 5 Other recent rumors suggest that the new MacBook Pro release this year will be followed by an iPad Mini 5 release next year. Some of its rumored features include 32 GB of storage, 3D Touch, better chipset, and A9 processor.

Stock Bounces Back After China Concerns Wane (AAPL) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) Recent Posts: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Shares Slump As Sales Miss Estimates (WMT) Here’s Why Target Corporation is Still a Buy (TGT) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) View All Posts Facebook Inc (FB) stock continues to be a Wall Street darling as it received yet another price target increase on Monday. This time it comes from Citigroup Inc (C) analyst Mark May, who believes that the concerns about decelerating ad loads are overblown and that worries about Snapchat taking a bite out of Facebook are unfounded. His price target follows another positive report from Nomura Holdings, Inc. (ADR) (NMR) last week. Meanwhile executives continue to unload shares of Facebook stock as the shares move higher. Facebook Stock Price Target: $158 Citi analyst Mark May increased his price target on Facebook stock by $10 to $158 per share in a report dated September 18. He believes that it “feels like it is still early days” for the social network. However, he adds that over the last few months, investor sentiment has shifted toward the negative end of the spectrum. In order to analyze this shift, he applied his own stress test to the company. Specifically, he looked at the concerns about the potential slowdown in growth of the ad load and the threat Snapchat might pose. May believes that concerns about the impact of the expected deceleration in ad load growth on Facebook’s core ad revenue are overblown. He explained that current forecasts imply an increase of 3% to 4% or 30 basis points on ad load growth in 2017 and 2018, which he views as reasonable. He views the concerns about Snapchat are unfounded based on his analysis of third-party and company-reported data. He noted that the amount of time the average user of the core Facebook platform continues to grow and doesn’t appear to be impacted by Snapchat. The analyst cited Sensor Tower data, which was used by Nomura to prove the same point last week. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google He added that there looks to be an upside basis to consensus because the forecasts imply conservative growth expectations in areas such as ad load and cost per thousand impressions. Further, he doesn’t believe current estimates include any contributions from WhatsApp or Messenger, which are already at scale, or any possible new opportunities like longer-form video or e-commerce and payments. Profit-Taking on FB As analysts continue to push Facebook stock, executives at the social network continue to unload shares. Among those who have sold shares of the company This month are CEO Mark Zuckerberg, General Counsel Colin Stretch, Director Jan Koum and Chief Product Officer Christopher Cox. Zuckerberg has sold more than $300 million worth of Facebook stock over the last month. Why Shopify Inc. Stock Is on the Rise Today Regulatory filings also show that Westwood Management recently sold 600 shares of Facebook stock, although it remains the firm’s largest position at 10% of its portfolio. Also Swedbank AB (ADR) (SWDBY) unloaded about 193,000 shares but still held more than 2.57 million shares. Facebook makes up 2.5% of the firm’s portfolio and is its 15th biggest position. Shares of Facebook edged downward by as much as 0.17% to $128.85 during regular trading hours on Monday but are ahead marginally in Tuesday’s early morning trading.

HP will work with Digital Promise Global, the Global Business Coalition for Education, Microsoft and Intel to establish centers equipped with computer systems and teacher training services to give refugee students access to the latest education technology and provide adults with the opportunity to learn essential business and IT skills. This week, HP also committed to provide technology and HP LIFE training resources to the International Medical Corps Livelihoods Center pilot in Istanbul, Turkey.  As part of this initiative, HP will make online freelance opportunities available to refugees.  In addition, HP agreed to support the opening of two Lynke and Blue Rose Compass tech centers for refugees, also in the Middle East. These centers will provide training and support for refugees in app design and other technical work.  In total, HP is committing more than US$1 million in technology and training support to help refugees, alleviate poverty, and improve the lives of more than 100,000 people in the coming year. “The refugee community is full of untapped potential, but is challenged with growing those talents and skills due to a lack of access to technology and the digital world,” explained Nate Hurst, HP Chief Sustainability and Social Impact Officer. “By opening these new HP Learning Studios and supporting a variety of initiatives, HP is empowering refugees to build a better, more prosperous life through access to quality education and employment opportunities.” HP Learning Studios will be equipped with its latest technologies, including HP Sprout, a fully integrated desktop 3D scanning solution with 3D object capture, editing and multiple streamlined 3D print options, and x360 convertible PCs powered by Windows 10, along with a Dremel 3D Printer.  The core curriculum will be powered by HP LIFE e-Learning courses, which include 25 online modules on essential business and IT skills in seven languages. As part of this effort, HP will support the creation of additional free online courses and curated content specifically designed to help refugees develop the skills and expertise necessary for freelancing and ecommerce.  “We are looking forward to collaborating with HP on this important effort, sharing our expertise to bring innovative, high-quality learning experiences to refugee students,” said Karen Cator, CEO of Digital Promise Global.  This new commitment builds on HP’s ongoing effort to aid in the refugee crisis. In June 2016, HP was among the first 15 private sector companies to join the White House Call to Action. As part of this pledge, HP committed to working with the administration to drive new, measurable and significant commitments that will have a durable impact on refugees.  For more information on HP’s most recent work to aid refugees, including the Global Alliance Institute, Girl’s Truth Seekers Education Project, USAID and UNIDO, please visit the HP Newsroom.

Stock Bounces Back After China Concerns Wane (AAPL) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) Recent Posts: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Shares Slump As Sales Miss Estimates (WMT) Here’s Why Target Corporation is Still a Buy (TGT) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) View All Posts Intel Corporation (INTC) has received a pair of price target increases and a trio of positive earnings reports as its earnings preannouncement last week showed improving trends. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts remain bearish on Intel but raised their price target, while a bullish JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) analyst also raised his price target. Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) also weighed in on the chip maker‘s preannouncement. Intel Surprises with Better-Than-Expected Results Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore and team reiterated their “Underweight” rating but increased their price target for Intel from $31 to $34 per share. They note that the preannouncement on Friday indicated the best sequential growth in nine years but add that channel replenishment was one of the drivers of that growth. As a result, they don’t believe it would be a good idea to buy Intel shares on the strong performance. They explain that the strength is not actually indicative of end demand but rather inventory build across ODMs, OEMs and distributors. They don’t believe the strength will continue into the fourth quarter and thus are expecting a “slight decline.” 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google However, they also said the better than seasonal strength in the third quarter does provide a resolution for their concern about excess inventory on the chip maker’s balance sheet. Intel Revises Guidance Upward On Friday, Intel revised its third quarter guidance upward, with management now expecting September quarter revenue of around $15.6 billion, representing a 15% sequential increase and 8% year over year increase. The new outlook is 5% higher than the previous guidance for $14.9 billion, as Intel replenished its PC supply chain inventory. Intel also increased its outlook for gross margin to 63%, an increase of 100 basis points. It also guided for a $100 million increase in operating expenditures, bringing it to $5.2 billion for the third quarter. In addition to the inventory replenishment, Intel also expects its data center business to post strong results. The Morgan Stanley team said one very important thing to keep check will be just how strong Intel’s data center business was during the third quarter. Although the data center segment didn’t drive the upside to revenue, Intel management has remained confident that double-digit growth would resume in the quarter. JPMorgan Raises Intel Price Target JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur is at the opposite end of the spectrum with an “Overweight” rating on Intel. He raised his target from $42 to $44 per share, citing improving demand trends in laptops, gaming PCs and the U.S. as being an additional driver of the upside in the third quarter (on top of the supply chain refill). How Apple Inc. Ranks As a Top Dow Analyst Pick (AAPL) He is especially bullish on the chip maker’s data center business, as he expects double-digit growth from it with upgrades in 25G networking products driving the growth. He also expects demand among enterprise customers to continue improving and believes Intel will benefit from the refresh of the Broadwell servers. Praise for Intel’s Data Center Business Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer did not adjust his price target, leaving it at $40 while maintaining his “Outperform” rating. Like Sur, he expects strength in Intel’s data center business but added that the chip maker should benefit from its share of Apple’s iPhone 7 modem business, in addition to improving prices for memory and what he views as a “cheap” valuation. Despite the improved outlook, shares of Intel slumped on Monday, declining as much as 1.37% to $37.16.

Northamber almost strikes cheery note, warns profit a year off Intel has hired veteran tech CFO and sometime troubleshooter Bob Swan to take over from long-time numbers supremo Stacy Smith. Swan, or to give him his full press release name, Robert “Bob” H Swan, joins from equity outfit General Atlantic, where he was an operating partner. Stacy Smith, “as previously announced, is taking a broader role within Intel leading manufacturing, sales and operations.” Before his stint at General Atlantic, Swan spent nine years as CFO of eBay. That’s a fairly chunky job, but equally interesting from our point of view was his stint at EDS in the early noughties. Swan joined EDS after the previously solid as a rock firm had issued a shock profit warning after its 2000 $6.9bn Navy Marine Corp Intranet deal unravelled. Swan was brought into steady the ship, after the deal blew a massive hole in the services firm’s finances. Just an example, in Q1 2005, EDS reported that on that contract it made a loss of $57m in the quarter on revenue of $166m, down 27 per cent on the year. In fact, Swan steadied it so well, that after he left in 2006 to take up the CFO job at eBay, the firm was in a reasonable enough state to sell itself to HP for $13.9bn. We’ll just gloss over Swan’s stint as CFO of Webvan, one of the mega disasters of the original dot com boom, and "Bob's" first foray into the world of tech after spending over 20 years learning the ropes at GE. Intel’s financial performance has been slightly erratic over the last couple of years as it deals with the changing shape of the computer, server and mobile industries. It’s nowhere near being the sort of basketcase EDS or Webvan was. But we’re guessing Swan isn’t joining just to keep things ticking over. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Intel mulls sale of Intel Security – reports Opinion The game done changed 6 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

Intel's upcoming Core i7-7700K should rock 8MB of L3 cache, and a 95W TDP, while slotting into the LGA1151 socket.   Kaby Lake will work on some current Z170-based motherboards, while newer Z270-based boards should be launching in the near future. The new Kaby Lake architecture is made on Intel's latest 14nm+ node, which provides up to 12% more performance over the older Skylake architecture made on 14nm.   Intel will have a bunch of Kaby Lake-based CPUs, including: Core i7-7700, Core i7-7700T, Core i5-7600K, Core i5-7600, Core i5-7600T, Core i5-7500, Core i5-7500T, Core i5-7400, and the Core i5-7400T.

Zoia | WardsAuto EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Something happened in the past year to turn autonomous-vehicle development from a science project to full speed ahead, Intel’s Elliot Garbus says. Autonomous vehicles could be $1.3 trillion boost to U.S. economy. Related Media Uber Headed to Detroit U.K. Insurers Outline Autonomous-Vehicle Policies Fields: Mobility, Autonomy Mean Moving on From ‛One Fordʼ Strategy NOVI, MI – What a difference a year makes. That’s the picture drawn by Elliot Garbus, vice president-Internet of Things Solutions Group for Intel, in discussing the quickly shifting landscape of autonomous-vehicle development. “A year ago, I would have had a clear vision of autonomous,” Garbus says in a keynote presentation here at the SAE 2016 Convergence conference and exposition focused on automotive electronics. There were the disruptors, the Silicon Valley startups that were in go-fast mode conducting what Garbus says largely were seen as “science projects” around autonomous-vehicle development. That contrasted with the more measured approach by automakers, which were focused on a step-by-step rollout of advanced systems that slowly would add up to autonomous drive. “But something happened on New Year’s (Day),” the Intel executive says. “And a race began.” Garbus rattles off the number of moves by automakers and others in recent months to step up autonomous-vehicle development and get cars to market faster, including Ford’s push to have vehicles in hail-service fleets by 2021, General Motors’ acquisition of a stake in Lyft and purchase of developer Cruise Automation, Google’s expansion of real-world testing of its driverless technology and Baidu’s (China’s Google competitor) planned entry into the sector. There also is his company’s tie-up with BMW and Mobileye expected to lead to development of an open technology platform for autonomous vehicles, Garbus adds. “So the race is on; (autonomous) is coming.” Look for the technology to surface first in fleets, both for moving passengers and goods, he notes, because autonomous vehicles will need to operate in more controlled environments along well-mapped routes and with regular service intervals. One thing needed is better external communication between the vehicle and the cloud, which will store vital data used in part to update onboard software. Garbus sees automakers moving to 5G cellular service to increase the bandwidth and boost the communication speed. Intel will begin experimenting with 5G in vehicles used at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Korea. “A tremendous amount of computing will be required, so we’ll need the bandwidth,” he says. “This is a critical piece of autonomy.” Autonomous-vehicle technology has the potential to have a $1.3 trillion impact on the U.S. economy in fuel saved, productivity gained and the expected reduction in fatalities and injuries, Garbus says. Car insurance costs are expected to drop up to 80% over the next 10 years, he says. “That (alone is) stunning, and quite an economic incentive.” dzoia@wardsauto.com @DavidZoia Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 20 September 2016 | MYT 2:41 PM Intel hires Robert Swan from General Atlantic as CFO New CFO: Intel Corp named Robert Swan chief financial officer, replacing company veteran Stacy Smith who is moving to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations. — Reuters Intel Corp named Robert Swan chief financial officer, replacing company veteran Stacy Smith who is moving to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations. The world's largest chipmaker said earlier this year that Smith, who has been Intel's chief financial officer for nearly a decade, would shift to a new role. Swan, 56, joins from private equity firm General Atlantic and will oversee global finance and IT organisations, as well as corporate strategy office, Intel said on Sept 19. He will take up his new role, effective Oct 10. Swan, who also served as eBay Inc's chief financial officer, left after the company spun off PayPal Holdings Inc last year. Intel raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years on Sept 16 as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand. The company's shares were unchanged in aftermarket trading on Sept 19. They closed down 1.3% at US$37.16 (RM153.92). — Reuters You May Be Interested Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail SpaceX seeks US approval for Internet-via-satellite network Microsoft offers EU concessions over its US$26bil LinkedIn bid Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Insight - Far from Mosul, Islamic State close to defeat in Libya's Sirte Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toms launches Apple Watch wrist bands US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 White supremacist ad allowed on Twitter, CEO apologises Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

TheMarker, Shelly Appelberg and Uri Tomer 20.09.2016 04:03 Updated: 6:03 AM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon SpaceX CEO Elon Musk poses by the Dragon V2 spacecraft in Hawthorne, California May 29, 2014.Reuters The Israeli behind the wheel of the self­-driving car Mobileye cuts Tesla ties, claiming Musk ‘pushing envelope in terms of safety’ After BMW, Israel's Mobileye poised to seal second self-driving car deal Mobileye shares take hit in public spat with Tesla If share price is any measure, Mobileye is the loser in the caustic debate it has fought with the electric-vehicle maker Tesla about why the two ended collaboration two months ago. Since the Israeli maker of collision-prevention technology sparked the controversy on Wednesday, Mobileye’s share price has fallen 2.8% and was trading early Monday New York time at $42.98. Tesla, meanwhile, has risen 5.6% to $207.12. In a Reuters interview, Mobileye chairman Amnon Shashua contended that Tesla was “pushing the envelope in terms of safety” with its AutoPilot driver-assist system based on Mobileye technology. Tesla fired back that it dropped Mobileye in a commercial dispute. The Los Angeles Times quoted Bill Selesky, research analyst at Argus Research, as saying Shashua’s comments raised questions as to “whether this technology is ready for the public” right now. “Just the fact he came out with something, I think would be a negative for the company and ultimately the stock,” he said. (TheMarker Staff) Ceva rallies after market learns its processors are inside the new iPhone Shares of Israel’s Ceva took off Monday on news that its digital signal processors are being used inside Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+. The reason is that Apple revealed that Intel is now supplying many of the modems for the new device and Ceva is an Intel subcontractor, entitling it to royalties from iPhone sales. The financial website Motley Fool estimated that if Apple ships in the upcoming product cycle120 million to 130 million units, Ceva CEVA could see $5.3 million in royalty revenue, a major addition to its sales last year of $59.5 million. “We view CEVA as one of the main beneficiaries from the launch of the iPhone 7/7+,” said Gary Mobley, an analyst at Benchmark Company over the weekend. Barron’s magazine added, “For investors, aside from buying Apple shares, one of the ways to make money off the trend may be to invest in Ceva.” Ceva shares were up 9.4% at $34.71 midday local time in New York. (TheMarker Staff) TipRanks in collaborative pact with Nasdaq Israel’s TipRanks has launched a cooperative program this week with the Nasdaq Stock Market for its service ranking analysts and financial bloggers based on their stock picks’ performance. A link to the TopRanks’ system appears on the Nasdaq website as of Sunday, offering investors analysis of their portfolio, tips on how to diversify it, risk analysis and analysts’ opinions and performance comparison with other portfolios. “This is an important collaboration, which will expose us to millions of new users and let Nasdaq monetize users,” said CEO and co-founder Uri Gruenbaum. He declined to provide details about the revenue-sharing agreement the two sides have.  TipRanks counts about 4,000 premium users who pay a fee for access to more data and analytical tools and has revenues in the single millions of dollars. “Our system enables us to look at all the stock traded in the American market and give each one a rating,” he said. (Shelly Appelberg) TASE shares lose momentum after early advance Tel Aviv shares drifted lower from early highs Monday even as markets in Europe and Wall Street moved higher. The blue chip TA-25 index ended virtually unchanged at 1,448.67 points, while the TA-100 gained 0.2% to 1,270.31, as just over 1 billion shekels ($270 million) in shares changed hands. Insurance stocks led gainers, with Migdal ahead 2.5% by closing at 2.44 shekels and IBI Insurance up 1.7% to 175.50. Mazor Robotics led TA-100 gainers, advancing 3.6% to 43.90 while Kenon added 2.8% to a 7.3% jump the day before to end at 40.17. Blue Square Real Estate rose 3.7% to 154.80 after it lowered the interest it pays on bonds following a ratings upgrade by Midroog. It was the biggest gainer among TA-100 shares for the day. Partner Communications led TA-100 losers, falling 2.2% to 2.44. The Israel Corporation lost 1.1% to close at 653 shekels. Jerusalem Economic Corporation ended down 0.2% to 8.87. Shareholders rejected an offer from the Saidoff brothers to buy 30% of the company at 7.25 a share.

Photo courtesy of BMW Group Navigation, visual scanning and artificial intelligence know-how originally developed for Israel’s military are now set to be the brains of almost everyone’s next vehicle. “As technology becomes a key element in the automotive industry and more global players aim toward developing these [driverless] vehicles, our multidisciplinary approach to high-tech is making us a bigger and bigger player in the industry,” said Ziva Eger, chief executive of Israel’s International Investments and Industrial Cooperation Authority. “With more than 300 companies in the auto-tech sector, the ‘Startup Nation’ is quickly becoming the ‘Transportation Nation,’ ” Eger, a retired Israel Defense Force Colonel, told the Journal. Over the summer, automakers BMW, Volkswagen and Ford Motor Co. announced partnerships with or acquisitions of Israeli firms developing the technology behind the coming generation of driverless vehicles. Amnon Shashua, a computer science professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, is credited in large part for Israel’s emergence as a global leader in smart-car development. His company, Mobileye, is the top supplier of camera-based sensors used in driver-assistance systems already on the road.  In 1993, Shashua completed his doctoral dissertation, “Geometry and Photometry in 3D Visual Recognition.” In 1999, he co-founded Mobileye, and in 2014 the company launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange, raising approximately $1 billion. The market value of all of Mobileye’s shares is estimated at $5.3 billion, setting the record as the biggest Israeli IPO ever in the United States.  Last month, Mobileye, BMW and Intel — the world’s largest chip maker — negotiated a pact to jointly develop autonomous-car technology. “It’s one thing to come and say: ‘I developed a technology,’ ” Shashua said. “It’s another thing to say, ‘I have already partnered with one-third of the global industry.’ ” In late July, in order to improve its driverless car technology, Ford Motor Co. bought Israeli computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS. Ford plans to put driverless vehicles on the road in a ride-sharing service such as Uber or Lyft by 2021. Although no financial details of the acquisition were disclosed, the Tel Aviv business daily Globes reports that Ford will pay in the tens of millions of dollars for the Israeli startup founded in 2013. SAIPS has developed algorithmic solutions in image and video processing, deep learning and signal processing needed to achieve what industry insiders call Level 4 technology. A Level 3 vehicle can operate safely with the driver’s “eyes off” the road, while Level 4 indicates a “mind off” vehicle able to perform all safety-critical functions throughout a trip without a driver having to be prepared to take control. “The next decade will be defined by automation of the automobile, and we see autonomous vehicles as having as significant an impact on society as Ford’s moving assembly line did 100 years ago,” said Ford CEO Mark Fields, in a statement released shortly after its Israeli tech acquisition. This year, Ford will triple its autonomous vehicle test fleet to be the largest of any automaker, bringing the number to about 30 self-driving Fusion Hybrid sedans, with plans to triple it again in 2017. In June, Volkswagen — Europe’s largest carmaker — invested $300 million in Uber’s Israel-based competitor Gett Inc., a move that helps the company acquire the ride-sharing information needed to repurpose geographic and driver behavior data into the deep intelligence needed to deploy autonomous cars. “The partnership with Gett marks the first milestone for the Volkswagen Group on the road to providing integrated mobility solutions that spotlight our customers and their mobility needs,” said Volkswagen’s Chairman Matthias Müller. Driverless vehicles will require the development of new rules of the road. Regulators in Washington, D.C., invited Israel’s Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz to a meeting with U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx to sign an agreement giving the American government an advisory role in the development of autonomous vehicles at the ministry’s technology center in Herzliya. Automotive firms know that connected cars are at risk of cyberattacks, and Israeli data security companies are already doing business with much of the industry worldwide. Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Argus, founded by veterans of Unit 8200 — the Israeli Army’s signal intelligence and code decryption branch — has opened offices in Michigan, Tokyo and Stuttgart, Germany, to serve global automakers.  “The more connectivity is embedded into these vehicles, the greater the need for cyber solutions to protect these cars from getting hacked,” Argus’ marketing director Monique Lance told the Journal.

This is sensationalist, untrue and distracts from a genuine problem. With that solved, let's get to the real root cause of the problems here: The real problem here is that Intel do very little to ensure that free operating systems work well on their consumer hardware - we still have no information from Intel on how to configure systems to ensure good power management, we have no support for storage devices in "RAID" mode and we have no indication that this is going to get better in future. If Intel had provided that support, this issue would never have occurred. Rather than be angry at Lenovo, let's put pressure on Intel to provide support for their hardware. As someone who tried to move his retina MacBook Pro to Linux only a few weeks ago - I can attest to Intel's absolutely terrible Linux drivers and power management. My retina MacBook Pro has an Intel Iris 6100 graphics chip, and the driver for it is so incredibly bad that even playing a simple video will cause the laptop to become so hot I was too scared to leave it running. Playing that same video in OS X or Windows doesn't even spin up the fans, with the laptop entirely cool. Battery life in Linux measured in a 2-3 hours, whereas on OS X or Windows I easily get 8-10 hours.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple charges $649 for the cheapest version of the iPhone 7, but it actually costs a lot less to build. IHS Markit reports that it the materials inside each iPhone 7 add up to just $219.80, before adding an extra $5 per device to cover manufacturing. That’s actually $36.89 more than the iPhone 6s, according to IHS estimates, bringing Apple’s material cost closer to what Samsung pays per flagship smartphone. Cupertino reportedly pushed suppliers to cut costs ahead of the iPhone 7 launch, but it also packed the device with plenty of upgraded hardware. So it makes sense that the price of materials would go up slightly. Breaking down the components, the most expensive piece is the display at $43. Intel’s modem and other chips from the company cost about $33.90 overall. The new A10 Fusion processor reportedly costs $26.90, while the iPhone 7’s bigger battery is priced at $2.50. The front and rear-facing cameras add up to $19.90, while the iPhone 7’s 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage cost $16.40  IHS lumps the new Taptic Engine, antennas, microphones, speakers and connectors together at $16.70. The audio chips, barometer, accelerometer, gyroscope, Touch ID sensor and a few other sensors combine for another $14. Each iPhone 7 also comes with new Lightning EarPods, a 3.5mm to Lightning adapter and a USB power adapter. That’s another $11.80 per unit. Of course, that doesn’t factor in all the work the company does before manufacturing even starts, including research, design, engineering, software development, licensing and more. CEO Tim Cook has also previously denounced these sort of cost estimates, though it’s safe to assume each new iPhone will always come with a pretty big markup.

Pakistan started off well. In Jinnah’s homeland where we opened our eyes merit was the order of the day.

Ability to wage nuclear war at Trump’s ‘arm’s length’ 18-Nov-16 WASHINGTON: President-elect Do ... Merit is a misunderstood trait in our part of the world mainly because of lack of understanding. Clarity of definitions is always helpful. Merit is defined as the demonstrated ability or achievement that is worthy of praise while discretion is freedom of judgment or choice. Most of us claim to follow merit while using discretion that at times is obvious and blatant. Use of discretion usually leads to unfairness; in other words, it causes poor decisions and should be avoided as a matter of policy. Dr Andy Grove, one of the three co-founders of the Intel Corporation, said that for any serious consideration an idea should be produced in a written form. Most people believe that innovation starts with an idea but according to Dr Grove only when it is written down, understood and communicable it is worthy of consideration. In order for merit to prevail it should also be in a written from and communicated. Most quality management systems require job descriptions for important positions to ensure merit. Individuals have to meet the laid down conditions in order to qualify, and there is very little discretion or freedom to select at will. Several books have been written about the downside of discretion; the recent one is by James C Cooper titled The Perils of Excessive Discretion. Indeed, developing countries like Pakistan have suffered because of this menace. It invariably leads to the phenomenon of “blind leading the blind,” the end result of which is more blindness that we see all around us today. For those who cannot see, light has no meaning for them. The famous proverb “Light at the end of the tunnel” is rendered meaningless for those who live and prosper in darkness. There is no hope in their dawn or relaxation in their dusk; it is all the same drudgery for them. Good universities have written course outlines for every class. At the start of the term, the instructor is required to communicate the grading policy. It then constitutes an agreement between the teacher and the taught, which has to be adhered to. In my teaching experience, there have been situations where the student had managed to get an A grade though he was not worthy of it. Once the grading policy has been announced, teacher’s discretion to award grades is limited, and the criteria have to be followed. Even in ancient times, there were battles and contests for leadership. In history there are many famous duels. Emperor Humayun had to flee India when he was defeated by the brilliant leader, Sher Shah Suri. Historians believe had Suri lived on the Mughal Dynasty his brilliance would not have taken roots. Even in those times sword was used to establish merit. Weak rulers were weeded out or constantly threatened by the powerful. Merit was determined through power. In jungles the pack or herd animals have a framework for the leader to emerge, and there is no blind following. Naturally, they lack the ability to read and write that humans have; as such a written framework to ascertain merit is essentially required for humanity to move forward. The prevalent scenario in Pakistan is even worse than the jungle. Imagine the country under the premiership of Hamza Shehbaz Sharif or Maryam Nawaz Sharif. At least there should be some discussion on their education, credentials, experience and background before passing on the mantle to them. Lee Iacocca was perhaps the most brilliant corporate leader of the 20th century. He started his career as an engineer at the Ford Motor Company (FMC) in Michigan, and rose to be the president of the group. The Ford Mustang was his masterpiece development that brought him to prominence. The FMC was the last large family controlled business in the USA. For top management positions one had to be a Ford. Iacocca was fired by Henry Ford Jr, the last Ford to head the company. After leaving his parent company Iacocca then turned around the bankrupt Chrysler Corporation. In his book, he talks about his encounters with his boss. When discussions got heated and Henry Ford could not get his way he would take Iacocca to the window and show him the Ford name on the building. In other words, it was a shut-up call, as it was their company: the Fords had to be obeyed. My way or the highway was the approach, and eventually, Iacocca had to leave. When the Ford discretion destroyed the company the board finally decided to bring in professional management. The FMC not only survived it also became prosperous under the professionals. Meritocracy is the only way forward. Pakistan started off well. In Jinnah’s homeland where we opened our eyes merit was the order of the day. We were required to prove our credentials for which hard work was required. It was the result of these efforts that we produced winners in all fields. In 1996, Pakistan had five world championships — cricket, hockey, squash, snooker and yachting; today, we don’t have any international medal. Discretion has taken over merit with obvious consequences. It is time to put the country back on tracks. Abilities have to be demonstrable and communicable. Mystery is mischief; transparency and openness can effectively check the ills of discretion that is taking us down. It should be merit, merit and merit all the way if we desire to come out of this discretion-created mess.   The writer is a former chairman of the Pakistan Science Foundation, and can be reached at fmaliks@hotmail.com Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

Margrethe Vestager is on a US charm offensive, making the case about recovering alleged unpaid taxes – but she has been met with more offense than charm The European Commission is seeking ‘recovery of illegal state aid’ from Apple for alleged unpaid taxes in Ireland.

Vestager met with US treasury secretary Jacob Lew, had a closed-door session with members of the US Senate finance committee, and spoke at the Global Antitrust Enforcement Symposium at Georgetown University, where she gave a vigorous defense of the EC’s decision. “Our rules don’t stop governments applying a low tax rate to every company,” she said in the speech. “What they can’t do is to select just a few favored businesses and give them special treatment which their rivals can’t get. So when we ask national governments to reclaim unpaid taxes, all we’re doing is ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity. The ​​commissioner failed to build an effective case for this highly politicized ruling Senator Orrin Hatch “That is only fair. And I think that’s what people expect of their public authorities. Not to get cozy with special interests, but to have the courage to defend the public interest. And that’s an area where competition enforcers can lead by example.” So far, however, reaction to her visit – and her comments – has been more offense than charm. The Senate finance committee chairman, Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, met with Vestager in advance of her meeting with the bipartisan Senate committee and was moved to make a statement about the meeting. “Rather than working with countries to strengthen the international tax framework and improve the rule of law, the European commission, in its recent state aid ruling, opted to run roughshod over an American firm by retroactively overriding a tax opinion between a sovereign country and a company,” he said. “Though our meetings were cordial, the commissioner failed to build an effective case for this highly politicized ruling rooted in an erroneous interpretation of law, underscoring the need for additional action in international courts.” After Apple: will other tech companies face Irish tax bills of their own? Read more Technology industry advocates and analysts echoed this view. Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based technology industry advocacy group ITIC (Information Technology Industry Council), said that members of his group (which includes Amazon, Apple, Dell, EMC, Facebook, Google, HP, Intel and Microsoft) did not think Vestager’s visit will have much of an impact. “It hasn’t changed anything,” he said. “It’s aimed at explaining and putting in context what is largely inexplicable.” Personal rapport, he said, is helpful to work through difficult trade issues, “so a degree of familiarity and trust is helpful, but the policy implications remain the same”. Technology industry analyst Tim Bajarin, president and principal analyst of San Jose-based Creative Strategies, was even more blunt. “Every major company we deal with has the same basic position – it’s sensitive for them to speak out, but as far as they are concerned, they have paid every tax they legally owe,” he said. “A retroactive tax just doesn’t sit well with anyone here in the US.” Bajarin, who has been advising US technology companies for more than 30 years, also offers a historical perspective based on his own work with those companies when they were being courted by Ireland’s Industrial Development Agency (IDA) to make a move to Ireland in the first place. “Had they not built this program, they would not have built a tech industry in Ireland,” he said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Why Apple is facing a €13bn tax bill in Ireland He also said that he was surprised by the European commission’s decision to seek retroactive taxes, since the EU was well aware of the IDA’s work with Apple and other technology companies from the start. “From when they first did the program, they got the EU’s approval – and nobody had any problems with it for almost 30 years.” Bajarin also suggested that it loses sight of why tax incentives were offered in the first place. “Parents were getting upset with the Irish government [because there was no significant technology sector in Ireland] and their kids would leave. That was a huge issue and why the Irish government created this program – so Irish kids would have jobs in the tech industry. And it was very successful,” he said. When Silicon Valley started booming, the IDA opened an office in San Francisco and pitched everything around tax, he explains. Yet despite concerns about the European commission’s decision on Apple, virtually all of the players on the US side of the discussion concede that tax reform in the United States is part of the solution. Hatch weighed into the issue in his comments on the meeting with Vestager. “We must do our part to address the anti-competitive nature of the US tax code and the impact it has had on our domestic job creators both here and abroad,” Hatch said. “Lowering the corporate tax burden and shifting to a territorial regime with base erosion protections will help shift our economic landscape and produce fertile ground for more businesses to invest here at home. It’s an achievable, bipartisan goal that holds great promise, should we get a willing partner in the White House.” The Irish government created this program so Irish kids would have jobs in the tech industry. And it was very successful Tim Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies Garfield concurred. “The best way to address this is to address the tax code and not to address the rules in the middle of the game,” he said, suggesting that no government should be making retroactive calls on taxation issues. Garfield also said he hoped that both of the leading candidates for the US presidency would recognize the importance of dealing with tax reform. “Tax reform should not be a political football,” he added. “The need for change is compelling and should be something all parties should agree on.” Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, commented on tax reform following the European commission ruling. “Apple has long supported international tax reform with the objectives of simplicity and clarity. We believe these changes should come about through the proper legislative process, in which proposals are discussed among the leaders and citizens of the affected countries. And as with any new laws, they should be applied going forward – not retroactively,” he said. Vestager’s US visit continues on Wednesday with a speech at New York’s Columbia University called “Tax avoidance and privacy in the digital age: an EU perspective”. She also issued a statement clarifying the commission’s definition of “state aid” as part of the announcement of a finding on Wednesday that found that “five public measures for purely local operations in Spain, Germany and Portugal involve no state aid because they are unlikely to affect trade between member states” and will thus not be the subject of any commission action. “In many cases member states can stimulate investment without asking the commission,” she said. “These decisions confirm that many local public support measures do not constitute state aid. This reflects the Juncker Commission’s approach to be ‘big on big things and small on small things’.” More news Topics Apple Tax and spending Silicon Valley European commission Margrethe Vestager Corporate governance Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Both drives feature 3D NAND (which Samsung refers to as V-NAND) to offer more storage capacity than a traditional 2D NAND methodology would allow. While companies like Intel are releasing their first batches of SDDs with the new technology this year, Samsung has been using 3D NAND for consumer hardware since the release of the popular 850 Pro and 850 Evo SSDs back in 2014. the first consumer SSDs from Samsung to use the NVMe interface specification Last year’s model, the 950 Pro, used 32-layer V-NAND technology from the 850 series of SATA SSDs, but replaced the older 2.5-inch SATA interface for the newer and smaller PCIe form factor. In 3D NAND, the number of layers is key to offering increased storage, and Samsung has managed to upgrade both this year's 960 Pro and 960 Evo to using 48-layer V-NAND technology. Both 960 series drives are also the first consumer SSDs from Samsung to use the newer NVMe interface specification to achieve faster speeds. The 960 Pro is the top-of-the-line consumer model, which uses faster and more reliable – but less memory dense and therefore more expensive – MLC (Multi Level Cell) memory, where each memory cell can contain 2 bits of charge. The 960 Evo, on the other hand, uses cheaper TLC (Triple Level Cell) technology, which divides each cell into three possible bits of data, at the expense of reliability and speed. But Samsung is touting even the budget 960 Evo models as faster than last year's 950 Pro, with speeds of up to 3200 MB/s read and 1900 MB/s write, while the flagship 960 Pro can reach up to 3500 MB/s read and 2100 MB/s write. Both the 960 Pro and 960 Evo are scheduled for release in October. The 960 Pro starts at $329.99 for 512GB up to $1,299 for 2TB, while the 960 Evo begins at $129.88 for 250GB up to $479 for 1TB of storage.

Finding serenity in the mighty – not murky – Ohio Jennifer Mooney 5:12 p.m. EDT September 21, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Swimmers brave the Ohio River for the 2010 Great Ohio River Swim. Stacy Doose for The Enquirer Swimmers get ready to start Cincinnati’s Great Ohio River Swim in 2013. The swim was canceled last year because of poor water conditions. (Photo: Provided) Jennifer Mooney is the founder of The Mooney Group, a communications firm. She learned to swim at a Cincinnati area YWCA when she was about 2 1/2. She “trains” at Clifton Meadows and plans to ultimately participate in the Alcatraz Swim. Intel founder and Holocaust survivor Andrew Grove, in his autobiography “Swimming Across,” described the impact open-water distance swimming had on his life. Open-water swimmers experience the water as a Zen-like place, a place to immerse, escape and find an altered state. The upcoming Great Ohio River Swim offers this experience right in our city’s front yard. The swim is scheduled for Sunday morning at Cincinnati’s public landing, with registration at 6:30 and an open-water skills workshop at 7:30, followed by the “jump off” into the mighty Ohio. Information and registration is online at www.greatohioriverswim.com. With swim cap and goggles on, I gladly will take the plunge for the fifth time. Anyone who loves the water will appreciate this exhilarating swim from Ohio to Kentucky and back – a brief 900 meters. In September, the Ohio is generally bathtub-warm. Swimmers and their entourages of family and friends witness the beauty of fog lifting over the looming bridge to Newport under the burn of a stark orange sunrise as plunge time approaches. There is no better time or vantage point to view the Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky skylines. Jennifer Mooney  (Photo: Provided) While the event is timed, I have discovered (usually somewhere in the middle) that this is not a time to rush, but to appreciate being in the water unencumbered. Yes, I compare my times (year to year) to ensure that I am not slipping with age – but I am not in this thing to win a race. When I talk about my plan to jump in the Ohio, friends and family often ask if I have encountered any cadavers, logs or 90-pound mutant catfish. One former City Council member known for advocacy of environmental issues asked with a certain incredulity “you are doing what?” I reminded the individual that the river is our front yard and folks had worked hard to keep it clean. This is our drinking water, after all. Questions and comments about my sanity include: 1) Why would you do that? 2) That water is unclean and unhealthy. 3) Can you see anything? 4) That does not sound fun to me. Why would I not? Boat traffic is shut down. There is peace and serenity in this silence. River cleanup has been a longtime regional goal, and while not much can be “seen” during the swim due to turbulence I haven’t experienced a troubling water taste or any unsightly objects floating past. This is an event for the robust, regardless of age. Swimmers range from high schoolers to folks in their 80s. You run into people well known in real life – except here they’re in their Speedos. It makes for a different sort of “what’s up?” Swimming has a positive impact on overall lifetime health. It doesn’t discriminate against age and passage of time. The river crossing may be unnerving for first timers, but the event team fills the river with kayaks ready for those who change their mind. (This does not seem to happen often.) I will enter the water again Sunday – while my “landlubbing” husband drinks coffee, holds my towel and reads the paper – and be grateful for the chance to see our city at its most peaceful. Some look forward to the holidays – for me it’s swimming across that big river. 430 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2cVlsRD TOP VIDEOS Watch Google Home struggle to answer queries 1:34 Cole Swindell has ‘You Should be Here’ moment on CMA Awards red carpet 2:01 Cole Swindell talks about is favorite 30 seconds while on CMA Awards red carpet! 1:01 RaeLynn’s reaction to watching old clips from ‘The Voice’ is priceless! 0:50 What’s it like to be inducted into Country Music Hall of Fame?

Depending on the type of lecturer you have, you’re usually free to bring a laptop into classes to take down notes. So you’ll want to consider getting a decent note-taking machine, but it doesn’t have to break the bank. Chromebooks are a option if you want to save money when buying a laptop, although what you have to consider is the fact they’re very different to MacBooks or Windows models. They use Google’s proprietary Chrome OS and predominantly function by being connected to the internet. Most of the device’s applications are cloud-based. If the mandatory Wi-Fi connection doesn’t bother you, then have a look at the Acer Chromebook 14. It’s one of the best Chrome devices you can get, offering you access to all Google’s cloud features in a sleek form and costing a little over £200. Sleek and stylish, it offers a 14-inch HD display, a 16GB hard drive and an Intel Celeron processor. The Chromebook 14 costs £240/$300. For more information, visit acer.com   Libratone Too While learning is important when you’re a student, university life is also about having fun. If you’re shipping off to do a degree this year, then you ought to get excited and prepared for the bustle and madness of Fresher’s Week. It’s an opportune time to get to know other students and make friends for the year ahead. And, as you may have gathered, there are going to be a load of house parties. Should you want to plan one of your own – perhaps to show off your organisational skills and awesome music taste – you’re going to need a good speaker to keep the atmosphere alive. The Libratone Too is one of the best speakers you can get. Costing a little over £100, it’ll easily connect up to your phone via Bluetooth, offers 12 hours of battery life and is splashproof. The Libratone Too costs £110/$150. For more information, visit libratone.com   Aerobie AeroPress A good coffee boost will almost be essential to helping you finish off those dreadful assignments early in the morning. And although you’re a student, that’s not to say you can only drink awful instant coffee. The AeroPress from Aerobie lets you make barista-grade coffee from the comfort of your own home. Easy to use and with a press time of 20 seconds, the coffee maker uses a uniform extraction method for the best coffee taste. It can make between one and three cups of American-style coffee per use, and you can buy a nylon pouch to carry it in. The Aerobie AeroPress costs £30/$35. For more information, visit aerobie.com   Olympus WS-852   Taking notes in lectures is hard. Unless the lecturer speaks as slow as a snail moves around, then you’re going to have a hard time jotting down every word they say. Well, no worries, as that’s what voice recorders are for. The Olympus WS-852 has 4GB of internal storage, 1040 hours of recording time, smart audio tracking and a retractable USB stick. The Olympus WS-852 costs £40/$50.

All of a sudden, you have to be an adult. You don’t have your parents to pick up after you anymore, and it’s down to you to ensure you survive. They certainly won’t be around to make you an omelette or sandwich when you’re hungry, or a hangover cure. Cooking is probably the hardest thing to get to grips with once you’ve moved away from the luxury of your parents’ cooking, unless you’re a seasoned chef. But it doesn’t have to be too tough. This is why devices like Tefal’s Toast N’ Egg were created, and you should make the most of them when you’re living the hectic lifestyle of a university student. It’s an affordable two-slice toaster and egg maker, and is perfect for student houses. There are two slots for toast, muffins and bagels, along with a steamer for hard-boiling or poaching eggs. The Tefal Toast N’ Egg costs £35/$45.

For more information on Server Hardware Why Lenovo for Hyperconverged? Partner Offers HPE's all-in-one-box solution is the HC 250, which packs up to four nodes into a single 2U chassis. It comes in two basic flavors with support for both VMware and Microsoft's Cloud Platform Systems – Standard. The HPE Hyper Converged 380 is the newest member of the family and is based on the popular DL 380 Gen9 server. This product starts with a minimum of two physical servers and scales up to as many as sixteen nodes. With a front-panel storage capacity of up to twenty-four small form factor (SFF) drive slots, it's possible to max out the unit at 25.2 TB of storage per appliance with the current software. This will only increase over time. HPE's secret sauce for both of these systems is in the company's simplified OneView InstantOn (OVIO) deployment tool. This menu-driven question and answer tool takes the majority of the pain out of configuring multiple machines for clustering, networking and storage. On the storage side, HPE uses its StoreVirtual VSA (Virtual Storage Appliance) product for both the HC 250 and HC 380. StoreVirtual VSA takes the place of VSAN for VMware and Storage Spaces on the Microsoft side. We'll look at this feature in more detail in a bit. Hardware Details With the HPE DL380 used as the basic building block, the HC 380 requires a minimum of eight disk drives plus 10Gb networking added in. A minimum of 128GB of memory is the recommended starting point with a range of options for number of CPU cores. Our test system consisted of two HP DL380 systems equipped with Intel E5-2620 v3 CPUs and 128 GB of memory. While you can order the system with all 1 GbE networking, HPE recommends using 10 GbE for best performance. It's worth pointing out here that VMware requires a minimum of three hosts to construct a minimal VSAN cluster. Some deployment scenarios, such as remote office applications, can be configured as a two-node system with an external system (possibly remote) as the witness. StoreVirtual scales up to a total of 32 hosts should you need that big of a cluster. VSAN 6.2 now scales up to sixty-four hosts, giving it the edge on expandability. Disk configurations vary depending on your application. HPE recommends implementing one full block consisting of eight drives at a time. Each DL 380 will support up to three blocks or a total of twenty-four drives. These can be any combination of HDD or SSD drives to include all HDD or all SSD. All storage is managed by the StoreVirtual Appliance software and is fully integrated with VMware vSphere. The nice thing about using a commodity server like the DL 380 as the building block is the flexibility it brings. Special Sauce Setup and configuration is greatly simplified with the OneView InstantOn (OVIO) tool. The foundation of this tool is used for both the HC 250 running Microsoft's Cloud Platform System and the HC 380 we tested running VMware vSphere. Configuring multiple network addresses and individual settings for each node in a large cluster can be tedious and error prone (see Figure 1). HPE's OVIO takes all the information needed through a simple dialog process and then does everything for you. HPE HC380 - Figure 1 (Click for larger image) HPE offers a simulator-only version of the OneView InstantOn tool for instructional purposes. This tool works just like the real tool with the exception of actually installing or modifying any hardware configurations. It's useful for walking through the various menus to help identify any information required for a successful installation. In fact, it's a great way to identify all the IP addresses and system information you'll need to complete the process. Figure 2 shows the summary page listing the configuration details prior to deployment. HPE HC380 - Figure 2 (Click for larger image) Management Multiple avenues exist for managing the HC 380 system. An overall dashboard as shown in Figure 3 presents a summary of the system with quick links to tasks such as back and restore and software updates. HPE HC380 - Figure 3 (Click for larger image) Other tabs on the left side show Virtual Machines, system Activity and Utilization. The web-based management interface provides quick access to many functions that would typically take a number of clicks in the vCenter. HP OneView for VMware vCenter version 7.8.2 provides a connection to a number of management tools specific to the management of the HC 380. Figure 4 shows the menu that presents when you right-click on the cluster. The All HP Management Actions entry provides links to create a Datastore, VM from Template and deploy the HP StoreOnce management console or an additional VSA instance. HPE HC380 - Figure 4 (Click for larger image) All other vSphere actions, including creating, deleting, moving and cloning VMs, function just as you would expect against the VSA-based datastore. Bottom Line The HPE HC 380 builds upon the foundation of the venerable DL 380 system to deliver hyper-converged features with simplified installation and management. HPE's OVIO takes the complexity out of cluster installation and makes it cookie-cutter simple. HPE's StoreVirtual Appliance brings redundant, multi-node storage at a cost below what you would pay for a similar VSAN installation. Pricing remains in the "call for availability" category, but the product is listedon their website.

Promontory, my dear Watson Microsoft boasts its cloudy Hadoop big data mill's faster than yours Amazon: Students, we'll give you $2.5m for a chat-up, AI? Dell is all about engineered systems, or so its CEO Mickey D said recently, but actions speak louder than words and today the Texan infrastructure baron rolled out a box targeting firms running SAP HANA. The Dell EMC Validated Systems for SAP HANA v.4.1 is an updated version of Dell’s ready-built system for scale-out deployments of SAP’s analytic database platform aimed at larger enterprises. This is based on the firm’s PowerEdge R930 server hardware, which was itself updated back in June with Intel’s latest Xeon E7 v4 processor family. Dell EMC makes customary big claims that this is the “fastest server for running SAP workloads”, quoting benchmarks that rate it at 33,500 advanced navigation steps per hour with the SAP Business Warehouse Advance Mixed Load operating with 2 billion records. Coming next month is the Dell EMC Validated System for SAP HANA Edge, a platform aimed at making it easier for smaller mid-market companies to operate data analytics. First detailed earlier this year at SAP’s SAPPHIRE NOW event, this is delivered as a fully integrated appliance running SAP HANA Edge edition, advanced version and SAP Predictive Analytics. Continuing the SAP love-in, Dell EMC also unveiled a reference architecture aimed at helping manufacturing firms to implement predictive maintenance regimes through analysis of operational data - essentially a use case for the Internet of things (IoT). This reference architecture brings together Dell EMC’s Edge Gateway devices, sensors from ifm efector, and the Dell EMC Validated System for SAP HANA running SAP Predictive Maintenance and Service (PdMS), and is intended to cut operational costs through elimination of unnecessary maintenance and early diagnosis of any developing faults - that at least is the aim. These latest announcements seem to show the newly forged Dell EMC is well aware that has to offer something beyond just hardware and software, and is moving to become a one-stop provider of ready-integrated solutions for its business customers. As noted by The Register previously, this is a path already trodden by rival Oracle. The margins are better than on standard boxes and Dell needs as much margin as it can grab after the $63bn buy of EMC. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Michael Dell promises new EMC/Dell/VMware engineered systems Vmworld Expect them ASAP once the EMC deal closes, which will be real soon now 5 Comments Dell-EMC, Pure Storage disengage from legal brawl Lawyers weep as retirement plans go AWOL and Dell gets payment Dell EMC cranks Xeon servers into ludicrous mode with Tesla GPUs But can it play Crysis on ultra? 10 Comments EMC storage wranglers to cuddle Dell SC arrays Compelling development for SC, much less so for PS Series 3 Comments SonicWall goes it alone as Elliott and pal swallow Dell/Quest Software Rumours abound of product lines ending – and layoffs too 5 Comments Dell has laid off EMC people at Hopkinton Getting rid of overlapping job functions 7 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

In the rush to cross into Europe, following German Chancellor Angela Merkel's announcement that her country's doors were open to refugees, the German the Federal Bureau of Migration and Refugees (BAMF) struggled to deal with the sheer volume of migrants arriving in its borders.  © AP Photo/ Armin Weigel German Intel Warns Daesh Hit-Squads, Sleeper Cells Infiltrated Country Among Refugees A year on, politicians in the German Bundestgag have been told that only around 20-30 percent of migrants arriving showed any form of identity and that many passports being checked now are being found to be fake, giving rise to fears that there could be hundreds — or even thousands — of Daesh sleepers in Germany. According the Die Welt newspaper, at the height of the migration, hundreds of thousands were making their way into Germany each month via the West Balkan route and — without border controls — staff from BAMF were overwhelmed.

More Sleeper Cells There is evidence that sleeper cells may have been set up as early as 2012 — which the 2015 influx may have joined. According to a 99-page manifesto, "Black Flags from Rome" — which intelligence agencies have been aware of since January 2015 — radicalized Muslims who have been trained in Syria were told to form "sleeper" cells in Europe — particularly in areas of cities and towns that were heavily populated by Muslims. "While the experienced Islamic State fighters left Syria for Europe, the European Muslims who had emigrated to the Islamic State would train within the training camps, and nobody doubted — neither the Islamic State, nor the West — that some of these trainees would be sent back to Europe to form their own secret cells to continue the Jihad and to seek revenge for the western occupation of Muslim lands," the manifesto states. "These fighters would simply receive their training and be told to go back to their European home countries, to go into 'sleeper cell' mode until the Khalifah (Caliph) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ordered to start attacks in Europe." ...

After the second world war ended a policy of ethnic cleansing started that slowly but surely turned schools, streets, neighbourhoods, villages and large parts of cities from white to to black, from vaguely christian to muslim. A crime against the German/European people that doesn't have an equivalent in history and that will lead to the extermination of Germanic society, language, culture and people.

Cloud computing has been a critical part of this transformation story, but cloud alone is not the answer to all of today’s business challenges. In their excitement to adopt the latest cloud solutions, it’s easy for organizations to forget about issues around risk and security. Then, when the question does arise, it quickly becomes apparent that while traditional approaches to security may have worked in a pre-cloud world, they are far from adequate when faced with current business demands for speed, flexibility and agility.

By Owen Hughes September 21, 2016 13:24 BST The bug appears to be mostly affecting customers in the USReuters Some iOS 10 users have reported that using Airplane mode permanently disables mobile signal on their phone. Apple is now investigating the claims. It's unclear whether the issue is affecting iOS 10 or the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus specifically, although it appears to be mostly affecting US customers who purchased an iPhone 7 through AT&T. MacRumors notes that the iPhone 7 uses different modems depending on the network operator they're purchased through, with AT&T's iPhone 7 using an Intel modem rather than the Qualcomm unit used by rivals Sprint and Verizon. Some users have found that restarting their device solves the problem, however others have been forced to return their device to Apple in exchange for a new one. A video uploaded to YouTube shows an iPhone 7 with no cellular service, next to an iPhone 6S connected to a 4G signal. According to the owner of the video, the phone lost signal after turning on the device's Airplane Mode and then switching it off again. They told MacRumors: "All of a sudden today my iPhone 7 Jet Black model started not getting internet service – can't make outbound calls or receive calls – even though it showed 4 bars. I then put it in Airplane Mode, and back off, then it showed no service. It got pretty warm in the top right-hand corner. "I then took a video of my wife's iPhone 6S right next to my iPhone 7, put them both in Airplane Mode, and then switched Airplane Mode off and you can see immediately that the iPhone 6s gets signal instantly, and the iPhone 7 just sits there searching. I then took her SIM and put it in my iPhone 7, no luck, put my SIM in her phone, and it got signal right away." IBTimes UK tested out the reported Airplane Mode bug and found to have no problems regaining cellular connectivity. While Apple hasn't seen anything on the scale of exploding smartphones, the launch of its latest products hasn't been smooth sailing. In addition to finding hardcore porn in iOS 10's new GIF search feature, users have also reported handsets freezing and connectivity problems with Apple's Lightning EarPods. Apple has told network providers that customers who report the latest problem should be instructed to restart their phone, and remove and then reinsert the SIM card if the issue persists.

Hewlett-Packard's (HP) new product releases for August successfully widened the vendor's shipment gap by nearly 700,000 units with number two Lenovo. HP stayed firmly as the largest notebook vendor in the month. Dell turned its focus to the consumer sector in August, but its shipments only grew a single-digit percentage on month, according to Digitimes Research's latest report on notebook shipments. Asustek Computer and Acer both enjoyed over 10% on-month growths in August thanks to seasonality. With HP's significant shipment growth in August, the top-3 ODMs, which are all suppliers of HP, together achieved higher on-month growth than the top-5 vendors combined, while ODM's combined on-year shipment growth also turned positive for the first time in the past 16 months. Quanta benefited from HP's orders the most in the month, growing nearly 40% from July.

News & Analysis Startup Tips Machine Learning Chip Wave Computing aims to leapfrog Nvidia in AI Rick Merritt 9/21/2016 08:00 AM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – A new startup will emerge from stealth mode and into the super-heated market for machine learning next week. Wave Computing will describe a chip that can train neural networks ten times faster than Nvidias top GPUs while consuming the same power. Wave’s chip is one of a handful of announcements at next week’s Linley Processor Conference. Also at the event, Ceva will describe a new DSP core for computer vision, Adesto will detail a NOR chip that can handle both storage and execute code and ARM will announce a new member of its family of on-chip interconnects. The news comes at a time of growing specialization in microprocessor design, according to the event’s host, veteran chip analyst Linley Gwennap. “In the 1970’s and ‘80’s people created a lot of different architectures, but over the past 20 years work has consolidated more on to ARM and x86,” said Gwennap, principal of the Linley Group. “As Moore’s law slows, Intel can’t keep delivering twice the performance every two years, so people have to innovate at the architectural level again…and we will see more custom accelerators with special instruction sets to get a 10x boost in performance,” he said. Wave is the poster child for that trend at this year’s event, showing a custom chip for accelerating the TensorFlow algorithm Google developed and designed its own ASIC to run. “We’ve looked at their architecture, and it looks very innovative, their preliminary performance numbers are 10x better than traditional GPUs in the same power as a high-end Nvidia GPU,” Gwennap said. “It’s a hot space, and they have a similar business model to Nervana [recently acquired by Intel] of selling systems to accelerate machine learning,” he added. The systems approach makes sense given the difficulty of attracting the $50-100 million needed for a new chip startup and the higher revenues for selling systems, Gwennap noted. Indeed, even Nvidia is trying to sell machine learning systems that use four of its high-end Pascal-class processors. Among other newsmakers, Adesto will describe a NOR chip with a special interface geared to speed output of programs executed on it. Typically flash is too slow to execute programs, so engineers provide SRAM, generating unacceptable costs for Adesto’s target markets in wearables and the Internet of Things. For its part, ARM will detail a more feature rich on-chip interconnect. However it is not expected to support all the bells and whistles of offerings from companies such as Arteris and Netspeed. Several presentations will look at server and networking chips that aim to attack the dominance of Intel’s Xeon processors. AMD, not presenting at the event, will have the best chance of grabbing Xeon market share with its x86-based Zen chips expected next year. “Data center guys would love to see someone compete with Intel in a way they don’t have to move all their code,” Gwennap said. Applied's X-Gene 3 could become the closest ARM server SoC to Intel's Xeon in performance. (Image: Linley Group) ARM chips also have a shot in 2017, particularly Applied Micro’s X-Gene 3 which ranks highest in performance among the current crop. Cavium’s ThunderX has the most cores, but they are relatively small, low performance ones that keep overall performance below X-Gene 3. “ThunderX 2 is significantly better, but it will probably be ThunderX 3 before they can really compete with Intel,” Gwennap said. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: AI Drives Startup to Map Deep Learning Computer Data Centers Dominate FPGA Event EE Times Silicon 60: 2016's Emerging Companies to Watch Googles TPU Hit a Tight Sked Email This Print Comment More Related Links Integrated Resistors for an Advanced Node CMOS Qualcomm Boss Brainstorms on 5G Startup Programs Multicores on Data, Not Gut U.S. Analog IP Startup Partners with Megachips Chip Veterans Scan Horizon Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author Re: A question spike_johan   9/22/2016 8:42:18 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Thanks Rick for your rapid reply. Yes, ASICs are all about custom silicon. So are FPGAs, except FPGAs are rewritable. I guess I am still wondering if the inherent logic blocks of an FPGA (or unchangeable ASIC) is where the heavy lifting is done via processing the algorithm.

Some do this work in software on CPUs, some want the fastest GPUs for best performance (see http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1328464) and others are doing architectures tailored for it such as Wave and Nervana mentioned here. Google developed an ASIC to accelerate its TensorFlow version of the algorithms: See http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1323500 Separately, Microsoft and Badu have implemented FPGA cards in servers to handle specific jobs such as accelerating search, network processing and cryto. See http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1323500 This broader uses of accelerators in data centers was one of the motivations for Intel to buy Altera. That move motivated all their rivals to gear up for acclerators, too. See http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1329734 In short, there's a lot of related and somewhat orthognal things going on here.

This brings me to my question. If I have been understanding what I have been reading these past few months, is all of this new custom silicon based [sort of] on FPGA/memory closely clustered with a CPU(s) on an SoC where specific machine learning algorithms are configured in the logic blocks of the FPGA? And to where other tasks which can be offloaded from software have been done so to run faster on hardware accelerators? Thanks if you can shed any further light on where my thinking on this subject presently is. I have been out of the game for almost five years and I find it fascinating - if I am right - how early technology like FPGAs have been relegated these new tasks.

Participants in this latest round include financial institutions, family offices, and private investors from five continents. “OurCrowd has grown exponentially since our launch in 2013 to become the leading global platform for Equity Crowdfunding,” said CEO Jon Medved. "This transformative Series C funding will allow us to take advantage of the growing investor interest in quality equity crowdfunding and further expand our global operations. One half of the round will be invested in the expansion of our 7 global offices, and further developing our technology platform. The other half of the Series C funding will be used to make sure that each and every company which raises funding on our platform receives participating investment from the General Partner on the same terms as the crowd. This new capital will help us hit our goal of investing $1 billion annually by 2020.” OurCrowd has to date invested in 100 portfolio companies and funds on its platform. Total investment in companies and funds now exceed $300 million. OurCrowd has had nine exits to date from its portfolio investments: two IPO’s and seven acquisitions. These include ReWalk (ipo:Nasdaq), Crosswise (bought by Oracle), Replay Technologies (bought by Intel), and NextPeer (bought by Viber). Dror Sharon, CEO of OurCrowd portfolio company Consumer Physics (the makers of SCiO), said, “OurCrowd was one of the earliest investors in the SCiO vision. We have grown up together and come a long way, from their initial investment of $325,000 in Consumer Physics to several million dollars invested by OurCrowd into Consumer Physics so far. But what makes OurCrowd so important for Consumer Physics is not just the money, but the assistance and worldwide connections they make for our company, on a weekly and sometimes daily basis.” According to Dr. Richard Swart, former Director of Crowdfunding Research at UC Berkeley, "OurCrowd continues to lead the equity crowdfunding market not just in numbers but in the quality of their deal flow and number of their exits. They have consistently proven that crowdfunding can deliver not only the best deals but also healthy returns. OurCrowd's impressive new funding round should enable them to address the considerable challenge of scaling up their business to the billion-dollar level." “We understand the ambitions of startups and emerging enterprises and want to help them grow into sustainable businesses. We look forward to working closely with OurCrowd to further develop their platform to support the startup ecosystem both in Singapore and the broader Asian market,” said Janet Young, Managing Director of Group Channels and Digitalization at UOB Group, one of Singapore’s leading banks. “Our investment into this Series C funding for OurCrowd reinforces our commitment to supporting startups and small businesses.” Geoff Levy, Chairman of Monash Private Equity in Sydney, Australia, an OurCrowd investor and member of the OurCrowd Advisory Board, stated that “OurCrowd has grown incredibly fast over the last 3+ years. With this new and important Series C funding, we expect to continue this steep growth trajectory, not only gaining more investors and capital worldwide, but most importantly increasing the ‘crowds’ involvement in sourcing and adding value to our remarkable portfolio of companies.” For Press Materials: http://blog.ourcrowd.com/72m-series-c-round/ About OurCrowd OurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors.

The new SPECvirt_sc2013 V1.1 benchmark uses real-world workloads and SPEC's proven performance- and power-measurement methodologies to enable vendors, users and researchers to compare system performance across multiple hardware, virtualization platforms, and applications. It was developed by the SPEC Virtualization subcommittee, whose members and contributors include HPE, IBM, Intel, Lenovo, Oracle, Red Hat, and VMware. Extending an industry milestone "Since its introduction six years ago as the first vendor-neutral benchmark to measure the performance of datacenter servers used for virtualized server consolidation, SPECvirt_sc has played a central role in enabling datacenter managers to make better-informed decisions about the right configurations to meet their demands," says David Schmidt, SPEC Virtualization subcommittee chair. "It has also been a valuable development and marketing tool for vendors of virtualization solutions." Upgrades in SPECvirt_sc2013 V1.1 include: Support for newer security protocols -- The new version continues to support SSLv3 and adds support for TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 with several new ciphers (encryption algorithms). Updates to the power and temperature daemon (PTDaemon) -- The PTDaemon that controls power and temperature measurement has been updated to V1.8.0, the latest version from the SPECpower subcommittee. This version supports the latest power analyzers and temperature sensors. Response to user feedback -- Improvements have been made to documentation in response to user suggestions and bug reports. SPECvirt_sc2013 V1.1 results are comparable to results from V1.0. Result submissions to the SPEC website can be made with the V1.0 or V1.1 version of the benchmark until December 21, 2016, after which all submissions must be made with V1.1. Available immediately SPECvirt_sc2013 V1.1 is available for immediate download from SPEC. The cost is $3,000 for new customers; discounts are available for qualified non-profit and educational institutions. Upgrades to V1.1 are free for current licensees. SPEC will contact existing licensees and make arrangements for free downloads. Additional product and ordering information is available on the SPEC web site at https://www.spec.org/virt_sc2013/.

Israeli global equity crowdfunding platform OurCrowd has closed $72 million in Series C funding. Participants in this latest round include financial institutions, family offices, and private investors from five continents. OurCrowd CEO Jon Medved said, “OurCrowd has grown exponentially since our launch in 2013 to become the leading global platform for Equity Crowdfunding. This transformative Series C funding will allow us to take advantage of the growing investor interest in quality equity crowdfunding and further expand our global operations. One half of the round will be invested in the expansion of our 7 global offices, and further developing our technology platform. The other half of the Series C funding will be used to make sure that each and every company which raises funding on our platform receives participating investment from the General Partner on the same terms as the crowd. This new capital will help us hit our goal of investing $1 billion annually by 2020.” RELATED ARTICLES OurCrowd receives license to raise funds in Singapore OurCrowd raises $10m for Asian expansion Jerusalem-based OurCrowd has to date invested in 100 portfolio companies and funds on its platform. Total investment in companies and funds now exceeds $300 million. OurCrowd has had nine exits to date from its portfolio investments: two IPO’s and seven acquisitions. These include ReWalk (IPO: Nasdaq), Crosswise (bought by Oracle), Replay Technologies (bought by Intel), and NextPeer (bought by Viber). OurCrowd portfolio company Consumer Physics CEO Dror Sharon said, “OurCrowd was one of the earliest investors in the SCiO vision. We have grown up together and come a long way, from their initial investment of $325,000 in Consumer Physics to several million dollars invested by OurCrowd into Consumer Physics so far. But what makes OurCrowd so important for Consumer Physics is not just the money, but the assistance and worldwide connections they make for our company, on a weekly and sometimes daily basis.” According to Dr. Richard Swart, former Director of Crowdfunding Research at UC Berkeley, "OurCrowd continues to lead the equity crowdfunding market not just in numbers but in the quality of their deal flow and number of their exits. They have consistently proven that crowdfunding can deliver not only the best deals but also healthy returns. OurCrowd's impressive new funding round should enable them to address the considerable challenge of scaling up their business to the billion-dollar level." “We understand the ambitions of startups and emerging enterprises and want to help them grow into sustainable businesses. We look forward to working closely with OurCrowd to further develop their platform to support the startup ecosystem both in Singapore and the broader Asian market,” said Janet Young, Managing Director of Group Channels and Digitalization at UOB Group, one of Singapore’s leading banks. “Our investment into this Series C funding for OurCrowd reinforces our commitment to supporting startups and small businesses.” Geoff Levy, Chairman of Monash Private Equity in Sydney, Australia, an OurCrowd investor and member of the OurCrowd Advisory Board, stated that “OurCrowd has grown incredibly fast over the last 3+ years. With this new and important Series C funding, we expect to continue this steep growth trajectory, not only gaining more investors and capital worldwide, but most importantly increasing the ‘crowds’ involvement in sourcing and adding value to our remarkable portfolio of companies.” Published by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on September 21, 2016 © Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2016 5 Comments View comments in rows Update by email about comments talkback POST Comments Your name Please insert your name Content Your comment Thanks You comment was recieved and soon will be published.

Following its success with the 950 SSD, which uses PCIe Gen 3 x4 technology in an M.2 form factor, Samsung has just announced a new line - the 960 series. The new 960 SSDs comes in two flavours - for mainstream home use there's the 960 EVO, and for enterprise and enthusiast use Samsung has its new 960 PRO. Both well exceed the speeds of the current gen of NVMe SSDs, of which there are but three - Intel's 750, Samsung's 950, and the new RD 400 from OCZ. Each of those products deliver nearly identical speeds - in the order of 2200MB/s read and about 1600MB/s write. The new drives from Samsung exceed that by making better use of available bandwidth. They still use four PCIe lanes, so we were a little surprised to learn that there was headroom there, which Samsung is exploiting. READ NEXT: One Minute Review: Seagate Innov8 Samsung claims that the 960 PRO will deliver peak sequential read speeds of 3500MB/s and read speeds of 2100MB/s. That's a huge gain over the current gen of NVMe drives. The 960 PRO series is also optimised for durability and a longer lifetime, in line with its SATA Pro series design. The 960 PRO will ship in capacities of 512GB, 1TB and 2TB. The more consumer-focussed 960 EVO delivers up to 3200MB/s read and 1900 write speeds, which is also a nice jump over the 950 series and its ilk. Capacities will be 250GB, 500GB and 1TB. The 960 EVO carries a three-year warranty and the 960 PRO has a five-year warranty. Both products will ship exclusively as M.2 devices, and we're told a PCIe card version won't be available, nor a U.2 interface version. Australian pricing has not yet been announced.

Now that hybrids have hit their stride in the market, other manufacturers are following suit. We've seen the release of the iPad Pro, the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S and, most recently, the Huawei Matebook -- all devices aimed at swaying business users away from traditional notebooks. Huawei is mostly known for smartphones -- not so much in the U.S., but the company has gained a significant amount of the market in other regions. The Matebook is one of Huawei's first attempts at offering a hybrid tablet aimed at business users. It's an attractive and well-made device, but how well does it compete with the Surface Pro 4? Keyboard A keyboard can make or break a hybrid device. To use the tablet as a traditional notebook, you expect a similar level of usability and convenience. Unfortunately, this is definitely an area where the Matebook falls flat. While it's similar in design to the Galaxy TabPro S and iPad Pro, where the keyboard acts as a dock and stand for the device, but it's far less sturdy than the competition. The Matebook's keyboard design is flimsy, and it's too easy for the display to slip right out of the dock -- which could end up with a broken device. The keys themselves feel mushy with shallow travel, and they're placed too close together, which increases the amount of typing errors. Ultimately, the keyboard on the Matebook feels like an afterthought. The Surface Pro 4 has completely different design -- the keyboard isn't meant to support the device. Instead, you make use of a kickstand on the tablet to adjust viewing angles and to keep the display upright. It's far more convenient, and sturdier, than the portfolio design of the Matebook. It's also a nice feature if you decide to use the device as a tablet, because if you remove the keyboard -- you won't need anything else to keep the display upright. [ Related story: Huawei Matebook: A hybrid tablet that almost competes ] All-in-all, the Surface Pro 4 keyboard and kickstand offer more stability and makes it easier to use in cramped spaces (e.g., on a train or a plane). The keyboard is also comfortable to type on, and won't require much adjustment from your typical notebook or desktop keyboard. The Surface Pro 4 definitely wins in this category. Ports Ports may not be a huge concern for the typical consumer, but for a business user, a hybrid tablet needs to offer a wide array of ports. The Huawei Matebook went the way of the iPad Pro and Galaxy TabPro S by including just one USB Type-C port that also acts as the device's power source. That doesn't leave much room for USB sticks, HDMI connectivity or for extended peripherals such as a wireless mouse, keyboard or external display. Huawei does offer a docking station that expands the device to include two USB 3.0 ports, a VGA port, an HDMI port and a USB Type-C port. However, it's just another piece of equipment you'll need to remember to pack every time you take your device somewhere. The dock adds another $89 to the overall price. [ Related story: 8 reasons to buy an iPad Pro vs. a MacBook (and vice versa)] The Surface Pro 4 also has a compatible dock, but the device itself has enough ports to get you through the day without opting for the dock. It includes a USB 3.0 port, a MicroSD card slot and a mini DisplayPort. If you need some on-board ports, and you don't want to carry around adapters and a docking station, you'll want to opt for the Surface Pro 4. Performance The Matebook offers two options for processors and memory -- you can opt for either an Intel m3 or m5 processor and 4GB or 8GB of RAM. Naturally, if you opt for the Intel m5 with 8GB of RAM, it's going to perform better than the lower end options. However, the configurations aren't on par with the Surface Pro 4 which has multiple configurations, ranging from an Intel m3 mobile processor all the way up to an Intel Core i7. The real dig comes down to the amount of performance for the price. You'll need to shell out around $1,100 for the highest Matebook configuration, with the Intel m5 mobile processor and 8 GB of RAM. For around the same price, possibly a little less depending on where you purchase it, you can get a Surface Pro 4 with an Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of Ram. It's hard to rationalize spending the same amount on a device with lower performance, which means the Surface Pro 4 wins in this category. Design Huawei did not skimp on the design of the Matebook and it's actually more attractive than the Surface Pro 4. They're both high-quality builds, each featuring an aluminum chassis, but the Matebook does have a more modern and sleeker design than the Surface Pro 4. It also doesn't help that Microsoft has -- for the most part -- left body of the Surface Pro mostly unchanged over the years. In contrast to the more tired design of the Surface Pro 4, the Matebook is an eye catching device. The Matebook is a great option if you want an iPad Pro lookalike running Windows 10 instead of iOS.

Now, however, leaked information has reportedly surfaced regarding the company’s graphics chip road map, revealing that AMD’s Navi cards won’t actually arrive until sometime in 2019. The leak also claims there will be three Vega solutions instead of two. If that information is correct, then AMD has pushed Navi back a year. That follows AMD’s recent decision to push Vega product releases back from the second half of 2016 to the first half of 2017 for unknown reasons, although there is speculation that AMD wants the graphics cards to roughly launch in the same window as its first “Summit Ridge” processors for the high-end desktop crowd. The Vega graphics cards will focus on that market as well. Related: AMD’s latest deal with GlobalFoundries could help close the gap with Intel Right now, AMD offers two variants of its current graphics chip: Polaris 10 and Polaris 11. The Radeon RX 480 and Radeon RX 470 cards use the Polaris 10 graphics chip, while the Radeon RX 460 uses the Polaris 11 model. In 2017, there will be products based on three Vega GPU variants: Vega 10, Vega 11, and Vega 20. Products based on the Vega 10 graphics chip are slated to arrive in the first quarter of 2017 for the enthusiast market. This chip will rely on AMD’s 14nm GFX9 graphics core technology, and will sport 64 compute units that encompass 4,096 shader processors. This chip will provide up to 12 TFLOPS of single-precision floating point performance, and will by accompanied by 8GB or 16GB of local next-generation “stacked” HBM video memory. The power requirement is expected to be 225 watts. AMD’s Vega 10 products will compete with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 graphics cards. The company is expected to provide a graphics card with two Vega 10 chips that has a power requirement of around 300 watts. AMD also plans to go after Nvidia’s updated GeForce GTX Titan X card with a product based on its Vega 11 graphics chip. Vega 11 is expected to pack a hefty 6,144 shader processors. One of the more interesting things about the latest leak is the mention of a Vega 20 graphics chip. It will be based on GFX9 cores stemming from GlobalFoundries’ smaller 7nm process technology, allowing AMD to pack more cores into the Vega graphics chip. However, Vega 20 is rumored to have only 4,096 shader processors, indicating that the resulting graphics card may include 32GB of “stacked” HBM2 video memory, a smaller form factor, and a lower power requirement of 150 watts. Vega 20 will reportedly also support PCI Express 4.0. Finally, Navi will arrive in two variants: Navi 10 and Navi 11. While the technical specs are unknown, AMD says that Navi will be scalable and support next-generation video memory, likely HBM3. Given its Vega products were pushed back into 2017, AMD’s move to delay Navi shouldn’t come as a surprise. News regarding the Vega and Navi chips arrive by way of a road map stashed away on a server stationed within AMD. That said, file a good chunk of this information under the rumor umbrella. What we do know is that Vega products are slated for the first half of 2017 as AMD has repeatedly acknowledged, so hopefully a good deal of these rumors will be put to rest toward the beginning of 2017.

Both new daughter cards boast superior density and analog performance, and are optimized for use with Annapolis’ world-class WILDSTAR FPGA Boards and WILD40 EcoSystem for OpenVPX and PCIe. Annapolis boards employ the latest Xilinx UltraScale(+) and Intel Altera Arria 10 & Stratix 10 FPGAs. The single-channel 5.0GSps 10-Bit ADC 12-Bit DAC WFMC+ Card was specially architected for latency-sensitive applications where every nanosecond counts, as with Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) devices in sophisticated Electronic Warfare (EW) systems. It features Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) of 10 bits and Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC) of 12 bits, running at a sample rate of 400-5,000MSps. This rugged card’s ultra-low latency is unequaled in the COTS marketplace. ADC SMA input to DAC SMA output is under 15ns in digital bypass mode, and under 23ns in fabric space mode. The Board Support Interface, which is available for VHDL or Open Project Builder™, includes a built-in bypass delay which can be from 0 to 124 ADC sample clock periods. This allows the user to “walk” the latency out from the minimum digital bypass mode latency to slightly beyond the fabric space latency, providing for a smooth transition between the two modes. The second new mezzanine card – KSII DSP WFMC+ Card – features a Texas Instruments KeyStone II ARM/DSP. The Keystone II includes Quad Cortex-A15 processors running at 1400 MHz and eight C66x DSP Cores running at 1200 MHz. Depending on the application, this rugged card has a few potential advantages: lower power consumption and cost, a close coupling with processing FPGA, and faster time to market. Both mezzanine cards feature Annapolis’ WILD™ FMC+ (WFMC+™) next generation I/O site. WFMC+ is compatible with the FMC/FMC+ specification, but outperforms it. WFMC+ supports 32 HSS and 100 LVDS as opposed to only 24 HSS and 80 LVDS for FMC+. This provides the ability to support higher density ADC and DAC solutions, as well as mezzanine card stacking. www.annapmicro.com Source: Annapolis Micro Systems Advertisement Military Embedded Systems Articles Blogs News White Papers Products McHale Report Radar/Electronic Warfare CyberDefense Rpt. © MMXVI Military Embedded Systems An OpenSystems Media publication.

Cramer's New Book
Wednesday, September 21, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] macOS 10.12 Sierra Notes The first impression of downloading a major OS update is still discouraging. Adam C. Engst: Fujitsu (a TidBITS sponsor) is warning users of the company’s ScanSnap document scanners and accompanying software to avoid upgrading to macOS 10.12 Sierra at this point. Fujitsu has identified a variety of problems associated with its ScanSnap software when running in Sierra. People have been blaming Fujitsu for this, but I wonder whether the issues are instead caused by bugs from Apple’s rewrite of its PDF subsystem, which has also been affecting EagleFiler. (I’ve also updated DropDMG and SpamSieve for Sierra.) Andrew Cunningham and Lee Hutchinson (Hacker News): It has been a long time since the Mac was Apple’s favorite child, and there are places in Sierra (like the Messages app) where it clearly feels like Mac users are getting a second-tier experience compared to people on iOS. Add in the Mac’s stale, aging hardware lineup and Apple’s total lack of communication about it, and there seems to be real problems for the Mac as a platform. […] When Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion dropped older Macs, there were clear reasons why the hardware that went unsupported was being left behind (PowerPC CPUs, 32-bit Intel CPUs, and 32-bit EFI and driver limitations, respectively). In Sierra, aging hardware and drivers are a factor—drivers especially, since a lot of the GPUs, networking hardware, and chipsets in those older machines have long since been forgotten by the hardware companies that made them—but there are no hard-and-fast hardware cutoffs. I’ve seen many attempts to define a strictly hardware-related cutoff, but none of them quite work. […] If you don’t want universal clipboard to work, you can head into the General preference pane and disable Handoff. As best we can tell, there’s no way to keep Handoff but not the universal clipboard. […] The main change in Notes is a real-time collaboration option. Hit the button at the top of the screen and enter some Apple IDs to invite others to view and edit the note with you. You can send anyone you’ve invited a link via one of many different apps or services, including Mail, Messages, AirDrop, Twitter, Facebook, and more. […] The Gatekeeper options in System Preferences will no longer let you choose to allow any and all apps by default. The only two options are to allow signed apps and Mac App Store apps (still the default in Sierra, as it always has been), or just those from the Mac App Store. […] In discussing APFS checksumming directly with Apple, the company told Ars that user data integrity is a top priority, and that the decision to checksum metadata but not file data (and other major architectural decisions made around Sierra) are driven by decades of data on what does and does not work well with file system design. […] One tack Apple didn’t take is writing multiple copies of an object’s metadata to disk. The reasoning given is simply that solid state disks offer no real way for the operating system to ensure that the multiple copies would be written to different physical NAND cells—and that concurrent writes are in fact often grouped into the same cell. Writing two redundant copies to the same physical location kind of defeats the purpose of having two redundant copies. […] Disk Utility was redesigned with El Capitan, and the few tweaks Apple has made are unlikely to appease you if you miss the old version. Stephen Hackett: There is one big difference between these sets of results worth pointing out. Spotlight can surface email attachments, while Siri can just show what’s in my user folder. […] Lastly, shared clipboard content is only available for two minutes. This helps make Universal Clipboard feel much more intentional. In my month or so of using it, I’ve never once felt surprised at my devices doing the “wrong” thing. […] This does screw with clipboard managers on the Mac. I use Alfred for this, and it only sees Universal Clipboard content after I paste it somewhere on the Mac. In short, I can’t use Alfred as a running clipboard history for my iPhone or iPad when they are in range of my Mac. This isn’t a big deal, but something to be aware of if you use a clipboard manager. […] This is one of the features Apple ships that feels like it was designed in a bubble. Universal Clipboard is great if you work in a very intentional way. If you’re at your Mac and go to pick up your iPad to finish a task, it’s great. If you share your tablet with someone else in the house, however, you can very be quickly in the situation where devices in the same location are over-riding each other’s clipboards. Roman Loyola: To use Universal Clipboard, you copy from your Mac or iOS device just as you normally would. Then go to your recipient device, and perform a paste. If you’re pasting on a Mac, you may see a progress bar indicator. On iOS, you see a message window stating the device your paste is coming from. I did find one hiccup involving Microsoft Word. When copying text from a Word document, it pasted in iOS 10 Notes as Chinese text. Jason Snell: What I’m saying is, the Universal Clipboard feature is really cool and clever when it works, and I wish it worked more reliably. I’ll keep trying to use it. I hope it becomes more reliable as time goes by. […] Still, I gave it a whirl. I turned on iCloud syncing for my Desktop and Documents folder (you have to sync them both), knowing I’d be watching a few gigabyte-sized audio projects slowly uploaded. What happened was a bit more disturbing: The entire contents of my iMac’s Desktop disappeared. This turned out to be a function of the fact that I’d already turned on syncing a MacBook Pro, and rather than merging the contents of the laptop’s Desktop with my iMacs, Sierra created a new folder and moved all the items on my Desktop into it. (The same happened to my Documents folder.) So my files were still there and uploading, but I had to drag them back out onto the proper Desktop and restore them to their proper positions. […] Sierra also offers a feature that lets your Mac arbitrarily delete any of the items in your Desktop and Documents folders that have been stored in iCloud. […] Here’s what happened: I was editing a podcast in Apple’s Logic Pro X, and my project was stored on the Desktop. All of a sudden, the voice of one of my podcast panelists simply vanished from the mix. I quit and re-launched Logic, only to be told that the file in question was missing. Sure enough, a visit to Finder revealed that Sierra had “optimized” my storage and removed that file from my local drive. I’ll grant you, the file was a couple of weeks old, and very large as most audio files are. But I was also actively using it within a Logic project. Apparently that didn’t count for anything? […] To add insult to injury, at the time my files were deleted, my hard drive had approximately 80GB of free space. Why were the files deleted? I have no idea, but I suspect a bug in how Sierra was viewing the stock internal SSD of my iMac, because it’s also warned me that it didn’t have enough space to back up a 64GB iPhone with more than 100GB free, and gave me a “you’re about to run out of disk space” warning with 60GB free. So not only did Sierra remove files that I was using, it did so without any necessity. Adam C. Engst: For those struggling to free up space, particularly on a notebook Mac with relatively little internal flash storage, Optimized Storage sounded great, at least if you don’t mind paying for online storage in iCloud Drive. And while it could be a great boon for such people, it turns out to be a somewhat confusing collection of seemingly unrelated features, burdened by one of the stranger interfaces that Apple has produced in recent years. […] Amusingly, Microsoft Windows has been capable of automatically deleting files from its Recycle Bin at least since Windows 98, although back then it deleted older files when adding a newer file to the Recycle Bin caused it to exceed a user-specified size. I’m surprised it took Apple this long to get to the point of taking the trash out for the user. […] My second warning is that turning off Desktop and Documents folder syncing is stressful. When you do this, in System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options, Sierra tells you that all your files will be available only in iCloud, which seems wrong: if you’re turning off syncing, you’re doing so because you want them locally. However, that dialog is followed immediately by another that tells you that you can recover your files from iCloud Drive. Tom Bridge: This is a great concept, designed to save space on your SSD-based Macs that are very definitely space constrained, but there are pitfalls. I am glad that Rich Trouton has made available his configuration profile that blocks this setting for organizations to use on their computers. I’m not interested in turning this feature on any time soon. Rich Trouton: Siri is a welcome addition to macOS Sierra, but in certain environments it’s a service which needs to be disabled. For those Mac admins who need to do this, here are the relevant keys. Jesper: On macOS Sierra, when you click the play/pause button on attached headphones and Siri is Off, an alert comes up asking you whether you want to enable Siri. Every. Single. Time. No matter what you do. Keir Thomas: With the macOS Sierra update Siri finally makes it onto the Mac. However, did you know about the following Mac-specific tricks? Nick Heer: It’s a little frustrating that this kind of stuff is gated behind a spoken Siri command. Not only does this require talking to your computer — a task which I still find a little bit weird — it also means that the computer must interpret what you’re saying absolutely perfectly for this feature to be of any use. David Pogue: Siri on the Mac—that is really big. Siri is far more complete and powerful than Cortana is on Windows, and having voice control of your computer is a game-changer. Lloyd Chambers: Unlike the past 3 or 4 releases, macOS Sierra is probably safe to go ahead with right away. Finally, relief from the Apple quality failure onslaught. Lloyd Chambers: Clicking on my Sent mailbox (and others) results in delays of up to 30 seconds in showing the mailbox, along with multiple rainbow beach balls. The system has had ample time to do whatever it is it does after a system upgrade. Then trying to open one message may take another 20 seconds. Apple mail pins a CPU or more during this time. Peter Maurer: TIL that Icon Composer uses Garbage Collection and thus can’t run on Sierra. Dammit, I was still using that, mostly for quick scaling. See also: Alex Guyot and Rene Ritchie. Previously: Testing for macOS 10.12 Sierra. Update (2016-09-23): Andrew Abernathy: Well, Aperture is pretty broken in Sierra. Just switching to the Info tab gets an uncaught exception; “continue in an inconsistent state?” Update (2016-09-24): I continue to run into PDF and Preview issues. I’m also having problems with new application windows being added in tabs despite disabling that in the preferences. Josh Marshall: When I did that everything disappeared. So all the files on my Desktop were gone. All the files in my Documents folder were gone. […] The guy on the line explained to me that the system was really more intended for users who had a single desktop and iOS devices rather than trying to use this syncing function on more than one desktop. Update (2016-09-27): Benjamin Mayo: I’ve barely used macOS Siri and I already have a list of niggles and unfinished edges. I’m even ignoring things that are potentially debatable and just focusing on things that are unequivocally wrong. […] There is nowhere to check Universal Clipboard connectivity so I’m basically left in the dark about how to fix this because it fails silently. If it was done properly, it would flag up a ‘Universal Clipboard Failed’ alert with details of the error. As it is, I have no recourse apart from crossing my fingers and hoping it sorts itself out. Update (2016-09-28): Keir Thomas: We’ve already described macOS Sierra’s new window-snapping feature but we didn’t realize Sierra also introduces a new feature that lets you ultra-quickly expand windows to the edge of the screen.

Thanks to TidBITS for finding the relevant menu command: Window → Merge All Windows. The greatest disappointment for me is the lack of data integrity in APFS. Perhaps it would have been difficult/impossible to implement on non-ECC systems? Still, it would be nice to at least have a command-line flag for Mac Pros... Michael Tsai September 23, 2016 9:44 AM @Roy There should also be a Show Tab Bar command in the View menu, and you can set the global default in the Dock pane of System Preferences. stephane September 23, 2016 11:44 AM @michael The "Show Tab Bar" menu item will either be in the View or Window menu: - if you have a View menu, it will be here - if you don't have a View menu, it will be in the Window menu. @roy The universal tab support is not limited to NSDocument-based apps. That's the issue with this option which should have been opt-in in the first place. If you have an application with just a NSWindowController, you can be impacted by this undesired feature as soon as you have a View or Window menu. And there's also a common problem for NSDocument based applications having secondary windows (even Apple's own system applications) Michael Tsai September 23, 2016 11:51 AM @stephane Yeah, Apple did not really go through all their apps. For example, the only way to get tabbed viewer windows in Mail is to merge existing windows; the + button doesn’t appear.

Picture taken April 22, 2016. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson Reports suggest that the Microsoft Surface Book 2 will sport a 4K resolution and 3D display. It is expected to be launched with top-of-the-class specs with an update Windows operating system, high-resolution display and a new USB port. The gadget could be lighter and slimmer compared to its predecessor. Reports suggest that the Microsoft Surface Book 2 will be announced in October during an event and will be released in 2017, writes HNGN. All the information is based on rumours and leaked reports. Microsoft has not confirmed anything officially. The 2017 release of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 is mainly because of the Intel Kaby Lake processors and Windows 10 Redstone 2 update, both are not expected before end of this year. The 4K display technology is also reportedly delaying the launch. The Redstone 2 update will include features such as OneClip, Working Sets and Office Hub. Microsoft has decided to provide only the best specs and features to the Surface Book 2. It is ready to wait a bit more than hurry up the release. The Kaby Lake chipsets are expected to be way faster than the existing Intel Skylake micro architecture-based processors. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 will also get the USB 3.1 support and may be launched along with the Surface Pro 5, reports Vine Report. Microsoft is offering a US$150 (AU$199) and Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Thus, the Surface Book is now available for US$1,349 (AU$1,788). It has an 8GB RAM, 128GB storage and Core i5 processor. The discount offer is valid till Oct. 1. According to The Bitbag, Microsoft offers discounts either when sales are constantly declining or the company is about to launch a new product. This has led many fans to believe that the Surface Book 2 will be released soon.

The penny-stock success story, which surged sevenfold after hiring the cyber security guru in May, just slumped 42 percent over two days, capped after the New York Stock Exchange refused to list shares for a planned merger. Its market value is $48.9 million, down from $104 million on July 7. The decision put a damper on the Harrison, New York-based firm’s plans to acquire D-Vasive Inc., sending MGT’s stock down 25 percent to $1.89 on Tuesday. The drop compounded the company’s 23 percent decline on Monday sparked by a subpoena from the Securities Exchange Commission requesting “certain information.” It’s been anything but a smooth ride for MGT, which added $90 million in market value in May after saying it would hire McAfee as chief executive to aid the transition from video-game maker to cybersecurity firm. The stock showed remarkable resilience in the following weeks despite the company not generating any revenue -- never dropping below $2.24 a share -- until selling this week sent it tumbling. “We are determined to consummate a transaction that brings our cybersecurity technologies to market in order to solve the pressing privacy and security issues that society faces,” McAfee said today in a statement. MGT intended to issue 43.8 million shares to acquire D-Vasive, which would almost triple the number of MGT shares outstanding. The listing of new shares to acquire a private company could require the issuer to meet the same requirements needed for a first-time listing, according to the NYSE website. NYSE spokesman Brendan McManus declined to comment on the decision to reject the proposed share issuance. The stock has been a battlefield of fans and detractors of MGT, with bulls pointing to McAfee’s hiring and the pending acquisition of D-Vasive, a Wyoming company that MGT says is developing “anti-spy” applications. Meanwhile, bears pushed short interest on MGT’s stock to the highest in history in late July. The measure is still more than double its two-year average. This isn’t the first time in recent weeks MGT’s plan to capitalize further on McAfee’s name has run into issues. McAfee earlier this month sued Intel Corp. for the right to use his name in new ventures, saying Intel warned him that any use of his name will infringe on the company’s trademarks that it acquired when it bought his company in 2010, according to his complaint in Manhattan federal court.  MGT plans to rename itself John McAfee Global Technologies. On Monday, MGT received a subpoena from the SEC requesting information from the company. In a statement, the MGT said in a statement that it has “no indication or reason to believe that the company is or will be the subject of any enforcement proceedings.” Current CEO, Robert Ladd, when interviewed by Bloomberg earlier this month, wouldn’t provide any details of MGT’s planned business beyond saying it intended to develop its own technology. He declined to comment about the NYSE’s decision to block MGT’s share listing. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The display remains the most expensive component, costing an estimated $43, followed by an Intel modem and other baseband chips worth an estimated total of $33.90. Apple's quad-core A10 Fusion chip is the third most expensive item on the bill of materials, costing an estimated $26.90. Meanwhile, the larger 1,920 mAh battery is said to cost just $2.50. The larger rear-facing iSight camera and improved 7-megapixel front-facing FaceTime camera cost a combined $19.90, according to IHS Markit. Electromechanical components, including the Taptic Engine, antennas, connectors, microphones, and stereo speakers, cost an estimated $16.70 combined. iPhone 7's 2GB of RAM supplied by Samsung, and 32GB of flash storage supplied by SK Hynix, are estimated to cost a combined $16.40. An audio codec and audio amplifier supplied by Cirrus Logic, an NFC controller supplied by NXP, a Bosch Sensortec-made barometer, along with an accelerometer, gyroscope, Touch ID, proximity sensor, and other sensors, cost an estimated $14 altogether. The accessories included in the iPhone 7 box, including a Lightning-to-USB cable, Lightning-to-3.5mm audio adapter, EarPods with a Lightning connector, and 5W USB power adapter cost an estimated $11.80 combined. IHS raises Apple's total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 to $224.80 after adding $5 in "basic manufacturing costs" related to assembly, insertion, and testing. A 32GB iPhone 7 Plus costs $649 as a point of comparison. However, the bill of materials does not factor in costs related to, among other things, research and development, software, licensing costs, and transportation. The accuracy of the component costs is also questionable. Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he has never seen a cost breakdown that is "anywhere close to being accurate," adding that they are generally "much different than the reality." At least in comparison to IHS estimates for previous iPhones, the iPhone 7's bill of materials is seemingly costlier than the iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, and iPhone 5, each estimated to start at $200, and the iPhone SE at $160.

Rating: 33 Votes Small White Car 8 weeks ago I know people moan about how these prices aren't accurate don't reflect other costs, but I find the year-to-year comparisons to be quite informative. It doesn't matter what the actual numbers are, it still shows that Apple is striving to squeeze more into these phones than ever before at the expense of their margins. And that's interesting info. Rating: 22 Votes ftaok 8 weeks ago These cost breakdowns are always so irrelevant. They don't tell much of a story at all. So all of those parts that Apple buys, like the Intel modem for $33.90, doesn't cost Intel that much to make. So let's pull a number of of the air and say that it costs Intel $13.24 for the modem. Then whoever is supplying the stuff that Intel has to buy to make the modem isn't selling at cost either. Eventually, it's all free since the air, water, sand, etc to make all of the stuff is available at your local beach. Apple so greedy! I cringe every September when this post comes out to imply that the iPhone costs $200 to make. Rating: 22 Votes danakin 8 weeks ago Before people lose their spit over how much profit the Cupertonians rake in per device, stop to consider costs for: * Research and Development * Marketing * Shipping * Taxes * Legal * Regulatory compliance * Facilities (leases and sundry expenses) * Salaries and benefits * Warehousing * Product testing * Event planning and management * Internal and Retail training I'm sure there are others but those are at the top of my head. Also if customers and/or suckers (depends on your perspective) choose to dole what what they're asking for, then keep charging what the market will bear. Capitalism folks! Rating: 22 Votes now i see it 8 weeks ago + 500 million R&D Rating: 18 Votes LordVic 8 weeks ago GREEDY APPLE!!!!! now that that's out of the system: we're about to get inundated wiht hundreds of post who somehow think that this in any ways is reflective of the price we pay and that we're all being "ripped off" you cannot ever equate raw hardware costs with retail pricing. Hardware costs are only a portion of the total costs that go into each device. the fact that the iPhone 7 actually comes with industry standard hardware finally (2gb ram, and the 32gb base storage) and is clearly costing Apple more to produce from a hardware standpoint, it's clear that Apple is lowering margins on iPhone sales, which is kind of the opposite of "greedy" Rating: 14 Votes Cuban Missles 8 weeks ago The cost estimates does not include OS or Software. It does not include marketing and other expenses. It does not include taxes, tariffs, shipping. It does not include profit and investor return. It does not include R&D. When you do, I believe that Apple states gross margins around 40% putting the per phone closer to $400. Rating: 13 Votes Gasu E. 8 weeks ago Cue the "greedy Apple" illiterati. Rating: 12 Votes garirry 8 weeks ago You'd think that with half a trillion dollars, they might use a little more of their own money for research and stuff and make the iPhone cost closer to its production cost.

It's not without flaws and Asus did have to cut some corners here and there, but that was expected from a device that sells for this little. The good sleek and light, decent keyboard, can handle daily tasks and multimedia activities, lasts for a long while on a charge, very affordable The bad miniaturized ports, erratic touchpad, limited on-board storage space Hi everyone, Mike here and in this video we’re going to talk about the Asus EeeBook X205TA / X205, which is a brand new compact laptop selling for only $199 (actually, it’s even cheaper now than initially announced). There are a few other notebooks that go for around the same amount of money these days, like the 11 inch Acer Chromebooks. But this one comes with Windows 8.1 and that allows it to run most of the software you’re already familiar with from your other computers. Well, at least to some extent, as the X205 is not a power-horse, not by far. But we’ll get to that in a few second. First though, check out the specs sheet, so you’ll know what to expect from this laptop, and also the video review, if you don’t feel like reading the block of text (however, some details are not included in the video). The Asus EeeBook X205TA is a compact and affordable Windows laptop The X205TA is not yet available in stores at the time of this post, but the unit I’ve tested is pretty much identical to what you’ll be able to buy in a few weeks. Asus EeeBook X205TA spec sheet Screen 11.6 inch, 1366 x 768 px, TN Hardware Intel Atom BayTrail-T Z3745D CPU and Intel HD graphics Memory 2 GB RAM Storage 32 GB flash-storage Connectivity Wireless N, Bluetooth Ports 2x USB, micro-HDMI, microSD card reader, proprietary PSU, headphone jack Battery 38 Wh OS Windows 8.1 Size 288 mm or 11.3 in (L) x 196 mm or 7.7 in (W) x 18 mm or 0.70 in (H) Weight 954 g (2.10 lbs) Others stereo speakers, available in several colors, webcam The Video Review Hardware and daily use The EeeBook X205TA is primarily meant for light everyday activities. It can then handle browsing between a couple of different tabs, watching video content and listening to music, editing some texts and maybe some pictures as well. It can run Microsoft’s Office suite (does come with a Trial version of Office that requires activation and the final release versions will include a 12 month Office 365 Personal license) and software like Adobe Photoshop if you want to, just make sure you’re not going to ask too much out of it, as it will choke easily if pushed. And that’s because this EeeBook is built on an low-power high-efficiency hardware platform, with an Intel Z3745D processor, bundled with 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage, which can actually become a problem quite fast. Both the RAM and eMMC storage are soldered and NOT upgradeable. The thing is you’re not left with a lot of spare space after having Windows installed (roughly 14 GB), so Asus definitely had to cut a corner here to meet the low price tag. And that leaves you with two options: either use the included cloud space offered for free in Asus’s WebStorage environment, or expand the storage space with the help of a microSD card. To be frank, I was a bit disappointed this laptop does not support standard sized SD cards, that would have been useful for downloading pictures from my cameras while on the go, but that’s probably not such a big deal for most potential buyers. Overall though, the X205 is a fairly capable little fellow and it can do a lot of things for you. The daily experience is enhanced by the loud and punchy speakers placed on the belly, but towards the front of the chassis and by the fact that this runs completely noiseless, since it houses no fans and no moving parts inside. The EeeBook X205TA is the modern netbook: faster, thinner, lighter than before, and at the same time noiseless The Wi-Fi chip is fairly capable of well. It can’t match my Internet speed, going to only about 30 Mbps near the router, but at least the speed and signal strength don’t drop away fast as you step a bit further. I was able to stream 1080p video content with no buffering and download all sorts of things of the Internet without feeling slow, and in my book that’s good enough for a computer that only sells for $199. The laptop’s belly has no cooling cuts in it, and none are in fact needed, which leads to a simple and beautiful design. You can take it apart by unscrewing the 12 or so regular Philips screws that hold in place and that gives you access to the internals. However, it won’t help much, as everything seems to be soldered on the motherboard. In fact, you can see how small the MB is and how most of this laptop is occupied by the battery, which is also hold in place by a few screws and could be replaced down the line, if needed (and if Asus or third parties will provide replacements). I was hoping to be able to upgrade the storage, but there seem to be no dedicated storage stick like on some of the other mini-laptops I’ve tested, so there’s no way to up the 32 GBs through a hardware upgrade. At least none that I can tell of, and that’s a bit annoying, as the 32 GB of space is hardly sufficient for a Windows 8.1 laptop. You could try to go the Linux road. I planed to try Ubuntu or Mint on this myself, but my Linux knowledge is virtually null and I did not have the time to do it this time. Hopefully in the next few weeks. One final thing I was looking to mention here are temperatures and performance under load. The X205’s case remains cool under light use and the temperatures won’t reach for the stars when running the Prime95+Furmark stress-test either. You can see the numbers in the pictures below. It could be worth mentioning that the internals get to about 80 C under stress and both the CPU and the GPU run and sub-default frequencies (around 900 Mhz for the CPU and 300 Mhz for the GPU), but these should not matter much for the average buyer Asus targets with this laptop, who should understand from starters the the X205 is meant for light casual activities, and not serious chores or multitasking. Keyboard and trackpad The typing experience is not bad on the X205 and is helped by a fairly good keyboard and a nice typing position, thanks to the roomy palm-rest and the laptop’s low profile. The keys are firm and offer decent travel and feedback, for this size range of course, but they do feel a bit cheap to touch, plasticky. And besides these, the layout is vertically cramped, as Asus opted for shorter rectangular keys and not the square keys I was expecting, and the arrow keys are small, just like on the older Asus EeeBooks launched a few years ago. The shorter keys do leave room for the spacious palm-rest mentioned before and an oversized trackpad, which I do appreciate. In everyday use though, the latter proved occasionally erratic and moody, although it worked alright most of the time. But sometimes ti double clicks all by itself or sends the cursor flying to the edges, and these mostly happen when you put the computer under a heavier loud than it can handle. Even so, this is one of the few aspects where the X205 needs extra tweaking. Luckily, the jumpy cursor is usually a software problem and could, at least in theory, be addressed by future drivers updates. We should hold our judgement for further reviews, just keep the potential issues in mind. Design and build quality Now, let’s take a few steps back and have a wider look at this thing. The EeeBook weighs just under 1 kilo, which is about 2.1 pounds. It’s also thin and has a compact footprint, so it will easily fit in a backpack or even a bag. And besides these, it’s fairly tough and definitely doesn’t look bad either. If you’ll grab it firmly and squeeze it, you’ll heard the creaks associated with cheap plastic machines, but judging by how much this thing cost, I’d say it’s more than adequately built and finished. The entire case is made out of soft matte plastic that spreads across the lid, the interior and the belly, with the screen’s bezel being the only black element on this laptop, and Asus will offer the X205 in a few different colors. The materials feel nice to the touch and there’s little to complain about the finishing quality. However, If we’re to get picky, I do have two nits to mention: first of all, the case catches smudges and finger oil easily, which are especially visible on this dark blue version, and second, the lid-cover does flex a little bit, but that doesn’t seem to affect the screen’s integrity in any way, although pressing the lid hard does translate in ripples on the screen, so you might want to get a sleeve for this thing when carrying it in your backpack and be careful not to have many heavy objects sitting on it. And there is one other thing that I’ve noticed: the laptop’s rubber feet seem poorly made and I fear they are going to wear off easily. Time will tell, but again, a minor aspect. Display There’s an 11.6 inch display on this laptop, with 1366 x 768 px resolution, a glossy finishing and a TN panel. The latter translates in rather poor vertical viewing angles, with the Costner and colors quickly fading away, which is characteristic for low priced screens, but even so, as long as you get to look at it heads-on, this aspect shouldn’t bother you much. The screen leans back to about 130-140 degrees, which is not perfect, but will do, and actually lifts itself up on two small plastic feet, which leaves more space underneath the laptop (better cooling) and slightly raises the keyboard (better typing position). I just hope these feet won’t break in time, but they seem solid, so there’s no reason to worry much. The screen lifts up on two small plastic feet In fact, I for one was fairly happy with the display. If you’ll look at the numbers below you might say otherwise. The measured contrast is appalling, the screen having trouble displaying accurate blacks at high brightness. The colors might sound awful as well and the laptop does have a very cool (as in blueish) glow, which could be addressed with the included Splendid app if you enjoy warmer images. But the truth is, when you’re actually using this thing in practice, it’s not going to be that bad as the numbers are suggesting. Panel HardwareID: AU Optronics AUO235C; Coverage: sRGB 58% , NTSC 41%,  SdobeRGB 43%; measured gamma: 2.3 ; max brightness in the middle of the screen: 247 cd/m2 on power; contrast at max brightness: 90:1 (?); white point: 7900 K; black on max brightness: 2.78 cd/m2; average DeltaE: 8.48 uncalibrated, 4.37 calibrated . Asus could have gone with a matte finishing, since this is not a touchscreen anyway, but they decided instead, which is going to affect bright-light legibility. They’re using the same approach on the C200 Chromebook, with whom the x205 might actually share the screen. The screen is a notch better than what’s you’re getting on another $200 computer, the Acer C720 Battery Life I did mention earlier that the EeeBook X205 does last for a long while on a charge, and that was no underestimation. There’s a 38 Wh battery inside this laptop and paired with the efficient hardware, this translated for me in about 10 hours of daily use, that includes browsing through a few different tabs, writing several thousand words, watching a few Youtube clips once in a while and occasionally listening to some music, with Wi-Fi ON, screen at about 60% and the default Power profile (you don’t have Power Modes on this platform). I was also able to loop a 720p .mkv file for about 9 hours in WMP-HC and stream the Big Bunny HD 1080p clip from Youtube for nearly 8 hours. On top of that, the laptop can last in stand-by for weeks and Intel’s Always Connected ability will make sure that all your updates and emails are waiting for you the moment you decide to bring this one out of sleep. It comes with a very compact 10Wh brick and a long cable. Charging the battery from 5 to 99% takes about 2 hours and 15 minutes, providing you’re not doing anything on it during this time. Big battery, compact charger with a long cable – a winning combo Pricing and availability Update: The X205TA is now available in the US and it’s actually cheaper than initially predicted. See this link for details. $199 in the US/CA , 199 euro across the pond and £169.99 in the UK. That’s how much you’ll have to pay for the EeeBook X205TA , starting October 14th, when this little fellow will start shipping. That that was bogus. I can’t say for sure when this thing will actually hit the stores. My Asus contact said (in the first part oc October) that “it’s not coming anytime soon”, but couldn’t provide even a rough estimate.  However, it might reach other countries sooner. Wrap-up At the end of the day, Asus actually did a great job with the EeeBook X205TA, which checks most of the right boxes. After using it for the last week, there’s a single thing that really annoyed me, albeit only occasionally: the trackpad. I was also not happy with the microSD and microHDMI slots (would have preferred full-size versions) or the fingerprint magnet case, but these are definitely not deal-breakers. The limited storage space could be though, you’ll really need to properly organize your content and leave the included partition for Windows, if you don’t want to have to reinstall it fresh once every couple of months. But that’s about it, there’s only that little to complain about on a 200 bucks laptop. That’s why I believe this thing can be a solid travel companion, especially since it’s light, sturdy and lasts for a long while on each charge. It will also do good as a laptop for kids and school, because it’s so affordable that you won’t mind as much if it gets dropped or it breaks. And last but not least, it could be an option for anyone looking for a small inexpensive computer that runs Windows and all the compatible software. There’s not much to complain about the X205TA, that’s why this could be a great Windows-running mini-laptop if you’re on a very tight budget Just make sure you understand what the Atom platform inside this X205 can do and what it can’t and adjust your expectations accordingly. Otherwise, it might prove too slow, but if you do plan on using it for light daily tasks, there’s imh no other more capable mini-laptop you can buy brand-new for $200 these days. Not even a Chromebook. But I’m confident Asus won’t be running free in this segment for long. HP already announced their Stream notebooks for the end of the year, and the other manufacturers will soon follow, which is great for us, the average consumers. Cheap windows laptops are coming back. Netbooks are coming back, only better than before. Are they something many will be interested in? Perhaps, perhaps not… We’ll see. Anyway, there you have it, these were my impressions on the Asus EeeBook X205TA. Let me know what you think about it in the comments section below and post your questions as well, if any, I’ll be around to reply. And if you’re in the market for an affordable and compact laptop, you should definitely check out this post as well.

Or it’s built-in? Thanks Reply Andrei Girbea October 12, 2014 at 1:13 pm Built IN. It’s specified in the review.. Reply FILA November 17, 2014 at 9:39 pm no, only the storage was specified in the review where its soldered, nothing was mentioned about the RAM. I was wondering the same thing. I would of bought this and upgraded the RAM but looks like you cant. Sucks. And I doubt using a memory card for RAM will be fast enough wil November 28, 2014 at 12:28 am Thanks for the review was worried fits my needs in front of store now 99us plus 32gb sandisk 9us !!! Henry January 5, 2015 at 8:42 pm I’ve purchased 3 of this Asus X205T and love everything about it, You mention that the 32GB Flash Storage is NOT upgradable, Is that really True? Bumber, maybe there another possible way????? and If i purchase any microSD Card that is maybe anywehre from 64GB to 128GB will the Flash storage of the X205T continue to start using and microSD when the built-in 32GB storage goes to end of line or gets Low on Storage Space. I tried doing all the Window Update on the OS and it ended up using all the Flash Storage and the Windows Update was NOT even finish yet but the good news after using all the storage is that the OS didn’t really Slow Down you can still use the laptop, you just can’t store or install anything else. So…do you know if the microSD card that you attach can actually extend the Life of the current Factory built-in Flash Storage? Andrei Girbea January 6, 2015 at 1:50 pm Yes, the eMMC is not upgradeable from waht I know. And no, the system won’t automaticaly use the microSD card when it runs out of internal space. You’ll have to carefully manage the space yourself and store all your content on the card. Windows updates eats a ton of space, that’s true, but I can’t see a way past that, other than peform only some of the updates.

I did have a 64GB of USB Flash Drive and that did get recognized during all the Windows updates.OR I meant it did NOT continue and extend the Life of the built-in 32GB Flash Storage. Mike March 8, 2016 at 12:04 am As Andrei said, it’s mentioned in the review that the RAM and flash storage are not upgradeable: “Both the RAM and eMMC storage are soldered and NOT upgradeable.” What you can do is use a high-capacity Class 10 and install most of your programs there. Some won’t install to an SD card, but most will, including Firefox, Opera, Corel PaintShop Pro X6, LibreOffice, Dropbox, Filezilla, Notepad ++, Foxit PDF Reader, Avira Antivirus and others. Certain programs won’t, and you can’t easily run a virtual machine from the SD card. Overall, it’s a fast computer. My next project: Install Linux (LXLE distro) on this. Richard Sachs March 6, 2016 at 6:20 am Just bought one to replace my HP Stream 11, which I use for travel. Slightly disappointing; 1 as the screen cannot be dimmed all the way and 2, if you do turn the screen off, the computer will go to sleep. I listen to Pandora, much the same as a clock radio, and I like the screen off or at least “auto-off” in a few minutes. The power management does not give you this option as does the HP. Same Windows 8.1 but different options 🙁 I’m ready to put it on ebay! Any help? Reply Jason October 13, 2014 at 2:03 am Excellent review Mike. I’m interested in the 64GB version of this. What are the three LED’s on the left front of the keyboard? I’m hoping one is a drive activity light. TIA Reply Andrei Girbea October 13, 2014 at 2:22 am The first one on the left is drive, the middle one is battery and I can’t remember what the last one is 🙁 . The 64 GB version is a better buy imh as well, but it depends on how much it’s going to cost. $229 would be fair, but not more. Reply Ganesh November 12, 2014 at 4:36 am Bro can I ask you about the charger. Is it like most notebooks where the brick will allow 240v and also 110v that is used in the US? I live in a country with 240v but I am going to US for a holiday and plan to buy the x205. Hope you can help me on this Mathias October 13, 2014 at 12:43 pm Where did you get the release date from? You’re the only one with one, so just wondering Reply Andrei Girbea October 13, 2014 at 3:50 pm Some of the Italian websites reported on this release date a while ago, after a press release in their countries. Knowing Asus though, I’d expect delays. Reply Mathias October 14, 2014 at 2:11 am I’ve been waiting for bay trail laptops for a while now, and this one is really cool. Also badly in need of a laptop, so please do update when you get more info on availability :D! Andrei Girbea October 14, 2014 at 11:22 pm I asked my Asus contact today about this 14th of October date and he couldn’t give a definite answer. All he knew is that over here in Romania it won’t be available this month, but it could be available earlier in the western countries. Will get back if I find out anything. Mathias October 18, 2014 at 9:09 pm A french guy on YouTube told me that “F205TA-BING-FD019B” – A 4GB version of the Eeebook x205 had shown up on several sites in France, noting that it would arrive in the following days. I’m guessing early November, as many sites, including Windows’ blog, notes that it’ll start shipping “in November”. Mathias October 13, 2014 at 12:44 pm Hey, how do you know October 14th is the release date? Can’t seem to find it anywhere else. Reply Fábio October 14, 2014 at 12:01 am Hi. Very informative review, however I still have a few questions. Will the microSD go completely in, so we don’t have to worry about it breaking off by accident? How well does the microphone (and camera) perform when using something like the popular Skype? Is the power supply universal? Or is it standard micro USB like most phones and tables? Reply Andrei Girbea October 14, 2014 at 11:19 pm the MicroSD card goes all in. The Mic and the camera are, well, decent, but not great. Will handle Skype decently in a properly lit room, but if you’re in darker environement everything is going to look noisy and grainy. The Power supply is not universal, it has a proprietary tip (NOT microUSB). Reply Interested in this buddy October 17, 2014 at 4:52 pm Hi. What is maximum capacity of microSD card this laptop supports, and in what speeds, or classes? Reply Andrei Girbea October 17, 2014 at 6:00 pm 64 GB from what I’ve been told, but haven’t tried it, I don’t have such a big card available. Should handle Class 10 without a problem Reply :) October 17, 2014 at 6:12 pm Thx. Any news about launch date in europe? Andrei Girbea October 18, 2014 at 11:43 am no really, not for now hshs October 17, 2014 at 4:59 pm Hello can you have review for HP stream 13 and which is better in case of performance thx Reply Andrei Girbea October 17, 2014 at 6:02 pm I’ll try but can’t promise. Not sure if the HP Streams will be available over here. Performance wise though, they are goign to be close, since they are built on similar hardware Reply MC October 19, 2014 at 2:11 am Hi, thanks a lot for this really great review. Does the screen look really bad? I want to use it for watch few videos sometimes and I’m a bit scared by the x205’s screen quality Reply Andrei Girbea October 19, 2014 at 1:39 pm Depends how you define “Bad”. As long as you’ll watch it straight ON, should be OK. From and angle though, viewing angles are bad. And as you can see from my tests, blacks aren’t great on this and are mostly displayed as dark-grays, that’s why the contrast is poor. Reply SteamDine October 20, 2014 at 10:31 am Excellent review. Question is – will it be linux friendly out of the box , and accept Ubuntu or Mint distribution instead of Win8.1 ? Reply Andrei Girbea October 20, 2014 at 1:32 pm I wanted to try this out by didn’t quite have the time. I might get it back just for this, but my experience with Linux is pretty much none. How’s yours? Can I get in touch via email in case I get this back and get stuck? Reply SteamDine October 22, 2014 at 12:11 pm No problem. I ordered this netbook (amazon pre order), and probable some where in Mid November will try to put the Linux on Any way , you may always try to put Ubuntu or Mint on SD card and try to make it boot from it with no effect on Win8.1 on SDD . Andrei Girbea October 22, 2014 at 7:56 pm I wanted to do that but was a bit short on time when I had this for reviews. Will try to get it again just to try Linux on it. John November 27, 2014 at 6:59 pm I’m really interested in this question as Amazon reviews of this model have people complaining that the BIOS is crippled so that Linux cannot be used at all. With this item on sale Black Friday I have very little time to make purchase decision. eargent October 21, 2014 at 11:28 pm Just found your site, it’s really great. Thanks for the very in depth reviews! Since both this ASUS X205TA and the Acer C720 got a 4/5 from you, would weigh in on which one do you think you would pick? Disregarding that one is Chrome and the other is Windows 8.1, just on performance. Which one would you go for? Maybe you can do a side by side comparison like you did one for the Acer C720 & ASUS C200 in the future. Thanks! Reply Andrei Girbea October 22, 2014 at 7:55 pm Hi, I already posted a comparison on my other website, you can find it here: http://www.ultrabookreview.com/4726-acer-chromebook-c720-vs-asus-chromebook-c200/ As someone who owns the C720 and use it occasionally, I’d probably go with the Asus, as ut runs WIndows and can do things a Chromebook can’t. Chromebooks and Chrome OS are fine if all you need can be done in a browser, but not if you might need specialized software (edit images, maybe a small clip, run a certain program, etc). Besides this, the X205 (or the C200) is fanless, and that matters a lot. On the other hand, the C720 is somewhat snappier, the X205 will choke faster if you try to run multiple things at the same time. Reply ktriebol October 28, 2014 at 3:40 pm Does this laptop run the full version of Windows 8.1, or is it lightened in some way? Reply Andrei Girbea October 28, 2014 at 3:54 pm full version Reply Mike October 28, 2014 at 8:44 pm do you know the supply voltage level of the X205? Reply Andreas October 29, 2014 at 9:42 am Thanks for the review! What is the voltage of the power supply? 12V? 19V? Reply Andrei Girbea October 29, 2014 at 5:22 pm Hmmm, I haven’t checked that out, to be frank. But why is this important? Reply Andreas October 29, 2014 at 5:32 pm We are planning to charge it with a 12V solar system and need to know if that is possible. And I cant find that inforation anywhere else. Andrei Girbea October 29, 2014 at 7:06 pm I see. Well, sry I can’t help you. Daniel October 29, 2014 at 4:14 pm What charging voltage does this Laptop require? Is it possible to charge this with a 12V or is 19V required? Reply ktriebol October 29, 2014 at 10:59 pm Is Windows 8.1 that is installed on this laptop 32 bit or 64 bit? Reply Andrei Girbea October 31, 2014 at 2:17 pm 32 bit Reply Interested October 31, 2014 at 2:20 pm In your opinion does that matter and if yes whats the difference between those two architectures? Andrei Girbea November 1, 2014 at 12:55 pm It shouldn’t. Maybe there are some programs that only worj on the 64bit version, but the vast majority will work on both. And since there’s no way to upgrade RAM on this thing, in which case having a 32 bit OS could have been problematic (32 bit Windows can only use 3.2 GB of RAM). James November 29, 2014 at 4:19 am Is the ASUS capable of running 64 bit windows? Windows 7, or 8 Drivers? The graphics are great I’d just like too see if this little thing can run Left for Dead 2 and some higher end games. porpo November 2, 2014 at 12:36 pm Does the usb of asus x205ta can read an external hard drive? 1tb? Reply Andrei Girbea November 2, 2014 at 1:46 pm yes, it can read USB external hdds Reply Mathias November 2, 2014 at 6:40 pm Have you heard anything about a release in Europe, or other parts of the world? France was supposed to get it, but I haven’t heard or seen anything about a release date. Reply Andrei Girbea November 3, 2014 at 5:04 pm Not more than what I’ve noted in the review Reply Artem November 4, 2014 at 6:41 am Hello! Can I install ubuntu? Will it work in full force?

Reply Andrei Girbea November 4, 2014 at 4:47 pm Not sure, haven’t tried it Reply Tejas November 5, 2014 at 8:38 am Are there any other laptops coming in the near future which are better than this in the 200$ segment, or would you still suggest this. Reply Andrei Girbea November 5, 2014 at 3:23 pm THere’s the Chromebook C720. Not necesarily better, but different, worth checking out. HP announced their Stream line, starting at $199, but can’t say how good those are going to be yet. Nothing else that I know of. Reply Robin Majumdar November 7, 2014 at 5:10 am Excellent review – thanks for sharing, it’s just been released for ordering here in Canada. Reply Sara November 7, 2014 at 7:26 am Does this laptop have a cd/DVD drive? If so, can it burn CDs? I Reply Andrei Girbea November 7, 2014 at 7:01 pm it doesn’t. you can buy an external DVD drive and use it to play/burn dvds and cds Reply Bruce November 10, 2014 at 12:29 pm Will programs run from an attached hard drive or micro SD?

Also, is the memory expandable? Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:09 pm the Memory is soldered and not expandable. As for LOL, no, I’d say it wouldn’t be playable even on the lowest settings in 13 x 7 Reply Robert Tau November 15, 2014 at 12:03 am Funny, entertaining, and informative! Thanks for the great article! Looking forward to your review on the HP Stream notebooks… Reply Greg November 15, 2014 at 5:23 am I just purchased this for my wife from the Microsoft website. Have read on Amazon reviews that people have put in a 120 GB card and it worked fine. Even if just a 64 works you are still going to end up with about 80gb to play with. For web surfing a back up pc, I don’t see how one can go wrong. By the way, $179 at Microsoft right now, run don’t walk! Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:10 pm But the card does not sit flush when connected, which is annoying. There might be some sollution to use a microSD card and a special adapter though, so the card won’t potrude on the side. Reply Prabin November 16, 2014 at 5:16 am How well does office 13 perform on it?

Andrei Girbea January 28, 2015 at 11:21 pm Should show. Will probably take a while to load. Can’t tell for sure cause I don’t know how complex those excells are. DO they lag on a regular computer? If yes, than the X205TA will perform poorer, if not, you should be alright. Ruf November 17, 2014 at 11:32 pm The touchpad issue is a “deal breaker”. Lots of complaints about the lack of scrolling w/ Smart Gesture. What’s worse is that ASUS doesn’t have a fix. Stay away from netbook for now. Reply Jay November 18, 2014 at 8:13 pm Thanks for pointing out that storage cannot be upgraded. That’s what I was concerned about and the reason I wouldn’t buy it. It’s on sale today at BestBuy for $140. You should definitely try Linux. For this small computer, try PCLinuxOS 32-bit KDE-minime. Much better than LinuxMint (which is the OS I use for all my computers) for newbies (have installed it for my 10 and 12 year old grandchildren and they love it) because it works well in 1G of RAM and uses less than 3G of HD space. Somewhat XP-like (as is Mint). Ubuntu is more like Win8. You can easily test it on a bootable CD or USB which this Asus supports through its USB ports. Thanks for your article and YouTube video. You may want to read about the advantages/disadvantages of Linux at starkman.com/articles/Linux4CPAs.shtml Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:19 pm Thanks, I’ll look into Linux in the future. Planned to do it for this laptop but didn’t quite have the time for it Reply John November 28, 2014 at 9:21 pm Jay, have you successfully used Linux on this specific model? In the Amazon reviews for this model multiple people say that the model has a crippled BIOS which can’t boot Linux. Reply Sven November 19, 2014 at 3:27 am Can it really handle Photoshop and basic photo editing (300 pics in-row): captioning/color/saturation/cropping/light adjustments etc.? How about smooth youtube / netflix viewing? Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:20 pm Youtube and Netlfix FHD are smooth if you’re not running antyhing else at the same time. But I don’t think it can handle batches of 300 pics in photoshop. I’d stick to an older version of Photoshop (CS2, for example) and batches ot 10 pics at a time Reply Phil November 20, 2014 at 7:22 am Great in-depth review and video! I also liked your review of the ASUS T100. Which would you recommend of the two? I have read lots of reviews of the T100 and played with it in store. The keyboard is fine for me. I don’t NEED touch, though it might be fun as a tablet. I just want something I can take away on holiday and use with a full version of Word and Firefox for a work plugin. So something light and cheap, in case it gets stolen. The X205 is cheaper here in Australia – about AUD$145 cheaper – even with the T100 on sale. Anyhow, any opinion would be helpful. I know the specs, I just want to know the gut-feeling from somebody who has used both for some weeks. Thanks! Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:24 pm Difficult to compare the two. This thing is basic and cheap, the T100 is a 2-in-1 with a touchscreen and can be used for things the X205 cannot (as a tablet, for reading, watching movies, etc). The T100 also comes with Office included (not sure if that’s the case in AUS as well, check it out). IN the end it’s up to you to decide if the T100 is worth paying extra. Reply Phil November 20, 2014 at 7:23 am Also, will this boot from a USB stick? I want to install Windows 10 technical preview on it. Cheers. Reply Andrei Girbea November 23, 2014 at 7:24 pm Haven’t tried it Reply kos November 25, 2014 at 9:59 pm will work on asus x205 software autocom 2013.3 ???

Reply Andrei Girbea November 26, 2014 at 7:52 pm Should cope well with those tasks as long as you don’t multitask between many apps at once. Reply Phil November 26, 2014 at 3:53 pm If you are going to write to the masses, try to learn some grammar. “could have went”, and about a dozen others. I’m embarassed for you. Reply Andrei Girbea November 26, 2014 at 7:55 pm Thank you. I’m not a native English writer, as you can probably tell, so mistakes do slip up. I hope the value of the content rises above these, but if you don’t mind and have the time, maybe you could point me towards those “dozen others”? I’d really apreciate that. Thank you in advance. Reply Kevin December 3, 2014 at 10:56 pm Are you serious Phil? Are you so narrow minded that you can’t imagine that some people do not use English as their native language? You should be embarrassed for yourself. Reply Bruce November 26, 2014 at 11:08 pm Phil, I’m embarrassed for you – there are two r’s in embarrassed 🙂 Reply Ryan November 26, 2014 at 11:49 pm Thanks for your review. I had thought it’s an old model, yet it turns out to be recently released one. Does it even weigh less than an 11-inch Apple MBA (2.4lbs)? That’s really impressive even considering its plastic material. What I concern is its 2G RAM. Do you need to wait long for initiating a business app like Word or Excel? Reply Andrei Girbea November 27, 2014 at 1:26 pm those apps should start decently fast. howeve,r if you load big files, that will take a while Reply edchris November 27, 2014 at 3:29 am Someone above asked about the charge voltage. I have an older EEE, running XP, that the charger crapped out on, was hoping this one would fit both. It doesn’t, the ends are different. However the voltages are the same. They all accept 120-240V input, the out puts are 19V. I’m not sure why they didn’t use the more common 12V output, but it says right on the charger-output 19V DC. Reply Ganesh November 27, 2014 at 2:53 pm Thanks bro for your answer. So I can use the US brick in a country that has 240V? You sure? Reply edchris November 27, 2014 at 3:33 am I just picked one up in Canada on Nov 26, my older EEE had the “P” key quit, & I can’t charge the battery. Tried a new battery, won’t take a charge, so I said screw it & spent $219 CDN for the new X205 Still getting used to Window 8,(the old one was XP). The Company gives us Ipads, but for a workstation I like the keyboard & touchpad, along with MS Office. Pretty limited use so far, but it seems fine for use during all the time I spend on planes. the biggest pain I found is it won’t transfer from XP, & I wish it was a full size SD Card. Reply Ryan November 27, 2014 at 5:02 pm Hey bro, where did you get your X205TA? BestBuy or Staples? I am also thinking about getting one. Reply Dave November 28, 2014 at 4:16 am Staples has them for $99 today only. Just ordered one in store. Jo November 28, 2014 at 4:12 am Does the X205TA run online and downloadable games well? Sims, roller coaster tycoon etc. Reply Andrei Girbea November 28, 2014 at 12:49 pm Very old PC games, maybe. But it’s not made for games Reply Lloyd G LeCain November 28, 2014 at 5:25 am Could you upgrade to 8.1 pro? Can you use a mouse with it? Reply Andrei Girbea November 28, 2014 at 12:49 pm Yes and Yes Reply CS November 28, 2014 at 9:48 am Hi, may I know, if this x205 comes with Office365 Personal free? I read from another blog, which mentioned that there is Office365 Personal. Reply Andrei Girbea November 28, 2014 at 12:51 pm It doesn’t from what I know. The HP Stream 11 is another $199 laptop that does though Reply Moety November 28, 2014 at 1:43 pm I purchased this as a early black friday deal without reading the specifications. However after using this laptop much to my surprise it worked well. The size is small but it works great for traveling, this will replace the tablet just due to the keyboard. Value for regular use is awesome. Your review was very detailed and the pro’s were enough for me to purchase two. Thanks. Reply Courtney November 29, 2014 at 6:06 pm Hello As far as printing docs, how does that work? I was considering a chrome book, but printing seemed complicated( I am less tech savvy and will use better if it’s wireless or “cord” printer). I also needed skype or tango and the chrome book did not have that either. Second question: is it possible to “lock” screens so my 13 month old can “play” without deleting something Reply Courtney November 29, 2014 at 6:22 pm I thought of another question- How can I upload pictures from smartphone and camera? Reply Skylar November 29, 2014 at 7:19 pm I think the sale is over, but I picked this up in Canada from the Microsoft store for $179CDN (205CDN/$180USD after tax+shipping). I popped in a 64gb microSD for another $25. I then redirected my basic folders (documents, pictures downloads, etc.) to go to the SD card to leave the HD available for program files and such. I’ve been running Outlook, OneNote, Word, 15 tabs in Chrome, and paint.Net simultaneously before getting a memory error (once I push up to 25 tabs in Chrome that happens). I also clocked a full 12 hours of battery life with this sort of use. At the size, weight, battery life, and full laptop functionality, this has definitely killed my use of tablets. Reply humming bird November 29, 2014 at 9:13 pm I got it yesterday for 179.99 from best buy. I think I was a bit frustrated for a while but I could def use this for quite sometime. great review! I have smudges all over mine after a night of use. lol Reply Courtney November 30, 2014 at 7:12 am Hello I am not very tech savvy. Can you let me know how printing docs works on this laptop? I was considering a chrome book, but heard of having to use external ports to print( sounded confusing); I need ability to print wirelessly or from a “plugged in” printer Skype or tango use is important, can the asus do that ? Lastly, I liked that you could ” secure” the chrome book, so my 1 year can ” play” on laptop without me worrying he deleted or accessed important content. Can ASus do this? Thanks for dealing with my “elementary PC language and knowledge”, I appreciate it! Reply Ryu December 3, 2014 at 1:32 am Hi, I recently picked this up for $99. I discovered that there was an 8 gb recovery partition made that I cannot delete or even use. I tried deleting it thru dishonest means, and it crashed. Upon reboot, I was greeted by the message that my PC needs to be repaired, due to error 0xc0000225. I can only get the UEFI Firmware Settings to start up, along with Startup settings. Is there any way to restore this system to factory settings? The old videos about disabling boot booster and mashing on the F9 key etc don’t apply here, because there IS no boot booster. (And I just have no idea what the hell I’m talking about.) MAIN THING: Can someone help me restore this laptop before I head to Staples for an exchange/refund? Reply Ryu December 3, 2014 at 1:35 am I also need to add that the error involves a file halmacpi.dll Reply Michelle December 5, 2014 at 7:20 pm Do you know I’d this would run Minecraft?

I just ordered 1 from Staples online for $149 since I will be in the US in about a week or so. Here in France, it’s available for about 254€ (wtf !!) on Amazon, or else in 1 or 2 electronics shops for 219€, which is still about 100€ more than Staples. Doesn’t seem to be available anywhere else. Why such an enormous difference in price??? Reply Tobbe December 15, 2014 at 9:13 pm Yeah, the European price is ridiculous compared to what it sells for in the US. Too bad the US keyboard has one less key than most European keyboards 🙁 Makes it that much harder to use for us with alphabets with more characters than in the English alphabet. Reply GabsJL December 18, 2014 at 2:49 pm Yes, you’re right about the keyboard. I probably won’t be using it for long texts or emails in French, Spanish or Italian, but for web browsing, Short emails, watching films…it should be fine. Will love the look on people’s faces when I say how much I paid for it though lol ! Brenden December 7, 2014 at 5:14 pm I see 3 open connectors on the motherboard. Two to the right of the wifi card, and the third one on the top right below the lcd screen connection. 3-5 inches from the other two connectors. Any idea what they could be for?

I bought a 64gb micro SD card, and all is well. I had some issues with my wifi and downloaded their latest patch, BAD idea, now I can’t connect that to any wireless. Fortunately, I had a mini usb wifi adapter that works fine, but with the wireless mouse, I’m out of ports. Any idea on the location of the original drivers?

Reply Dennis December 25, 2014 at 7:56 pm Andrei Girbea, great review. I am wondering why there is no premium model. Here are some drawbacks, both Intel and Asus fault. This is what I want in a premium version of this laptop. 1. A 64Gb eMMC 2. 4Gb memory (in memory slot), with 32bit you only get about 3.4Gb of memory you can use, but it is a must to have 4Gb of memory with Win7, Win8 2. Standard HDMI-port 3. Separate headphone and mic jacks 4. Stanard SD and Micro SD slot (128Gb support if possible). 5. Option to install a mSSD card in the unit. (I have been wondering why this is not possible for a long time, in tablets and other units. This could remove the need for large SD-card storage. 6. IPS screen display 7. All the port should be up where screen is and not so close to where you have your hands when using the computer. It is nice to see that finaly some small netbooks are comming back. Tablets are fine but it they are not for everyone, I like small computers like my asus eee PC 102b that has worked wonders. It is old, slow but has everything I need in a small portable computer. As of now, the Acer Aspire E-11/ E3-111 option is better for me, just add more ram and a SSD and you have Macbook Air 11 but far cheaper and running full windows. To bad this computer is low budget, would love to see this one in a more premium version as it would be the perfect replacement for a tablet. Great review ! Reply Audrey December 31, 2014 at 11:22 am Hi there!

As a side note, is there any sound coming out of the laptop when those lights are lit? Put you ear next to the back and tell me if you hear anything at all? I wonder if the laptop actually boots but the screen isn’t disconnected, thus there’s nothing diplayed. Either way, if the computer doesn’t start after these, you should get in touch with the shop.

Thanks, Reply Max February 27, 2015 at 1:31 pm re Steve’s problem – when mine wouldn’t turn on, I phoned ASUS; turned out the trick was to hold the power button down for a full 30 seconds (maybe that turns it fully off when it’s in a confused coma, after which it can be started normally). This isn’t mentioned in the manual. The service rep was polite, but took 15 minutes to reveal this solution. Two-finger “SmartGesture” scrolling on the trackpad stops working; rebooting reactivates it for me, but someone said ending this process in Task Manager worked for them. I still don’t know how to stop the cursor from flying to random spots at times while I’m trying to type, but I suspect it comes from accidentally brushing the trackpad. If so, the solution may be to plug in a mouse and disable the trackpad. Reply Sydney April 17, 2015 at 2:54 am Thank you so much! I was having the same problem and this worked perfectly. Reply Mike May 1, 2015 at 5:36 am Thanks for the info on the boot issue. I was about to call support myself. I think mine ran out of juice while in sleep mode, which might be what caused this.

You can get them as low as $20 at various places. It basically uses the cigarette lighter port in your car and makes it a regular 2 prong socket like in your house (while converting the power from DC=/=AC appropriately of course). I have one in my truck I mainly use to charge my cell phone while driving and man it blows a regular car cell charger completely out of the water. My buddie joking around hooked up a Xbox 360 and a 24″ 1080P HDTV and we played games off it for about 3 hours. They’re nice to have for sure. Reply John April 30, 2015 at 11:53 pm Mine would not turn off after updating. Any help on how to fix that? Reply Scott May 4, 2015 at 5:58 pm Great laptop for the price, all the concerns have work-arounds and gamers can rejoice – The Half-Life 2 Source engine works fine on this machine and from there you can imagine what else is possible on this laptop, so for 200 you wont be playing any call of duty titles but you can play the hell out of classic modern steam titles and that’s all I need. I got myself a mini-HDMI to HDMI adapter and plug this laptop into my HDTV and party like it’s 2007. I never expected to play games on this machine but for a millennial my age it’s just fine.

I have a question about memory and storage that I’m a little confused about after reading this paragraph: “And that’s because this EeeBook is built on an low-power high-efficiency hardware platform, with an Intel Z3745D processor, bundled with 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage, which can actually become a problem quite fast. Both the RAM and eMMC storage are soldered and NOT upgradeable. The thing is you’re not left with a lot of spare space after having Windows installed (roughly 14 GB), so Asus definitely had to cut a corner here to meet the low price tag. And that leaves you with two options: either use the included cloud space offered for free in Asus’s WebStorage environment, or expand the storage space with the help of a microSD card.” Can you add or expand the memory using a microSD card? The first paragraph kinda seems like a no and the second kinda sounds like a yes. PS your review is very thorough and good- I’m 100% sure that my confusion is due to my lack of knowledge. Reply Andrei Girbea November 3, 2015 at 1:16 am Hi Lane, yes you can expand the storage space with a microSD card. The first paragraph tells you the internal storage space, the 32 GB eMMC, cannot be upgraded. Sry for the confusion.

When I’m home, should I use it connecting the charger even if it 100% charged? Reply Muhammad November 24, 2015 at 9:19 pm I bought this laptop manufacturer refurbished for $220 CAD, with the intention for using this exclusively for studies and work. This machine fits that category appropriately. Space is not an issue. After Windows you’re left with around 22 GB. I have a 64 GB Micro SD and a 128 GB USB; but anything from 16 to 32 GB should suffice. Don’t forget cloud storage options for potentially limitless capabilities. Browsing the web, watching and streaming videos, playing music and other processes work perfectly on this machine. It was meant for something like this. I do not game on this machine. Even for a refurbished product I average ten and a half hours of daily use. If I watch videos exclusively for most of its life, I average eight hours which is outstanding. The real kicker for me is the battery life and portability. I can spend one day at school or work with this laptop on one charge. I only ever charge this when I’m not using it or during downtime. But this feature is absolutely critical for me. If you want something to travel with or just use in general but lightly, this is what you need. It beats having a Chrome OS and its limited capabilities. I have been using this laptop for almost three months and have had no issues. Kudos to you, ASUS. Not sure how you pulled this off. Reply Alan November 27, 2015 at 10:38 pm Does anyone know the difference between an X205T and an X205TA. The spec’s look the same, so why different model numbers?

As a PC repairshop owner, that is a HUGE turn off, and I will not be purchasing this solely on this fact. It’s getting harder and harder to find a good replacement for the seemingly perfect HP DM1 i3.

Reply Chris P December 15, 2015 at 1:22 pm Hi Andrei, Good review..Was about to buy but someone told me that a new replacement for X205TA gonna launch soon in early 2016…Is this true? An upgrade is coming……:) Reply Harith January 14, 2016 at 7:04 pm Hi Mike. Last netbook I purchased was under your recommendation and here I’m looking for the new one. My top choice right now is Asus Eeebook e202 but doesn’t see anywhere on internet anyone review it only just quick look. So I really hope you’ll review it soon. Reply Pratyd January 16, 2016 at 2:21 pm Bought the X205ta based on the review here, which is why I feel compelled to mention that though spill proof keyboard isn’t mentioned anywhere in the specs, my netbook just survived a coffee spill. 250 ml of relatively hot coffee, and it is still going strong. Hard to beat this at under $200. Reply Sylvain January 30, 2016 at 4:54 am Awesome little notebook. I have mine since 6 months mostly for texts typing and it’s still doing very well. Disk space is a bit limited but just add a good micro sd card and it’s fine. Reply Zet June 13, 2016 at 10:49 am Grrrrrr… Bought mine close-out for appx $80. Upgraded to Windows 10 fine. The sound jack turns out to be some kind of combined thing and I had trouble using a headset with microphone for Skype so I downloaded and ran the BIOS UPDATE Bad Idea.. Bricked… No recovery protocol, it took 8 attempts to get Asus North America to issue and RMA (never never never lose your invoice – best to scan and upload it to google photos-) Finally it is back at the Asus repair depot. Waiting to see how they do. Worst thing was I bought it for travel and ended up lugging a dead machine across Japan. Asus service was useless at handing me over to Asus Japan, had to wait until I got back, then 7 more attempts before they agreed it was in warranty and issued the RMA So, barely worth what it cost, even on sale Reply constance bryant July 14, 2016 at 7:09 am You are righto n regarding this asus eeebook. I have had mine for 1 year and 5 months, but my internal battery went kapooey. Where can I get a replacement battery that is reasonable or should I just buy another eeebook. I love this one, and hate to discard it, plus I have a lot of data stored on it???? Reply Andrei Girbea August 4, 2016 at 1:21 pm You can try on ebay and amazon, or try contacting an authorized Asus service and see if they can provide the battery and the swap Reply Manthan August 9, 2016 at 4:59 pm I bought this laptop sometime in May last year. Had no issues until its display broke and I got it replaced. Now the USB ports dont work. I gave it to the service center and they said its connected to some main chip and if they did something to it, the laptop might even be dead. Also checked the USB drivers and they are up to date. It becomes almost useless without USB. Any possible fix? Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Ga verder Meer informatie Software-update: Kodi 17.0 bèta 2 Door Bart van Klaveren, dinsdag 20 september 2016 19:54, 20 reacties • Feedback Bron: Kodi, submitter: LeechGuy De tweede bètaversie van Kodi 17.0 is eerder deze week beschikbaar gemaakt. Deze crossplatform-mediacentersoftware wordt ontwikkeld voor Windows, macOS, Linux, Android en iOS. In versie 17.0 is de mogelijkheid voor het afspelen van 10bit- en hevc-materiaal toegevoegd, in combinatie met gpu's van Intel of Nvidia die daar ondersteuning voor bieden. Ook de standaard-skin is gewijzigd naar Estuary en voor apparaten met een aanraakscherm is dat Estouchy geworden. De belangrijkste veranderingen die in bèta 2 zijn doorgevoerd zijn hieronder voor je samengevat. Fixes done in Beta 2: Any game controller was non function due to recent refactoring. This has now been fixed with the added bonus of deadzone settings for joypads. PVR section got a variety of fixed ranging from usability to possible crashing Fix possible issue if internet stream used a redirect Fix “could not connect to repository” popup No longer handle data migrations from pre-Kodi v14 versions. Add fallback path to Kodi settings if the skin you use hasn’t received an update yet Several fixes done to passthrough audio handling Fix possible crash on loading context menu add-ons Add Android Nougat new passthrough audio API which special thanks to Google developers for adding this. De-interlacing setting underwent some changes recently and some problems came to light. Skin and add-on updating doesn’t check for dependencies if they are not in a repository. From now on on any upgrade Kodi we will go through all available updates and install them before starting Kodi. Fix DPI unawareness on Windows where it would start in the zoomed in if it wasn’t set to 100% Thanks to Microsoft for giving us the correct way of solving it.

(Leuk voordeel dat hij ook op MN NAS staat ) Maar helaas nog steeds geen shared library, dus als ik aflevering X van serie Y heb gezien wordt dat niet bijgehouden op elke kodi player.

Enige nadeel is dat je wel alle KODI-versies gelijk moet houden omdat bij versie-updates ook de database wordt bijgewerkt. Verder werkt het perfect, en wordt zelfs de EPG daar netjes in bijgewerkt. Afhankelijk van je NAS kan je dat daar ook prima op kwijt. Heeft niets met scripting van doen, en met een minimum aan inzet kan je ook zonder enige db-kennis dat draaiend krijgen. Is links en rechts nog wel wat ruimte voor verbetering in hoor, zoals dus versie-beheer, maar ook bijvoorbeeld addons e.d. zou prettig zijn als dat centraal te regelen valt. +1 rbr320 @kroegtijger • 20 september 2016 21:07 Enige nadeel is dat je wel alle KODI-versies gelijk moet houden omdat bij versie-updates ook de database wordt bijgewerkt.Geldt dat alleen voor de major version zoals Kodi 16/17, of ook voor de minor version (Kodi 16.0/16.1)? In het eerste geval lijkt het me namelijk te doen, maar als je ook de minor version exact gelijk moet houden wordt het een stuk lastiger. +2 kroegtijger @rbr320 • 20 september 2016 21:43 Over het algemeen zijn het alleen de majors, maar op de wiki kun je het hele overzicht bekijken en zien welke versies met elkaar overweg kunnen. Zie hiervoor http://kodi.wiki/view/Database_versions Zoals je kan zien is bijvoorbeeld tussen 17 Alpha 1, Alpha 2 en Alpha 3 een verschil in versie in MyVideos, maar is dat verschil er niet tussen Alpha 3 en Beta 1. Meestal houden ze het wel "beschaafd" en zijn databaseupdates beperkt tot volledig nieuwe versies (alpha's zijn zogezegd work in progress, en dus kan je daar verschillen in verwachten. Beta's zijn meer voor het eruit halen van bugs en daar is de kans dus al een stuk kleiner dat er naar een nieuwe db wordt uitgeweken). Een uitleg over MySQL en Kodi kun je vinden op http://kodi.wiki/view/MySQL maar er zijn ook andere methoden dan MySQL. UPnP kan bijvoorbeeld ook maar er is ook een AddOn die het zou kunnen. Persoonlijk ben ik meer liefhebber van de MySQL-oplossing omdat het de meest universele methode is, en je er het makkelijkst ook weer andere bewerkingen op los kan laten. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan het manipuleren van content, genereren van listings, backup/restore mogelijkheden etc. +1 Bliksem B @rbr320 • 20 september 2016 22:29 [...] Geldt dat alleen voor de major version zoals Kodi 16/17, of ook voor de minor version (Kodi 16.0/16.1)? In het eerste geval lijkt het me namelijk te doen, maar als je ook de minor version exact gelijk moet houden wordt het een stuk lastiger.Volgens mij ook bij 16.1 en 16.0, niet bij fixes. Andere oplossing om het shared library probleem op te lossen, kan door gebruik te maken van de interne UPNP server: je draait 1 kodi als UPNP server en vervolgens voeg je deze in je library. Een andere oplpossing (welke ik zelf gebruik) is door Emby server te gebruiken. Lijkt op Plex, alleen ze hebben een gratis native add-on voor Kodi. Deze synct al je bestanden inc waar je gebleven was. Emby heeft als voordeel dat je voortaan ok je bestanden overal te wereld kunt benaden via een webinterface (zoals plex). Ook is Emby wat groffer qua indexeren van bestanden. [Reactie gewijzigd door Bliksem B op 20 september 2016 23:00] 0 MacPoedel @Bliksem B • 25 september 2016 14:29 Er is ondertussen voor Plex een heel gelijkaardige add-on (eigenlijk gewoon een herschreven versie van de add-on voor Emby) die toelaat om Plex als backend te gebruiken van je Kodi bibliotheek. https://forums.plex.tv/di...et-kodi-talk-to-your-plex Verder doen Plex en Emby grotendeels hetzelfde, maar moet zeggen dat ik de apps (althans de Android app en de web interface) voor Plex beter vind dan die van Emby. +1 EdwinB @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 20:10 Ik gebruik de website (en Kodi plugin) Trakt.tv om te synchroniseren. Extra voordeel is dat je dan altijd je kijkhistorie hebt en bij een herinstallatie van Kodi weet je dus ook meteen weer wat je al gezien hebt. +1 Ultimo @EdwinB • 20 september 2016 20:43 Dit lijkt me de beste oplossing in mijn geval, dank! +1 tcviper @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 19:59 Daar hebben ze iets voor gevonden: Plex of Emby +1 Dimiz @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 20:01 NAS > Plex rPI > OpenELEC > PlexKodiConnect Zo synct ie alles ;)!

Je kan daarmee ook je afspeelstatus naar de cloud uploaden. +1 cypro66 @Ultimo • 20 september 2016 22:16 voor het syncen van wat je gekeken kun je de Trakt.tv intergratie gebruiken.. Dat werkt heel handig is eenvoudig te configuren. Account aanmaken op Trakt.tv en plugin in Kodi installeren. That’s it. +1 mykieonline 20 september 2016 20:06 Of je gebruikt een mySQL database als shared library: http://kodi.wiki/view/MySQL Zo heb ik het hier thuis draaien, waarbij ik beneden een windows machine heb staan met kodi, en boven een RPI met openelec. En ik heb op mijn android tablet kodi draaien, maar die gebruik ik eigenlijk nooit. Alledrie verwijzen ze naar de centrale mySQL database. Nadeel is wel dat als er een nieuwe kodi versie uitkomt, ik niet kan upgraden tot er ook een upgrade van de openelec versie is, want anders gaat het soms mis. +1 Idiocracy @mykieonline • 20 september 2016 20:11 Ga voor https://libreelec.tv/ Is 1op1 vervangen die wel gewoon geupdate word +1 Nelissuh @mykieonline • 21 september 2016 10:56 Daarom ben ik overgestapt van OpenElec op OSMC.

Zo zorgt Emby ervoor dat alle media die je op een player kijkt bijgehouden word (zodat je op een andere player kan verder kijken). Ook heeft Emby de mogelijkheid om via de browser te spelen. +1 Ome Ernst 20 september 2016 20:53 Doordat de RTL XL app versie 1.1.2 onder deze versie niet werkt, is de WAF factor helaas wat lager.
