Rumours already point to the arrival of Intel’s latest-generation microprocessors (Kaby Lake), freshly unveiled at the CES technology show in Las Vegas (USA), accompanied by a boost in RAM. According to a research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, reported by a host of tech news sites, Apple has finally decided to use Intel’s latest processors in its MacBook Pro computers. When the laptops launched in November 2016, Apple surprised observers by using Intel’s seventh-generation Core processors, already at large in top-of-the-range PCs from HP, Lenovo, Acer and Dell. The new processors are expected to be joined by more RAM, with up to 32GB for the 15” MacBook Pro, double the current maximum. However, this MacBook Pro update isn’t expected before fall 2017. As a result, the firm’s 12” MacBook is likely to be the first of the brand’s notebooks to get a new Intel Kaby Lake chip, expected from Q2 2017. The laptop could also get up to 16GB of RAM, up from the current 8GB. The current-generation MacBook Pro is the slimmest and most lightweight model ever made by Apple. It stands out from competitors with the new “Touch Bar” of touch-sensitive controls replacing the traditional row of function keys. This Retina-quality multi-touch strip adapts its functions in relation to the program being used, offering quick and easy touchscreen access to the main functions of Finder, Mail, Safari, Photos, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X or third-party applications. The 13” MacBook Pro with Touch Bar technology starts at US$1,799 (RM8028.04), rising to US$2,399 for the 15” model. With top-spec components, the MacBook Pro can cost up to US$4,799. A 13” model with no Touch Bar is available for US$1,499. The previous-gen 13” model is still available to buy for US$1,299, with the older 15” model at US$1,999. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Panasonic launches washing machine for curry stains in India Microsoft claims clients’ rights in FBI email search fight China takes thousands of porn, violent apps offline Zuckerberg charity buys AI startup to battle disease ‘Grand Theft Auto’ man opens new studio WeChat suddenly looks like a threat to the iPhone Samsung confirms battery defects caused Note 7 fires (VIDEO) Mozilla: A new look for a new start?

By Patrick Kulp2017-01-17 22:28:09 UTC A wave of new technology is set to reinvent the way people shop in stores, and Intel wants to be at the center of it. The chip giant announced the launch of a new platform for brick-and-mortar retailers this week that will tie together a set of software systems, sensors and other tech aimed at streamlining and improving store operations. SEE ALSO: Amazon just teased the future of in-store shopping The web of connected gadgets will let companies more closely track inventory, collect data on shopper habits and eventually personalize offerings much like their online counterparts already do. Intel plans to invest $100 million in the project over the next five years. During the unveiling, which took place at a retail trade show in New York on Monday, the company also showed off a robot called Tally, a tower-shaped gadget designed to roam store aisles and collect inventory data. The automated store clerk is produced by Simbe Robotics, but Intel touted it as an example of a technology that might eventually tap into the company's web of devices.  The computer company also assembled a mock version of a Levi's store display to demonstrate how ceiling sensors could provide real-time information on the stock and location of various sizes and styles of jeans.   One of the biggest advantages online retailers have over their brick-and-mortar counterparts is a wealth of customer data with which they can tailor individual product suggestions and arrange virtual storefronts and promotions around shopping habits. But thanks to advancements in internet-of-things technology and artificial intelligence, these capabilities will soon be just as possible in physical stores. "At Intel, we believe that increasingly retailers will be separated by those who have data and use it to grow and optimize the shopping experience, and those who don’t and make their decisions based on 'experience' and subjective observations," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in an editorial accompanying the announcement at a retail trade show in New York. This coming revolution has not escaped the notice of e-commerce behemoth Amazon, which recently teased its own take on a physical retail store with Amazon Go, which incorporates much of the same tech plus more radical features like self-checkout via app. By contrast, Krzanich stressed that Intel's automated technology is intended to assist rather than replace employees, according ZDNet's report.

If well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is to be believed, the Cupertino-based company is now reportedly planning to update all of its MacBook laptops with seventh-generation Intel Core 'Kaby Lake' processors from Intel. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has suggested in an investor note that apart from the updated processors across MacBook Pro models, the 15-inch variant of the laptop will also get a 32GB RAM option, as per a report by 9to5Mac. Kuo says that the first MacBook to receive Kaby Lake treatment will be the 12-inch MacBook laptop, mass production of which will start in Q2 this year. He added that a 16GB RAM variant is also expected to be added for the laptop. The production of 13-inch and 15-inch variants of MacBook Pro laptops (equipped with Kaby Lake processors) has been tipped to start from Q3 this year. Further, Kuo says that the 15-inch MacBook Pro is expected to receive a 32GB RAM variant. The KGI analyst says that this laptop will receive desktop memory in order to aim for high-end users. Interestingly, Phil Schiller, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing at Apple, justified in October last year that the maximum of 16GB RAM option enables the laptop to offer better battery life. Kuo says that Apple is expected to grow in terms of shipments during 2017 and slow start to the year has been mostly because of production delays as the demand for the Touch Bar variant of MacBook Pro is "better than expected," as per the report. However, the 13-inch variant of MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar has underperformed and is likely to see a price-cut from the company, Kuo reportedly pointed out.

Plus a Note on CPU Scaling 1k Facebook Twitter Reddit RSS Comments Launched over a decade ago, the 65nm Core 2 Extreme QX6700 was Intel's first quad-core desktop processor. Though its ridiculous asking price of $1,000 ensured few would take the plunge, even with four unlocked cores operating at 2.67GHz, it was the fastest CPU money could buy back in 2006. Fortunately, it was only a few months later when enthusiasts were blessed with the Core 2 Quad Q6600, another Kentsfield-based quad-core chip that sold for a less absurd $530. Although the part was locked at a frequency of 2.4GHz, we were still able to overclock via the front side bus back then, allowing us to boost the Q6600 from its stock 2.4GHz operating frequency to well over 3GHz! By no surprise, it quickly became one of Intel's most popular enthusiast-grade processors of all time. Released about 10 years ago, we thought it would be interesting to see how the Q6600 holds up in 2017 while playing today's games on modern GPUs. In other words, what would happen if you paired a trusty old PC with a GeForce GTX 1060 or GTX 1070. We'll also throw in a Haswell dual-core Pentium, a Skylake Core i3, a Sandy Bridge Core i5 and the mighty Core i7-6700K. All CPUs will be benchmarked using the two Pascal graphics processors to establish some comparisons. Quite a load is going to be placed on these aging processors as we test some of the most CPU-intensive games released in the last year to see if the Q6600 can cope with such a burden. Test System Specs Kentsfield System Specs Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 (2.4 GHz) Gigabyte EP45-UD3P 8GB DDR2-800 RAM GeForce GTX 1060 GeForce GTX 1070 Samsung SSD 850 Pro 2TB SilverStone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Sandy Bridge System Specs Intel Core i5-2500K (3.3 - 3.7 GHz) Asrock Z77 Extreme4 16GB DDR3-2400 RAM GeForce GTX 1060 GeForce GTX 1070 Samsung SSD 850 Pro 2TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Skylake System Specs Intel Core i7-6700K (4.0 - 4.2 GHz) Intel Core i3-6100 (3.70GHz) Asrock Z170 Gaming K6+ 32GB DDR4-3200 RAM GeForce GTX 1060 GeForce GTX 1070 Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Haswell System Specs Intel Pentium G3470 (3.6 GHz) Asrock Z97 Extreme4+ 16GB DDR3-2400 RAM GeForce GTX 1060 GeForce GTX 1070 Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Benchmarks: Battlefield 1, Overwatch The Core 2 Quad Q6600 really struggled in Battlefield 1, delivering just 26fps on average at 1080p with the GeForce GTX 1060 handling the rendering. Worse still, stuttering was a massive issue and we often saw the average frame rate cut in half as the system halted. Even overclocking the Q6600 to 3.1GHz didn't get it out of trouble as minimum frame rates still dipped into the teens. Intel's fourth-generation budget Pentium processor did a better job, though it wasn't exactly smooth either. However, the now six-year-old Core i5-2500K kept its cool, delivering slightly better performance than the Skylake Core i3-6100 processor. With an average of 69fps and a minimum of 58fps we were quite impressed with the 2500K and when paired with the mid-range GTX 1060, it wasn't a great deal slower than the 6700K. Jumping up to the GeForce GTX 1070 allowed the 6700K to distance itself from the 2500K. That said, the 2500K was now noticeably better than Core i3-6100 when comparing the minimum frame rates. Again, the Pentium G3470 was able to brush aside the Core 2 Quad Q6600, at least when comparing the minimum frame rates. Again the Q6600 was unable to provide playable performance, even with the GTX 1070, due to excessive stuttering. Our Overwatch benchmark is a 'bot test' with two teams maxed out using bots. This is a rather CPU-intensive test that uses all eight threads of the 6700K. As a result, the Q6600 once again suffers massive frame dips with the GeForce GTX 1060. The regularity of the frame stuttering isn't actually as severe as what was seen in Battlefield 1, despite being greater in relation of the average frame rate. Still, using the ultra-quality settings at 1080p the Q6600 wouldn't allow the GTX 1060 to deliver playable performance. Increasing the rendering power with the GTX 1070 didn't improve performance when using the Core 2 Quad Q6600, the same unplayable performance was experienced. The Pentium G3470 on the other hand was able to deliver 60fps and only occasionally we did notice any kind of stuttering, but it was minor.

Congatec followed upon its earlier announcement of a Conga-TC175 COM Express Compact Type 6 module with a larger, 125 x 95mm Basic Type 6 module called the Conga-TS175. Both COMs support Intel’s latest 7th Generation “Kaby Lake” line of 14nm processors. Conga-TS175 (click image to enlarge) Other COM Express Basic entries include Advantech’s SOM-5898 and MSC’s MSC C6B-KLH. Like these competitors, the Conga-TS175 is designed for quad- and dual-core EQ and E Series Kaby Lake Core and Xeon E3 SoCs. These are faster, but less power efficient than the dual-core Intel Core U models that made up the bulk of the supported CPUs on the Compact sized Conga TC175. The high-end Core chip here is the Core i7-7820EQ, a quad-core 3.0/3.7GHz CPU with 8MB cache and a 45/35W TDP. Congatec similarly supports the ability to configure the TDP of selected EQ and Xeon chips. (For the full list of chip options, click on either the Advantech or MSC links above.) As with the Conga-TC175, but unlike the SOM-5898 and MSC C6B-KLH modules, the Conga-TS175 is said to support Intel Optane memory on carrier boards via PCIe 3.0. This faster, RAM-like alternative to NAND solid state drives uses 3D XPoint technology to offer low 10µs latency, or about a thousand times lower than that of standard HDDs, while handling the same sized data packets. Intel Optane won’t be available for several months, however. As you might expect, the larger Conga-TS175 has a similar, but slightly more extensive feature set compared to the Conga-TC175. Like the vast majority of Kaby Lake products we’ve seen, the Conga-TS175 supports up to 32GB of speedy DDR4 (2400 MT/s) delivered via a dual channel memory controller. There’s an onboard Intel i219-LM GbE Controller with AMT 11.6 support, as well as 8x PCIe Gen 3 lanes and 4x SATA 3.0 interfaces. Unlike the Conga-TC175, there’s also a PEG x16 Gen 3 expansion interface. Conga-TS175 block diagram (click image to enlarge) Triple displays are enabled with the dual DDI/TMDS interfaces (DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 1.4a), as well as eDP 1.3 and dual-channel, 24-bit LVDS. Options include a VGA port and a Conga-LDVI daughter-board that converts LVDS to DVI-D. The Conga-TS175 supports 4x USB 3.0 and 8x USB 2.0 ports, all with XHCI (eXtensible Host Controller Interface) technology. Additional I/O includes LPC and I2C buses, 2x UARTs, and HD audio. The Congatec Board Controller provides features like a watchdog and power loss controls. There’s also ACPI 4.0 power management with battery support, as well as optional TPM security. This commercial temperature (0 to 60°C) module is available with optional passive, active, and heatspreader cooling solutions. The Conga-TS175 runs Fedora 24, Ubuntu, SUSE, RHEL, and Yocto Project 2.2 Linux distributions, as well as Chromium 2. There is also support for VxWorks and 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. Congatec’s existing Conga-TEVAL carrier board is available as an option.   Further information No pricing or availability information was provided for the Conga-TS175.

Ryan Parker, a marketing director for Intel, says the Intel Responsive Retail Platform (RRP) is an effort by Intel to create what amounts to a reference architecture for Internet of Things (IoT) applications in the retail sector. It includes the hardware, software, application programming interfaces (APIs), RFID tag technology and sensors required, says Parker. The goal, says Parker, is to give retailers more control over inventory management. “Inventory is a billion-dollar problem,” says Parker. Parker says Intel envisions a world where retailers take advantage of the IoT to more efficiently manage inventory by knowing the precise location of each item in the supply chain at any given moment. As part of that effort, Intel at the NRF conference this week demonstrated Tally, a robot developed by Simbe Robotics, that can be used to more efficiently manage inventory inside a retail store. To help achieve its goal, Intel this week also pledged to invest over $100 million over the next five years in technologies aimed at the retail sector. Intel RRP is a component of a larger series of IoT initiatives that Intel is investing in as part of an effort to expand the number of use cases for its processors. Naturally, it remains to be seen just how much of the retail supply chain can be automated. But one thing that is for certain is that robots are about to play a bigger role, not just in the warehouse, but on the shop floor.

Rumors already point to the arrival of Intel's latest-generation microprocessors (Kaby Lake), freshly unveiled at the CES technology show in Las Vegas (USA), accompanied by a boost in RAM. According to a research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, reported by a host of tech news sites, Apple has finally decided to use Intel's latest processors in its MacBook Pro computers. When the laptops launched in November 2016, Apple surprised observers by using Intel's seventh-generation Core processors, already at large in top-of-the-range PCs from HP, Lenovo, Acer and Dell. The new processors are expected to be joined by more RAM, with up to 32GB for the 15" MacBook Pro, double the current maximum. However, this MacBook Pro update isn't expected before fall 2017. As a result, the firm's 12" MacBook is likely to be the first of the brand's notebooks to get a new Intel Kaby Lake chip, expected from Q2 2017. The laptop could also get up to 16GB of RAM, up from the current 8GB. The current-generation MacBook Pro is the slimmest and most lightweight model ever made by Apple. It stands out from competitors with the new "Touch Bar" of touch-sensitive controls replacing the traditional row of function keys. This Retina-quality multi-touch strip adapts its functions in relation to the program being used, offering quick and easy touchscreen access to the main functions of Finder, Mail, Safari, Photos, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X or third-party applications. The 13" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar technology starts at $1,799, rising to $2,399 for the 15" model. With top-spec components, the MacBook Pro can cost up to $4,799. A 13" model with no Touch Bar is available for $1,499. The previous-gen 13" model is still available to buy for $1,299, with the older 15" model at $1,999.

It will be integrated with Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors, the report was made by a notable industry analyst. The news also kickstarts further speculations that the new upcoming MacBook Pro models this year will be much stronger than 2016’s. The latest MacBook pro models from 2016 are powered by Intel’s Skylake processors and feature 16GB of RAM. Although 16GB of RAM are above most computer standards, a number of users have complained that 16GB of RAM is still not enough. This is especially since it has been pointed out that high-end laptops, such as the MacBook, should have more RAM. Kabylake Cultofmac reports that Apple had decided to cut RAM on the MacBook Pro to 16GB because an increase in RAM would consume much more power from the system. This would further reduce the battery life of the laptops. However, it appears that the next line of MacBook Pro models is aiming to address the RAM issue. Ming-Chi Kuo, KGI Securities analyst, has revealed that Apple has big plans this 2017. He detailed that Apple will be integrating the new Kaby Lake CPUs to the upcoming models of MacBook pros. In addition, the new MacBook pros will also sport 32GB of RAM that consumers have been searching for since last year. Kuo also reveals that the upcoming MacBook Pro will innovate the laptop line. Kuo says that the 2017 version of the MacBook Pro will be “the most significantly redesigned product this year.” Kuo also shared that the Kaby Lake processors will not only grace the MacBook Pro product line. It appears Apple intends to also upgrade the 12-inch MacBook line to the Kaby Lake processor this 2017 as well. Kuo has yet to reveal any release dates for the much anticipated MacBook models this year. However, he is expecting that the 32GB RAM version of the MacBook should be arriving to the market during the second half of the year.

Intel is betting on data being the defining point of future retail experiences. To power the data revolution, it's developing new smart sensors that can collect information from shoppers. It explained how its technology can already detect misplaced items in stores and work out where they should be from the shop's inventory. The sensors can also pry into the minds of shoppers, identifying items that go into changing rooms but never make it to the till. So far, Intel doesn't seem to have a complete connected retail solution to demonstrate. However, it does have a variety of components that it's now linking together through Responsive Retail Platform. The field is another frontier for Intel, a company increasingly desperate to separate itself from its former focus on desktop processors and silicon. With developments in tech no longer emphasising raw processing power, Intel is having to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. After missing out on mobile, the company is aiming to be at the forefront of developments in machine learning, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. Retail stores are one area where these fields combine, making it an attractive investment to Intel. Intel plans to use bots to drive the next retail transformation Intel The company has announced it will spend $100 million on the retail industry over the next five years. According to Intel, this will enable retailers to unify their business, ranging from back-office stock taking to customer promotional campaigns. It will develop data-centric tools and new automated systems to help retail stores take control of their operations. "The retail platform collects multiple data streams to connect digital and physical environments," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. "With the goals of lowering costs and increasing sales, the platform helps optimally place inventory, deploy employees and other resources, and track inventory – through the supply chain to the store door. It provides in-the-moment information about what customers are buying, what they want and how to manage inventory so it arrives just in time for customers to take it home." Intel hasn't yet highlighted how its technology could directly aid the consumer. It's more focused on harvesting data for retailers, an approach that could dissatisfy customers. People aren't currently used to having every action they make in a store tracked and analysed. Intel and retailers that choose to use bots and sensors could face trust issues in convincing customers to keep shopping in their stores. Robots that know when you last purchased what you just put in your cart could be helpful to store managers but more concerning to individuals.

Be in 10 Years? Will the mobile chipmaker’s investments in adjacent markets pay off over the next decade? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jan 16, 2017 at 8:52PM The last decade was a great one for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the largest mobile chipmaker in the world. Its mobile SoCs dominated the smartphone market and forced out rivals like Texas Instruments, Broadcom, and NVIDIA. Its massive patent portfolio bolstered its bottom line with high-margin royalties, which let it hike its dividend annually for 14 straight years. But the next decade could be tougher for Qualcomm, which faces stiff competition in mobile chips and regulatory pressure to lower its royalty rates. Let's take a closer look at how Qualcomm is addressing these challenges with new strategies, and where they might take the chipmaker over the next 10 years. Image source: Qualcomm. Pivoting away from mobile devices Qualcomm remains the 800-pound gorilla among mobile chipmakers, but it's been ceding market share to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from OEMs like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. Qualcomm's "best in breed" high-end Snapdragon chips are still used in many flagship Android devices, but it will likely keep losing market share due to the commoditization of the smartphone market and the growing importance of low-end and mid-range devices. To offset that slowdown, Qualcomm's QCT (chipmaking) division must diversify into adjacent markets. The first major adjacent market is the Internet of Things (IoT), which connects wearables, home automation devices, drones, cars, and other gadgets to the internet. Cisco expects the number of connected devices worldwide to double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion by 2020. Qualcomm is acquiring companies to expand its IoT portfolio. It bought IoT and automotive chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion in 2015, and plans to close its $47 billion purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) later this year. It's also promoting customized Snapdragon chipsets and boards for specific devices -- like Snapdragon Wear for wearables, Snapdragon Automotive for connected cars, and Snapdragon Flight for drones. Rising sales of these new chips could offset declines in mobile devices over the next decade. Declaring war on Intel Qualcomm kept Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) out of the mobile market as it licensed ARM's low-power CPU architecture as Intel stubbornly tried to adapt its PC and data center-based x86 architecture for mobile devices. Intel's x86 mobile chips never measured up to ARM-based ones in terms of power efficiency, and OEMs stuck with Qualcomm or other ARM licensees. But now Qualcomm is eyeing a big move into Intel's territory. Last December, Qualcomm and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that Windows 10 will fully support next-gen Snapdragon processors. Older apps developed for x86 processors will be usable via emulation, which represents a major threat to Intel's decades-long dominance of Windows PCs. Qualcomm also recently started sampling its first 10nm server processor with 48 cores -- double the core count of Intel's 14nm E7 Broadwell processors. If Microsoft starts making Windows Server compatible with Qualcomm's chips, Intel could gradually lose its near-monopoly in the server CPU market over the next few years. Beefing up its patent portfolio Qualcomm's QTL (patent licensing) unit, which generates the lion's share of its profits, takes a low single-digit cut of the wholesale price of every 3G/4G-enabled mobile device sold worldwide. That provided Qualcomm with stable bottom-line growth for years, but defiant regulators and OEMs are now protesting those royalties -- claiming that they make it nearly impossible to generate profits in the low-margin market of smartphones. Qualcomm was forced to lower its cut in China after being hit by a $975 million fine in 2015, and was recently hit by a similar $850 million fine in South Korea. These pressures will likely persist with the commoditization of the smartphone market. The only way out for Qualcomm is to beef up its patent portfolio with additional technologies through R&D or acquisitions. Qualcomm has already added thousands of patents via acquisitions, and the purchases of CSR and NXP will let it generate more royalties from various IoT devices. Where will Qualcomm be in 10 years? Qualcomm's next decade won't be as smooth as its previous one. It will likely shed more market share in mobile chipsets, and its licensing business will be continuously targeted by regulators or smartphone makers. But if Qualcomm's investments into adjacent markets pays off, it could steal market share from NVIDIA in connected cars, Ambarella in connected cameras and drones, and even Intel in PCs and data centers. If that happens, Qualcomm could become a much more diversified chipmaker over the next 10 years. Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's Board of Directors.

Currently, online retailers have access to information on what sorts of merchandise consumers look at, what they purchase, and what they don't. Intel argues physical stores should have the same information.  In a Monday editorial on the company's site, Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich wrote: "At Intel, we believe that increasingly retailers will be separated by those who have data and use it to grow and optimize the shopping experience, and those who don’t and make their decisions based on 'experience' and subjective observations."

Follow TechnoBuffalo Now that Intel has officially launched its seventh generation Kaby Lake processors for desktop, Apple intends on using them. According to an investor note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the Cupertino company is planning to release a MacBook Pro update with Intel’s Kaby Lake chipset being the main focus. Kuo claims Apple’s 12-inch MacBook will be among the first computers to receive Kaby Lake, with mass production on the updated machine expected to kick off in Q2 of this year. But that’ll simply be a taste of what’s to come, according to Kuo. Production on updated 13-inch and 15-inch models is expected to kick off during Q3 of this year, with the inclusion of Intel’s Kaby Lake among the big new features. Apple recently introduced new laptops with Intel’s Skylake processors, improved graphics, and more. That’s not all Apple is also expected to introduce support for 32GB of RAM in the 15-inch model; the existing model is capped at 16GB of RAM, something Apple’s Phil Schiller was done to preserve battery. Finally, Apple may cut the price of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar because the machine hasn’t performed well among consumers, according to Kuo. That could be very good news for folks who don’t need the added functionality of the Touch Bar but don’t want to pay the high entry price of the new 13-inch model. Kuo is typically pretty accurate with his predictions, so we’ll see if he winds up being right as we approach the spring months, which is when Apple usually holds its first big event of the year.

Image: Intel. 6   17 Jan 2017 , 18:58 Highlighting the importance of data and smart and connected solutions in transforming the retail industry, Intel has unveiled Simbe Robotics Tally — the world’s first robotic autonomous shelf auditing and analytics solution for retail. The solution was unveiled at NRF 2017, an annual convention and expo in New York City on Monday. In his keynote, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich demonstrated how Tally works in concert with retail associates by arming them with information to ensure the store’s products are always stocked, in the right place and displaying the correct price tag. The robot operates safely during normal store hours alongside shoppers and employees and does not require any infrastructure changes to the store. Tally is powered by an Intel Core i7 processor-based Intel NUC and uses Intel RealSense cameras to help understand the world around it and navigate the store safely. Krzanich also introduced the Intel Responsive Retail Platform (Intel RRP) — a new platform that helps in creating flexible, scalable and innovative solutions. Intel plans to invest more than $100 million over the next five years in the retail industry that would support Intel’s efforts to integrate Internet of Things (Iot) and other technologies into retail.

Broadwell Vulkan Performance Also Up After Recent Mesa Git Work Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 17 January 2017 at 07:25 AM EST. Add A Comment Yesterday I published a number of OpenGL/Vulkan benchmarks from Mesa Git in Mesa Git Delivering Faster Intel Vulkan Performance, Closer To OpenGL Driver Speed. Those tests were with Skylake desktop graphics so for some follow-up reference tests I also fired up Mesa Git on an Intel Broadwell ultrabook. With the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, the Vulkan performance too goes up when using the fresh Mesa Git following the round of HiZ improvements last week. See the aforelinked article for more back information. Here are those numbers for reference. The i7-5600U isn't really great for gaming, but indeed the Mesa code from last week does boost this system's Broadwell performnace with Vulkan. And makes it a tiny bit faster than OpenGL with the i965 Mesa driver... More details via 1701166-RI-MESAGITTE00 on OpenBenchmarking.org and see yesterday's article for more information. Mesa 17.0 will be released as stable in February.

Intel has launched a new Internet of Things (IoT) retail platform, which intends to make shopping easier by tracking store inventory and responding to customer requirements in real time. The Intel Responsive Retail Platform (Intel RRP), which was unveiled at the National Retail Federation (NRF) show being held in New York, works to bring together retail hardware, software, APIs, and sensors in a standardised way. It gathers various data streams to connect digital and physical environments.  The platform features three components that include a sensor array, gateway to process sensor data and an open-source analytics platform on the cloud. The platform aims to reduce costs and increase sales. Intel said it helps optimally place inventory, deploy employees and other resources, and track inventory – through the supply chain to the store door. Intel is partnering with an ecosystem of retailers to deploy the platform, including Avery Dennison, ByReveal, Honeywell, Fujitsu, JDA, RetailNext, SAP and SATO. The chipmaker is also planning to invest more than $100m over the next five years in the retail industry to support its efforts to integrate aspects of IoT and other technologies like virtual reality and robotics to address needs ranging from inventory management to checkout. At the NRF show, Intel also demonstrated its robotic autonomous shelf auditing and analytics solution for shops. The solution, Simbe Robotics’ Tally, works in concert with retail associates by giving them with information to make sure that the store’s products are always stocked at the right place with correct price tag. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said: “With technology like robots and artificial intelligence to free up employees, every aspect of the store and supply chain will allow retail employees to better focus on the customer and improve the store’s performance. “We’re developing technologies that will help transform the shopping experience in the near future. By bringing together virtual reality and the power of data, we’ll help create the store of the future – one that is smart, responsive, connected and secure.” Tags Homepage News List Intel IoT Sidebar Editor's Pick Previous ArticleBaidu hires ex-Microsoft AI expert as new COO and group president Next ArticleRaspberry Pi bakes in more power for Compute Module 3 launch Most read Lloyds online banking hit by DDoS cyber attack Ellie Burns 23rd January 2017 Cloud and cognitive computing fails to save IBM from 19th quarter of declining revenue James Nunns 20th January 2017 MapR claims open source big data victory with patent award James Nunns 19th January 2017 MongoDB, ElasticSearch hackers now target Hadoop with ransomware Ellie Burns 18th January 2017 UK cyber security skills shortage second worst in the world – and growing Ellie Burns 17th January 2017 Artificial Intelligence startup Maluuba acquired by Microsoft Byomakesh Biswal 16th January 2017 What a 13 year old would write in your digital transformation strategy Ellie Burns 16th January 2017 Latest White Papers How Intel IT’s Integrated Analytics Platform Helps Sales and Marketing By Intel HPE Security Research – Cyber Risk Report 2016 By HPE Le stockage de demain By Kaminario Editor’s Pick Big data: It may be the new oil but have public failures damaged adoption?

Intel GVT-G Starts Being Usable On Linux 4.10, But More Work Still Needed Written by Michael Larabel in Virtualization on 17 January 2017 at 06:24 AM EST. 2 Comments With the Linux 4.10 kernel there is initial mainline support for Intel GVT-G (Graphics Virtualization Technology) while it will become more usable in future updates. Gerd Hoffmann of Red Hat has commented on the current upstream state of GVT-G. With Linux 4.10, there is virtual GPU support via Intel's Graphics Virtualization Technology for Broadwell hardware and newer and it will work without any extra QEMU patches. However, currently it's limited to headless operation, so you won't get any native display support so just useful if you want to do compute with say Beignet or using x11vnc for remote display access. The display support for GVT still requires more changes to the Linux kernel that didn't make it for the 4.10 cycle. There will also be some QEMU patches needed too for the virtual display support. Those are for host requirements while Linux guests will need at least the Linux 4.8 kernel, but there may be some kernel releases not yet quite compatible. This state of GVT was shared this weekend on igvt-g.

The chip giant is launching a Responsive Retail Platform that creates a common set of sensors, software kits and other components for in-store tech. It promises to speed up inventory tracking, provide feedback on buying habits and personalize your shopping. Stores might not have to cobble together separate solutions or make their own -- they'd just have to turn to Intel and partners for everything they need. The company is also backing up its words with cold, hard cash. It's investing over $100 million into the retail industry over the next 5 years to help get the ball rolling.

However, the company is showcasing the kind of technology it wants to see. Simbe Robotics' Tally keeps tabs on store shelves, for instance, while ShopperMXTM HIVE gives retailers a virtual reality preview of store layouts. In short: if it's Intel-powered and pushes technological limits, there's a good chance the company is thinking about it. Intel probably isn't the first name you associate with retail, but it certainly has clear incentives to jump into this space with both feet. More than anything, it's a way to accelerate Intel's fledgling Internet of Things business -- someone has to design the sensors those stores will use. It also serves as one more hedge against a declining PC industry. It's hard to know if shops will welcome Intel with open arms, but something tells us that the company is willing to wait until people warm up to its presence.

Here's what you need to know about Kaby Lake release date, features, plus specs, models and prices, including the new Pentium chips which now have Hyper-threading. Kaby Lake is 'optimised' Skylake with a few new features By Jim Martin | 8 hours ago Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Back at Computex 2016, Intel confirmed in its keynote that the 7th generation Core processors will launch later in the year. While that was true for laptops, enthusiasts have been kept waiting for the desktop chips. But Intel has now revealed more details on the desktop Kaby Lake release date and specs, including the new sub-£100 Pentium chips which, for the first time, get Hyper-threading. Intel Kaby Lake 7th gen Core processor release date The new Kaby Lake desktop processors are on sale now from Overclockers UK, Scan and other retailers. Rumour has it, via Benchlife, that Intel will launch Kaby Lake X (and Skylake X) chips in August at Gamescom 2017. There will reportedly be 10-, 8 -, 6- and 4 core models. Kaby Lake X will supposedly be the quad-core chip and will have a TDP of 112W and all chips will be marketed as the Core i7-7000 series processors. Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake specs and prices Here are the main specs of the new desktop Core i7 chips. Just three have been announced so far. They are all quad-core with Hyper-Threading. Model Core i7-7700K Core i7-7700 Core i7-7700T Price £339 £309 £309 TDP 91W 65W 35W Cores/Threads 4/8 4/8 4/8 Base Frequency 4.2GHz 3.6GHz 2.9GHz Boost Frequency 4.5GHz 4.2GHz 3.8GHz Unlocked Yes No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 8MB 8MB 8MB   Intel Core i5 Kaby Lake specs and prices Four seventh-gen Core i5 models have been announced (see table below), plus a further three chips with a ‘T’ suffix which denotes they use less power – they all have a 35W TDP. As the table shows, they’re all quad-core parts, but with no Hyper-Threading. Model Core i5-7600K Core i5-7600 Core i5-7500 Core i5-7400 Price £239 £219 £199 £189 TDP 91W 65W 65W 65W Cores/Threads 4/4 4/4 4/4 4/4 Base Frequency 3.8GHz 3.5GHz 3.4GHz 3.0GHz Boost Frequency 4.2GHz 4.1GHz 3.8GHz 3.5GHz Unlocked Yes No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 6MB 6MB 6MB 6MB These are the 35W 'T' models: Model Core i5-7600T Core i5-7500T Core i5-7400T Price £219 £199 £179 TDP 35W 35W 35W Cores/Threads 4/4 4/4 4/4 Base Frequency 2.8GHz 2.7GHz 2.4GHz Boost Frequency 3.7GHz 3.3GHz 3.0GHz Unlocked No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 6MB 6MB 6MB Intel Core i3 Kaby Lake specs and prices As with the Core i5 models, the Core i3 is also available as a ‘T’ model which has a 35W TDP. The Core i3 chips have no boost capability, so rely on high base frequency. They’re dual-core chips with Hyper-Threading. Note that the flagship model is unlocked, so Intel is catering to enthusiasts who want to overclock a more affordable chip. Unlike the Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition processor from 2014, the i3-7350K supports Hyper-Threading. Model Core i3-7350K Core i3-7320 Core i3-7300 Core i3-7100 Price £185 £159 £149 £119 TDP 60W 51W 51W 51W Cores/Threads 2/4 2/4 2/4 2/4 Base Frequency 4.2GHz 4.1GHz 4.0GHz 3.9GHz Boost Frequency N/A N/A N/A N/A Unlocked Yes No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 4MB 4MB 4MB 3MB Overall, there is a similar lineup of Kaby Lake processors to Skylake, so you’ll have a choice of an entry-level Core i3, right up to a 10-core Extreme Edition Core i7 (this hasn't launched yet). Prices are unlikely to vary much from the Skylake range, so there will be something to suit every budget. There are of course be laptop and mobile versions of the Kaby Lake desktop chips for everything from ultraportables to all-in-one PCs.   Intel Kaby Lake Pentium specs There are three new Pentium models, each also available in a low-power 'T' model. They support the new Kaby Lake features such as Intel Optane, 4K video and have DDR4 memory controllers. The big news is that they're the first Pentiums to get Hyper-threading, so while they're not true quad-core parts, they do get the performance advantage of being able to process four threads. Model Pentium G4620 Pentium G4600 Pentium G4560 Price £94.99 £83.99 £64.99 TDP 51W 51W 54W Cores/Threads 2/4 2/4 2/4 Base Frequency 3.7GHz 3.6GHz 3.5GHz Boost Frequency N/A N/A N/A Unlocked No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 610 Cache 3MB 3MB 3MB What is Kaby Lake? The 7th-gen Core processors are based on the same 14nm process as Skylake and its predecessor, Broadwell. Intel won’t make the move down to 10nm until the 8th-gen Cannonlake CPUs which are due to launch later in 2017. The original plan was to switch to 10nm back in 2015 but, because of manufacturing problems, it’s sticking with 14nm for Kaby Lake. This disrupts Intel’s Tick-Tock roadmap, since Kaby Lake should be a Tick – a new manufacturing process – but will instead be an ‘optimised’ version of Skylake (which is already an improved version of Broadwell). And that’s now Intel’s plan for the future: no more Tick-Tock, it’s now Process-Architecture-Optimisation. So when we finally get ‘Canonlake’, there will be two more generations based on the 10mm manufacturing process before a move to an even smaller one. Intel Kaby Lake 7th gen Core processor features Optane Memory So what’s new? Well, there’s the obvious performance improvement, but the new 200-series chipset supports Intel’s new Optane memory. This isn’t to be confused with Optane SSDs – it’s a brand new memory module which is designed to make a PC with a traditional mechanical hard drive feel more like one equipped with an SSD. Few details are yet known about Optane Memory, other than it uses 3D Crosspoint memory. Intel hasn’t yet said anything about capacities or prices. It has confirmed that Optane Memory modules won’t work in older Z170 boards, or with Skylake chips, though. These should be available to buy within the next six months. Better overclocking Kaby Lake chips have a 300MHz base frequency boost over the equivalent Skylake chips, but are also better for overclocking. For example, they will automatically adjust voltage to make a given base clock more stable. The second improvement is better control over Turbo Boost. When the chip has to process an AVX instruction it will downclock, then return to a higher clock for normal instructions. With faster clock speeds than Skylake at a given TDP, Kaby Lake is already around 25 percent quicker, but it remains to be see just how fast they will go. Early benchmarks show they are no faster than Skylake (when compared at the same clock speeds). The performance boost comes from using higher clock speeds than the equivalent Skylake chips. If you already have a PC with a 6th-gen Skylake chip, you won't see any better performance simply by upgrading to the equivalent Kaby Lake chip. But if you're still on a third, fourth or fifth-gen Core processor, it could well be a good time to upgrade. Better graphics Certain new U-series processors (which will appear in 2-in-1 laptop/tablet devices) have Iris Plus Graphics 640 GPUs integrated. Intel says this GPU is 65 percent faster than the equivalent Intel HD graphics system. It’s 40 percent faster for quick sync video, and is also capable of 4K video playback. Backwards compatible with 100-series chipsets Desktop Kaby Lake chips are compatible with the existing 100-series chipsets, so it’ll be an easy upgrade from Skylake, assuming manufacturers provide BIOS updates for the new chips. However, you will miss out on Optane Memory support (which we’re assured won’t be added to any 100-series boards) and possibly certain overclocking features.

But potential buyers in the region have safety concerns that could hold back widespread adoption. According to a December 2016 survey by Intel and Intuit, which asked internet users in Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan who owned or intended to buy a car if they would consider purchasing a so-called "driverless" car, interest was high. More than half (51%) of total respondents said they would consider buying one. Respondents in Taiwan were the most enthusiastic, with 80% saying they would contemplate owning a self-driving car, vs. Australia, where only 24% would consider it. Intel's survey is not the first to notice significant interest in autonomous vehicles among consumers in Asia-Pacific. In June 2015, for instance, an Arthur D. Little study of internet users' "acceptance" of such vehicles in select countries worldwide found that those in China, South Korea and Japan had the highest rates of approval. But even as consumers in Asia-Pacific indicate enthusiasm for the idea of self-driving vehicles, they still have concerns that could hold back adoption. In Intel's study, many expressed worries about issues like a lack of safety standards for driverless cars (79%), or had questions about how the cars might react when dealing with a situation for which they had not been programmed (76%). Although the road to success for self-driving cars in Asia-Pacific looks to be relatively traffic-free, marketers in the space would be wise to develop strategies to address consumers' concerns sooner rather than later. —Jeremy Kressmann New in eMarketer PRO This Week Report: Digital Video Advertising Best Practices 2017 Report: Worldwide Digital Video Viewers: eMarketer's Estimates for 2016–2020 Report: B2B Mobile Marketing and Advertising 2017 Not a PRO subscriber?

Image: Intel Window shopping is quickly becoming a thing of the past. To that end, Intel has debuted its IoT retail platform, driven by technologies such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. While the internet of things and data analysis have already entered the retail industry supply chain to some degree, the customer side of the business is yet to be radically transformed. That may be about to change. Intel has unveiled what it is calling the Responsive Retail Platform (RRP), an effort to fill major high street stores with sensors, robots and 3D printers. The robot takeover begins In an announcement at NRF 2017 – one of the largest retail conferences in the world – Intel explained that the RRP will connect all aspects of a store, from the items in the showroom to the stockroom. The basis of the platform will be Intel’s RFID sensors – though the company has said it will be extendable to third-party sensors, as well – to allow the tracking of inventory in stores, and to do things like gathering data for the shop owner on customer trends and tastes. Powering the sensors will be Intel’s established Core i7 processor, but the company has said that, depending on the results found during the initial roll-out, it could expand RRP to the more powerful Xeon processor. On-demand, in-store 3D knitting Also showcased at the launch was a robot that would do little to ease fears of a robot takeover of the workplace. An on-demand, in-store 3D knitting machine powered by Intel technology. Image: Intel Developed by Simbe Robotics, and driven by Intel hardware, Tally is one of the world’s first robotic autonomous shelf auditing and analytics solutions for retail, which roams a store telling the manager that products are always stocked, in the right place and displaying the correct price tag. Some other technologies making their debuts were on-demand, in-store 3D knitting; real-time, data-driven clothing; and interactive product displays to target customers more directly, whether that be in this reality, or a virtual one. During his on-stage address, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that the company plans to spend $100m on RPP over the course of the next five years. The company announced late last year that it plans to spend up to $250m on autonomous driving tech. “[Virtual reality] will help customers and retailers use data and analytics to maximise investment and impact in retail. It could be a game changer,” Krzanich said in a blog post. “With technology like robots and [artificial intelligence] to free up employees, every aspect of the store and supply chain will allow retail employees to better focus on the customer and improve the store’s performance.” Related: Intel, employers, AI, retail, internet of things Colm Gorey is a journalist with Siliconrepublic.com editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Machines Intel buys 15pc stake in Here to develop autonomous car mapping tech 4 Jan 201710 Shares Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Working at the leading edge of IoT Innovation for mobility and the internet of things Help develop the future of sales and trading Machines How IoT intersects with everyday life, and the not-so everyday 22 Nov 201623 Shares Noel Murphy: How IoT can make the ordinary extraordinary 28 Nov 201610 Shares WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT FEATURED EMPLOYERS?

Be in 10 Years? Will the mobile chipmaker’s investments in adjacent markets pay off over the next decade? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jan 16, 2017 at 8:52PM The last decade was a great one for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the largest mobile chipmaker in the world. Its mobile SoCs dominated the smartphone market and forced out rivals like Texas Instruments, Broadcom, and NVIDIA. Its massive patent portfolio bolstered its bottom line with high-margin royalties, which let it hike its dividend annually for 14 straight years. But the next decade could be tougher for Qualcomm, which faces stiff competition in mobile chips and regulatory pressure to lower its royalty rates. Let's take a closer look at how Qualcomm is addressing these challenges with new strategies, and where they might take the chipmaker over the next 10 years. Image source: Qualcomm. Pivoting away from mobile devices Qualcomm remains the 800-pound gorilla among mobile chipmakers, but it's been ceding market share to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from OEMs like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. Qualcomm's "best in breed" high-end Snapdragon chips are still used in many flagship Android devices, but it will likely keep losing market share due to the commoditization of the smartphone market and the growing importance of low-end and mid-range devices. To offset that slowdown, Qualcomm's QCT (chipmaking) division must diversify into adjacent markets. The first major adjacent market is the Internet of Things (IoT), which connects wearables, home automation devices, drones, cars, and other gadgets to the internet. Cisco expects the number of connected devices worldwide to double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion by 2020. Qualcomm is acquiring companies to expand its IoT portfolio. It bought IoT and automotive chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion in 2015, and plans to close its $47 billion purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) later this year. It's also promoting customized Snapdragon chipsets and boards for specific devices -- like Snapdragon Wear for wearables, Snapdragon Automotive for connected cars, and Snapdragon Flight for drones. Rising sales of these new chips could offset declines in mobile devices over the next decade. Declaring war on Intel Qualcomm kept Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) out of the mobile market as it licensed ARM's low-power CPU architecture as Intel stubbornly tried to adapt its PC and data center-based x86 architecture for mobile devices. Intel's x86 mobile chips never measured up to ARM-based ones in terms of power efficiency, and OEMs stuck with Qualcomm or other ARM licensees. But now Qualcomm is eyeing a big move into Intel's territory. Last December, Qualcomm and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that Windows 10 will fully support next-gen Snapdragon processors. Older apps developed for x86 processors will be usable via emulation, which represents a major threat to Intel's decades-long dominance of Windows PCs. Qualcomm also recently started sampling its first 10nm server processor with 48 cores -- double the core count of Intel's 14nm E7 Broadwell processors. If Microsoft starts making Windows Server compatible with Qualcomm's chips, Intel could gradually lose its near-monopoly in the server CPU market over the next few years. Beefing up its patent portfolio Qualcomm's QTL (patent licensing) unit, which generates the lion's share of its profits, takes a low single-digit cut of the wholesale price of every 3G/4G-enabled mobile device sold worldwide. That provided Qualcomm with stable bottom-line growth for years, but defiant regulators and OEMs are now protesting those royalties -- claiming that they make it nearly impossible to generate profits in the low-margin market of smartphones. Qualcomm was forced to lower its cut in China after being hit by a $975 million fine in 2015, and was recently hit by a similar $850 million fine in South Korea. These pressures will likely persist with the commoditization of the smartphone market. The only way out for Qualcomm is to beef up its patent portfolio with additional technologies through R&D or acquisitions. Qualcomm has already added thousands of patents via acquisitions, and the purchases of CSR and NXP will let it generate more royalties from various IoT devices. Where will Qualcomm be in 10 years? Qualcomm's next decade won't be as smooth as its previous one. It will likely shed more market share in mobile chipsets, and its licensing business will be continuously targeted by regulators or smartphone makers. But if Qualcomm's investments into adjacent markets pays off, it could steal market share from NVIDIA in connected cars, Ambarella in connected cameras and drones, and even Intel in PCs and data centers. If that happens, Qualcomm could become a much more diversified chipmaker over the next 10 years. Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's Board of Directors.

Magdalena Petrova (IDG News Service) 17 January, 2017 11:47 - - - - print email Comments Intel wants to level the playing field between online retailers and brick and mortar shops by introducing IoT technologies into physical stores. Currently, online retailers have access to information on what sorts of merchandise consumers look at, what they purchase, and what they don't. And Intel argues physical stores should have the same information.  In a Monday editorial on the company's site, Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich wrote: "At Intel, we believe that increasingly retailers will be separated by those who have data and use it to grow and optimize the shopping experience, and those who don’t and make their decisions based on 'experience' and subjective observations." The company is showcasing some of its IoT technologies at the National Retail Federation show in New York.  The Rise of 'Data and Analytics' Roles Points to Digital Business Transformation More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Intel has a $100m plan to bring the IoT and robots to the high street Chris Davies - Jan 16, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Shopping is about to get seriously high-tech, with Intel launching its Responsive Retail Platform, an Internet of Things upgrade for stores that will track shoppers as much as stock. Announced today, the Intel RRP is effectively a combination of a common language for various sensors intended for use in retail environments, a new tracking device, and a cloud-gateway combination that, altogether, promise to make brick & mortar stores as clever as their pattern-calculating online counterparts. Along the way, it might also mean more robots in the aisles. While online shopping has been at the forefront of Big Data-style pattern crunching, with retailers like Amazon building vast and comprehensive profiles of each customer so as to make better recommendations and encourage more sales, physical stores have been slower to upgrade. That’s something Intel plans to pump $100m into over the next five years, CEO Brian Krzanich said today. Intel RRP is built around a new Responsive Retail Sensor, a multi-sensor product with an RFID reader and antenna specially designed for dense retail environments. It’s intended to record from numerous data points across the store; eventually, Intel says, it’ll expand to include video gathering along with WiFi and Bluetooth LE connectivity. It’s based on an Intel Atom processor. Each of those sensors communicates with the RRP Gateway. That’s currently built by HP, which has two such systems, each hooking up to the Responsive Retail Sensors over ethernet and using Intel’s Core i7 and Xeon processors. Data is passed to the cloud via wired, WiFi, or 3G/LTE networks; some local processing of real-time analytics is supported, but for everything else there’s an open-source analytics platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that can be run in AWS, Azure, or similar. It’s that which does the interesting work. For instance, with a combination of RFID, video, radio, and other sensors, Intel’s new platform could keep track of stock in real-time, spotting incorrectly-placed items on shelves, and tallying up what’s on the floor and what’s in the back room. Items taken into changing rooms but not subsequently making it to the checkout could be monitored, both to help prevent theft and to figure out what isn’t being loved enough to make a sale. The upgraded aisles, meanwhile, could be patrolled by stock-checking robots like Simbe Robotics’ Tally. Resembling a price-check scanner atop a Roomba, the robot is designed to take on some of the more mundane tasks that human staff would otherwise need to. That includes auditing shelves for out-of-stock items and low stock items, looking out for misplaced items, and spotting any pricing errors. Tally can be active during store hours, and in combination with other sensors opens the door to even more precise restocking schedules. Intel isn’t the only tech company looking to revolutionize old-school retail, of course. Last month, Amazon revealed plans to open a physical store in 2017 that, with a combination of cameras and other sensors, would do away completely with the traditional checkout process. Shoppers at the store, dubbed Amazon Go, would check in with their Amazon account and then be observed as they grabbed items from the shelves; simply walking out at the end would be enough to trigger payment.

ByNatalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | January 16, 2017 -- 15:35 GMT (07:35 PST) | Topic: Internet of Things Image: Intel Intel CEO Brian Krzanich spoke at the National Retail Federation's Big Show conference on Monday and announced the chipmaker's latest platform for the retail sector. What's Hot on ZDnet ​Samsung's report should quell fears, but brand recoveries take time The biggest barrier to Windows 10 success is still Windows 7 For national security, Trump gets a new secure 'smartphone' How social media is crippling democracy, and why we seem powerless to stop it It's called the Responsive Retail Platform (RRP), and according to Intel, it connects disparate islands of in-store technology and makes it easier to develop and deploy Internet of Things (IoT) software and services. Simply put, it works to bring together retail hardware, software, APIs, and sensors in a standardized way. "Think of it as a Xeon-based multi-tenant processor for the store," said Intel marketing director Ryan Parker, during a pre-briefing on the news. The core of the platform is Intel's low-power integrated sensor with RFID capability and an expandable sensor suite that allows for the eventual inclusion of other sensors from third-party sensor vendors. The sensors can be used to track inventory and generate in-store data that highlights store activity and customer preferences. The RRP also includes an open source analytics platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for cloud applications from independent software vendors (ISVs). The current RRP runs on an Intel Core i7 processor-based gateway, but as more use cases become available, Intel said it will enable Intel Xeon processor-based gateways for better efficiency. The platform is available today through Intel's partner ecosystem. "This is one of those rare situations where it's a win-win-win," Parker added. "It's a win for Intel, and a win for sensor vendors and ISVs because they don't currently have access to the market. And retailers get a lot of choice." Intel also announced plans to invest more than $100 million over the next five years in the retail industry. The investment supports Intel's wider efforts to integrate aspects of IoT and other technologies like virtual reality and robotics into retail to address needs ranging from inventory management to checkout. Krzanich made sure to note that this kind of technology innovation is not intended to displace workers -- a growing concern with the rise of robotics, artificial intelligence and automation in the workplace -- but rather to allow stores to shift human resources to other areas in operations. "With technology like robots and artificial intelligence to free up employees, every aspect of the store and supply chain will allow retail employees to better focus on the customer and improve the store's performance," Krzanich said. "By bringing together virtual reality and the power of data, we'll help create the store of the future -- one that is smart, responsive, connected and secure." Also at NRF, Intel is showcasing new technology for on-demand, in-store 3D knitting, real-time clothing and shoe matching platforms, and interactive product displays designed to boost customer engagement.

Mesa Git Delivering Faster Intel Vulkan Performance, Closer To OpenGL Driver Speed Written by Michael Larabel in Display Drivers on 16 January 2017. Page 1 of 3. 5 Comments In addition to Nouveau Gallium3D seeing a performance boost last week, last week Intel's Vulkan driver also seen some interesting work around HiZ. Here are some fresh benchmarks showing recent performance improvements to the Intel "ANV" Mesa Vulkan driver plus some fresh OpenGL benchmarks too. For this testing are results for a Core i5 6600K "Skylake" system with HD Graphics 530. Tests were done on Ubuntu 16.10 with the Linux 4.10 Git kernel. Being compared today was Mesa 13.0.3 stable, Mesa 13.1-dev Git from earlier this year, and then Mesa 17.0-dev Git (since being renamed from 13.1 to 17.0) from today. So there's a look at how the performance compares to the current stable series and then how the graphics performance has evolved in just the past two weeks. With the Mesa 17.0 branching expected at any time now, this is nearly what the Intel Skylake Mesa performance will look like for next month's Mesa 17.0.0 debut. All of these Intel Linux OpenGL and Vulkan benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

Page 1 of 1. 9 Comments The MSI X99A RAIDER is a sub-$200 LGA-2011 v3 motherboard. I've been using it for almost two months now on one of the daily Linux benchmarking systems and it's been running great. This shouldn't be a big surprise though given the Intel X99 chipset is now rather mature and in the past I've successfully tested the MSI X99A WORKSTATION and X99S SLI PLUS motherboards on Linux. The X99A RAIDER is lower cost than these other MSI X99 motherboards I've tested, which led me in its direction, and then sticking with MSI due to the success with these other boards and MSI being a supporter of Phoronix and encouraging our Linux hardware testing compared to some other vendors. The MSI X99A RAIDER supports LGA-2011v3 Xeon / Core CPUs, up to eight DDR4-UDIMM ECC memory modules, USB 3.1 support, M.2 storage, SATA Express + SATA 3.0, Intel Gigabit LAN, and all the other usual features expected from modern motherboards. I've been running this system with an Intel Xeon E5-2609 v4 Broadwell CPU, 16GB of DDR4-2133 memory, and 256GB Corsair Force LX SSD graphics. The Linux distributions I've run with this setup include Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 16.10, and Intel Clear Linux. Currently this system is used for daily Clear Linux benchmarks on LinuxBenchmarking.com. For those interested there are some benchmarks with this motherboard on OpenBenchmarking.org. Several weeks into using this system, the MSI X99A RAIDER continues working out great so simply wanted to pass it along in case anyone else is looking for a X99 / LGA-2011v3 motherboard on the lower-cost side at under $200 USD. Those potentially interested can find the motherboard currently in stock at NewEgg.com. Those with any questions about it and Linux can drop by our forums.

By Quiruben Dela Cruz https://twitter.com/Vhelskud on January 16 2017 11:26 PM PHOTOGRAPH: PlayStation | Share Tweet Share Share Email The Styx: Shards of Darkness system requirements had just been revealed. It appears as if the Unreal Engine 4 stealth-based assassin game is a bit demanding. Users must have a high CPU content, as well as at least 8GB of RAM accompanied by a moderate GPU. Styx: Shards of Darkness System Requirements When it comes to the AMD side, the developers ask for an Octa-core Piledriver CPU or stronger. As for the Intel side, the game requires an Intel Quad-Core Broadwell i5 running at 3.1GHz or stronger. In addition to this, the game will require an NVIDIA GTX 570 or R7 370 graphics processing unit or above. All of the specifications mentioned above should be accompanied by at least 8GB of RAM. The RAM specification appears to be lower given that games nowadays usually require 16GB. Furthermore, the game itself looks impressive when it comes to the graphical side. PlayStation Hence, users playing on resolutions higher than 1920 x 1080p should have a higher-end hardware, especially on the GPU side. Increasing the graphical settings could also result in lower performance. In that case, players who wish to play the game at higher graphical settings and resolutions should at least have twice the power of the hardware mentioned above. As for the Styx: Shards of Darkness system requirements breakdown, read on below. Processor: Intel Core i5-5675 at 3.1GHz or AMD FX 8320 at 3.5GHz Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 570 or AMD Radeon R7 370 RAM: 8GB Operating System: Windows 7 64-bit Additional Notes: Online connections is required for the game’s Co-op Play. Styx: Shards of Darkness Release Date The game is scheduled to arrive on March 14 on PC. With that in mind, there is still a lot of time for the developers to figure out the recommended specifications for the game. However, the absence of the recommended settings is kind of a bad sign. Recommended system requirements usually aim for “High” settings on most games. For more news and updates on Styx: shards of Darkness system requirements, stay tuned to TheBitBag.

And there are signs of progress. [Photo: Unsplash user Cindy Tang] More from Innovation Agents What Jay Z's Tidal Gains By Selling A Stake To Sprint Qualcomm's Wearable Boss On Why There's No Moore's Law For Smartwatches Facebook's Creative Shop: What Can It Do For Small Businesses (And Itself)? This Fintech Giant Wants To Recreate The Bell Labs Experience In NYC Jared Newman 01.16.17 6:00 AM Smart home gadgets were everywhere at the CES trade show in January, from useful iterations on connected light bulbs and door locks to odder endeavors such as fridge cams and connected trash cans. But one theme was constant: They're not all going to work together. While some of these devices can communicate with others, no universal language yet exists for the "Internet of Things"—the industry catch-all term for ordinary devices made more powerful through connectivity. Device makers must instead choose between disparate frameworks such as Apple's HomeKit, Samsung's SmartThings, Works with Nest, Android's Things, and Amazon's Alexa. The burden then falls on users to determine whether the products they want are compatible with the system they bought into. The good news is that standardization is under way, with meaningful progress toward a common language for all these devices. But it'll probably be another CES or two until consumers start to notice. No More Standards War The Open Connectivity Foundation—the industry body that's building an Internet of Things standard—didn't have an outsized presence at CES. Its modest demo pavilion blended into a sea of booths within the smart home section of the Sands Expo, which itself is a shuttle ride away from the cavernous Las Vegas Convention Center that serves as CES's main venue. Yet the firms that are leading OCF are some of the biggest in technology, including Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung, LG, and Sony. LIFX light bulbs support OCF predecessor AllSeen. Until about a year ago, those companies were split on how to standardize. Intel and Samsung belonged to one standards group, called the Open Interconnect Consortium, while Qualcomm, Microsoft, LG, and Sony were part of the AllSeen Alliance. Each group was developing its own framework, with seemingly different policies over intellectual property, structure, and bylaws. But over the last year, those two groups hashed out their differences and merged into one entity, now called the OCF. All members are now working toward a single framework that will support the couple dozen existing products already certified by AllSeen. With the newfound unity, there's been an uptick in interest from device makers; the group now has more than 300 members. "I think we've eliminated one of the potential hurdles for other companies to consider joining and participating," says Matt Perry, a Microsoft program manager who is also the OCF's president. Look For The Logo The goal for this year, Perry says, is to get products into the market. Member companies are now trying to define standard behavior for various types of devices—for instance, a common on-off function across all connected light bulbs, and a common set of climate adjustments for smart thermostats—and are coming up with a certification process. The group has also started working beyond the smart home, into automotive and industrial applications. "A standard's just a standard. When it really gets interesting is when you have real products that are interoperating together, and that makes it more compelling for other companies to join," Perry says. The connected refrigerator at the OCF's CES display To that end, the OCF used its CES booth to demonstrate how products might work together. A living room section showed light bulbs, a TV, an air conditioner, and a robot vacuum cleaner all turning on and off from a single command on a Windows PC. In the kitchen section, the touch screen on a connected fridge triggered the room's lighting, air purifier, air conditioner, and coffee maker. The OCF also demonstrated its potential for medical devices, for instance allowing different-brand blood pressure detectors to feed standardized information into a single smartphone app. Once the OCF feels it has enough products, it'll offer a logo that consumers can look for. The logo wasn't always a certainty—last year, Perry said the OCF was still evaluating whether to create one—but since then, member companies have started to ask for it. "The companies are proud of the work they put in from a tech perspective, and they trust the certification program, so they wanted to have some way to represent that work, and asked us to have a cert mark so they can put it on their products," says Kimberly Lewis, a marketing program manager for Intel's Standards and Advanced Technologies group. The OCF isn't giving a timeline for when that logo might appear, or how many devices the group would like to see on the market first. But Lewis notes that there's a lot of interest in pushing things forward. "Everyone's anxious to make money, so it's like, 'When are we going to be done?'" she says. "That's a good problem to have, that people want to start putting this in their products." Can Open Win? Although competition among standards is no longer an obstacle, the OCF still has plenty of competition from existing Internet of Things platforms. Some of the biggest companies in tech, including Apple and Google, aren't participating, nor is smart home mainstay ZigBee, which used CES to announce its own common language for smart homes. Device makers must still make tough decisions about which of these platforms to support. Perry says the OCF's phone lines are still open, though it doesn't sound like there's been much progress in working with the major players who aren't yet on board. For now, the OCF is assuring itself with the long view, believing that free, open standards will prevail over time. People shouldn't have to worry whether their smart door lock is compatible with Apple's system, or Google's, or Amazon's. "There's only one company out there that's probably going to be successful with a vertically integrated stack or solution, and that's Apple," says Gary Martz, Intel's product line director for Internet of Things communications frameworks. "And even then, in markets where they've done this, at some point in time, markets develop to a level of maturity where there are enough industry heavyweights that they'll sit at the table and they'll participate as well." That's not to say there's no room for proprietary systems. One might imagine a virtual assistant like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa sitting on top of all these connected devices, able to control them all in a standard way instead of needing each device maker to add their own support. (Alexa currently has more than 7,000 "skills," but gadget companies must hand-craft each integration individually.) The real value of interoperability, Martz says, is that it grows the overall market so that these kinds of uses can flourish. "The players that recognize this are going to do very well," Martz says. "If somebody comes in and says, 'Oh, my brand is so important, and I'm going to use this space as a competitive barrier,' they're not going to be successful, not in this space, not in the narrow space that OCF has defined as having this common framework." That's not to say there's no room for proprietary systems. But Martz's point is that those systems—whether they're virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, home-monitoring services, or other types of offerings—should sit on top of interoperable hardware. In other words, people shouldn't have to worry whether their smart door lock is compatible with Apple's system, or Google's, or Amazon's. Instead, "door lock" would be a generic concept that every service could tie into, with no walled gardens keeping them out. "The players that recognize this are going to do very well," Martz says, whereas companies that try to use hardware compatibility to beat their competitors will fail. On the whole, he's optimistic that the industry will choose the right path. "[Compatibility] is not the space that we need to differentiate our products on," he adds. "This is the space where we all need to agree on interoperability, so we can all provide features above the standards." Never miss a story.

Until today, the Intel i965 graphics drivers offered by the well-known Padoka and Oibaf PPAs for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) and Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) operating systems exposed only OpenGL 4.0 for Intel Haswell GPUs, thus support for some demanding games just wasn’t there. Last week, we told you that the Mesa team decided to change the versioning scheme of the devel branch to Mesa 17.0.0 from 13.1.0, a change that, apparently, will happen at the beginning of every year, and that developer Juan A. Suarez Romero announced new patches that implement support for Intel Haswell 64-bit vertex attributes. Since then, we’ve been monitoring the Padoka and Oibaf PPAs, and only today, January 14, 2017, are these patches available in both of them for the Intel i965 open-source graphics drivers, along with the latest Mesa 17.0.0-devel series, of course.

It will go on sale on 25 January. The workstation is being marked as the first “mini workstation designed for CAD users”. Regardless of your inclination to using CAD, the workstation is quite powerful. You get a choice of CPUs, ranging from an Intel i3 6100 to an i7 6700 and Xeon E3-1245 v5. You get 32GB of RAM at 2133MHz, a 500GB or 1TB HDD or, for performance, various configurations of 256GB PCIe-based SSD modules. For graphics, you can either stick with Intel’s integrated graphics option (HD Graphics 530 or HD Graphics PS30) or you can opt for a discrete chip in the form of the Nvidia Quadro M620. You get one spare M.2 slot, 2 USB 3.0 ports on the side, and on the back, two USB 3.0 ports and 2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type C ports. Depending on your configuration, you’ll get either a 135W or 200W power supply unit. The dimensions and weight of this workstation is what makes it special. The base model tips the scale at a mere 2.04 kg, which is less than that of many workstation laptops. It’s also small enough (2.3 inches tall) to be mounted behind your monitor via a VESA bracket. The workstation will come pre-loaded with Windows 10 Pro or Linux. HP claims that the workstation starts at Rs 72,000 and if the base model does indeed come with an Intel i3 6100 CPU, the price is on the higher side.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 16 January 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Startup pays real people to answer questions to build better AI The more data, the better: A file photo of a humanoid robot operating a switchboard during a demonstration by a German research centre for artificial intelligence at CeBit in Hanover. Mighty AI obtains specific information for companies interested in building smarter AI software. — Reuters To set up effective artificial intelligence software, a company needs a lot of data. But what happens if you don't have that kind of specific information about your area?  A Seattle-based startup, Mighty AI (formerly known as Spare5) will get it for you by paying subject-matter experts to spend a few minutes answering questions or performing tasks. Some examples include finding golf aficionados for IBM, people who can describe a photo for Getty Images, and radiologists or technicians to read tumour scans.   The company, which renamed itself to reflect a focus on AI training tasks, is adding three new investors as part of a US$14mil (RM62.46mil) funding round: Intel Capital, Google Ventures and Accenture Ventures. It's unveiling partnerships with Intel and Accenture, too.  Spare5 was spun out of Seattle-based VC Madrona Venture's labs in 2014, a mobile rival to Amazon's Mechanical Turk program, which finds workers for tasks online. Around the same time, Getty, reached out to get help categorising images in its collection.  Like Getty, customers increasingly wanted Fives – the people that take on the “microtasks” – to perform brief activities that train AI algorithms. So Spare5 refocused and renamed itself around that idea.  “There's an arms race in training data” for AI, said chief executive officer Matt Bencke.  IBM, with its focus on Watson AI products, wanted to create a chat bot for spectators at the 2016 Masters golf tournament it sponsors. Using tablets on site or their own mobile phones, golf fans would be able to ask the bot questions or banter with it. The only problem? IBM couldn't find enough annotated golf-related training data.   So IBM sent Mighty AI a large body of information culled from the web that it thought was related to golf. Mighty AI found workers familiar with golf, had them tag information specific to the sport and compose questions and answers based on the material. That data became the basis of IBM's Watson golf conversational agent.   Accenture and Intel see Mighty AI as a way to help their customers deploy artificial intelligence apps and algorithms more quickly, letting them use Accenture services to set them up and Intel software and chips to run them.   “What we like about Mighty AI is that for a lot of our customers the first step is annotating data – they need that before they can build on top of our chips and software for AI,” said Ken Elefant, Intel Capital managing director for software and security. “With Mighty AI all of this annotation will happen at a much faster rate which will help Intel customers deploy much more quickly.”  Some companies handle the problem by trying to label data themselves, and others use general crowdsourcing software like Mechanical Turk or CrowdFlower, Bencke said.   Mighty AI has more than 100,000 specialists in 155 countries and it rates how they handle tasks. If the person does well, he or she gets paid more and gets offered more jobs. A poor job will generate feedback and eventually lead to termination if the person doesn't improve.  Mighty AI dubs its product “Training Data as a Service,” a riff on cloud product categories like “Infrastructure as a Service” and “Software as a Service.”   Previous investors Madrona Venture Group, Foundry Group and New Enterprise Associates also participated in this funding round. — Bloomberg You May Be Interested China startup Mobike teams up with Foxconn as it plans surge in bike output Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Time to say goodbye TM offers free speed upgrade – do you qualify?

 Qualcomm allegedly paid Apple billions of dollars in rebates to use its chips Kif Leswing Jan. 17, 2017, 5:28 PM 13,391 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty/Chip Somodevilla A newly unsealed antitrust suit from the Federal Trade Commission alleges that Qualcomm entered into an anticompetitive deal with Apple to keep its modem chips in Apple's products, including the iPhone and iPad.  The deal allegedly included "substantial incentive payments" on the condition that Apple would continue using Qualcomm's baseband processors "exclusively" in all iPhone and iPad models from 2011 and 2012. "In all, Qualcomm’s 2011 and 2013 agreements with Apple provided for billions of dollars in conditional rebates from Qualcomm to Apple," according to a complaint filed by the FTC. Qualcomm not only makes the chip that lets phones like Apple's connect to high-speed LTE wireless networks, but it also owns a significant amount of the underlying patents and intellectual property. Qualcomm licenses that IP to other companies, like Intel and MediaTek, that also make LTE baseband processors.  Basically, the FTC is alleging that Qualcomm strong armed phone makers by essentially bundling its chips along with its licenses. If a phone maker like Apple were to use Qualcomm's chips, then it would get a deal on the associated property licenses.  If a phonemaker were to use a competitor's chips, then it would pay extra IP royalties.  The discount on the licenses was allegedly paid to Apple in the form of conditional rebates. Conditions allegedly included not using a competitive wireless technology backed by Intel, agreeing not to sue Qualcomm over royalties, and using Qualcomm chips in forthcoming iPhones and iPads.  Qualcomm and Apple allegedly struck deals in 2007, 2011, and 2013 over these royalties.  "Under these agreements, Qualcomm provided Apple large lump sum payments that constituted partial relief from Qualcomm royalties. Qualcomm conditioned this relief on Apple’s exclusive use of Qualcomm baseband processors in new iPhone and iPad models," according to the suit. The FTC did not charge Apple, and in its complaint, suggests that Apple may have chafed under Qualcomm's licensing deals.  Qualcomm vigorously refuted the premise of the FTC's claims against it, saying that "the complaint is based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry." "Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC’s allegation to the contrary -- the central thesis of the complaint -- is wrong," the company said in a statement.  Qualcomm also accused the FTC of accelerating its investigation and filing the complaint days before a change in administration, and a time when two of the commission's five seats are vacant. 'No license, no chips' If Apple or another phone maker were to use another company's baseband processor, Qualcomm would ask for higher royalties on its IP. "The FTC alleges that this tactic forces cell phone manufacturers to pay elevated royalties to Qualcomm on products that use a competitor’s baseband processors," the FTC said in a press release.  One possible reason that Qualcomm allegedly struck the deal with Apple is that if Apple were to use a different supplier, that supplier might become more competitive with Qualcomm. "Qualcomm’s exclusive supply arrangement with Apple denied other baseband processor suppliers the benefits of working with a particularly important cell phone manufacturer and hampered their development into effective competitors," the FTC wrote in its complaint.  Ultimately, Qualcomm has few competitors for high-end baseband modems. In the past year, Intel has started to supply LTE modems for the iPhone 7, but tests showed that the Qualcomm-equipped iPhone 7 has marginally better wireless performance than the one with Intel's baseband chip.  Read the entire complaint below: Qualcomm Redacted Complaint by Kif Leswing on Scribd SEE ALSO: The next laptops Apple launches could fix the biggest complaints about the new MacBook Pro More: Apple Patents Qualcomm facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Qualcomm allegedly paid Apple billions of dollars in rebates to use its chips Qualcomm allegedly paid Apple billions of dollars in rebates to use its chips A newly unsealed antitrust suit from the...

The company's first product was a crowd-funded $120 device that made a 14" laptop-of-sorts out of pretty much anything with an HDMI output. Now the company is back with a second revision that can also turn one of Intel's recently-announced Compute Cards into a hybrid tablet-laptop device with a touchscreen. The device is shaped like a conventional tablet with a bulge in the chassis, where the Compute Card is inserted. The company cleverly calls this bulge an ergonomic hand grip. Instead of the old Micro HDMI plug, the second-generation NexDock uses a USB Type-C port that allows a connected device to provide brains for the screen while simultaneously being charged. The potential of a device like this is easy enough to recognize. The NexDock offers easy-to-understand functionality for the average user. A particularly active person who is tough on hinges and screens could keep a couple NexDocks on hand and easily swap his computer or smartphone from chassis to chassis. Frequent upgraders can easily reuse the docking unit as they move to newer devices, too. NexDock says a crowdfunding campaign for the new docking unit with Intel Compute Card compatibility will begin in mid-2017.   Tags: Systems Displays Mobile computing User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

On January 6, the US Intelligence Community released a report saying it had high confidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. "This is not a questionable case. It is plainly evident to all of our intelligence agencies… that Russia was behind the hacking of American political organizations," Rhodes stated on Tuesday. "It is an insult to our intelligence to suggest that that did not happen right in front of our eyes." The report did not offer proof for the claims that Russia attempted to hack and influence the US election process, but made the claims anyway. Russia has repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues.

The device was a good fit for Continuum for Phones, and despite some pretty minor delays was eventually shipped out to all backers. Now the company is back with the next generation of their device, and this time it will be powered by Intel’s Compute Card. The Intel Compute Card is a fully self-contained PC that packs a CPU and GPU with RAM, storage, and wireless connectivity and is only slightly longer than a credit card (95mm X 55mm X 5mm). As one of Intel’s initial regional partners, the new NexDock will be the first docking unit that supports the Intel Compute Cards in 2-in-1 laptop form. You can read more about the Compute Card, which Intel announced, at CES, here. The PC will fit in a slot inside the shell, but Windows 10 Mobile fans need not fear, as the device will continue to support the OS and Continuum for Phones, this time via USB-C and with a proper HD display. The new dock is being built from the ground up by new electronic, design and mechanical engineers to come up with a high quality, retail level product on par with big players in the market. The new dock is expected around mid-2017, around the same time as Intel’s Compute Card is expected to drop. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Industrial giant Honeywell International Inc. will team up with chip maker Intel Corp. to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for the retail industry to enhance logistics, improve inventory visibility, and drive supply chain efficiencies, the companies said Monday. By combining Intel's processing capabilities with Honeywell's data collection platforms, the new partners hope to pitch those solutions to customers, such as retail businesses, that are struggling to maintain profitability and compete with rivals in an age where consumers are shifting to online shopping, the firms said during the National Retail Federation (NRF's) annual convention in New York City. Honeywell has been boosting its investment in logistics solutions since the company paid $1.5 billion to acquire material handling automation provider Intelligrated Systems Inc. in July 2016. Both firms had their own booths at the NRF show, but held briefings together as they continue to integrate their products and client bases. Fort Mill, S.C.-based Honeywell Scanning and Mobility said that after the merger, Intelligrated's warehouse execution system (WES) software and order fulfillment technologies would complement Honeywell's product lines in mobile computers, scanning and automatic-identification, and voice automation technology. Now Honeywell is taking another step toward the goal of networking those retail and material handling platforms by partnering with microprocessor industry leader Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif. The companies plan to leverage their combined technology offerings, including sensors; handheld computers; processors; bar code scanners; radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and readers; and cloud-based software. Working in symphony, those technologies can help businesses track, monitor, and assess the condition of goods moving through the supply chain as well as in brick-and-mortar stores, the companies said. "Technology can help transform retail, making stores more responsive to customer needs by connecting physical and digital retail environments," Joe Jensen, vice president and general manager of Intel's retail solutions division, said in a release. "By working with Honeywell, Intel plans to enable retailers to benefit from IoT solutions by having the visibility of real-time accuracy of on-shelf inventory.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS LINKED STORIES iOS 10 WWDC 2016 AirPods: Ushering in a Wireless Future App Extensions Are Not a Replacement for User Automation 3D Touch for Power Users The Mac mini Family Tree By Stephen Hackett Four members of the Mac mini family. "The Mac mini is BYODKM," Steve Jobs said, in front of a crowded and slightly confused audience at Macworld 2005. "Bring your own display, keyboard and mouse," he continued. "We supply the computer, you supply the rest." The Mac mini was designed to lure switchers to the platform. A new customer could simply unplug their desktop PC and hook a new Mac mini up to their existing peripherals.1 The original machine started at just $499, making the Mac mini the lowest-cost Mac Apple has ever sold. For some long-time fans, the Mac mini brought back memories of the Macintosh LC, Apple's low-cost Mac in the early 1990s. While totally adorable, the LC was hamstrung to hit a price point, something that Apple managed to avoid with the Mac mini, at least at first. The Mac mini was slower than other desktop Macs at the time, but I thought the compromises made were perfectly fair. Introduced in 2005, the Mac mini was unlike anything else Apple was selling at the time. The original Mac mini was powered by a 1.25 or 1.42 GHz G4 processor, came with a slow 4200 RPM hard drive and just 256 MB of RAM installed. Both initial models came with a Combo optical drive that could read DVDs and burn CDs. All of this was packed into a computer just 2 inches tall and 6.5 inches wide and deep. At this point the iMac and Power Mac were both sporting G5 processors, but the Mac mini's reduced specs helped Apple hit that amazing price point. While I believe many switchers did purchase a Mac mini as their entrance into the Mac OS X ecosystem, the small computer soon garnered a large fan base. People started buying them as servers. They showed up in cars and alongside DVD players in home entertainment setups. In September 2005, Apple silently revved the Mac mini to include a faster hard drive and CPU. The high-end model got a better GPU and a nicer SuperDrive. The Move to Intel Like the iMac, the Mac mini's move to Intel did not involve a radical redesign. Apple kept the case design intact, while adding two additional USB ports, audio in, Gigabit Ethernet and an infrared port for using the Apple Remote with Front Row. That small black plastic at the right of the optical drive opening? That's the infrared port. All of these improvements came with an increase in price. The base model, which is the only Mac to have ever shipped with the Intel Core Solo processor, was $599. The high-end model, with a SuperDrive, Core duo CPU and a larger hard drive was $799. The Mini's industrial design would remain in place for several more generations. The Late 2006 model brought a CPU speed bump, while the Mid 2007 machines came with 1 GB of RAM, larger hard drives and the Core 2 Duo processor. The Mid 2007 model was on sale for 19 months, leading many to worry that the Mac mini was going to be discontinued by Apple.2 Eventually, in March 2009, Apple refreshed the Mac mini again. CPU speed stayed the same, but the update brought Mini DisplayPort in addition to mini-DVI making this the first Mac mini to support multiple displays. Mac mini (Server, Late 2009) In October 2009, Apple introduced a $999 Mac mini that was unlike all other models before it: This machine came with Snow Leopard Server, a 2.53 GHz processor, 4 GB of RAM, and two 500 GB hard drives. To accommodate the second drive, Apple removed the optical drive, leading to a one-off case that looks rather funny today. I think this model shows that Apple had noticed how people were using the Mac mini by this point in the product's life. The machine's low price, small form factor and near-silent operation had made it an attractive option for users who needed a server in their home or office. A "Big" Redesign In the summer of 2010, Apple released a new Mac mini with an all-new design, carved out of a single slab of aluminum. It was shorter and packed a slightly-larger footprint, at 1.5 inches tall and 7.7 inches wide and deep. It's kind of like the original design got squished a bit. The Mid-2010 Mac mini is the only one that featured the unibody design and an optical drive. While upgrading the previous models meant taking a putty knife to the case, the new design included a plastic bottom panel that could be removed with a simple twist. Upgrading the RAM had never been easier. Bolder customers could replace the hard drive, but it wasn't technically a user-serviceable part. Around back, the Mini picked an HDMI port3 as well as an SD card slot. While a separate server model remained, the mainstream Mac mini for 2010 was now $699. 2011 to Today A year later, the Mid 2011 Mac mini brought Thunderbolt, and the removal of the optical drive. Apple brought back the $599 model, and a year later in 2012, the separate Server edition was quietly discounted. Optical drives? Where we're going, we don't need optical drives. Currently, the Late 2014 Mac mini is the newest model available. While it may look like the 2011 and 2012 machines, Apple made several changes that have made its smallest Mac noticeably worse: The RAM is no longer upgradable. That bottom panel still comes off, but underneath is just a sheet of metal. Even if it was easy to get to, the memory is soldered to the logic board. There is no longer a quad-core model, even as a build-to-order option. It's dual-core all the way. The second 2.5-inch drive bay has been removed. Putting in a second drive just isn't an option anymore. The only good things I can really say about the 2014 models is that Apple was able to bring back the $499 SKU, and that the value of 2011 and 2012 machines is still quite high. Customers who want more flexible machines are willing to spend good money on older machines to have access to things that Apple has taken away. The Future of the Mac mini I have two Mid-2011 Mac minis in active duty. The first sits under my television. It handles file sharing for my Drobo, hosts the family iTunes library and acts as a DVD player, thanks to a USB SuperDrive. The second is a quad-core model at MacStadium, on which I run the streaming software used for Relay FM's live shows. Both machines have SSDs and are stuffed full of RAM. Both run amazingly well; it's hard to tell that they are each six years old. I know that at some point, I won't be able to install the newest version of macOS on them. That's a problem. I shouldn't have to rely on a machine from 2011 to provide critical tasks for my business, but I do. Buying a new Mac mini just isn't worth it for me. Upgrading would mean going back to a dual-core system, and to match the SSD and RAM I have in them would mean dropping $1,399 at the Apple Store. I'd love to see Apple take the Mac mini and breathe new life into it. The design is a holdover from the days of the optical drive; a theoretical future Mac mini could be much smaller. As cool as that could be, what I really want is for the Mac mini to be returned to its former glory, as the cheap-but-super-upgradable Mac it once was. Spending even $700 or $800 on a machine and spreading out the upgrade costs is far preferable to many users than spending twice that all at once. From its humble beginnings as the BYODKM Mac to its role as a server, the Mac mini has been a faithful workhorse for 12 years now. It deserves another chance. Assuming they had a USB keyboard and mouse. PS/2 users had to buy new input devices. ↩︎ History always repeats itself. ↩︎ Again, Apple was seeing what people were doing with these computers. HDMI made using a Mac mini as an input on a television a dream. ↩︎ Tags: Apple history, mac, mac mini Sign Up Unlock MacStories Extras Club MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.

According to a Chinese-language Economic Daily News report cited by DigiTimes, Apple is likely to slash prices of 13-inch Pros without Touch Bar to increase its overall shipments in 2017. Industry sources also claim that these more affordable 13-inch MacBook Pros without Touch Bar will eventually replace the 13-inch MacBook Air in Apple’s notebook lineup. Market watchers think Mac sales will grow 10 percent annually to reach 15 million units in 2017 due to new Mac notebooks. This should be music to the ears of Apple’s notebook suppliers like Quanta Computer, Shin Zu Shing, Auras and Wistron. Demand for the latest MacBook Pros with Touch Bar is still “rather strong,” sources said. KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks Apple will refresh 12-inch MacBooks in early second quarter, adding a new 16-gigabyte RAM option. Production of Kaby Lake-driven Pros should being in early third quarter whilst a new 15-inch MacBook Pro with 32GB memory won’t enter mass production until early in the fourth quarter, said the analyst. I’m a big fan of MacBook Air and will be saddened to see it phased-out. This has been my productivity machine for more than five years now. When I’m not on the go, I’m using it connected to Apple’s 27-inch Thunderbolt Display. Despite my Air having only four gigabytes of RAM, it crunches pretty much everything I throw at its feet without breaking a sweat. The phased-out 11-inch Air even handles 1080p video editing quite comfortably. I’m fully aware that the Air lineup has not received a major refresh for quite some time now and that upgrading my desktop experience to 4K resolution is going to require a 4K-capable machine such as the new MacBook Pro. But until that inevitable moment arrives, I’ll be sticking with my rusty old 13-inch Air.

This is according to the latest research note from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In a note presented to investors, Kuo predicts Apple’s 2017 refresh will focus on internal component updates, notably platform-wide adoption of Intel Kaby Lake processors. He said the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with Kaby Lake processors will start mass production early in the third quarter of 2017. Kuo’s prediction of “the most significantly redesigned” 15-inch MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM. The said laptop will enter mass production early in the fourth quarter of 2017, which starts in September. He also added Apple will be adopting desktop-class RAM in order to get improved performance. This is not the first time Kuo predicted 32GB RAM options for the Macbook Pro. Late last year Kuo stated that 2017’s MacBook Pro models may arrive at cheaper prices and offer 32GB of RAM. The current top of the line Macbooks come with maximum 16GB RAM, a feature that is receiving flak from several Mac users. Apple will need to adopt an emerging memory technology like LPDDR4 or DDR4L in order to increase memory configurations. Beyond a faster processor and memory upgrades, the Macbook Pro 2017 refresh will ship with similar specifications and features as the 2016 model. 12-inch Macbook Refresh In addition, Kuo stated Apple will also update the thin-and-light 12-inch MacBook laptop. The next-gen laptops will be among the first computers to be powered by Kaby Lake processor series. Also, the new 12-inch MacBook will come with options of 16GB of RAM. The two current 12-inch MacBook configurations include 8GB of RAM. The devices also feature older-gen Intel Core m3, m5 and m7 processor series. The 2017 refresh will make the 12-inch MacBooks powerful than the predecessors. Kuo believes the Kaby Lake notebooks will be power efficient and improve Apple’s Macbook sales. He stated that Apple’s Mac growth will return in 2017 after its poor performance in 2016. The company has rectified supply chain bottlenecks, and as such, shipments will be quicker boosting Macbook sales. However, the 13-inch Macbook Pro without Touch Bar is not performing well. Apple will, as such, heavily discount the entry level MacBook Pro model for upcoming year. This will help replace the current MacBook Air line.

However as it turns out, Amazon isn’t the only ones who are interested in making shopping a more hi-tech experience. It would seem that Intel is just as interested as they have announced the Intel Responsive Retail Platform, in which the company is expected to invest as much as $100 million towards creating a smarter retail space. This initiative isn’t so much about a single device, but rather it is creating a common set of sensors, software, and other pieces of hardware that will all work together to help speed up the process of inventory tracking, collection of data on buying habits, personalized shopping experiences, and so on. The idea is that retailers won’t have to seek out separate solutions for all their needs, but instead turn to Intel and their partners for products that can work seamlessly together. An example would be Talley by Simbe Robotics. This is a robotic autonomous shelf auditing and analytics solution for retail. According to Intel, “Tally works in concert with retail associates by arming them with information to ensure the store’s products are always stocked, in the right place and displaying the correct price tag.” It is powered by Intel’s processors and also uses the RealSense technology to help make sense of its surroundings.

That means a role for live motion-capture performance – aka that of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings – with the character of Ariel the sprite rendered as an animated character on stage via a an avatar powered by motion-sensor control. RSC Artistic Director Gregory Doran says he was inspired by the masques of the 1600s to think about the kind of theatre Shakespeare might have created if he were writing today, while Intel says it is creating a new toolbox to empower actors, directors and designers to ‘bring their imagination to life for new audiences’. Alongside the new production, the RSC is running a series of debates to explore the development of the technology used in the show and its possible future applications. London’s National Theatre moved into VR last year with the launch of a new Immersive Storytelling Studio, with the institution commissioning new work created specifically using VR or 360 technologies.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 17, 2017 at 11:00AM On January 3, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released a new family of computer processors, branded seventh-generation Core, aimed at desktop and notebook personal computers. Among the new chips were three chips targeted explicitly at gamers and personal computer enthusiasts: Core i7 7700K, Core i5 7600K, and Core i3 7350K. Image source: Intel.  Although the Core i3 7350K isn't widely available yet, the Core i5 and Core i7 models are. The new Core i7 7700K is off to a strong start among those who build and upgrade their own computers, topping the best-selling processor lists on Amazon.com and Newegg.com.  The lower-end 7600K occupies the second-place spot on Newegg's best-sellers list; it's eighth on Amazon's, but Amazon is currently out of stock of those chips, which is likely artificially depressing its ranking on Amazon's list right now (it's updated hourly). What does this mean for Intel? Let's take a closer look. Business as usual One thing that has helped Intel combat declining industrywide personal computer sales has been aggressive segmentation actions designed to convince consumers to buy higher up in its product stack. This means even in a market in which people are buying fewer personal computers than they did last year, they're buying computers packed with more expensive processors than they did before. This phenomenon hasn't always been enough to completely offset the unit declines, though. In 2015, for example, Intel saw notebook processor shipments plunge 9%, but average selling prices grew just 2%. Desktop processor shipments dropped by 16% in 2015 -- a huge decline -- but average selling prices were up 6%, partially offsetting that decline.  Year to date, Intel is seeing a similar phenomenon in a stronger unit environment: Notebook platform volumes have dropped 1% as average selling prices rose 2% (so in that time, notebook chip revenue for Intel is actually up); desktop platform volumes declined by 5%, partially offset by a 2% increase in average selling prices. The fact that the $350 7700K seems to be off to a better start than the $250, less powerful 7600K suggests that demand -- at least among those individuals who build and upgrade their own computers -- continues to shift to higher-end chips. There is a limit to this mix-up among enthusiasts, though Interestingly, although the 7700K is at the top of the best-seller list, with the 7600K right behind it (at least on Newegg.com) -- suggesting a consumer affinity for higher-end chips -- Intel's high-end desktop chips don't seem to be enjoying anywhere near that level of success. For example, the Core i7 6800K -- Intel's cheapest six-core desktop processor at $424 -- is way down on Newegg's best-seller list, at position 20. The higher-end six-core, as well as the eight- and ten-core Intel desktop processors (which sell for about $1,100 and $1,650, respectively) are much further down the list. Part of the problem for Intel, here (aside from the fact that these chips are simply pricier), is that these higher-core-count chips require more expensive motherboards, and memory modules need to be bought in packs of four, rather than packs of two for the mainstream 7700K and 7600K chips. The high-core-count Intel chips also utilize previous-generation processor architectures and run at slower clock frequencies out of the box, meaning per-core performance on these higher-core-count chips is lower than on the lower-core-count chips. In other words, for applications that can't take advantage of lots of cores (like most consumer applications), the cheaper 7700K and 7600K chips are simply going to be better solutions -- both in absolute terms (for those workloads) and in terms of performance per dollar. It would be interesting to see what impact, if any, Intel would see on its desktop chip product mix, particularly when it comes to sales of chips directly to consumers (not through personal computer sales, which represent the bulk of chip sales), if it were more aggressive in driving up the per-core performance of its high-core-count chips.

Credit: Apple More like this Why did Apple take the ‘ding’ out of the universe? 10 reasons to love the USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro MacBook Pro USB-C move is a new gold rush Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell We’ve been waiting a long, long time for new Apple pro desktops, but it’s beginning to look very like Apple’s completely focusing on the MacBook Pro at the high end, with iMac as a consumer desktop and MacBook at the low end. Mobile Mac, desktop class I guess that is one way of looking at Apple analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities claim that Apple plans to increase the max memory configuration in MacBook Pro models to 32GB in the latter half of the year. That’s the kind of memory you’d expect in order to make Apple’s high-end notebooks even more effective professional tools. Particularly when combined with Kuo’s prediction that Apple will put quad core Intel Kaby Lake chips inside the high end MacBook Pro. While delayed, Intel’s latest 14-nanometer chips have a few advantages that appear to dovetail well with what Apple thinks we want: Fully integrated support for USB-C Generation 2, (G2 USB 3.1 and Thunderbolt 3 support) Native HDCP 2.2 support 4K video support. Big ding dongle deal Apple attracted lots of criticism for its wholesale embrace of USB-C in the latest MacBook Pros, but its decision to adopt Kaby Lake with its integrated support for the standard confirms what a good move this was. “We’re absolutely more sure than ever that we’ve done the right thing,” Apple’s VP marketing, Phil Schiller said when discussing the move to USB-C. It seems reasonable to anticipate the standard will be introduced across all future Macs – and now is a good time to purchase USB-USB-C hubs to help your eventual migration to Macs that use it, as Apple is selling these at generous discounts to boost adoption. The move has kick-started this section of the industry. Kuo also thinks Apple will update the 12-inch MacBook with Kaby Lake processors and a 16GB of RAM option. What’s really interesting here was noted by Apple Insider: “In order to achieve high memory allotments and keep unplugged battery life performance on par with existing MacBook Pro models, Apple will need to move to an emerging memory technology like LPDDR4 or DDR4L,” they wrote. This means high-end memory, high end RAM and high end Kaby Lake Macs. These will be desktop class machines. Bell chimes for MacBook Air The analyst has another prediction that may be of interest – that Apple will discount the 13-inch MacBook Pro model that lacks a Touch Bar in order to gradually replace the MacBook Air in its line up. Demand for the Touch Bar MacBook Air remains strong, Kuo said. Manufacturing capacity has been raised by 50 percent in order to keep up with demand, he explained. It is interesting that despite claims Mac sales are slack, when compared to the industry Apple continues to holds its own. “Compared to the industry 2011-16, you can't even say Mac is on a downward trend - yet,” points out long time Apple stock watcher, AAPL Tree. Et tu, Mac Pro? What we don’t know yet is if Apple’s vision for its platform extends to the Mac Pro. After all, if it can create incredibly powerful MacBook Pro machines that work in tandem with a highly effective peripherals I/O like USB-C, then is there any need for them? Most of the expandability you expect from a desktop can now be matched by USB-C devices connected to a notebook. Three years since the Mac Pro was replaced, I’m certain many Mac users want to find out the truth behind Apple’s promise that “great desktops are coming”. Will these be Mac Pros, iMacs? Is the MacBook Pro the future of Apple’s high end Mac market? For the reasons above I think it could be, but I also think Mac users deserve to know. Google+?

Analog engineers need to feed high-end CPUs hundreds of amperes without starting fires. The Intel CPU processor has always been a challenge because it relies on as many as eight multi-phase switching regulators (aka DC-DC converters) per CPU, each generating up to 25 watts per chip. They are typically clocked at 250 kHz, and they generate quite a bit of heat. DC-DC converters are pulse generators whose outputs are filtered and summed to effect currents of hundreds of amps at fixed voltages. Designers and users believe that higher switching frequencies will make incremental increases in energy-transfer efficiency and dramatic reductions in the size of ancillary components such as inductors and capacitors. Thus far, 10MHz has been the upper for commercial pulse-width modulators capable of putting out 40A from a thimble-sized package. In ISSCC session 26 on processor power management, Intel will describe a module with an-order-of-magnitude higher clock rate. It is a fully integrated, digitally controlled buck voltage regulator with on-die inductors with a planar magnetic core on a 14nm CMOS substrate. Technology-circuit co-optimization enables ultra-thin packages, the Intel paper reports. The module obtains a power density of 1A/mm2 and an efficiency of 84% at a switching frequency of 100MHz using a digital pulse-width modulation scheme with an 8ps resolution. Including inductors, the modulators footprint is only 0.42mm2. The analogy I frequently use to describe DC-DC is to imagine a bulldozer moving a mountain of dirt across a road. Each shovel-full may take several minutes to transfer, and a significant amount of dirt (a measure of inefficiency) is left behind. Now, imagine a shovel the size of a teaspoon, but with an ability to move a million scoops of dirt per second. An 100-MHz oscillator can be quite unstable, and only a fistful of companies are now claiming that kind of energy transfer rate even though faster switch rates enable significant increases in power densities. Engineers face trade offs in increasing power density at the expense of energy transfer efficiency and vice versa. The historical trend is shown in the chart below. We are closing in on a 1-watt per mm2 power density and efficiencies of 82% in the state of the art for DC-DC converters, according to ISSCC organizers. DC-DC converter efficiency over time with the latest results in red. (Image: ISSCC) Because they are a must-have for practically all electronic systems, power management ICs are the largest and fastest growing segment of the general-purpose analog market, accounting for almost $12 billion in revenues. Thus power management is arguably the most significant analog skill set today. ISSCC also will showcase analog skills in signal amplification and conditioning. General-purpose amplifiers are having a renaissance with the proliferation of devices for the Internet of Things where they a called upon to capture and elevate a low-level sensor signal to something that can manipulated by a microcontroller. Amplifier circuits account for roughly $3.5-$4 billion in annual semiconductor revenues. Power transistors are also deserve mention. They are current delivery mechanisms used in conjunction with low-frequency power amplifiers like audio or motor drive circuits or as current switches in DC-DC converters such as voltage regulators with switch-mode outputs. The power transistor market is about $10 billion, half of it in MOSFET switches. The most attention-getting part of the power transistor market are the Gallium Nitride (GaN) switches which promise an order of magnitude improvements in switching speed. Thats a boon to switching power supplies with higher currents and energy-transfer efficiencies that are wrestling with gate driver topologies, yet another topic in analog sessions at the event. Stephan Ohr is a former director for analog research at Gartner and former editor-in-chief of Planet Analog.

A white paper co-authored by General Electric (GE) and Intel estimates that digital efficiency applications have the potential to help industry save $81bn per year in fuel costs. The research, details of which were unveiled at World Future Energy Summit (WFES) 2017 in Abu Dhabi, also claims that industrial internet programmes could close the global carbon gap by almost 30% – a reduction of 823Mt of carbon emissions per year, equivalent to removing 174 million cars from the roads. Tools such as embedded sensors, data analytics, and connected platforms are helping companies to boost productivity and reduce environmental emissions, according to the white paper’s authors. Deb Frodl, global executive director of GE Ecomagination, said: “We are working closely with our partners in the region, such as Masdar, Saudi Aramco, and RasGas, among others – some of the first adopters of digital solutions – to support regional economies in achieving their energy and economic diversification goals. “This is part of a larger movement that includes both large companies and start-ups from across the industrial and tech sectors, working together on innovation and implementation to realise the dramatic economic and environmental potential of digital efficiency.” The report identified five segments that stand to benefit from the economic and environmental impact of digitisation: power, lighting, aviation, rail, and ground transportation. The researchers estimate that the power sector could achieve $14bn in cost savings annually, in addition to a potential reduction of 495Mt per year in carbon. Annual savings related to lighting could hit $30bn, reducing carbon emissions by 132Mt per year. The aviation industry could save $14bn per year, and achieve an annual carbon reduction of 45Mt. The rail sector could save $3bn per year, and reduce carbon output by 19Mt. Ground transportation, meanwhile, could achieve annual cost savings of $20bn, and reduce carbon emissions by 132Mt per year, according to the white paper. GE has been working with a number of strategic partners in the Middle East in a bid to use industrial internet applications to achieve enhanced productivity, efficiency, and asset optimisation. Collaborators include, but are not limited to, RasGas, Masdar, Dubai’s Museum of the Future, Saudi Aramco, and Saudi Electricity Company. The report draws on the experience of GE’s Ecomagination business strategy to deploy sustainable strategies that provide economic and environmental outcomes, according to GE. WFES 2017 is currently taking place at Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Center (ADNEC) in the UAE.

A touchscreen with low processing latency, truly invisible touch sensing, and excellent noise rejection isn’t really what you’ll see on billboards, but if these things aren’t done properly just about anyone will notice the results. Similarly, if a fingerprint scanner has high processing latency and doesn’t have features like learning from a partial match and noise rejection, it’ll be very noticeable if you try a device that has all of these features. Probably the best example of this was the difference in TouchID quality from the iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. At CES they had a number of new things to show off. The first was a 30 dollar low profile USB fingerprint scanner, which was designed to retrofit laptops and similar devices without a fingerprint scanner in order to enable the use of Windows Hello. I went ahead and tried it and it works flawlessly from what I can see. Synaptics is also working on integrating a fingerprint scanner into trackpads and power buttons to enable more seamless designs instead of having a random sensor on the palmrest or somewhere similarly obvious. We also saw their FS4400 and FS4500 fingerprint scanners, which have entered mass production. These sensors enable fingerprint scanning under the glass bezel of a smartphone. There were also prototypes of fingerprint scanners on smart watches, although these prototypes are at an early stage and are more a proof of concept than anything else. On the automotive side, Synaptics also showed off a neat prototype that enabled force sensing with only four force sensors at the corners of the display. Judging by the state of the prototype this is only for engineering samples at this point, but may have interesting applications. On the DDIC side of things, Synaptics has been working on new solutions for things like large touchscreens. Using technology borrowed from their smartphone designs, they have been able to reduce the number of components and board area needed to enable large touchscreens in applications like mall kiosks. On the mobile side of things, the ClearView R63353 is a DDIC on glass that reduces the amount of bezel that it takes compared to previous display drivers and is currently available for sampling. The Synaptics engineers on site to discuss the issue of bezels did mention that it would be possible to drive down the amount of bezel used by moving to a chip on flex arrangement. However, I suspect that there are other engineering considerations at play as most devices, even those with thin bezels, continue to use a CoG packaging for the DDIC. In addition to smaller DDICs, Synaptics has also been working on enabling better OLED displays through new features like smoother dimming and software tools to emulate various subpixel arrangements to determine the best possible subpixel design given design rules. PenTile is mostly here to stay for OLED, but choosing something other than diamond subpixel arrangements can significantly reduce the amount of color shifting when changing viewing angles. Overall, while Synaptics doesn’t necessarily have the flashiest technologies, the kinds of things that they’re working on remain critical to the end user experience and it’s impressive to see that they continue to iterate and improve upon their products to enable a better user experience.

Reply JoshHo - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Samsung currently uses PWM because voltage-controlled brightness causes dramatic hue shifts. The Nexus 6 was an example of this. Reply Trixanity - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Do you think they can get around that with future displays? Reviews I've seen lists the Pixel as using PWM at 23% brightness and below and the OnePlus 3T at 10% and below, so judging from that it does seem like it is possible to some degree to eliminate it. Also, I think it would be great if you added PWM measurements to all your display tests.

Apple will be releasing the updated Macbooks with seventh generation of Intel Kaby Lake processors, as revealed by the latest research note from Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at KGI Securities. The analyst states that the company might launch a new 15-inch MacBook Pro model with a whopping 32GB of RAM. He said in a research note that the new MacBook Pro will be "the most significantly redesigned product this year" and will enter production in the early fourth quarter. The model will also feature the same Touch Bar as we have seen in the 2016 version of the MacBook Pro. Kuo said that the Cupertino-based company will also update 12-inch MacBook models with the latest processor, which will enter in mass production in the early second quarter. The analyst predicts that a 16GB memory option will also be added to the device. Furthermore, the company will also update the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with the same processor and the models will enter the mass production in the early third quarter, though the research note did not reveal any information about the RAM. To recall, Apple introduced the new MacBook Pro 2016 in October 2016, which is touted as the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever. The regular 13 inch MacBook Pro comes with 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. The one with the Touch Bar and Touch ID comes with 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage and lastly, the 15 inch MacBook Pro comes with 2.6 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.5 GHz, 16GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. For graphics, Apple has opted for Radeon Pro discrete graphics in the 15-inch model and for the 13-inch model, you get Intel Iris Graphics that offers two times faster performance than before. For software, Apple has given the new MacOS Sierra which comes with new features like Siri integration, Universal Clipboard, Apple Pay on the web and Photos. For connectivity, there are a 3.5mm audio jack and two Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type-C) ports on the 13-inch variant and four Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type-C) ports on the 15-inch variant.

Computers by Daniel Van Boom January 17, 2017 2:57 AM PST @dvanboom Up Next This crazy camera could be a boon to VR filmmakers MacBooks may grow more powerful this year According to an analyst known for accurate predictions, Apple will refresh its MacBook line with more processing power and more RAM. by Iyaz Akhtar 1:30 Close Drag Apple's newly refreshed laptop line may be a hit in stores, but many are still concerned that the MacBook Pros aren't quite "pro" enough. The electronics giant may assuage some of those concerns later this year, predicts KGI Securities analyst and Apple Nostradamus Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo, who last year correctly anticipated that Apple would overhaul the MacBook Pro line to include a touchscreen in place of function keys, said the company will release a 15-inch MacBook equipped with 32GB of RAM in the fourth quarter, MacRumors reported Monday. This appears to be separate to a refreshment for 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros, which he said will start offering Intel's new Kaby Lake processors in the third quarter. In the second quarter, Kuo predicts, Apple will update its 12-inch MacBook line with the new processors, as well as a 16GB RAM option. (They currently offer 8GB.) Related stories Why Apple's weird headphones are better than you think Apple's iPhone turns 10. Where does it go from here? Tim Cook's pay slips after Apple's 2016 dip The new processors could potentially address one criticism some had of the new MacBook Pros: their not-much-improved battery life. The 32GB RAM MacBook, which Kuo said will be the "most significantly redesigned product this year," is likely geared toward art professionals, who need RAM for video, audio and photo editing. While Apple relies heavily on its iPhones for its revenue, Apple's computers are the heart and origin of the company. Apple's reputation is especially renowned among creative professionals, who are willing to pay the steep price for Macs and MacBooks but also expect Apple to keep up with the competition on the basics like battery life. Kuo has an impressive record when it comes to Apple predictions. Other than his 2016 MacBook Pro redesign, his correct predictions have included the Apple Watch 2 and its onboard GPS, as well as the 2016 release of a 4-inch iPhone, which became the SE.

According to a report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kup Apple is getting ready to release 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros, with Intel’s brand new Kaby Lake processors. As written by MacRumours, the report goes on to say that production fo both laptops will start in the early third waurter around July. If you’re waiting for a price drop, it looks like you may be in luck. Kuo predicts the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro – the one without the TouchBar – should be discounted this year, partly to bring it in line with the 13-inch MacBook Air it’ll eventually replace.   For everything else you need to know about the new MacBook Pro, keep reading. 1. The new MacBook Pro has a stunning Touch Bar The Touch Bar is by far the most interesting feature on the new MacBook Pro, and it’s also one of the things we were pretty certain about before it was launched. Essentially, Apple has removed the function keys, replacing them with a reactive, OLED screen that changes depending on what you’re doing. There were some pretty convincing demos of the hardware last night, and our hands-on also suggests it’s more than a gimmick. 2. The new MacBook Pro is up to 2.3x faster than the last model Apple has squeezed a quad-core i7 chip into the new MacBook Pro along with 16GB of LPDDR3 onboard memory. That means that the new MacBook Pro is up to 2.3 times faster than its predecessor. Graphics-card wise, the 15in version also uses a Radeon Pro 450 or 455 with 2GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching. Battery life is always an important factor, and the new MacBook Pro offers pretty impressive performance here, too. Both the 13in model will give you around ten hours of use before needing a charge.  3. Apple has removed three familiar features From the outside, one of those is obvious. For years, a glowing Apple logo has been a hallmark of every MacBook, but it’s gone on the MacBook Pro. The new 12in MacBook is the only other laptop in Apple’s range without a glowing logo, so its removal could have something to do with the introduction of new screen technology. Second, and somewhat less obviously, Apple has also done away with the startup chime on the new MacBook Pro – and that’s because it boots up as soon as it’s opened. Lastly, the MagSafe charging connector is gone, although that also disappeared on last year's 12in MacBook.  4. The new MacBook Pro has Touch ID As expected, the new MacBook Pro comes with Touch ID, so you can use your fingerprint to make purchases, open encrypted files and more. The Touch ID module is on the right-hand side of the new Touch Bar, and it’s controlled by a brand-new “T1” chip. 5. The are NO normal USB ports Both MacBook Pros feature no USB ports, but do come with four Thunderbolt or USB Type C ports each. That means any of those points can be your charging socket, and you'll still have room for another three devices. They're also capable of 10GB/sec transfer speeds. Of course, you're going to have to buy at least three dongles to get the most out of them... 6. There are THREE new MacBooks Apple is also unveiling another 13in MacBook Pro without all the new-fangled features of the two flagship models. As you’d expect, it’s slightly less powerful and customisable than the other two models, but it does cost a bit less, too. It features actual physical function keys, and it will have two fewer Thunderbolt ports. All models are available in either Space Grey or Silver. 7. The new MacBook Pro costs A LOT more money See related  The iPhone 7 needs a new cable to connect to the new MacBook Pro — and that's not cool iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Which smartphone should you buy in 2016? In addition to a total removal of regular USB ports, the main issue with the new MacBook Pro is its astonishing price. The new MacBook Pro starts at £1,449, but you have to pay at least £1,749 to get four USB Type-C ports and the new Touch Bar, too. As for the 15in version? That starts at an eye-watering £2,349.  8. The new MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter Apple has shrunk the size of both the 13in and the 15in MacBook Pros. The new 13in laptop is 14.6mm thick, 23% smaller, and weighs just 3.02 pounds – half a pound less than the outgoing version. The 15in MacBook Pro is 20% smaller, and only 15.5mm in width. It also weighs 4.02 pounds, just one more than the 13in MacBook Pro. 9. And that’s partly because of a new keyboard The new MacBook Pro’s thinness owes a lot to its brand-new keyboard. Apple has introduced a double-hinged, butterfly-style keyboard to the new MacBook Pro, and it’s a development of the one we’ve seen on the 12in MacBook. As a result, the new keyboard has considerably less key travel than before, and that’s something you’ll probably have to get used to. At least the already fantastic trackpad is now twice as large as before.  10. The new display is LUSH Apple has improved the new 15in MacBook Pro’s Retina display so it’s even better than before. This time around, the screen is 67% brighter and has a 67% better contrast ratio than the previous version. Apple says the new panel can display 25% more colours too, so pictures will look more vibrant and natural. 11. Storage isn’t bad either All the new MacBook Pro’s come with an SSD of at least 256GB in size, but if you’re willing to pay that can extend to extend to 1TB on the 13in MacBook Pro and 2TB on the 15in model. Storage is up to 50% faster, too.

Comments Submitted by John Hind on Wed, 2016-05-25 08:31. I'd really like to see what could be achieved by fitting a touch-screen in place of the touch-pad. I would then strip the keyboard right back to just QWERTY, replacing all the rarely-used keys, even the number keys, with context-specific and customisable virtual keys on the edge of the touch-pad.

As a current user of the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and previous user of most past models of the MBP - I still have a pre-unibody MBP3,1 running - the above rumors don't excite me much, unless the form factor in weight and battery-life becomes one of the current MBA or better, and there is a true touch screen with 2-in-1 convertibility; in short, make me a surface book but better so I don't have to buy an ipad pro. Anything less is unacceptable for a major redesign. Submitted by Dave Knight on Mon, 2016-06-13 12:59. I remain very skeptical of this. Lenovo replaced the function keys with a touch-sensitive bar on their 2014 X1 Carbon. It was a flop, the proper function keys were missed by many professional users, and Lenovo backed down and put the proper function keys back for the 2015 model. I can understand the touch-strip on a less "pro" oriented model, but Apple does also risk alienating some of it's more high-end users with this rather gimmicky feature.

Apple won't put OLED screens on a high end device until the blue diode fading / failure problem is resolved. They just don't last long enough. Samsung may not care about screen quality after the first month (within the review life of the device), but Apple do. Not least because many of the devices have 3 year warranty.

I think it's unlikely to lose the headphone jack as there is no benefit to losing it and also it's not just a headphone jack: it's also the optical audio port. Maybe it will have a multi function strip but does seem gimmicky rather than adding something fundamentally beneficial. Lastly - I hate the butterfly keyboards!

Ah, but the problem with Lenovo's offer was it didn't have a cool little apple icon on it. If Apple's done it then it must be right. I'd better start blocking off the USB ports on my computer. Submitted by DigDug on Mon, 2016-10-31 11:41. Apple fail to innovate again! 'stunning touch bar' is at least a 20 year old idea recycled. overpriced, over hyped and over here tech that appeals to those that like there kit dumbed down Submitted by Baz Wrench on Mon, 2016-10-31 19:58. It would appeal to you then with your spelling and grammar? ;-) Submitted by Trevor Cake on Mon, 2016-10-31 20:04. So you need one hand free when you use your computer? Naughty. Submitted by JohnW on Mon, 2016-10-31 21:57. Another missing iconic, and practical, feature is the MagSafe power connector. Submitted by Frank on Wed, 2016-11-02 19:41. I do believe in the touch bar. Not in the hardware itself, but in Apple's ability to create functionality for such interfaces. The first time I saw the functionality of the trackpad, I thought I would never use more than two fingers to use it. It took a week to use every little functionality of the trackpad and I can't do without it anymore. I also believe that in a few years every peripheral has a USB-C connector (I was there when we had to throw away all serial devices because Apple introduced USB). But why on earth did they remove the magsafe connector? Stupid decision Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 11:43. "A new report suggests Apple is already planning to update its new laptop" At any point in time, Apple is working on the next minor refresh. The major update. And the next generation product product. And maybe the one after that. Saying that Apple is already planning an update is like saying there is a car behind you on the motorway. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 11:44. Far more likely a spoiler, probably sponsored by a competitor. If Apple has a new version coming, why buy this one. Wait. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 11:52. It's got the same number of "Delete" keys as most other notebooks. i.e. it's got the Back key that Apple labels with a back arrow and others label with the word "Delete", but performs exactly the same function in either case. i.e. to delete the character before the cursor. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 12:00. Have you spent time using it? Probably not if you describe yourself as just skeptical. I've been a software "pro" for 40 year. I have this device and use it every day. And the touch bar is brilliant. As is having 4 flexible ports each capable of 40 Gbits/sec. This machine will happily drive 8 (yes, eight) 1920x1200 monitors with 4 split cables. And no, I don't use dongles. I just have the correct cables. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 12:03. The problem with Lenovo's offer is that Microsoft hadn't built support for the touch bar into the keyboard handling, and Lenovo could only hack it in themselves, just so far. Apple control OSX as well has the hardware and so they have been able to fully integrate the facility from day one. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 12:04. Tells you how many readers Alpha believe are interested in the Microsoft Surface Book. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2017-01-17 12:07. For 45 years, I've hated every keyboard that isn't the one that I'm currently most used to. It took me a few days to get used to this one. So now it's great. Less subjectively, this is the fastest keyboard I've ever used. Submitted by RedHarry on Tue, 2017-01-17 12:16. I have never seen another make that only has a Backspace Key, all have Backspace & Delete. Thanks for the Backspace lesson but Delete, delete's character on and after - totally different! Only Macbooks have this weird phenomenon where you need to hold down Fn+Backspace to achieve the same very common, basic functionality. I find this very bizarre as Mac's are supposed to be so user friendly, they're ok IMO, nothing special and massively overpriced! But, each to his own Submitted by Bloomer on Tue, 2017-01-17 13:45. I can believe it - having tried the new one in the shop, the keyboard was better than the previous version...

According to popular analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities in Taiwan, Apple will be bringing new upgrades to the MacBook lineup this year. Since the new Intel Kaby Lake processors are official, this year could see Apple updating the MacBooks with the new chipset along with an option for 32GB of RAM on the 15-inch model. A new 12-inch MacBook is expected to enter production in Q2 of 2017 while the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros will begin production Q3 of 2017. There is also the mention of a new 15-inch MacBook with 32GB of RAM which will enter production in Q4. This model will most likely be aimed at high-end users. Apple announced a refreshed line of the MacBook a couple of months back with Intel’s Skylake processor, so chances of an upgrade to the new processors is quite obvious. While there is limited detail, it is safe to assume that Apple will retain the design and most of the other features. The new MacBooks have been criticised for having poor battery life which should probably by addressed in the new upgrades.

ByCorinne Reichert | January 17, 2017 -- 04:59 GMT (20:59 PST) | Topic: Networking Networking giants Ericsson and Cisco have announced working together on virtualising the core network of Vodafone Australia in an effort to replace its fixed functionality systems with virtualised systems. Under the project, which marks the first "major collaboration" on telecommunications cloud infrastructure between Cisco and Ericsson, Ericsson will build the infrastructure as well as take responsibility for end-to-end operations. Latest Australian news Turnbull pushes TPP as Japan calls it 'meaningless' without the US Optus boosts coverage across Australia with small cells ​Cyber experts to brief Australian political leaders CPSU: Centrelink too under-resourced to handle debt recovery fiasco Labor 'very concerned' about telco data retention use in civil cases The network architecture solution makes use of Ericsson's Hyperscale Datacenter System and such software as Ericsson Cloud Execution Environment, Ericsson Cloud Manager, and Cloud SDN controller. Cisco is contributing its WAN Automation Engine; IP Network VNFs including IOS XR 9000v and Cloud Services Router 1000v; virtualised and physical security technologies including its Adaptive Security Appliance and Cisco Firepower security gateway; and security support services for the Vodafone project. Vodafone Australia CTO Kevin Millroy, who was appointed to the role last month, said Cisco and Ericsson were chosen because they already provide the telco's core network and routing functions. By simplifying its infrastructure and core network -- which earlier on Tuesday suffered a three-hour voice outage -- Vodafone said it will decrease operating expenditure and capital expenditure, and improve both customer experience and the "agility" of its network. "This transformation allows us to introduce new applications to drive innovation and improve customer services and user experience," Millroy added. "The new infrastructure opens the door to new business models and markets, such as Internet of Things, for Vodafone." Intel last year emphasised how virtualised networks within telecommunications providers will also lead to consumers paying less for more data. "The carriers are getting tremendous pressure to continue to build out that infrastructure to better support higher and higher data rates, [and] greater and greater demands," Diane Bryant, Intel executive vice president and general manager of its Data Center Group, told ZDNet in June. "The network today is very expensive; demands far exceed their ability to support it in a cost-effective way, so they have got to start over and create a network infrastructure that is virtualised and can flux." Increasing network capacity is faster under a virtualised network, Bryant added, because providers no longer need to physically build out a series of fixed function devices, whereas in a virtualised cloud environment, companies can procure more capacity instantly. "Once they go to a virtualised environment, the vision is for customer services on demand," she said. Virtualisation is also a step towards network slicing, Ericsson said, which is used with 5G for more personalisation across networks. Using the slicing technology, a physical network can be segmented into several virtual mobile networks. Ericsson demonstrated 5G network slicing technology in partnership with South Korean telecommunications giant SK Telecom in October 2015, performing the demonstration at its R&D centre. Both Vodafone and Ericsson have been trialling 5G network technology in Australia: Ericsson and Telstra attained download speeds of 18-22Gbps during their 5G trial in September, Vodafone and Nokia attained speeds of 5Gbps in October, and Australia's third mobile provider Optus and Huawei saw speeds of 35Gbps in their 5G test in November. Vodafone also announced at the end of last year that it is working with Nokia to create a proof of concept to combine mobile edge computing, 4G networks, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, network function virtualisation (NFV), and video analytics to improve public safety. The companies said they would trial the technology in 2017, using the Nokia Mobile Edge Computing platform to track the movements and numbers of people in public safety applications through real-time data processing and video analytics from censors including CCTV footage. Telstra is similarly "co-innovating" with Cisco on NFV and software-defined networking (SDN) functionalities. "SDN and NFV technologies are redefining the user experience on the network," said Philip Jones, Telstra executive director of Global Products and Solutions, when unveiling a series of SDN and NFV products with Cisco last March. "By allowing us to overcome the constraints of traditional network infrastructure, the software-driven customer experiences dramatically increases our agility by enabling us to quickly create new solutions, and puts the control of those solutions into the hands of our customers." In October, Telstra additionally announced a partnership with HP, F5 Networks, and Alcatel-Lucent startup Nuage Networks to design a proof of concept for a multi-vendor NFV solution, certified by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. Under the collaboration project, HP's Helion CloudSystem framework was paired with F5 Networks' virtualised network functions, as well as Nuage Networks' virtual services platform. Telstra renewed a deal at the end of 2014 to use Ericsson optical network equipment and services to build out its SDN and NFV offerings.

ByJake Smith for iGeneration | January 17, 2017 -- 00:16 GMT (16:16 PST) | Topic: Hardware CNET/CBS Interactive Apple plans to release a new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Intel's next-generation Kaby Lake processor and "desktop class" RAM, later this year, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via MacRumors). survey Macs to replace PCs in enterprise at "unprecedented rate" Is Apple on the upswing in the enterprise? Some IT professionals think so based on a recent survey, saying Macs are safer and boost productivity while also cutting down on support costs. Read More Kuo, an often-correct analyst, said in a research note the 15-inch MacBook Pro will be "the most significantly redesigned product this year." It's said to feature 32GB of RAM and enter production in early fourth quarter. The update is likely to feature the same Touch Bar that was introduced on the 2016 version of the MacBook Pro. A 12-inch MacBook is said to enter production in the second quarter, according to the analyst. It will be upgradable to 16GB of RAM from the entry level 8GB, and carry the same aesthetics as the 2015 version. Kuo added that new entry-level 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros will enter production in early third quarter with Kaby Lake processors. Intel unveiled the new processors at CES 2017 in January, and are believed to make the laptops more power efficient. There's no word on rumored updates to the iMac line that were pegged for the first half of 2017. It's believed Apple will also unveil an external 5k display, which is rumored to have an integrated GPU.

Details from the note were published earlier by MacRumors. According to Kuo, a new 12-inch MacBook will begin production in the second quarter of this year, new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros will begin production in the early third-quarter, and a new 15-inch MacBook will begin mass production in the final quarter of the year, featuring 32 gigabytes of memory and aimed at high-end users. It’s unclear whether this last machine will fall into the “Pro” lineup or have simply the “MacBook” nomenclature. Not surprisingly, Kuo says that all new laptops are predicted to run on Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, the latest revamp in Intel’s Core family of chips. The newest MacBook Pros, released last fall, run on Intel’s 2015 Skylake processors. Of course, there are always plenty of rumors swirling around upcoming Apple products, so we take these notes with a grain of salt. But Kuo has been one of the more reliable sources out there, making accurate predictions that range from specific iPhone features to predicting the high price of a high-end Apple Watch to Apple’s whole product roadmap for the year.

They had also hinted about some updates to the ZBOX lineup, with some details about the ZBOX CI549 nano, a vPro-enabled passively cooled UCFF (ultra-compact form factor) PC with Thunderbolt 3 support. However, at their suite, we found that many of their existing ZBOX models will be getting a Kaby Lake update. Since Kaby Lake is a minor update in terms of features to Skylake, the Zotac really doesn't have much to work with compared to the Skylake models. Despite that, Zotac has introduced some new features into the ZBOX series - including vPro and Thunderbolt 3 support - that are not present in the Skylake versions. Gallery: Zotac @ CES 2017 - Suite Visit - mini-PC Segment Zotac markets their mini-PCs in multiple market segments - the E-series for gaming, the C-series for users interested in passively cooled systems, the M-series for certain PCs with active cooling in multiple form factors, the VR-series for virtual reality use-cases, the P-series for pocket-sized computers, and so on. The Kaby Lake updates are coming to the C-series, M-series, and E-series. While the C-series units come with the nano tag (with a 5in x 5in x 1.78in form-factor), the M-series come in either the regular ZBOX size (7.4in x 7.4in x 1.78in) or the nano size. The three tables below summarize the specifications of the Kaby Lake mini-PCs announced by Zotac at CES 2017. Zotac ZBOX nano C- & M-Series with Kaby Lake - Specifications Aspect CI527 nano MI527 nano CI547 nano MI547 nano CI549 nano MI549 nano Processor Intel Core i3-7100U Intel Core i5-7200U Intel Core i5-7300U Memory 2x DDR4 SO-DIMM (Up to 32 GB / 2133 MHz) Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Disk Drives 1x 2.5" SATA III Networking (Wireless) Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 (2x2 802.11ac - 867 Mbps) Networking (Wired) 2x Realtek RTL8111G PCIe Gigabit Ethernet Adapters 1x Intel I-219V PCIe Gigabit Ethernet Adapter 1x Reaktek RTL8111G PCIe Gigabit Ethernet Adapter Audio 3.5mm Headphone and Microphone Jacks (Realtek ALC892-GR) Capable of 5.1/7.1 digital output with HD audio bitstreaming (HDMI) Display 1x HDMI 2.0 / HDCP 2.2 (3840x2160 @ 60Hz) 1x DP 1.2 (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz) 1x HDMI 2.0 / HDCP 2.2 (3840x2160 @ 60Hz) 1x DP 1.2 (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz) (muxed with Thunderbolt 3 Type-C) Miscellaneous I/O 2x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C 5x USB 3.0 Type-A 1x SDXC Slot 2x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C 4x USB 3.0 Type-A 1x Thunderbolt 3 Type-C 1x SDXC Slot Cooling CI Series - Fanless / Passively Cooled MI Series - Air Cooling / Single Fan Dimensions CI Series - 5.76in x 4.98in x 2.38in MI Series - 5.03in x 4.98in x 2.00in The most interesting one in the above table is obviously the Zotac ZBOX CI549 nano / MI549 nano. From the perspective of a home consumer, the most important update when compared with the Skylake-U C Series models is the availability of a Thunderbolt 3 port. Thunderbolt 3 brings a host of exciting expansion possibilities. In addition, Zotac seems to have retained the two USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C from the ASMedia ASM1142 controller. The other important aspect of the ZBOX CI549 nano and the MI549 nano is that the Core i5-7300U is a vPro SKU, making it more suitable for use in business environments. Intel's UNITE technology is also supported for secure workplace conferencing. AMT is also available for IT administrators to remotely repair and maintain the systems. The vPro designation makes it necessary for one of the two LAN ports to be an Intel-branded one. The other mini-PCs being updated with Kaby Lake in the above table all use two Realtek adapters.

Using a desktop PCH allows Zotac to include Thunderbolt 3 as well as a rich set of I/Os compared to the others launched at CES. Gallery: Zotac ZBOX MI526 Gallery: Zotac ZBOX MI548 Gallery: Zotac ZBOX MI572 In the E-series, Zotac has only one updated SKU - the EN1070K, a Kaby Lake version of the EN1070. We would have liked them to move the MAGNUS EN1080 to Kaby Lake, given the pin compatibility between Skylake and Kaby Lake, and the fact that the PCH used for the Skylake board could work with Kaby Lake too.

It is great to see dual LAN ports spread to more models, though we would prefer Intel adapters to the Realtek ones that are currently in the units. Zotac must also be appreciated for adding the LSPCon to the BOM to enable HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 capabilities. The Thunderbolt 3 feature, as well as the vPro capabilities, will definitely expand the target market for these systems. That said, some of the shortcomings such as the thermal design of the C-series (which is the same as that of the Skylake C-series) and the placement of the USB ports in the chassis (that we pointed out in our review of the Zotac ZBOX CI523 nano) don't seem to have been addressed. Hopefully, Zotac can tweak a few things before the final market release.

Reply lordmocha - Monday, January 16, 2017 - link For the "EN1070K" you have "2x DP 1.3 (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz)" which is also what Zotac has on the specification sheet. But isn't DisplayPort 1.3 4k@120hz? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#1.3) Reply lordmocha - Monday, January 16, 2017 - link DisplayPort 1.3 also supports dual 4k@60hz using MST, so maybe this is what Zotac is doing? Reply jabbadap - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Well that old magnus en was the same barebone for gtx1060,gtx1070 and RX480. Barebone for gtx1080 was different and watercooled. I would expect to see EN1060k and maybe ERX480k version of it. But what I find interesting zbox MAGNUS ERX480 has vanished on their site. So is it canned? Marketing page is still there: https://www.zotac.com/us/page/magnus-erx480 But it is missing on the e series lists, where it were https://www.zotac.com/product/mini_pcs/zbox-e-seri... And old spec link just redirect to zotac members login. https://www.zotac.com/us/product/mini_pcs/magnus-e... Reply tai - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link What material is it? Reply Old_Fogie_Late_Bloomer - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link So, it looks like the Realtek Ethernet ports are not a great choice for Linux, but the Intel WiFi is? Wonder how much that MI572 is gonna turn out costing. Reply jabbadap - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link Realtek is like a hit and miss, it might work out-of-the box or not. Most common problem for it that kernel is loading wrong driver. For intel you need firmware, which should be included on your distribution. But again it should work out-of-the box with generic drivers, but for full speed that restricted firmware will be needed. Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 is supported from kernel 4.6 and up. http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/net... Reply Old_Fogie_Late_Bloomer - Thursday, January 19, 2017 - link Thanks for the clarification. I'm currently in an environment where I'm using Wi-Fi, but I would prefer to retain the option of using a wired connection. Then again, I don't want to go with the one with the Intel NIC on account of deeply distrusting vPro/IME. :/ Reply 1 PIPELINE STORIES + Submit News Razer Updates The BlackWidow Chroma Keyboard: New Ergonomics And Switch Choices Xiaomi Announces the Redmi Note 4 in India Kaby Lake E3-1200 v6 Xeon Specifications Leaked SanDisk Launches A1-Class microSDXC Card Edge Memory Announces Video Speed Class SD Cards` Samsung Reveals Root Cause of Galaxy Note7 Battery Fires Xiaomi International VP Hugo Barra to Leave the Company, Return to Silicon Valley Fujitsu Announces 13.3" Lifebook U937/P and UH75/B1: 7th Gen Core i5, 8hr Battery, Under 1.77 lbs Toshiba Is Studying The Possibility of Spinning Off NAND Flash Production Logitech Launches G203 Prodigy Gaming Mouse with A New 6000 DPI Sensor Seagate Launches 1 TB and 2 TB Enterprise Capacity 3.5-inch HDDs ASRock Shows DeskMini GTX/RX, using Micro-STX Motherboard with MXM Support TWEETS IanCutress: @duak Thanks!

Robot cars are now learning to drive by playing Grand Theft Auto Software allows AI developers to use GTA V as a simulator for self-driving cars Game gives them a realistic and diverse world for testing and developing AI Platform is another method of teaching road scenarios to machines, including the use of Google Street View By Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline Published: 07:12 EST, 16 January 2017 | Updated: 07:28 EST, 16 January 2017 e-mail 69 shares 14 View comments With its reckless and violent driving scenarios, you may not imagine playing Grand Theft Auto would be an ideal way to teach anyone or anything to drive in the real-world. But the popular game is being used to train computers capable of controlling self-driving cars of the future to navigate streets. GTA V is said to give researchers access to a realistic and diverse world for testing and developing artificial intelligence, without putting vehicles on real roads. Scroll down for video  With its reckless and violent driving scenarios, you may not imagine playing Grand Theft Auto would be an ideal way to teach anyone or anything to drive in the real-world. But the popular game is being used to train computers capable of controlling self-driving cars of the future Video games are the latest of a number of tools being used to test computers that could one day control cars on our roads. Recently, researchers from Princeton University developed software able to gather useful information about the physical properties of roads from Google Street View and OpenStreetMap, enabling a computer to learn where the edges of junctions should be, MIT Technology Review reported.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Look out, Uber!

Would you live in a 3-MILE-high smog-eating skyscraper?... Share this article Share 69 shares Such technology is of interest to companies designing autonomous vehicles because creating 3D maps of street environments is time consuming and expensive, according to automated driving expert John Leonard, a professor at MIT’s CSAIL. Various companies, including Intel have also modified Grand Theft Auto to test AI for driverless cars. However, this is the first one to be released to the larger research community A FASTER PROCESS  A separate research team made up of scientist from Darmstadt University and Intel has explored how Grand Theft Auto can help teach autonomous cars how to drive.  The team discovered that machine learning can extract maneuver and landscape data much faster in these virtual settings than with traditional methods. Using computer vision algorithms, tehy labeled thousands of images in just a few hours, which will be used to teach autonomous cars to recognise different objects.  Cars use object identification data to ‘learn’ how to recognize objects, such as pedestrians or cyclists. Gathering this information is usually conducted by researchers, who comb through scenes from real life footage and draw borders around objects by hand. This process can take 60 minutes per image for the CamVid datasets and 90 minutes per image for the Cityscapes datasets, according to the team at Intel Labs and Darmstadt University. However, a virtual world like Grand Theft Auto allows computers to step in and complete the labeling in just seconds.   ‘If this process can be automated using deep networks that operate on large public databases, this would be a big win for self-driving technology.’ Craig Quiter, an engineer at self-driving truck company Otto also believes learning from Street View is a good idea and came up with a method to use video games to prepare computers intended for self-driving cars for real-world scenarios. Together with researchers at OpenAI, he developed a way to use Grand Theft Auto V’s detailed road layouts as a training ground, using software called Universe. He described Universe as ‘a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites and other applications,’ in a blog post.  The open source software works with his DeepDrive project – a platform that allows developers to create self-driving car AI using memory inspection techniques to repurpose the video game into a self-driving car simulator. Quiter says DeepDrive can be set up in 20 minutes on various operating systems and works best using a joystick rather than keyboard and mouse. With this set-up GTA V can ‘train software to recognise elements of the real world,’ Because developers only need buy a copy of the video game and download the Universe agent to get started, it’s not only computer scientists working for top companies such as Google or Uber – that are said to be developing self-driving vehicles – who can start driving a virtual car around a detailed virtual world. ‘GTA V gives researchers access to a rich, diverse world for testing and developing AI,’ Quiter wrote. ‘Its island setting is almost one-fifth the size of Los Angeles, giving access to a broad range of scenarios to test systems. ‘Add to that the 257 different vehicles, seven types of bicycles, and 14 weather types, and it’s possible to explore a huge number of permutations using a single simulator.’ However, while the software may be giving more developers access to the tools with which to develop AI for the auto industry, its prowess has not yet been tested with a physical self-driving car.  Various companies, including Intel have also modified Grand Theft Auto to test AI for driverless cars.

Intel's Mesa Driver Set To Flip On OpenGL 4.5 For Haswell Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 16 January 2017 at 06:19 AM EST. 19 Comments It was just two weeks ago that Intel's Mesa driver finally crossed the threshold with Haswell for supporting OpenGL 4.0 and then last week OpenGL 4.2 was crossed for this older generation of Intel graphics hardware. Now, it looks like OpenGL 4.5 will be enabled for Haswell with the i965 Mesa driver. With a rather small patch sent out at the end of last week by Intel's Kenneth Graunke, Haswell is ready to see OpenGL 4.5 exposed with this open-source graphics driver. Ken commented, "Everything is in place and the test results look solid." The patch has already seen some reviews. Given it's rather trivial and Mesa 17.0 hasn't yet been branched, we'll hopefully be seeing OpenGL 4.5 for Haswell with Mesa 17.0 -- a nice upgrade after it was stuck with OpenGL 3.3 for years. Broadwell and newer has already supported OpenGL 4.5 since Mesa 13.0. 19 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

It never should have been presented as part of an intelligence briefing,” Woodward said. “As you suggested, other channels have the White House counsel give it to Trump’s incoming White House counsel.” Fox News host Chris Wallace asked Woodward his opinion of how the intelligence community handled the so-called Russian dossier against Trump. Woodward said Trump’s point of view on the issue is often underreported and then scolded the CIA for its criticism of the president-elect. “When those former CIA people said these things about Trump that he was a recruited agent of the Russians,” Woodward said. “A useful fool,” Wallace interjected. “A useful fool. They started this. In Trump’s mind, he knows the old adage, ‘Once a CIA man, always a CIA man.’ And no one came out and said those people shouldn’t be saying things,” Woodward said. Woodward said he has been in the journalism world for 45 years and that journalists receive information where people make allegations. Woodward said that Trump has the right to be upset with the allegations. “Those intelligence chiefs were the best we’ve had were terrific and had done great work. [They] made a mistake here, and when people make mistake, they should apologize,” Woodward said. Trump addressed the reports at his press conference on Wednesday morning, calling them “disgraceful.” “As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they are going to suffer the consequences. They already are,” Trump said. CNN’s Jim Acosta tried to ask Trump a question at Wednesday’s press conference, but the president-elect refused to answer his question and called CNN “fake news.” This entry was posted in National Security and tagged Bob Woodward, Chris Wallace, Donald Trump, Fox News, Intelligence, Russia, Trump Administration.

Twitter Facebook Oracle outlines plans to take on Amazon in cloud Bare metal servers, a focus on hosted databases and application development are keys Brandon Butler (Network World) 18 January, 2017 09:54 - - - - print email Comments Oracle executives today revealed the results of years’ worth of engineering and development efforts on its IaaS public cloud and announced a new bare metal cloud database service and an international geographic expansion. Oracle is typically not considered one of the top IaaS public cloud leaders, but the company has hopes of competing in the market by combining its infrastructure services – which focus on its core database services – with a suite of application development and software as a service offerings. At its Cloud World event in New York today, company executives laid out their vision of how they will take on competitors such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Salesforce.com. Oracle founder and now CTO Larry Ellison once famously denounced the cloud, questioning whether the technology was just hype. Since those statements the company has invested heavily in hiring the engineering talent to build up its cloud platform, and has begun releasing what analysts call a minimally viable product in the IaaS public cloud market. Today, Oracle released more details that will advance its cloud offering, across a handful of areas: Compute: Oracle’s IaaS cloud comes in three compute flavors: Physical (meaning non-virtualized) Linux or Windows servers, which offer isolation of customer workloads; virtual servers (where customers share infrastructure resources with other customers) and bare metal servers running Docker containers. “No one else in the public cloud offers that capability,” said Oracle President of Products Thomas Kurian about the company’s physical servers, which he says provide 100% isolation of workloads. IBM offers bare metal servers, too, though. Compute offerings range from inexpensive machines ($0.10 per hour) to ones with between 32 and 44 Intel core processors, 1 TB of dRAM and 29 TBs of local storage, all the way up to 60 TB local storage that are capable of up to 1 million input and outputs per second (IOPS). Kurain claims these cost 20% less than AWS with 7 to 10X the performance. Network: Kurian says that Oracle’s cloud is built on a virtualized network that isolates customer traffic in “fully encapsulated” virtual networks. He argues that this provides better quality of service – eliminating the “noisy neighbor” problem on shared resources – while providing better security. Storage: Oracle cloud offers object, block and file storage systems. Databases: Kurian argues that Oracle’s databases are the company’s biggest differentiator. Databases start at $175 per month and range to DBs with up to 240 TBs of storage and 246 physical cores, all the way to hosted Exadata platforms. They all have the same API and SQL dialect. Oracle, Kurian says, also supports more than 500 open source projects in its cloud. PaaS and cloud management: Oracle’s PaaS is broken into serving two developer profiles, either a professional developer, or a line of business developer, the latter of which would use a graphical drag-and-drop interface for simple application development. Advanced microservice applications can be controlled by Kubernetes on the Oracle PaaS, Kurian says. Meanwhile, the company’s cloud management portal can be used to control on-premises and other public cloud platforms. Administrators can set up policies to automatically backup or patch resources on a scheduled basis. SaaS Services: In addition to IaaS and PaaS functionality, Oracle has a strong set of SaaS tools, ranging from CRM, ERP, HCM and vertical industry specific applications. Geographic expansion: Oracle announced plans to open three more regions for its cloud this year in Virginia, Turkey and London, which will give the company 29 regions around the world. “Oracle should be congratulated for its enthusiasm and the proactive way it is pursuing the cloud market,” says Charles King, an analyst with Pund-IT, adding that the company was late to the market. Oracle has taken a similar approach to Microsoft and IBM in offering services across all three layers of cloud: IaaS, PaaS and SaaS. “They still have a massive install base of customers that want cloud services. The question is whether they will choose Oracle as their cloud vendor as opposed to vendors they may be currently working with, or choosing to go with a more established, more innovative vendor.” King adds Oracle’s cloud will appeal most to existing customers, but he questions how the company will be able to attract net new brands.

The FTC filed a blockbuster lawsuit against Qualcomm today, arguing that the chipmaker used its baseband processor patents to illegally force competitors out of the market. (The short version: the FTC says Qualcomm wouldn’t sell modems to any company that didn’t also agree to pay Qualcomm patent royalties on phones that used modems from other suppliers, which the agency refers to a the “no-license-no-chips” policy.) Anyway, a big part of the complaint has to do with Apple, and the fact that Qualcomm spent a lot of time working and reworking its deal with Cupertino to remain the exclusive provider of modems in the iPhone. Among the moves it made? The FTC says that in 2007, Qualcomm agreed to refund some of Apple’s patent royalty payments if Apple agreed not to make a WiMAX iPhone. Here’s the FTC’s complaint: Under a 2007 agreement, Qualcomm agreed to rebate to Apple royalties that Qualcomm received from Apple’s contract manufacturers in excess of a specified per-handset cap. Qualcomm’s payment obligations were conditioned upon, among other things, Apple not selling or licensing a handset implementing the WiMax standard, a prospective fourth-generation cellular standard championed by Intel and opposed by Qualcomm. WiMAX is dead now, but in 2007, this was a Big Deal: Sprint had just made an enormous bet on beating the market to 4G speeds by deploying a WiMAX network in 2008, ahead of LTE, and Intel still had an opportunity to make a mark in mobile. Paying off Apple allowed Qualcomm to keep the iPhone off a faster network until LTE was ready — and in the process effectively kneecapped Sprint, which invested billions into a network that couldn’t support the future iPhone roadmap. kneecapping sprint’s wimax network Ten years later, and Sprint has switched to LTE but still isn’t in great shape — T-Mobile CEO John Legere just referred to Sprint as “exploding” and hinted that he might like to take it over. Intel’s not doing much better when it comes to mobile, although the company just managed to get some modems in the iPhone 7. But it’s interesting to think about what might have been if the first 4G iPhone had been a WiMAX model on Sprint, while every other network was still running 3G.

Is your business still using Windows 7? It's time to upgrade to Windows 10, according to Microsoft, even though end-of-life support for the aging operating system is still three years away. Windows 7 isn't as secure as its modern counterpart, Markus Nitschke, head of Windows at Microsoft's German subsidiary, wrote in a German blog post. The OS, which first arrived in 2009, "does not meet the requirements of modern technology, nor the high security requirements of IT departments," Nitschke wrote, according to ZDNet. Microsoft plans to end support for the operating system on January 13, 2020. After that date, it will no longer receive security patches. But even those patches aren't enough to make it as secure as Windows 10, which has multiple security features geared toward the enterprise IT environment. They include built-in biometric security and a whitelist that checks each app's cryptographic signature and prevents it from running if it's determined to be unsafe. Meanwhile, Redmond last year confirmed that all next-generation processors built by Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, or others, will only support Windows 10. That means if you buy a PC with these upgraded chips—Intel's "Kaby Lake," Qualcomm's "8996," and AMD's "Bristol Ridge"—they will only run Windows 10; you can't downgrade to Windows 7 or 8.1. Related 10 Reasons to Upgrade to Windows 10 10 Reasons to Upgrade to Windows 10 Microsoft has also been highlighting Windows 10's security success stories in recent weeks. Company security researchers claim that Windows 10 would have thwarted two zero-day exploits that hackers used in a phishing campaign against think tanks and nongovernmental organizations in the US last fall. Still, many corporations will find the 2020 deadline to upgrade or be cut off from security updates a nuisance, because it means updating legacy software that's designed for Windows 7 or earlier OSes. It will also mean updating networks to support new features, and reconfiguring cloud apps, as Brad Passman, director of information technology at Novetta, noted when Windows 10 was released in 2015. Microsoft's decision to step up its role as Windows 10 cheerleader for enterprises comes as the company admitted that its upgrade push for consumers was too aggressive. The company's Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela said last month that Redmond had indeed made mistakes, including "getting too aggressive in pushing out the Windows 10 free upgrade."

January 17 AAPL: 120.00 0.96 FTC complaint alleges Qualcomm forced Apple to use its baseband chips for lower patent royalities [U] Zac Hall - Jan. 17th 2017 1:49 pm PT @apollozac Qualcomm View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Update: Qualcomm has aggressively responded to the complaint, effectively alleging that the FTC doesn’t understand the industry it regulates. Qualcomm believes the complaint is based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry […] Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC’s allegation to the contrary — the central thesis of the complaint — is wrong. Qualcomm is the target of a new Federal Trade Commission complaint filed today involving Apple. The FTC claims Qualcomm engaged in anti-competitive practices that helped it monopolize the market of a “key semiconductor device” used in products including iPhones and iPads. The FTC’s complaint specifically mentions that Qualcomm prevented Apple from working with its competitors over a five year period ending last year. Extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties. Qualcomm precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors. The complaint spans up to last year when Apple added cellular chips from Intel in some iPhone 7 models. Qualcomm was similarly fined nearly $1 billion in China over anticompetitive practices back in 2015 and over $850 million last month in South Korea. The complaint against Qualcomm in the Unites States has only started today, however. The Federal Trade Commission says it wants a “court order to undo and prevent Qualcomm’s unfair methods of competition in violation of the FTC Act” and has asked the court to force Qualcomm to “take actions to restore competitive conditions” which will likely include new penalties in the United States. Full FTC release below: FTC Charges Qualcomm With Monopolizing Key Semiconductor Device Used in Cell Phones January 17, 2017 The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint in federal district court charging Qualcomm Inc. with using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cell phones and other consumer products. Qualcomm is the world’s dominant supplier of baseband processors – devices that manage cellular communications in mobile products. The FTC alleges that Qualcomm has used its dominant position as a supplier of certain baseband processors to impose onerous and anticompetitive supply and licensing terms on cell phone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Qualcomm also holds patents that it has declared essential to industry standards that enable cellular connectivity. These standards were adopted by standard-setting organizations for the telecommunications industry, which include Qualcomm and many of its competitors. In exchange for having their patented technologies included in the standards, participants typically commit to license their patents on what are known as fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory, or “FRAND,” terms. When a patent holder that has made a FRAND commitment negotiates a license, ordinarily it is constrained by the fact that if the parties are unable to reach agreement, the patent holder may have to establish reasonable royalties in court. According to the complaint, by threatening to disrupt cell phone manufacturers’ supply of baseband processors, Qualcomm obtains elevated royalties and other license terms for its standard-essential patents that manufacturers would otherwise reject. These royalties amount to a tax on the manufacturers’ use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm’s competitors, a tax that excludes these competitors and harms competition. Increased costs imposed by this tax are passed on to consumers, the complaint alleges. By excluding competitors, Qualcomm impedes innovation that would offer significant consumer benefits, including those that foster the increased interconnectivity of consumer products, vehicles, buildings, and other items commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. The FTC has charged Qualcomm with violating the FTC Act. The complaint alleges that Qualcomm: Maintains a “no license, no chips” policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm’s preferred license terms. The FTC alleges that this tactic forces cell phone manufacturers to pay elevated royalties to Qualcomm on products that use a competitor’s baseband processors. According to the Commission’s complaint, this is an anticompetitive tax on the use of rivals’ processors. “No license, no chips” is a condition that other suppliers of semiconductor devices do not impose. The risk of losing access to Qualcomm baseband processors is too great for a cell phone manufacturer to bear because it would preclude the manufacturer from selling phones for use on important cellular networks. Refuses to license standard-essential patents to competitors. Despite its commitment to license standard-essential patents on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has consistently refused to license those patents to competing suppliers of baseband processors. Extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties. Qualcomm precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors. The FTC is seeking a court order to undo and prevent Qualcomm’s unfair methods of competition in violation of the FTC Act. The FTC has asked the court to order Qualcomm to cease its anticompetitive conduct and take actions to restore competitive conditions. The Commission vote to file the complaint was 2-1. Commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen dissented and issued a statement. Both a public and sealed version of the complaint were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on January 17, 2017. NOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The case will be decided by the court. The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers.

In a recently released report, GE and co-author Intel offer a comprehensive view of how the Industrial Internet – embedded sensors, data analytics and connected platforms- are helping companies increase their productivity and reducing environmental emissions to securing a cleaner and more competitive future. “We are working closely with our partners in the region, such as Masdar, Saudi Aramco, and RasGas, among others, some of the first adopters of digital solutions, to support regional economies in achieving their energy and economic diversification goals. This is part of a larger movement that includes both large companies, and start-ups, from across the industrial and tech sectors, working together on innovation and implementation to realize the dramatic economic and environmental potential of digital efficiency,” said Deb Frodl, Global Executive Director of GE Ecomagination. Overarching report findings on digital efficiency: Emerging digital solutions applied across industry can potentially save $81 billion in fuel costs annually and close the gap to reaching the COP21 goals by 30 per cent or 823 MT of carbon emissions per year, the equivalent of taking 174 million cars off the road. The key economic and environmental impact of digitization were identified as: • Power – $14 billion in cost savings annually and a potential reduction in global carbon by 495 Mt/year • Lighting – $30 billion in saving, and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction • Aviation- $14 billion in annual saving and 45 MT/year in carbon reduction • Railway – $3 billion in saving and 19MT/year in carbon reduction • Ground transportation – $20 billion in saving and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction GE has been working with its partners on digital industrial technologies that help achieve enhanced productivity, efficiency and asset optimization. For example, RasGas Company Limited (RasGas), one of the world’s largest and pioneering producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is marking the first global deployment of Industrial Internet technologies in the LNG sector. In the UAE, Masdar is working with GE to pilot and commercialize sustainable energy-neutral advanced wastewater treatment solutions in the MENAT region, and co-develop Industrial Internet solutions to optimize efficiencies. GE is also working with Masdar to launch a co-leadership training program for women to drive innovation and talent development in the renewable energy sector. In aviation, GE Aviation and Dubai’s Museum of the Future have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to accelerate innovation and advanced technology around the world. In Saudi Arabia, GE has announced several new digital industrial partnerships, technologies and initiatives. The GE Saudi Technology & Innovation Center (GE STIC) in Dhahran Techno Valley is at the heart of the company’s ‘Industrial Internet’ roadmap to drive digital transformation of industry. GE Oil & Gas Digital is introducing its first Asset Performance Management (APM) solution to reside on Saudi Aramco’s business network for the Aramco Jazan Complex Integrated Manufacturing Operations Management System (IMOMS). Saudi Electricity Company has joined hands with GE, and established a Generation & Optimization Center (GOC), a state-of-the-art center equipped with hardware and software to monitor 16 SEC power plants. In lighting, Current, which brings together capabilities from GE’s LED, Solar, Energy Storage, and electric vehicle businesses, is enabling its partners in MENA to tap into a wide variety of GE offerings and optimize their energy needs across their entire operation. GE’s Industrial Internet operating system, Predix, is playing a pivotal role in providing a foundation for a range of digital solutions that improve energy and water efficiency across aviation, railways, ground transportation, manufacturing facilities, power plants and buildings.

Andrew Tarantola, @terrortola 01.17.17 in Personal Computing Comments 2200 Shares Share Tweet Share Save A major obstacle currently facing VR is the fact that the headsets themselves (generally) have to remain tethered to a bulky desktop tower. With the new Zbox Magnus EN1070K from Zotac, however, that tower is now barely bigger than a Mac Mini. The EN1070K is part of Zotac's gaming line of ultra-compact PCs, but don't let its minuscule footprint fool you. It offers the current Intel Kaby Lake Core i5 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU and can accommodate up to 32GB of RAM. That's more than enough processing power to run a VR setup such as the Oculus Rift. There's no word yet on when the EN1070K will be released, or for how much. Given that the last generation E-series cost around $1,500, you can pretty safely bet the new one will retail for roughly the same, depending on the specific components you select. So even though it may be small enough to fit into a VR backpack, the EN1070K's price tag may be too big to fit into your budget.

Go Phones Laptops Cameras TV Gaming Wearables Forum MORE All articles Best picks Drones Car Tech Smart Home Gift Ideas Downloads Login Follow Us Follow Us Subscribe Antivirus Review McAfee 2017 Review by Brian Nadel Jan 12, 2017, 10:46 AM McAfee 2017 The good Inexpensively covers unlimited number of devices Moderate system-performance impact True Key password manager Rapid scans The bad Poor detection rates of zero-day malware Lacks some useful features offered by other brands Users can't schedule scans or opt out of viral collection Verdict McAfee products are a bargain, but their malware protection can't compare to that of other top brands. 6/10 Worth considering $49.99 McAfee McAfee's five Windows antivirus products — AntiVirus, AntiVirus Plus, Internet Security, LiveSafe and Total Protection — run the gamut from basic to full-featured, and can protect PCs against most widespread malware with a moderate system-performance impact. All but the cheapest product include licenses for Mac, Android and iOS security software, which can be installed on an unlimited number of devices. That's one of the best bargains in the antivirus industry. Unfortunately, McAfee is not very good at stopping new Windows malware, and its feature set for its premium products is sparse compared to that of some other brands. The company is implementing a new scanning engine, but until we see those results, we'll have to recommend Bitdefender or Kaspersky products instead. Costs and What's Covered The AntiVirus program (list price $40 per year for a single PC) has the basics covered, stopping malware, phishing scams and spyware. It's also got a two-way firewall, a system optimizer and file shredder, plus a few other features not always found in basic antivirus virus software. McAfee Antivirus $39.99 Amazon AntiVirus Plus is the same, but its license ($60 for an unlimited number of devices) adds software for Macs as well as Android and iOS devices, including both platforms' smartwatches. This is a bargain for anyone seeking basic protection for a lot of machines. The package lets you manage all your McAfee-protected devices from a web-based account. McAfee Antivirus Plus $59.99 Amazon McAfee Internet Security ($60 for one device, $80 for an unlimited number) adds peace of mind with anti-spam protection and parental controls. You'll also get one license for Intel's excellent True Key password manager. McAfee Internet Security $69.99 Amazon McAfee has a pair of very similar top-shelf programs, Total Protection and LiveSafe, each of which costs $90 for an unlimited number of devices, and each of which includes five True Key licenses. While LiveSafe offers 1GB of encrypted online storage, Total Protection can encrypt files. McAfee Total Protection $89.99 Amazon McAfee LiveSafe $33.70 Amazon All five products support Windows 7 through Windows 10. (No current McAfee product supports XP or Vista.) The multiplatform bundles include software for OS X 10.10 Yosemite and later, Android 4.1 and later and iOS 9 and later, as well as Apple and Android watches. We'll be focusing on the Windows software in this review. Graphic: N. Bush/Tom's Guide McAfee promises that if its software or support technicians can't remove a piece of malware from your computer, you'll get a full refund on the software's purchase price. The catch is that to qualify for this money-back guarantee, you'll have to agree to automatic annual renewals of your paid subscription. As is commonplace with antivirus software, it pays to shop around. Steep discounts on McAfee products are often found online, including on McAfee's own website. MORE: Best Antivirus - Top Software for PC, Mac and Android Antivirus Protection McAfee's three-tiered defense starts with the company's scanning technology, which matches suspect items against known malware signatures. This is backed up with heuristic analysis, which brings together behavioral monitoring and code inspection to stop new malware that doesn't have a signature. Any piece of suspicious code is uploaded to McAfee's Global Threat Intelligence lab for analysis. If necessary, a quick fix is pushed out to the company's 200 million users. But while most antivirus brands let customers with privacy concerns opt out of such code-collection programs, McAfee doesn't let you leave. The software doesn't block executable files on USB thumb drives or SD cards from running as soon as the storage drives are inserted, but the Real-Time Scanner keeps an eye on things 24/7. To examine a single file or folder, right-click it in File Explorer and select Scan; you can also shred files that way. Web browsers are protected by McAfee's Web Advisor software, which adds browser extensions that block known malicious websites. Email attachments are scanned, and the user can whitelist certain pieces of software so that they won't be blocked. A two-way firewall checks outgoing and incoming network and internet traffic. A game mode suspends scanning if the user is playing a PC game or watching a movie. None of the McAfee products have anything like Trend Micro's Cloud Scanner for finding rogue files in your online file repositories. Ransomware exploits are treated as just another infectious agent to be detected and thwarted. Unfortunately, the current versions of McAfee antivirus software don't allow you to schedule recurring daily, weekly or monthly scans. McAfee says its engineers plan to restore this ability in the spring of 2017. Antivirus Performance McAfee's malware scanner is shared among its five Windows products. In recent evaluations conducted by independent labs AV-TEST and AV Comparatives, the scanner's detection rates ranged from mediocre to excellent, with persistent weakness against zero-day malware. McAfee says it is overhauling its malware-detection technology for 2017; when lab results for those editions come in, we will update this review. In AV-TEST's fall 2016 Windows 10 evaluations, McAfee Internet Security did pretty well, stopping 98.8 percent of zero-day malware (found through heuristic detection) in September and 98.7 percent in October. It caught 99.9 percent of widespread malware (detected with signature matching) in September, and a clean 100 percent in October — excellent results. Yet 13 of the 22 brands AV-TEST evaluated in the fall Windows 10 evaluations did better than McAfee, especially against zero-day malware. And that showing by McAfee was an improvement over the previous Windows 10 round, in which McAfee found a dismal 90.1 percent of zero-day malware and finished third from the bottom. When what matters isn't how much you stop, but how much gets through, 90 percent isn't an A but a D-minus. McAfee Internet Security also fell short in AV-TEST's spring 2016 rounds of Windows 8.1 tests. It identified only 95.5 percent of zero-day attacks in May, although the rate rose to 100 percent in June. McAfee's widespread-malware rates were more impressive, at 99.1 percent in May and 99.6 percent in June, but once again, it was pretty far down AV-TEST's rankings overall. In AV-TEST's summer 2016 Windows 7 tests, McAfee's heuristic detection technology caught only 96.4 percent of zero-day malware in July and 94.9 percent in August. Only Microsoft Security Essentials, a free program that we recommend as a last resort, did worse. McAfee did much better against widespread malware, catching 99.7 percent and 99.9 percent in July and August, respectively. AV-Comparatives did have a chance to test McAfee's new malware engine in November 2016, but the detection results weren't terribly different from those for McAfee's older engine. The new engine caught 97.3 percent of "real-world" malware, a sample of all the prevalent online bugs, both zero-day and widespread. The old engine caught 97.6 percent of real-world malware in October and 98.8 percent in both September and August. About half of the other products tested did better. However, McAfee's false-positive detections, in which harmless software is misidentified as malicious code, skyrocketed to 23 in October and 29 in November after having been between zero and three for several months. (AV-TEST saw few false positives with McAfee's 2016 engine.) Overall, McAfee's results were a couple of notches below those of its chief competitors Bitdefender, Kaspersky, Norton and Trend Micro. All of those routinely scored between 99.8 and 100 percent against zero-day, real-world and widespread malware in lab tests. MORE: Best Free Antivirus Software for Windows PCs Security and Privacy Features McAfee AntiVirus is well stocked with extra features for an entry-level product. Its extras include file shredding, with the choice of four settings; a system vulnerability scanner to make sure you have the most recent versions of all software on your PC; and a QuickClean feature to optimize your system by getting rid of old files. Some other brands save such features for their midrange products. AntiVirus Plus has the same extra features as AntiVirus, but adds the Mac, Android and iOS licenses and the web-management interface. Internet Security adds an anti-spam filter to keep your email inbox clean, a single True Key password-manager license and parental controls to manage internet access for young users. At the pinnacle, McAfee's Total Protection and LiveSafe each include five licenses for True Key. (A stand-alone True Key subscription is $20 per year.) LiveSafe is often preinstalled on new PCs, while Total Protection is sold boxed on retail shelves, but both can be downloaded from McAfee's website or from online retailers. The only substantial difference between the two top-tier products is that LiveSafe includes 1GB of secure online storage (including photo storage) whereas Total Protection offers file encryption. Still, none of McAfee's products has a hardened browser for online commerce or an on-screen keyboard to block keyloggers, both of which we consider very useful, There's also nothing like Kaspersky's dedicated webcam protection or VPN service. Oddly, McAfee doesn’t have a rescue disk. This is the free system-cleaning software most antivirus companies offer for use when a Windows system is hopelessly clogged with malware and needs to be booted from a CD or USB drive. Performance and System Impact McAfee's scanning engine had a moderate impact on system performance. To test its load, we used our OpenOffice-based performance test, which matches 20,000 names and addresses on a spreadsheet. We noted the OpenOffice test's completion time in four scenarios: with no antivirus software installed, with McAfee LiveSafe installed but not actively scanning, during full scans and during quick scans. Our test machine was an ASUS X555LA notebook with a 2-GHz Core i3 processor, 6GB of RAM and a 500GB hard drive (36GB of which was filled). The system used Windows 10 with the latest updates. Prior to installing McAfee software, but with Microsoft's built-in Windows Defender unavoidably running in the background, the system had a baseline OpenOffice completion time of 7 minutes flat. With McAfee Live Safe installed but not scanning, the completion time lengthened to 7:30, indicating a passive performance loss of 7.2 percent, similar to that of Panda Gold Security. Neither result can compare to Kaspersky Total Security's zero passive impact, though. While performing scans and running our Open-Office benchmark, McAfee software scored a 9:07 for a Full Scan and 7:50 for a Quick Scan. These indicate performance slowdowns of 30 percent and 12 percent from the baseline, respectively, and put McAfee in the middle of the pack in terms of system impact. McAfee does offer some of the fastest full-disk scanning round, once the program has gotten a bead on your hard drive's contents. The software took 1 hour, 4 minutes and 53 seconds to complete its initial full scan of 49,185 items. During this scan, all the files were indexed and categorized. Subsequent full scans took an average of 5:47 to look at 49,190 files, a very rapid yet thorough examination. McAfee took 2 minutes and 3 seconds to run a Quick Scan that looked at 3,387 files. That's not bad, but some other programs get through quick scans in a matter of seconds. MORE: Best Antivirus Software for Mac Interface McAfee's white-and-gray interface hasn't changed much for 2017. As usual, there's a green checkmark on the main page to show that the computer is protected. Many of the subsidiary windows have handy go-back links, and there's a Home button to get to the main window. The main page includes links to details about virus protection, web and email protection as well as updates and subscription status. There are also buttons to add more devices to the coverage circle and search the local network for unprotected devices. Most pages include a right-hand navigation bar with links to Home, the True Key password manager and Help, plus a Navigation link with a list of features that get you to any feature quickly. That list is so extensive that you'll need to scroll up and down to see it all.  You can manually start an on-demand quick or full scan, but doing so requires drilling down four clicks from the main screen. Setup, Installation and Support Installing LiveSafe on our test PC took 13 minutes and 27 seconds. We started by inputting an activation code, then downloaded a 33MB beachhead installer from McAfee's site. Although the installer wants you to agree to auto-renew the subscription next year, it's easy to avoid, but you won't get the company's money-back guarantee. After the beachhead installer did its thing, we had to copy and paste a serial number from the McAfee website to the full program's installer. You'll need to do that again if you install the True Key password manager. If you encounter a problem with the installation process or the installed program, McAfee offers free 24/7 support via email, online chat or a toll-free phone number for users of all five paid programs. There's also a way to connect with tech support directly from the McAfee user interface. Bottom Line McAfee's inexpensive, unlimited AntiVirus Plus multiplatform license can be a big money-saver for families that have many PCs, Macs and mobile devices. That's especially true when many other antivirus companies reserve such universal coverage for only their top-tier products. The midprice Internet Security sits in the sweet spot in McAfee's lineup, offering the best tradeoff of features and price. It might not be worth upgrading to the top-shelf LiveSafe and Total Security just to get more password-manager licenses or a small amount of cloud storage or file encryption.  On the downside, even McAfee's pricier products lack some features we've come to expect from paid antivirus software, such as a hardened web browser or the ability to schedule scans. More dismaying is McAfee's middling ability to stop previously unseen malware, which drags down the programs' very good widespread-malware detection rate. It's a shame, because McAfee's affordable unlimited plans are among the best bargains in the antivirus industry We hope McAfee's next-generation scanning engine performs better against new malware. Until then, we'll have to recommend Bitdefender or Kaspersky products, which offer superior protection and even more useful features.

The first-generation NUCs based on Ivy Bridge had a SKU with Thunderbolt support. However, Thunderbolt went missing till it came back in the Skull Canyon NUC (NUC6i7KYK) last year. The Alpine Ridge controller for Thunderbolt 3 also integrates a USB 3.1 Gen 2 controller, making the Type-C Thunderbolt 3 port quite versatile. The Baby Canyon NUCs bring Thunderbolt back into the UCFF NUC form-factor. All the Baby Canyon NUCs have the Alpine Ridge controller. However, the i3 model is limited by firmware, allowing the Type-C port to support only USB 3.1 Gen 2 and Display Port 1.2. The i7 and i5 models have full Thunderbolt 3 support. The leaked specifications we wrote about in July were more or less accurate, and the official specifications allow us to fill in some of the missing blanks. The updated table is presented below. SKUs ending with K are units that do not support a 2.5" drive (only M.2 SSDs are supported). Intel Baby Canyon NUC PCs   NUC7i7BNH NUC7i5BNH NUC7i5BNK NUC7i3BNH NUC7i3BNK CPU Core i7-7567U 2C/4T 28 W TDP Core i5-7260U 2C/4T 15 W TDP Core i3-7100U 2C/4T 15 W TDP Graphics Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 Intel HD Graphics 620 PCH Intel Sunrise Point-LP for Kaby Lake-U Memory Two SO-DIMM slots, up to 32 GB of DDR4-2133 2.5" bay 1x2.5"/9.5mm bay, SATA3 None 1x2.5"/9.5 mm bay, SATA3 None M.2 Slot Up to M.2-2280 SSD with SATA3 or PCIe 3.0 x4 interface Wi-Fi/BT Soldered-down Intel Wireless-AC 8265 (802.11ac 2x2 + BT 4.2) with WiDi support Ethernet Intel I219V Gigabit Ethernet controller Display Outputs DisplayPort 1.2 via USB-C connector HDMI 2.0 Audio 3.5 mm TRRS audio jack 7.1 channel audio output via HDMI or DP Thunderbolt & USB-C 1x Thunderbolt 3 Type-C (40 Gbps) (USB 3.1 Gen 2 and Display Port functionality included) 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C (with Display Port functionality included) USB 4 USB 3.0 Type-A (5 Gbps), one with charging Other I/O MicroSDXC card reader with UHS-I support One infrared receiver Size (mm) 115 × 111 × 51 115 × 111 × 31 115 × 111 × 51 115 × 111 × 31 PSU External, 65 W OS Compatible with Windows 7/8.1/10 Product Page NUC7i7BNH Specifications NUC7i5BNH Specifications NUC7i5BNK Specifications NUC7i3BNH Specifications NUC7i3BNK Specifications In terms of appearance, the chassis sides now have a shade of gray to provide a better look when seen along with the black lid. We have a micro-SDXC slot on the side (a full-sized SDXC slot couldn't apparently work with their thermal design). In terms of performance, Kaby Lake should provide the claimed 7 - 11% improvement over the corresponding Skylake products. The new NUCs are also Optane-ready - allowing Optane M.2 SSDs to work seamlessly in conjunction with 2.5" hard drives in the future (when the Optane SSDs come into the market). One important thing to note here is that the i7 model uses a 28W TDP SKU (the Core i7-7567U), compared to the 15W TDP SKUs used in the i3 and i5 models. The i7 and i5 models have Iris Plus graphics with 64MB of eDRAM. None of the Baby Canyon NUCs support vPro. HDMI 2.0 with HDCP 2.2 is supported, thanks to the inclusion of a LSPCon in the BOM. This should make the units into perfect HTPCs with Netflix 4K capability. Compared to the NUCs from the last few generations, these units are not a big upgrade in terms of unique features for other use-cases. Generally speaking, we are not convinced that the Optane-ready feature is a big enough reason to upgrade to the Baby Canyon NUCs. That said, the i7 model should prove pretty interesting to compare against the Broadwell-U Iris NUC. The NUC7i3BNH with the neutered Alpine Ridge Controller (Note that the Type-C port only carries the SS10 / DP logos) Intel indicated that the kits are slated to come into the market over the next few months at price points similar to the current Skylake versions. While official MSRPs were not provided, we see the NUC7i7BNH for pre-order at $700, the NUC7i5BNH at $610, and the NUC7i3BNH at $496.   Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

Reply nathanddrews - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link I understand what NUC is trying to achieve as a form factor, but if you can buy a complete i3-7100 Kaby Lake laptop for less (including Windows) then I just don't see the point. Reply 1_rick - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Maybe you don't need portability (or perhaps you take it between a small number of fixed places), and you want a full-sized monitor. Waste of space to buy the LCD in a laptop, then. It could also be of use at a retail counter or nurse's station in a hospital, where there's not much space--just bolt it on the back of the monitor via the VESA mount. (Admittedly, an AIO might fill the same niche.) Reply Eletriarnation - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link These prices are kind of jacked up and I don't think they'll reflect the eventual reality since my Broadwell i3 NUC was $280 barebones and I've seen no indication that Kaby Lake has this kind of price difference on other platforms. Reply SquarePeg - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Yea, a quick stop at pcpartpicker shows a decent lower end mini-ITX gaming PC coming in at right at $700. That's with i5 7500, RX 480, 16gb dual channel DDR4, 480gb ssd, ect. I get that you're paying for the small size and low power draw but these prices seem $100 to $150 too high. Reply CaedenV - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link The NUC lineup has always been too high, and it is for a reason; competition. Intel is not a system-builder company, they prefer to sell to system builders, and provide reference designs that other companies can take ques from. For example, my school district bought a bunch of re-branded Intel NUCs from a 3rd party in bulk for far cheaper than what Intel was selling them for. MSI Cubi, and Gigabyte BRIX systems are also very similar in footprint using similar parts for a much cheaper price. So is it expensive? Yes. It is worth it... maybe, or maybe not. But if you are on a budget there are plenty of other cheaper options available because those are the units that Intel would prefer you to purchase. Think of it like the MS Surface lineup. There are plenty of surface clone devices for far less money. But Surface is what gets all the hype because it was 'the first' of the form factor and has the most PR behind it. But I could almost guarantee that the surface clone devices out-sell Surface several times over just on cost alone. And MS is OK with that because they are not really in the market to sell Surface PCs; they are in the market to keep PC manufacturers honest and making decent machines because they put out crap for too long. Now there is a standard of 'what can be done' which has raised quality across the board. The NUC play is almost exactly the same. Reply Ej24 - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link I wonder how the prices compare with a comparable Gigabyte Brix pc? There are technically competitors in this space. Reply spikebike - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link Sadly the competition seems to cheap out on the GPUs. I'd love to be wrong and see the 28 watt i7 + iris 650 graphics in something cheaper. Reply 1_rick - Tuesday, January 24, 2017 - link The Skylake Brix only supports DDR3L, whereas the Intel NUC does DDR4. Also, the Intel supports 32GB RAM while the Brix tops out at 16. There's a couple of other things like this. Are the extra features worth the price premium? You have to decide for yourself.

Credit: 3Glasses More like this Microsoft sets Windows 10 PC requirements for tethered VR headsets Sony's PlayStation VR bests HTC Vive in headset shipments 12 things Kaby Lake-based PCs will offer Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Microsoft will ship its first PC-attached mixed reality headsets for Windows 10 PCs to developers starting in March at the Game Developers Conference. The first Windows 10 VR headsets from Microsoft will be units for developers to write and test applications based on the Windows Holographic platform. The headsets will work with Windows 10 Creators Update, said Vlad Kolesnikov, senior program manager at Microsoft, during a webcast on Friday. GDC is being held from Feb. 27 to March 3 in San Francisco. Microsoft isn't expected to sell Windows 10 VR headsets commercially. Those will be available later this year through Lenovo, Acer, Asus, HP, Dell, and 3Glasses, which demonstrated headsets at the CES trade show earlier this month. The head-mounted displays work like a HoloLens, allowing users to interact with 3D objects that show up as floating images on real-world backgrounds. Like Oculus Rift, users can also watch movies, use apps, and play games in 3D with the headset. These headsets need to be tethered to PCs, which provide the computing horsepower. That's different from the HoloLens, which is a full-blown computer in a headset. Microsoft will provide updates on the VR development APIs during a Windows Developer Day webcast on February 8, Kolesnikov said. VR can be demanding on a PC, and Microsoft has set minimum hardware requirements to support the headsets. A laptop will need no less than an Intel Core i5 chip based on Kaby Lake architecture and 8GB of dual-channel RAM, and a desktop needs an Intel Core i5 chip based on Skylake. Gamers will require a faster GPU, CPU and memory for headsets to keep up with the fast-moving games. The headsets will also support AMD CPUs and GPUs, though the specifications haven't been provided yet. The headset will be detected as soon as it is plugged it into a Windows 10 PC, and drivers will be installed automatically. The next step will be to set up an "active space," or area in which users can play with the VR headset without hitting furniture or walls. The headset will scan and map the room and will issue a warning if a user steps out of an active space. A built-in camera will take pictures of the environment to create a mapping model, and the headset will also have tracking technology to check user movement. Headsets will also work with Cortana, so users can speak to give commands or interact with content. Initially the headsets will support nine languages, and more will be added during the holiday season this year. Microsoft will make all of its universal Windows 10 apps, like Skype, compatible with the headset. Starting with Creators Update, the company will host a "Movie and TV app" with 360-degree videos that can be viewed on the VR headset. The Edge browser will also have VR support through the WebVR standard. In addition, company is also porting some HoloLens apps to the VR headset.

Credit: Intel More like this Crate and Barrel works to balance online and offline sales New Relic aims to be your dashboard of the future The best way to doom a holiday retail trial to failure: Don't brief employees Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Shopping can be fun but also harrowing, especially in electronics or shoe stores. You can't find help or can't figure out if a specific product is in stock. In the future, the shopping experience should be much better thanks to technology. The store will recognize you, dig into your shopping habits, and guide you in the right direction. If your favorite product is in the store, retailers will make sure you know through messaging. That Minority Report-type technology is still many years away but will be possible with the magic of sensors, cameras, and data analytics. But some retailers have an early start: Some furniture stores are already using virtual reality so buyers can preview how furniture will look in a room. Poking into your shopping habits and recognizing your face may sound too invasive, but retailers are trying to make the shopping experience better. It starts with products like Intel's Responsive Retail Platform, which can track store inventory and respond to customer needs in real time. RRP, announced on Monday, includes hardware and software that could take control of inventory and pass on real-time alerts to sales associates and customers in the store about what's in stock. For example, if you're shopping for jeans, RRP could tell you if a particular size is available so you don't have to shuffle through a stack. Or if you are trying on jeans, you could request a size to be delivered to the fitting room. RRP includes a range of sensors and a mini desktop-like gateway box with an Intel x86 chip. The sensors, for example, can read RFID tags for real-time inventory checks, with the gateway providing the computing muscle. A large store may need a number of RRP boxes sitting on walls to keep a track of many products in real time. Also packaged with RRP are cloud services for analytics. Levi Strauss will use RRP to read tags to monitor inventory and issue an alert if jeans are left in dressing rooms or if shelves need to be restocked. The system will also map in-store traffic so the company can analyze what products are selling. The technology will be one piece of an effort to improve logistics at Levi Strauss stores. The new system is potentially the start of a way for Levi Strauss to make shopping a lot easier at their stores. On entering the store, repeat buyers could be instantly redirected to their jeans of choice, and they may be able to try on jeans through a virtual reality headset. There are many internet-of-things technologies being used to improve logistics at stores. Revel Systems provides technologies for collection and analysis of real-time store or restaurant intelligence at iPad point-of-sale systems. The Revel technology also helps in registering orders and billing. For restaurants, analytics helps figure out key operational details like how much food to buy on a given day. Home appliance store Pirch is experimenting with numerous technology to improve the buying experience in its large stores. Salespeople at its Manhattan store carry Surface tablets for inventory, billing, and helping customers find the best product. The store is also looking at virtual reality to help customers visualize rooms and kitchens with specific products. Intel is establishing a fund of $100 million for retail technology development. Intel will invest in companies developing compelling technologies for use in stores. The company established a similar $100 million fund for the development of automotive technologies. The fund and RRP were announced at the National Retail Federation show being held in New York, where Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is expected to give a speech. Intel will also have pop-up environments demonstrating cool shopping experiences based on its technologies.

The laptops could also see maximum RAM double, according to Apple Insider. Right now Apple's high-end laptop line, the MacBook Pro, comes in two sizes: 13-inch and 15-inch screens. Popular Searches Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 63.52 +0.54 +0.86% Verizon Communications Inc VZ ▼ 50.13 -2.28 -4.35% Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA ▲ 101.47 +2.90 +2.94% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 67.37 +0.72 +1.07% Kuo says that in Q4, Apple will start making a new 15-inch MacBook Pro that will come with up to 32GB of RAM. Currently MacBooks only support up to 16GB of RAM, but Kuo says that will double in the next generation of MacBook Pros. Phil Schiller, Apple's SVP of worldwide marketing, has previously defended Apple's decision to cap memory at 16GB, saying "to support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life." © Provided by Business Insider Inc apple macbook pro touch bar As well as a new high-end laptop, Kuo also reportedly says in his note that Apple will produce new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros in Q3. He also expects Apple to begin producing a 12-inch MacBook in Q2. It will reportedly have the same design, but its memory will also double from a maximum of 8GB to a new limit of 16GB. Kuo also says that Apple has seen higher than expected demand for its new MacBook Pro laptops with Touch Bar, a touchscreen above the keyboards that can be used to control the laptops. Demand is, apparently, "better than expected" for the devices, and manufacturing capacity has been increased by 50%. Apple also released a version of the new MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar. That didn't sell so well, Kuo said, and he expects Apple to discount that model. Kuo is a reliable source of news for future Apple products. The analyst, who lives in Taiwan, has sources close to Apple's supply chain who have given accurate descriptions in the past of what products the company is working on.

Hultin Professor at NYU Tandon and director of The GovLab. Through different partnerships with UNICEF (focused on creating data collaboratives to improve children's lives) and Omidyar Network (studying new ways to match open-data demand and supply to increase impact) , The GovLab has catalogued dozens of cases in which data collaboratives are already being used for the public good. Based upon The GovLab's research, data collaboratives provide:  Increased situational awareness and response, as demonstrated by a joint initiative between Orbital Insights and the World Bank to use satellite imagery to measure and track poverty Greatly improved public service design and delivery, as demonstrated by governments using crowd-sourced traffic information to help create better transportation systems Enhanced knowledge creation and transfer, as illustrated by an ambitious effort on the part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 10 biopharmaceutical companies, and  non-profit organizations to share data to create new, more effective diagnostics and therapies Cutting-edge prediction and forecasting, as shown when Intel and the Earth Research Institute at the University of California, Santa Barbara, employed satellite imagery to predict drought  and develop targeted interventions for farmers and government agencies More effective impact assessment and evaluation, such as occurred when Nielsen and the World Food Program used data collected via mobile phones to better monitor food insecurity and allocate resources According to Stefaan Verhulst, The GovLab's co-founder and director of research and the head of its Data Collaboratives Initiative, the diverse examples detailed on the site clearly demonstrate the potential of data collaboration as an emerging model of inter-sector digital philanthropy. "In the coming months and years, they will be essential vehicles for harnessing the vast stores of privately held data toward the public good," Verhulst said. Natalia Adler, a data, research, and policy planning specialist at UNICEF and UNICEF Data Collaboratives project lead, agreed:  "At UNICEF, we're dealing with the world's most complex problems affecting children. Data collaboratives offer an exciting opportunity to tap previously inaccessible datasets and mobilize a wide range of data expertise to advance child rights around the world. It's all about connecting the dots." In addition to the lessons provided by more than 70 examples of how corporate data was exchanged to improve people's lives, DataCollaboratives.org provides guidance for designing and implementing a data collaborative, including steps to take to avoid the risks that data sharing can entail. The launch of DataCollaboratives.org is being held in concert with both the inaugural United Nations World Data Forum, in Cape Town, South Africa, where Verhulst will help facilitate a two-day workshop on data collaboratives, and the 2017 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, whose focus this year is on "Responsive and Responsible Leadership" and where Noveck will speak on strategies for using data for public good. About The Governance Lab The GovLab is an action-research center with a mission to improve people's lives by changing the practice of governance. The center is dedicated to leveraging advances in technology to enable more open, collaborative, effective, and legitimate ways to make better decisions and solve public problems. For more information visit: http://www.thegovlab.org.    About the NYU Tandon School of Engineering The NYU Tandon School of Engineering dates to 1854, when the New York University School of Civil Engineering and Architecture as well as the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute (widely known as Brooklyn Poly) were founded. Their successor institutions merged in January 2014 to create a comprehensive school of education and research in engineering and applied sciences, rooted in a tradition of invention, and entrepreneurship and dedicated to furthering technology in service to society. In addition to its main location in Brooklyn, NYU Tandon collaborates with other schools within the country's largest private research university and is closely connected to engineering programs in NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai.

But as Zotac's new Zbox Magnus EN1070K shows, that doesn’t have to be the case. Announced earlier this month at CES 2017 and reported by AnandTech, the Magnus EN1070K is the latest entry in the Zotac E-series of miniature desktop computers, and measures in with a tiny footprint of 8.27 x 7.9 inches (or a little bigger than a Mac Mini). But it packs some serious firepower into the small size, offering a current-generation Intel Kaby Lake Core i5 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU, up to 32GB of RAM, and both an M.2 SSD slot and a 2.5-inch SATA drive bay for internal storage. The Magnus EN1070K is no slouch when it comes to ports either, somehow cramming two USB 2.0, two USB 3.0, a USB 3.1 Type-A port, a USB-C port, an SD card slot, two Ethernet ports, two HDMI ports, and two DisplayPorts into the diminutive form factor. Zotac isn't listing an exact price or release date for the Magnus EN1070K, but based on the previous $1,500 Skylake-equipped model, it'll likely cost somewhere in a similar price range (depending on hard drive, SSD, and RAM configuration, of course).

HOW TO HIRE THE BEST The Unusual Interview Question a Top Team Builder Always Asks Top business growth and team building consultant Nigel Green shares his unusual (and effective) interview strategy. By John Nemo John Nemo is the author of the Amazon bestseller LinkedIn Riches: How to Leverage the World’s Largest Professional Network to Enhance Your Brand, Generate Leads, and Increase Revenue! @JohnNemoPR Founder and CEO, LinkedIn Riches@JohnNemoPR WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement "I think that the fastest way to grow a business is to connect with your customers, not convince them." Business Growth Advisor and Consultant Nigel Green shared that thought with me on a recent podcast interview, and I haven't been able to get the phrase out of my head ever since. Green, who helped lead a healthcare sales company from $94 million to $350 million of revenue in just 36 months, certainly knows a thing or two about growing a business quickly. In his previous role, as CEO of StoryBrand, he helped clients like Pantene, Intel and Berkshire Hathaway clarify their marketing messages to improve customer engagement. Along with building businesses and helping clients clarify their marketing strategies, Green also shared with me his core philosophy of building a successful team inside your own company. (Related: Listen to the entire conversation with Nigel Green.) These days, everyone has their own opinions around how to recruit and build a dream team of professionals. In fact, LinkedIn recently released a report revealing the trends that they say will define recruiting in 2017. And while buzzwords like the "war on talent" continue to circle, Green says recruiting and team-building actually comes down to 3 C's. Character, Chemistry and ... Significant Others? "The most important thing that I'm looking for in any type of talent is character," Green says. "Chemistry is the number two 'C', because if someone's got great character but we're just not naturally going to jibe, it's going make for a really challenging work dynamic." One of the unconventional ways Green feels out character and chemistry is through spousal interviews. "If you are hiring someone that has a spouse and you're not sitting down with that spouse, I think you're making a big mistake," he says. "Here's why. I want to know, is the spouse supportive? I want to know, how does this person interact with his or her spouse? Is their marriage an important thing? Can I pick up on something that's unhealthy that is going to poison this team I'm trying to build? And so I think it's very important." Green also says that chemistry is not about everyone getting along, but rather having alignment. "Healthy cultures know intuitively that conflict is not strife, it is merely the search for the greatest truth," he says. "And therefore it is encouraged, and you can conduct conflict in a healthy way." Competency is Key Green's third "C" is Competency. "It's the one everyone expects you to start with," he notes. "I'm not as worried about that, because I can teach you how to be competent if I need to. "And if you have a healthy environment at home, a supportive spouse, he or she is going to be supportive of the long days and late nights of you getting competent, of doing the work and learning what you need to." For Green, much like building a business, building a top-notch team is more about connection than convincing.

January 16 AAPL: 119.04 0.00 KGI: Apple planning Kaby Lake processor updates for MacBook & MacBook Pros this year, 32GB RAM option for 15-inch Chance Miller - Jan. 16th 2017 3:16 pm PT @ChanceHMiller MacBook Pro Ming-Chi Kuo View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities is out today with a new investor note, offering up some more information about what’s in store for the Mac lineup in 2017. Kuo claims that all MacBook models will be upgraded in 2017 with Intel’s latest Kaby Lake chipset, while there will also be a new 32GB RAM option for the 15-inch model. Intel just announced its 7th generation Kaby Lake processors at CES and Kuo predicts that the first model that will see the upgraded chip will be the 12-inch MacBook. Mass production of that new machine will begin in Q2 of this year, according to Kuo, while a 16GB memory option will also be added to the device. Furthermore, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros will start production in early Q3 with Kaby Lake processors. Last but not least, Kuo claims that Apple will also add a new 15-inch MacBook Pro model to the lineup with 32GB of RAM. This machine, according to Kuo, will adopt desktop memory in an effort to satisfy high-end users. Earlier this year, Phil Schiller explained that Apple’s decision to cap the MacBook Pro at 16GB of RAM was done in an effort to preserve battery life. In terms of supply chain and shipping performance, Kuo predicts that Mac shipments will grow in 2017 and cites production delays as the main reason for the slow performance in 2017 as demand for the new Touch Bar MacBook Pro is apparently “better than expected.” The 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar, however, has reportedly performed worse than Apple expected. Because of this, Kuo, says that Apple will cut the price of the machine in an effort to improve shipments. Kuo’s note doesn’t offer any information regarding the rest of the Mac lineup, such as Apple’s desktop offerings. Earlier reports have claimed that Apple is planning a spec bump for the iMac this year, as well as support for USB-C. That spec bump will likely come around the same time as the 12-inch MacBook is refreshed, but nothing is guaranteed at this point. Read our full roundup of what to expect from Apple in 2017 here.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Jan 18, 2017 - Page 11　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Vietnam courts Japanese investment as Abe visits AFP, HANOI Vietnam is courting high-tech Japanese investment and wants Tokyo to become its top investor, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said yesterday during a visit by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan is the second-largest foreign investor in communist Vietnam, a manufacturing hub in Southeast Asia seeking to expand exports from apparel and agriculture to high-value goods, such as electronics and automobiles. “Vietnam wants Japan to become the top investor in Vietnam,” Phuc said at a business forum cohosted by Abe and attended by business tycoons from both nations. Vietnam has become a fierce competitor to regional neighbors such as Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia and China in tech manufacturing. Electronics giants such as Foxconn Technology Group (富士康), Panasonic Corp, Samsung Electronics Co and Intel Corp have all made significant investments, taking advantage of Vietnam’s comparatively cheap, but increasingly well-educated and young workforce. Ties between Tokyo and Hanoi have warmed in recent years, and the world’s No. 3 economy has invested heavily in Vietnam as growth back home has been dragged by a graying and shrinking population. The Asian allies have also cozied up in the face of separate disputes with regional powerhouse China over disputed territory in contested waters. Japanese firms are involved in more than 3,000 projects worth about US$42 billion in Vietnam, mostly in the manufacturing sector. Japan is the leading investor in Vietnam after South Korea. Tokyo is also looking for new markets where it can sell major construction projects. Abe called on Vietnam to “continue supporting Japanese enterprises [and] listening to experiences from Japanese companies in high-tech areas.” He earlier said that investment would focus on “projects to upgrade high-quality infrastructure.” The leaders did not outline specific areas of investment, but officials earlier said that Japan was interested in high-speed railway projects and airport infrastructure. Earlier during Abe’s two-day trip, officials said Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp would invest in a thermal power plant in Vietnam’s central Ha Tinh Province. Members of Vietnam’s business community welcomed the push toward high-tech at the meeting, which was attended by several Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi, Canon Inc and Fukuyama Transporting Co. “[It] will surely contribute to improving the quality of life in Vietnam,” Vietnam-based N&G Investment CEO Nguyen Hoang told reporters. Vietnam, an authoritarian one-party state, has become a hot spot for private investment in recent years, especially in the manufacturing and consumer sectors. Foreign investment last year shot up 9 percent year-on-year, hitting a record US$15.8 billion. Although growth has remained relatively strong in recent years, the nation’s GDP last year rose 6.2 percent, down from 2015 and falling shy of its growth target of between 6.7 and 7 percent.

Kuo says all Mac notebooks will be updated this year to Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, in addition to a 15-inch MacBook Pro with 32GB of RAM. During CES 2017, Intel announced its new 7th generation Kaby Lake processors and Kuo believes that he 12-inch MacBook will be the first Mac computer to come with the new chipset. Mass production will kick off in Q2 and the device will have a 16GB RAM option. Also, in early Q3, both the 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pros will be upgraded to the Kaby Lake processors. Finally, Kuo says Apple will add a new configuration to the 15-inch MacBook Pro lineup that will offer desktop-class 32GB of RAM. The new machine will use desktop memory in an effort to satisfy its top-end users. In terms of growth, Kuo predicts that Mac shipments will grow in 2017 and cites production delays as the main reason for slow growth in 2017 as demand for the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is “better than expected.” Unfortunately, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is performing worse than Apple expected.

Apple Apple to add Kaby Lake SoCs for 2017 MacBooks, 32GB RAM option for Pro By Bindu Nair - Jan 17, 2017 KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has released a brand new note talking about Apple’s plans for its MacBook range in 2017. The tech major is apparently going to focus on a number of internal refreshes such as introducing Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors across its lineup. One major bone of contention MacBook users have had with the 2016 MacBook Pro is that it tops out at 16GB of RAM. Many power users complained that the ceiling was too low for their needs. Apple responded to the criticism by stating that it did so in order to guarantee a healthy battery life. As it turns out, Apple seems to have absorbed some of the disapproval it received. Kuo claims that it’s looking to unveil a 15-inch MacBook Pro model which will carry up to 32GB of RAM in the fourth quarter of the year. He predicts that the company will be forced to utilize desktop RAM because of the restrictions currently found in memory system designs. Also Read: Consumer Reports reverses stance, now recommends 2016 MacBook Pro AppleInsider points out that the firm will probably have to adopt emerging memory technology like LPDDR4 or DDR4L to make sure the new MacBook Pro stays on par with the current one in terms of unplugged battery life. Other than the 15-inch edition, there might also be revamped 13-inch and 15-inch variants set for a Q3 2017 launch. Meanwhile, the 12-inch MacBook may hit mass production in the second quarter of the year looking mostly the same as its previous iteration. The one significant change it is likely to possess is a new 16GB RAM option, double its predecessor’s 8GB RAM. Interestingly, Kuo alleges that Apple is going to sell the current Touch Bar-less 13-inch MacBook Pro at a deep discount to boost shipments since it hasn’t been doing as well as the Touch Bar-equipped models. The brand wants the former to serve as a replacement for the 13-inch MacBook Air.

ByJ.A. Watson for Jamie's Mostly Linux Stuff | January 17, 2017 -- 12:23 GMT (04:23 PST) | Topic: Linux The Asus X540SA laptop on which I attempt to run Linux. Image: Asus A number of my laptops and netbooks have moved on to other homes and other purposes recently, so I have been looking for something new. Last weekend I saw an advertisement for an Asus X540SA at a ridiculously low price (CHF 299 / €280 / £245 / $300), which is always one of my criteria. Another criteria in this case was a 15" screen, and this ASUS has is 15.6", so that made the decision for me. This Asus specifications page for the X540S lists a variety of CPUs, memory and disk configurations, so this is obviously just the latest in a long line. The detailed specs for the one I got are: Intel Celeron N3060 8GB DDR3 RAM 500GB HDD / 5400 RPM / SATA 15.6" LED 1366x768 display Intel HD Graphics 400 802.11 b/g/n WiFi & RJ-45 Wired network Bluetooth 4.0 USB 2.0/3.0/3.1 HDMI & VGA SD/SDHC/SDXC Card Reader 8x Super-Multi DVD Weight 2Kg Those look like some very good specifications for such a low priced laptop. You don't get something for nothing, and even though I found it at a very good price, there is also clear evidence of the low-cost design and construction of this laptop. First, the case looks rather plush, it has a kind of brushed-metal finish - but is it entirely plastic, and it feels like relatively thin plastic. The keyboard doesn't have a very positive feel. Oh, and something that I have never seen before, the power button is actually the top right button of the keyboard. After looking at that and scratching my head for a while, I finally realized that the End key is missing. That seems like a pretty extreme decision, how much money can you save by not having a separate power button? The variety of external connections is good, but there is exactly one of each - USB 2.0, USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 (Type C) - that's not a lot. Finally, 1366x768 resolution is not very impressive for a 15.6" display. Oh, and one other thing. I don't know if this was a cost-related decision, but this thing has a "clickpad" style of touchpad, which doesn't have discrete buttons, just a little line in the middle of the bottom of the touchpad which supposedly delineates left- and right-click areas. There are some positive points about this laptop (beyond the low price) as well. For example, 8GB is a better than average amount of memory, having Bluetooth included is not always the case, as is the DVD drive. I'm not familiar with the USB 3.1 (Type C) connection, but I guess if you have something that can take advantage of this, it is a big plus. So in the end, I guess you get what you pay for, and if you're looking for a low cost laptop, you have to decide which compromises you are willing to accept. So far I think this one looks promising, but now it is time to get down to actually configuring and using it. Configuring Windows 10 Home The first step, as always, was slogging through the Windows 10 Home initial configuration. Sigh. If I didn't dislike Windows so much, maybe this wouldn't be so awful. But I do, and it is. Here are some of the questions it asked: Do you want to share your personal data with Microsoft? Ugh, no. Do you want to share your browsing history with Microsoft? Ugh, NO. Do you want to automatically connect to WiFi networks which your "friends" have previously connected to? What??? No, absolutely not. Do you want to automatically connect to other networks which have been pre-selected by Microsoft? Sigh. No. Do you want to automatically connect to otherwise unknown public-access wireless networks, just to check and see if they need some other kind of authentication? Gaaa... There were probably more like this that I don't remember, but really, do other people actually answer 'Yes' to some of these questions? I guess that 'Yes to Everything' is what you get if you take the Express Configuration option... After staggering through the initial configuration, the second step is finding and clearing out the pre-loaded bloatware. Dropbox McAfee LiveSafe (limited trial version) Microsoft Office 365 (limited trial version) Microsoft OneDrive TeamViewer (at least two releases out of date) ASUS Cloud Web Storage WPS Office ASUS Gift Box (this contained a number of other "offers") ASUS HiPost (I never did find an explanation of what this actually is) There's more that I have not found or identified yet, I'm sure. But at least getting all of the above off and then rebooting made the laptop noticeably more responsive, and dramatically reduced the amount of disk-thrashing noise it was making after boot. Unfortunately, the clickpad was turning out to be just as awful as I had feared. It seemed like half the time it didn't recognize a normal left-click, and more than half the time a right-click. Two-fingered scrolling was intermittent, at best. Oh, how I hate clickpads. Installing Linux At this point I was basically ready to start 'using' the laptop. Honestly, I'm still pleased and hopeful abut this laptop, it seems nice. It's not a speed demon (duh, it's a Celeron CPU), but it is fast enough to be comfortable to use; the screen resolution is not great, but it's good enough. Of course, using the laptop for me starts with installing Linux on it. The first step in that is to reduce the size of the Windows partition to make room for Linux. Although most Linux installers are now able to do that, I prefer to do it using the Windows disk management utility so that there are no issues about whether it was done 'properly' or not. In this case I found that Windows was installed to a single partition of about 465GB, and the disk/partition management utility said that the maximum I could reduce it was to about 260GB. That's enough for me right now. I then booted a Linux Mint 18.1 LiveUSB stick, and it came right up with no problem. That's a nice surprise, because of course this is a UEFI firmware system and I didn't have to go into the firmware/BIOS configuration to change anything. On other systems I have had to make changes to enable USB boot, or disable UEFI Secure Boot, which required setting a BIOS password, but not this time. Linux Mint 18.1 seemed to recognize all of the hardware, including wired and wireless network adapters. The screen resolution was correct (it's been a long time since I last saw a Linux installer get this wrong, anyway), and the clickpad at least worked (it hasn't been very long since I last saw an install get this wrong). I used gparted to set up a few partitions in preparation for Linux installation. I prefer to do it this way rather than fight with a bunch of different Linux installers to get the disk layout and partition sizes exactly the way I want. If you were going to just multi-boot one Linux distribution along with the pre-installed Windows 10 Home, it would not be necessary to do this kind of pre-partitioning. What's next? So, I am now ready to start installing a variety of Linux distributions. That will be the subject of the next post. I'm not sure exactly what I will install, but at the least it will be: openSUSE Tumbleweed Manjaro Debian Fedora Mint In summary, so far this is not the greatest laptop I have ever purchased. It has a number of negative points, but it also had a very low price. But if things continue to go as they have so far it could very well turn out to be the best price/performance laptop I have ever bought. Then it will just be a question of how durable it is: it should be interesting. P.S. For those who have been following my latest Raspberry Pi posts, this new laptop has only been a temporary diversion. I will be continuing with the Pi in parallel with setting up Linux on this laptop.

He gave us a run down of some of the new features on their Intel Kaby Lake motherboards, as well as a sneak preview of a pair of upcoming AMD chipset motherboards. Single button settings for a DDR4 boost is one thing, but the idea that a relative novice can go inside the latest version of OC Genie, ‘press a button’ and have a Kaby Lake processor running smoothly at 5.2GHz, is certainly interesting. The idea of automatic overclocking is not new to MSI (or other board manufacturers), but the interface now sports a dial that goes to ’11’ which is a clear sign that MSI have a sense of humour – linking it to legendary comedy rock film Spinal Tap (HERE). Not sure I would want to be running my new processor 24/7 at just over 1.5 volts however! (see video for more on this). If you want to see more on the new MSI Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon motherboard then read Luke’s full anaysis published last week, over HERE. You can also see Luke’s in depth testing and his views of manual and automatic overclocking of this particular MSI board on THIS page, when paired up with an i7 7700k. How stable a 5.2GHz Kaby Lake chip will be is something that will need plenty of testing – the same goes for how much you’ll need to spend on an after market cooler, but – for now – the demo is impressive. Also on show were a pair of AMD chipset boards, although no demos were allowed and information was limited – see for yourself. Watch via our VIMEO Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 1080p HERE. KitGuru says: The ease and size of the overclocks being made available with Kaby Lake (be it Turbo Boost or through a 3rd party tool) has us wondering how much damage specialist system builders like Overclockers and Armari have inflicted on Dell and HP’s high margin workstation business models.  Similar Posts Categories Tags Related Related Tags: 5.2GHzAM4AMDAutomatic OverclockingCES 2017DDR4 BoostJorankaby lakeMSInewsOC GenieOne Touch OCSchoonderwoerdZ270 Categorized Under: CES Thomas Jackson Look at following article to learn how an individual parent was able to acquire $89,844/year in her spare time on her computer or laptop without selling anything>>>FL-Y.COM/3m1e VA:F [1.9.22_1171] Rating: 0 (from 0 votes) Juliejmuncy Google is paying 97$ per hour!

We are now confronting a president-elect who has nominated persons for his cabinet and department chairs who are advocates for policies that appear to defy the purposes of the ofﬁces they would hold. For example, Trump has picked Jeff Sessions to serve as attorney general, a man who became only the second nominee to the federal judiciary in 48 years whose nomination was killed by the Senate Judiciary Committee for his racist attitude. For national security advisor, Trump has chosen Mike Flynn, the man who formed the Flynn Intel Group. According to a recent article in the New York Times, this is a consulting ﬁrm with “hazy business ties to Mideast countries, to Russia and to Putin himself.” Trump has also picked Tom Price for health secretary: a retired orthopedic surgeon, now a U.S. congressman, who is author of proposed bill HR 2300. This proposal, if adopted, would tear apart the Affordable Health Care Act. It would roll back expansion of Medicaid in 31 states and the District of Columbia, taking coverage away from 14 million poor people. Among other things, this proposal would no longer require insurers to cover addiction treatment, birth control, maternity care, or prescription drugs. Beyond the ACA, Price is an advocate for privatizing health care in general, including the conversion of Medicare for seniors into a block grant to state governments, which would limit federal spending for this program, and increase costs for senior citizens. The basic idea would be to turn Medicare into a voucher program. Our congressman, Rep. Greg Walden, says he is a friend of Tom Price. He and Price both agree they want to repeal and replace the “broken parts” of the Affordable Care Act. Walden has stated that only 8 percent of Americans — those who are not on Medicare, Medicaid, or have employer sponsored insurance (about 25 million people) will be affected by the changes. For Eastern Oregonians in Walden’s Congressional District 2, that represents about 55,000 people who will be affected. What will these changes mean to you? I suggest asking the questions that get more speciﬁc answers than the vague assurance Walden gave to The Chronicle that he is going to Washington “to set policy that makes a difference for the people (he) represent(s).” What will those differences be, really? Know what they mean for you.

Super Bowl LI Will Feature Player’s Eye Camera View A New View! Super Bowl LI Will Feature Player’s Eye Camera View By Jesse James on 17 January,2017 Technology has changed the way we do everything, and now it will further affect the way we watch sports. Today the word comes down that some big moves are being made for Super Bowl LI, which will go down on February 5th. Today the word comes down that Super Bowl LI Will Feature Player’s Eye Camera View which will be a first for the game. The never-before-seen camera angle displays the field only as the players can. This unique experience will use Intel’s 360 Replay technology and its extensive collection of cameras for a point-of-view perspective from any player on the field. FOX recently spoke on the news stating: “We tasked Intel to push their amazing Intel 360 Replay technology to the limit of what it could do, using their array of cameras circling the stadium to synthesize a player’s view on the field,” said Michael Davies, FOX Sports SVP of Field & Technical Operations. “The cameras, backed up by a huge bank of Intel computing power, allow a moment to be recreated in 3D space, so that a ‘virtual camera; can be placed at the player’s eye line — not unlike how limitless camera views can be created in video games.” Interesting moves made, but will it be worth it. Time will tell! Speak your thoughts on it after the jump and stay tuned for more coming soon. A New View!

Dean, VT Editor, … and Tasnim News Agency, Tehran Americans have no perspective of what it is like to be an ancient people, despite our DNA roots [ Note: VT gets most of its mainstream media coverage overseas primarily from organizations that have followed our work on subjects of interest to them. We do the same when cross-posting NEO material. And there are some that don’t, like Syria, where we do not have any kind of a media partnership, due to the war situation which has their government organizations on full focus there, with a big pipeline of current news coming at them all the time. Iran is slowly building up and diversifying its English news coverage to challenge the monopoly of platforms like the BBC and Voice of American, which are partially or fully under the influence of their respecting Intel communities. Such is the world we live in, and we cannot wish it away. We usually break the ice with them via written interviews, which we are normally happy to do, as they are published in Farsi also, which gives our material the ability to reach into the non-English speaking Iranian community, something we could not do on our own, due to our non-existent translation department. So we build these relationships one brick at a time, on overlapping interest areas during a trust-building stage. Sometimes that effort flatlines, and sometimes it evolves into being able to do Skype radio and video, and even brainstorming as to the current state of the crazy world we live in. We are always learning through new relationships, and we try to be as accessible as our time allows, which is limited. But Tasmin picked out a topic that I had written about, which they wanted to delve into more, so here that is… JD ] ____________ Pasargade, Iran – Capitol of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great, built during 559-530 BC, a UNESCO world heritage site Europe Facing Abject Security Failure: US Analyst – First published … January 12, 2017 – TEHRAN (Tasnim) – A senior political expert based in the US city of Atlanta warned against a “mind-boggling” security situation in European countries and said their governments have lost their battle against terrorism. European governments have lost battle against terrorism on several fronts, politically, by immigration policy, and an abject security failure, Managing Editor of Veterans Today Jim W. Dean said in an interview with the Tasnim News Agency. ____________ Following is the full text of the interview: Tasnim: British Security Minister Ben Wallace recently said Daesh (ISIL or ISIS) terrorists have aspirations to launch mass-casualty chemical attacks on targets in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. In fact, European authorities fear that as the terror group was driven out of its strongholds in the Middle East such as the Iraqi city of Mosul, their nationals fighting for the group would return home and pose a growing domestic threat. It seems that Europe is going to face an influx of Takfiri militants as a continent battered by a string of terror attacks. What would Europe do in order to contain this threat? Do not you think Europeans are somehow paying the cost of their moves to follow US’s lead in the Middle East region? Persepolis, Iran Dean: Europe has no security against terrorism. They have lost that battle on several fronts, politically, by immigration policy, and an abject security failure. But that I mean the various security forces do not have the manpower to track all the suspects they have because they have allowed way too many into their respective countries to recruit and set up cells. And we have this mind-boggling situation where, despite all the mass surveillance we all live under now, in Britain they are using public cameras to fine people for not picking up dog poop, while militants seem to have no problem traveling around Europe on their own passports. It’s almost like this door has been left open on purpose, by some power wanting to profit somehow from the resulting fear and chaos from growing terror attacks. Fortunately, a large number of suicide bombers have been killed in Syria and Iraq, who will not be returning home. But they can be replaced in time and can attack soft targets almost anywhere they want. Why has there been no legislation making membership in a terrorist organization a serious felony and open travel impossible for them? Why has no one at the UN demanded that state sponsors of terrorism lose their membership in the body? As long as those really behind this scourge have sovereign immunity, we will never see an end to it I am afraid. Tasnim: Thousands of Europeans are thought to have traveled to Syria, many to join Daesh, since the outbreak of the foreign-backed war in that country. It sounds that chickens are coming home to roost. What do you think? Dean: Not only will they be going home, but they will be filled with anger and hate. Does anyone think they will be content with a low-paying job or on public assistance? Once they have lived by the gun as they have, and abused their religion as a tool to cover their horrible crimes, they are beyond reform. Every one of them is a major threat if allowed to walk around freely, and any country that allows them to would be in effect aiding them in their future attacks. Tasnim: Reports suggest that certain European states have been supporting terrorist groups in the Middle East. Do you believe that they will finally reconsider their position on Syria and the rest of the region? Dean: They will not reconsider until they are fully exposed so their voting public can deal with it. This is a two headed problem, as even European opposition parties are lax to publicly charge their own government with aiding and abetting state proxy terrorism, not wanting to be tagged as “unpatriotic”. No Western democracies anywhere see anyone running for office with the issue of ending state-sponsored terrorism as an agenda. All we see happening for now is some changes to the disastrous open door immigration policy that was primarily driven by Angela Merkel. Tasnim: It is no secret to anyone that the election of Donald Trump as next US president gave a big shock to the entire Europe. How would US-Europe ties change under Trump? Will Europe try to turn to other powers as a replacement for US? Shiraz, Iran Dean: As Trump is such a showman and a narcissist, it remains to be seen if he can project a presidential image versus that of a “reality TV” host. He has already picked up the nickname of “President Twitter”, not out of any rudeness or spite, but because he likes to “play” on the world stage using Twitter, acting like a teenager with his numerous off-the-cuff remarks. Trump is unpredictable at this point, and by design…embodying a kind of psychological war on everybody, allies and adversaries alike, except for Israel, for which he has appointed himself as an American ex-official president with Netanyahu. Europe has no replacement powers for America. It has a long list of domestic problems, due to its governing body, the EU Council, having lost faith with the EU people, who have effectively been disenfranchised with the extra levels of bureaucracy between the voters and the decision makers. Many are now suspecting that this may have been by design. Trump threw the EU a big curve ball with his threatened NATO changes and demands that Europe carry the full cost of its defense. The key to all this will be exposing the hoax of the Russian threat to Europe, which followed the destruction of the Iran nuclear weapons threat hoax. No one, including Israel, who had claimed for years that Iran had a secret program put one shred of evidence on the table to kill the successful conclusion of the P5+1 talks; and that huge fraud was completely ignored by corporate media afterward.

Nothing of this exists in this country at all. We are the prototype of a complete brainwashed country, loving our enemies and hating ourselves. This is sad to state but it’s true. People love to be open for anyone brown, black or even white – if it only is “Not German”. If this is not Orwellian in the real sense, I don’t get it. I know there will be a war coming to the Europeans and I feel why, I really feel it coming. This state of affair is not sustainiable, no one speeks about it but everyone feels it deep down. I have no hope at all about your new president, because my personal humint and the absolute irreal (or grotesc) situation in Germany tells me that the smallest “Incident” at the Polish border can lead to a European catastrophy. I learned from Mr. Trump that Europe is not that important (if they don’t make fair deals, of course), so I wait for things to come for me, my family and my country. I aready know that it will be devastating. Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  January 16, 2017 at 5:55 pm I am sad to hear this Detlef as the German people have so many fine qualities. But it is the same with the Americans. The shrinks and the super computers have figured out that we can be led around like the Pied Piper’s children, just by playing the right tune. And now we have Mr. Trump, with no musical talent, thinking he can do it with lyrics alone. Detlef Reimers  January 16, 2017 at 3:44 pm Jim, let me tell you this: There is no threat at all of any crazy muslim, doing anitihng that migh hurt the people or – which would be much worse, of course – the government of this slowly but definitely dying country. Your government’s brainwashing of our whole contry over the last 70 years has been so effective and complete, that I have to confess: you won, we loose! There is no hope, people here hate their own country (which was one of the main aims of our enemies right from the beginning in the great 20th century game against Germans), the Preussians and all of this. No real history is teached, only zionist and western clap trap. The people are so perfectly and totally brainwashed over the years, they hate everyone who only tries to bring some new (which mostly comes from foreign historians) ideas about the sad situation. Congratualation to Edward Bernay, he’s done his job really well. We are dumb as dumb can be. Merkel will shurely win the next election, no doubt at all about this. My comment from a dying nation. Log in to Reply Andrew_Bukanov(Russia)  January 17, 2017 at 8:30 am Detlef Reimers – really sorry to hear that from You. It’s a pity. But you must do something. Merkel wouldn’t be the desirable candidate. I don’t know who will keep her up to win? Russian hackers maybe. Frankly – most Germans in the streets look like calm zombies, not paying attention on what happens in their country. We hear sometimes your Sahra Wagenknecht and Noam Homski from the “Voice of Germany” they are the only alternative info from Germany we know. Andrew_Bukanov(Russia)  January 16, 2017 at 2:08 pm Trump’s declaration about NATO has already made EU crazy :))))) I should mention, that Trump had such opinion since 1980s. It is pragmatic attitude to the question of a businessman. When it was Eastern military block of USSR, and the threat was actual – NATO was actual , too. But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO lost its orientation. it became huge military machine with no compass. No ideas, no aggressor to counterpart. What to do next? The newly proclaimed next NATO’s goals: terrorism fighting, anti-drugs fighting, Iran….. Iran’s problem was no so evident. Tell me – how to explain the army brigade generals, lieutenants, sergeants, admirals – what they must do to fight terrorism? HOW? All they could do is written in the military books of strategy and tactics since ww2. Thus West got a great bureaucratic war machine, too expensive and too great to do smth. Log in to Reply Andrew_Bukanov(Russia)  January 16, 2017 at 2:08 pm EU as i mentioned a week ago – has no military power at all. But it was comfortable for them – Uncle Sam pays for everything! All you need is to roar like a wounded whale – “Russians go”! The louder – the more profitable. As for NATO wars – the main forces were American. Libya was actually “democratized” by USA alone. Now Trump says: why do we need NATO? And he is right. It doesn’t mean that project NATO will be shut. It is not needed. It should be, but restructured. EU doesn’t have money to make EU Army. France, Germany, England – they can afford to have own armies. Another countries can’t. Maybe also European countries would protest the Germanization of Europe, remembering Hitler. Andrew_Bukanov(Russia)  January 16, 2017 at 2:09 pm Anyway, the doctrine to separate Germany and Russia as the most powerful union is in action if to see how many weapons arrived in Poland and Baltic. And Merkel was a piece of that plan.Poland is the most suitable buffer zone for separation. So, very interesting process start in EU. We sit and drink orange juice or glintweine and watch, in Russia 🙂 Will EU pay and use, or start dog-fighting for its virtual independence. JL  January 17, 2017 at 3:14 pm No Andrew, European Countries will protest against sovjetization of Europe, remembering Lenin. The big difference between Hitler and Lenin is not that Lenins mummy is still avaible, but Hitler got finance from Detroi businessmen and Lenin got finance from Wall Street bankers. Grampah  January 16, 2017 at 11:19 am “Yes, VT is working to build a bridge between East and West, to combat those sowing the seeds of destruction for both of us” But you will make the field tougher for the fiction producers, “their business model”. Blame xxxx one week, xxx2, the following week. Display indecent hubris with a policy such as “switch to Asia”, as if that was not a “swing the artillery (aka lies from a comic book) signal. 24/7 promote, confirm blatant false hoods, actually myths about 20th century events and wars. “Thy mist have a list of “rogue states” to use in your overall plan.” Rigidly control all media and academia to keep polishing up stale, obvious lies, fake names, fake everything. Let no one who thinks for themselves past ‘the gate” for public office.

Mesa 17.0 Delayed To Allow For Ivy Bridge OpenGL 4.0 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 17 January 2017 at 10:25 AM EST. 13 Comments Mesa 17.0 (formerly known as Mesa 13.1) was supposed to enter its feature freeze last weekend, but that milestone and branching of the code-base didn't happen due to last minute feature work. Haswell received OpenGL 4.5 while the branching is being delayed to now allow the Ivy Bridge OpenGL 4.0 patches to land. Mesa release manager Emil Velikov expects those Ivy Bridge FP64 patches to land in the next day or two and the branching would then take place. Emil wrote this morning, "with the above work, the Intel Linux driver will provide the same [or even greater] functionality than the respective Windows and Android ones, across the board. This is a very huge milestone, which should not go unmentioned!" Mesa 17.0 should be officially released in February. Stay tuned for more benchmarks and feature recaps. Emil also announced this morning the Mesa 12.0.6 release candidate. 13 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

MulteFire Release 1.0 comes just under a year after the alliance was first formed at the Mobile World Congress last year. The specification builds on elements of 3GPP Releases 13 and 14 to define how LTE networks can operate in unlicensed and shared spectrum, while ensuring fair sharing of spectrum with other users and technologies such as Wi-Fi.

Japan is the second-largest foreign investor in Vietnam, a manufacturing hub in Southeast Asia seeking to expand exports from apparel and agriculture to high-value goods like electronics and automobiles. “Vietnam wants Japan to become the top investor in Vietnam,” Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said Tuesday at a business forum co-hosted by Abe and attended by company tycoons from both countries. Vietnam has become a fierce competitor to regional neighbors like Thailand, Malaysia, China and Taiwan in tech manufacturing. Electronic giants like Panasonic, Samsung, Foxconn and Intel have all made significant investments, taking advantage of Vietnam’s comparatively cheap but increasingly well-educated and youthful workforce. Ties between Tokyo and Hanoi have warmed in recent years, and the world’s No. 3 economy has invested heavily in Vietnam as growth back home has been dragged down by a graying and shrinking population. They have also grown closer in the face of separate disputes with China over disputed territory in regional contested waters. Japanese firms are currently involved in more than 3,000 projects worth roughly $42 billion in Vietnam, mostly in the manufacturing sector. It is the leading investor in Vietnam after South Korea. Tokyo is also looking for new markets where Japanese companies can sell major construction projects. Abe called on Vietnam to “continue supporting Japanese enterprises (and) listening to experiences from Japanese companies in high-tech areas.” He said earlier that investments would focus on “projects to upgrade high-quality infrastructure.” The leaders did not outline specific areas of investment, but officials said earlier that Japan was interested in high-speed railway projects and airport infrastructure. Earlier during Abe’s two-day visit, officials said Mitsubishi is investing in a thermal power plant in Vietnam’s central Ha Tinh province. Members of Vietnam’s business community welcomed the push toward high-tech at the meeting, which was attended by several Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi, Canon and Fukuyama Transporting. “(It) will surely contribute to improving the quality of life in Vietnam,” Nguyen Hoang, CEO of Vietnam’s N&G Investment, said. Vietnam, an authoritarian one-party state, has become a hot spot for private investment in recent years, especially in manufacturing and consumer sectors. Foreign investment shot up 9 percent last year compared with the year before, hitting a record $15.8 billion. Though growth has remained relatively strong in recent years, its GDP rose 6.2 percent last year, down from 2015 and falling shy of its growth target of between 6.7 and 7 percent. Abe’s visited the Philippines, Australia and Indonesia on his six-day tour of the region before his final stop in Vietnam. He said Monday that Japan will provide six new patrol vessels to Vietnam as he called for maritime security in Asia.

MacBook Pro might get Intel's 7th generation processors this year. Image: Lili Sams/Mashable By Stan Schroeder2017-01-17 10:39:08 UTC There was no shortage of complaints about Apple's refreshed, 2016 MacBook Pro line, be it shoddy battery life or absence of any ports besides USB-C. But one complaint stood above others as it indicated that Apple may be neglecting a crucial target market: With aging processors and a maximum of 16GB of RAM, the new MacBook Pro does not appear to be a machine for professionals.  That might change in 2017. According to a report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via MacRumors), Apple will launch new variants of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro this year, with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. Later in the year, a "significantly redesigned" 15-inch Pro with 32GB of RAM will arrive.  SEE ALSO: Consumer Reports recommends the new MacBook Pro after battery fix Kuo also says Apple will update the MacBook with Kaby Lake processors and, possibly, a 16GB of RAM option. Currently, the 12-inch laptop maxes out at 8GB of RAM.  Mass production of the new MacBook could start in the early second quarter, Kuo claims; the updated 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models could enter mass production in the early third quarter, and the 15-inch MacBook Pro with 32GB of RAM could enter mass production in the early fourth quarter (that's March, July and September, respectively).  Kuo shared another, very interesting prediction — the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar will get cheaper this year, in order to replace the MacBook Air, which is currently in limbo as it hasn't been updated at all during Apple's latest PC event.  This could solve a crucial problem for many Apple users: price. The 13-inch MacBook Air was a solid entry-level machine that cost a thousand bucks, but is now too obsolete to recommend. On the other hand, the 13-inch Pro sans the Touch Bar costs $1,500 without bringing enough innovation, horsepower or ports (it only has 2 USB-C ports) to justify that price.   As always, none of this has been confirmed by Apple and is firmly in rumor territory. We expect a lot from Apple this year; hopefully the company makes the right news in its somewhat neglected PC department.  BONUS: This device fixes the worst thing about the new MacBook Pro Topics: Apple, Gadgets, kgi securities, Macbook Pro, ming-chi kuo, report, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

They will have disappeared into mergers, acquisitions or extinction.” This is not a new trend. According to the American Enterprise Institute, nearly 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies that existed in 1955 are no longer with us. Modern emphasis resides on the speed at which companies change and disappear. This has increased the corporate burn rate which is indeed running at high levels. Yet even here we are not in uncharted territory. A company from the first half of the twentieth century could expect a lifespan of at least fifty years. By the seventies, that had dropped to roughly thirty years. We can look to the seventies as the first definable major milestone in this trend. The rise of business machines, automation and other technologies were creating a new breed of company. Those were the years that saw the rise of Microsoft, Intel and other technology game-changers. The mainframe computer had graduated from high-end hardware used by militaries and governments to a mainstream business tool. Consumers were starting to enhance their lifestyles with cheap televisions, ATMs, microwaves, economical cars and a bevy of other innovations. The world was changing rapidly, and with it, companies rose and fell on their ability to respond. The eighties and nineties became the eras of rapid productivity. Based on US figures from the Heritage Foundation, productivity has doubled while the average hourly rate has declined from 1970 to 2010. This is both good and bad, but it illustrates with certainty, the impact of productivity technologies during the last decades of the twentieth century. From spreadsheets to e-mail to switchboards to fax machines to Enterprise Resource Planning suites: these were productivity’s catalysts. Eventually though, every pendulum has to reverse course. Those innovations started attracting complexity. In the early nineties you were lucky to get an e-mail a day. Today you are lucky if you can read a hundred e-mails and get through your daily workload. The same systems that have granted us more space to accomplish, have also grown bloated. This is not new either: the reason why technologies in the seventies boosted productivity is because they were replacing overwhelming complexity. Cumbersome The mainframe was so popular since it was a lot simpler to use than the boxes of punch cards demanded by older systems. Then it became cumbersome, eventually challenged by leaner desktop and server PCs. Today we are at that stage again. The stand-alone server is being replaced by the cloud. E-mail is being joined by collaboration suites and messenger apps. The spreadsheet is making way for dashboards and analytical machine learning. Why? Because complexity is at a saturation point and the world is demanding simplicity to drive new levels of productivity. It is important that we appreciate the nature and inevitability of the sea-change that companies are currently experiencing. Now to my point: your business processes have been born and honed through those productivity technologies. Your fax machine sits idle - all that has shifted to e-mail. If your e-mail ceases to function, several of your processes will grind to a halt. Thus, it is paramount that you take stock of your processes, consider what powers them, and see if there is a better way. Let’s consider the highly impactful example of data. Your company generates a lot of data, which until now, has likely languished in storage or was sent to the afterlife of deletion. But today data is a differentiator. Your ability to understand your data is crucial to your success, while the speed at which you access those insights defines your productivity. So it’s a simple question: are you making use of your data? There are many more examples: can the cloud improve the speed and expansion of your products? Can machine learning automate manual processes, freeing up your staff and time? How are you using mobile devices to empower your workforce and yourself? Do you understand the benefits of in-memory computing? Is there a role which technologies such as Blockchain can play in your organisation? What you are looking for is corporate cholesterol: the fatty bits that have started to narrow your company’s arteries. What are those processes and technologies that once made the enterprise’s heart beat, but now threaten to choke it off? Speed matters As a guideline, I can recommend three areas to consider. Firstly, look at how your customer experience drives your strategy. Customers are often familiar with innovations that make life easier. If you aren’t appealing to them, your processes are lagging. Secondly, don’t view your decision and the resulting transaction as separate entities. They feed from each other, so rather ponder on how you can enhance that relationship and learn from it. Thirdly, remember that data is the new centre of gravity, and speed matters. If your organisation is not responding as fast as your market expects it to, you need to address that. No such transition is easy. There are challenges in terms of security, regulation uncertainty, skill-sets, creating new mega-processes, disruption and more. But the only people who experience smooth sailing all the time are those who never leave the harbour. The storms of change cannot be avoided. However, they are key to ensuring business longevity.

It's also quiet, easy to manage and well thought out. If you need a four bay NAS, this is the leader in its class. It says something when NAS drives pack processors more commonly associated with laptops. While the Qnap TS-451+ doesn't have one of Intel's latest processors inside, there's nothing slow about its Celeron J1900 Bay Trail processor - running at 2GHz with a 2.4GHz burst speed, and partnered with 2GB of DDR3 RAM, it's primed for performance. And so it proved in our test. The Qnap hit average speeds of 107MB/sec when transferring meaty 4K video files, dropping down to 105MB/sec when writing. Even the small file tests that leave other NAS struggling didn't faze it, with its 46.6MB/sec write and 42.9MB/sec read speeds comfortably the fastest on test. There's more to this hefty four-bay NAS than performance, too. For a start, it's easy to get going. The drives install into solid pull-out caddies - you'll need to screw them into place - and these slip back into the unit with a satisfying click. Each drive has a label stuck to the side complete with QR code and nine-digit number; either scan the code or type the digits into the Qnap site, and the browser-based routine will do the rest. Alternatively, use Qnap's Qfinder Pro utility over the network to do the same job. The setup routine makes it pretty clear that the TS-451+ targets more expert users, with the upside being that options to set up a static network connection or configure the basic services are front and centre. You can create RAIDs in RAID0, 1, 5, 6, 10 and JBOD configurations, and enable 256-bit AES encryption on volumes, and the whole process is logical and thorough. Sure, there's a strong Linux feel to the desktop-style interface, but it makes it easy to find and install add-on apps or check the status of the disks and hardware. If you like reports and detailed status screens, the TS-451+ is NAS nirvana. You can even change the photo and welcome message on the login screen. Qnap was one of the first NAS manufacturers to push cloud-like features, and its Qsync module allows you to synchronise a Dropbox-style folder between the NAS and multiple PCs. The look and feel isn't quite as slick as Western Digital or Netgear's equivalents, but all the functionality is there, with files syncing quickly when added or modified. You can also access files on the NAS from your iOS or Android smartphone using the Qfile app, or manage many of the core features using another app, Qmanager. Meanwhile, the TS-451+ will happily work in tandem with a wide range of cloud services, including Amazon Cloud Drive, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box and Dropbox. A rich app library enables you to use the TS-451+ to download torrents, handle backups, serve Wikis, WordPress, Drupal and Joomla sites, or operate as a VPN or email server. You can also configure Plex or TwonkyMedia media servers, then use the TS-451+ as a Kodi media player. Not only does it have the requisite HDMI output, but also a bundled remote control. It proved effective as a media server and player in our tests, and can transcode 1080p and 4K video files on the fly for streaming to tablets or smartphones. While a good wireless connection at the device end is vital for smooth, artefact-free playback, the results are generally impressive. Qnap's claims that the TS-451+ can moonlight as a virtualisation platform or a PC might be a little ambitious - this is a Celeron-based NAS, not a Core i5 or Xeon server - but it has strong iSCSI support and it all goes to show just how versatile this NAS can be. Naturally, it still handles standard NAS tasks such as backup, either through Qnap's own rather basic NetBak Replicator app or Apple's Time Machine. This is a big and sometimes intimidating NAS, with lots of options and high-end features, excellent connectivity and server-room, not living-room, style. It's also quiet, easy to manage and well thought out. If you don't need four bays, the two-bay TS-251+ offers you the same features and specification with half the capacity for around £100 less. If you do, this is the leader in its class. This review originally appeared in PC Pro issue 261. Read more about NAS Cloud View the discussion thread.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple to update MacBook Pro lineup with Kaby Lake processors, 32 GB of RAM option for 15-inch model Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, January 17th, 2017, 05:56 Category: Hardware, MacBook Pro, Processors, Rumor As far as rumors go, this is pretty cool. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities released a new investors note today, stating that the current MacBook Pro lineup for 2017 will offer Intel’s latest Kaby Lake chipset along a new 32GB RAM option for the 15-inch model. Intel just announced its 7th generation Kaby Lake processors at CES and Kuo predicts that the first model that will see the upgraded chip will be the 12-inch MacBook. Mass production of that new machine will begin in Q2 of this year, according to Kuo, while a 16GB memory option will also be added to the device. It’s also been stated that the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro notebooks with Kaby Lake processors will enter production in Q3 of 2017. In terms of supply chain and shipping performance, Kuo predicts that Mac shipments will grow in 2017 and cites production delays as the main reason for the slow performance in 2017 as demand for the new Touch Bar MacBook Pro is apparently “better than expected.” Finally, it’s been noted that the 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar has performed worse than Apple expected. As a result, Kuo stated that Apple will cut the price of the machine in an effort to improve shipments. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

The problem is no matter what direction you investigate the hacks from, it always goes back to the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC. They are the responsible parties for the hacks that were done. Based on real evidence, the Clinton campaign and the DNC are never more than one connection away from the Ukrainian Intelligence operatives that claim their hack changed the course of world politics during the past months. How many hacks claim that laurel in 2016? This raises questions like why is the Clinton campaign working with a foreign government to change the course of the election? This assessment comes from the Clinton campaign and their hired hands as being the real result that the DNC hack caused. It's just that they didn't count on the possibility of going to trial for it themselves. If the Clinton campaign and the DNC are shown clearly to be working with a foreign country to influence the outcome of the election, should the country be sanctioned? By the end of this, the case is made that Ukraine should undergo every sanction that has been proposed for Russia. This is because their Intel services are clearly capable of and responsible for the hacking that Obama has laid at the feet of the Russian government. The hackers in question from the group KievHunta, RUH8 (Sean Townsend) should be investigated and extradited. Given the facts questions to the Clinton campaign and the DNC should include: How much information have you given these ultra-nationalist Pravy Sektor operatives? - Advertisement - How far does their reach go into US government networks? Why were you working with a cyber security firm (Crowdstrike) that has strong ties to Ukrainian terrorist groups like Pravy Sektor and was working for Ukrainian Intelligence? Is there an apparent conflict of interest? When did you know Crowdstrike's Russian attribution was based on poorly manufactured evidence? Why didn't you release that information publically? The reason for the second question is that contact with members of the Clinton campaign or DNC would have opened up members of Congress to the Ukrainian Intelligence/ neo-nazi hackers. The reason for the third question is that previously shown, Crowdstrike is tied at the hip to neo-nazi terrorists that make their living finding civilians to put on kill lists at Ukraine's notorious Peacemaker site. - Advertisement - The reason for the fourth question is that there is no longer any doubt that Crowdstrike fabricated the evidence it gave to the FBI and ODNI (Office of the Director of National Intelligence). The claim for attributing the cyber attack to Russia by Crowdstrike was based on the same hacker using the same tools to target Ukrainian artillerymen. These tools are supposed to be unique to this single hacking group. This is what makes the DNC hack and the Ukrainian artillery hack inseparable. Without one of them, the other didn't happen. That's why Crowdstrike blamed Russia for the DNC hack because Crowdstrike said Russia did the same thing to Ukrainian artillerymen using the same custom tools. Unless you are Dimitri Alperovitch, there just aren't many people that buy this lie anymore. Just to make this point embarrassingly clear to Dima Alperovitch, in an interview with Voice of America, Alperovitch claims to get artillery figures for Ukrainian losses from International Institute for Strategic Studies(IISS), a London-based think tank. It turns out that the one thing Dimitri Alperovitch is really good at is lying. Alperovitch did 2 interviews with US propaganda papers RFE/RL and VOA (Voice of America) one day apart from each other. RFE/RL carried the Crowdstrike story just like Alperovitch laid it out. VOA on the other hand fact checked and agreed with the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian military that the Alperovitch story about Russia hacking Ukrainian artillery positions was a lie.

The facts are clear. There was no Russian hack outside of information that the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign put out. Obama had no intelligence on the hacks until December and even then it was Crowdstrike's fake information. Was the hack to cover up the leak or was it to ratchet up anti-Russian sentiment?

I'll try to help do that. Submitted on Tuesday, Jan 17, 2017 at 2:37:05 PM     (11+)   David William Pear Editor (Member since Nov 29, 2014), 26 fans, 36 articles, 145 quicklinks, 1796 comments, 1 diaries    I wonder what Obama's dog and pony show said to Sanders at their meeting back in June. Bernie came out swinging for his revolution and then fell in line backing Clinton (YouTube). After the Democratic convention Sanders and his supporters got a pat on the back for "the most progressive platform in history". Then he played pied piper to try and get his followers to follow him to Clinton's voting booth. In a week the media had forgotten about the "most progressive platform in history" and so had everybody else. It did not take a Sherlock Holmes to know that the DNC, MIC, Wall Street, media and oligarchs were backing Clinton during the primaries. What was shocking and worse than Watergate was that Wikileaks released email leaks that proved the DNC just didn't put their thumb on the scale, they sat their fat butts right down on it. The emails proved that Clinton stole the nomination, it was a co-conspiracy and election fraud---I suppose that is a crime? The Russian bear ate my homework and pooped on the floor was the only thing Clinton-bots could come up with because they could not deny the validity of the emails and they did not even try. Bernie and his supporters had the nomination stolen from him. Where was the outcry? Where is Bernie now, where are his supporters, the feds the media? Chasing Russian ghosts instead of the real criminals, Clinton & Co. The course of history has been changed no less than if they had assassinated Sanders and lined all his agitators against the wall. Hell, they wouldn't have even needed to give them a cigarette and a blindfold. There has been a coup d'e'tat and nobody seems to care. Eliason makes the case that the conspiracy to cover up the coup is very deep and wide. They have gotten away with mass murder figuratively and literally. The media buried the corpus delicti.

Dollars to donuts they did the same thing to him as they are doing right now. Sanders was accused of "breaching" a firewall that separated his campaign info from Clintons. He agreed to a 3rd party expert look by crowdstrike. He was sanctioned by the DNC. Sanders was done after that. His supporters carried his political corpse to the convention.

I had forgotten about the "Sanders Hack". Sanders got blamed for looking at a "glitch" caused by the DNC. I admit I don't understand all the computer technicality, but sound like when Tanya Brawley smeared feces all over herself and then blamed "white racists". This time in my simple mind, are you saying the DNC smeared feces all over their computer and then blamed Sanders and the Russians? P.S. I know a little about these private security contractors and would never believe their findings. They are incompetent mercenaries, frauds and liars...even worse than the CIA.

I had also totally forgotten about the DNC accusing Sanders of hacking. This all has the smell of a rat and according to many pieces out there it seems to be a Ukrainian operative who was working for the DNC at the time, her name escapes me for some reason..

GNOME Developer On GTK4: State-of-the-Art of Toolkit Support Written by Michael Larabel in GNOME on 17 January 2017 at 07:39 AM EST. 37 Comments GNOME developer Georges Stavracas has shared his thoughts on the state of the GTK4 tool-kit with the recent work involving a Vulkan renderer, including which also now works on Wayland. Georges Stavracas was excited to try the current state of GTK4 development but initially hit a segmentation fault. But after overcoming that, he was successful in running GTK4 on Wayland and the widgets being rendered by Vulkan. He commented on his blog, "May not be as exciting, since there are no new visible features but… damn, it’s Gtk+ being rendered with Vulkan on Wayland. It’s basically the state-of-the-art of toolkit support right now. Even better, the absolute majority of applications will gain this for free once they port to Gtk+ 4 series." He also pointed out that Vulkan's validation layers have already proved useful in finding an Intel Vulkan driver bug with GTK4. From a technical perspective, I too am excited for GTK4 due to the Vulkan renderer and it being faster than OpenGL among other advantages and just being the latest and fun tech. Hopefully we'll see Qt soon picking up a Vulkan renderer, after all with Qt 5.8 they are having an experimental Direct3D 12 back-end to Qt Quick. The Qt Company did join Khronos and after the graphics stack improvements in Qt 5.8, hopefully it won't be too long before seeing Qt Vulkan rendering, though the Qt 5.9 feature freeze is just around the corner so it won't happen for that release. (There have been some Qt Vulkan experiments such as this Git branch for experimenting with Vulkan-rendered content into a QWindow.) 37 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

In a recently released report, GE and co-author Intel offer a comprehensive view of how the Industrial Internet - embedded sensors, data analytics and connected platforms-  are helping companies increase their productivity and reducing environmental emissions to securing a cleaner and more competitive future. “We are working closely with our partners in the region, such as Masdar, Saudi Aramco, and RasGas, among others, some of the first adopters of digital solutions, to support regional economies in achieving their energy and economic diversification goals. This is part of a larger movement that includes both large companies, and start-ups, from across the industrial and tech sectors, working together on innovation and implementation to realize the dramatic economic and environmental potential of digital efficiency,” said Deb Frodl, Global Executive Director of GE Ecomagination. Overarching report findings on digital efficiency: Emerging digital solutions applied across industry can potentially save US$81 billion in fuel costs annually and close the gap to reaching the COP21 goals by 30 per cent or 823 MT of carbon emissions per year, the equivalent of taking 174 million cars off the road. The key economic and environmental impact of digitization were identified as: Power - US$14 billion in cost savings annually and a potential reduction in global carbon by 495 Mt/year Lighting – US$30 billion in saving, and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction Aviation- US$14 billion in annual saving and 45 MT/year in carbon reduction Railway – US$3 billion in saving and 19MT/year in carbon reduction Ground transportation – US$20 billion in saving and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction GE has been working with its partners on digital industrial technologies that help achieve enhanced productivity, efficiency and asset optimization. For example, RasGas Company Limited (RasGas), one of the world’s largest and pioneering producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is marking the first global deployment of Industrial Internet technologies in the LNG sector. In the UAE, Masdar is working with GE to pilot and commercialize sustainable energy-neutral advanced wastewater treatment solutions in the MENAT region, and co-develop Industrial Internet solutions to optimize efficiencies. GE is also working with Masdar to launch a co-leadership training program for women to drive innovation and talent development in the renewable energy sector. In aviation, GE Aviation and Dubai’s Museum of the Future have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to accelerate innovation and advanced technology around the world. In Saudi Arabia, GE has announced several new digital industrial partnerships, technologies and initiatives. The GE Saudi Technology & Innovation Center (GE STIC) in Dhahran Techno Valley is at the heart of the company’s ‘Industrial Internet’ roadmap to drive digital transformation of industry. GE Oil & Gas Digital is introducing its first Asset Performance Management (APM) solution to reside on Saudi Aramco’s business network for the Aramco Jazan Complex Integrated Manufacturing Operations Management System (IMOMS). Saudi Electricity Company has joined hands with GE, and established a Generation & Optimization Center (GOC), a state-of-the-art center equipped with hardware and software to monitor 16 SEC power plants. In lighting, Current, which brings together capabilities from GE’s LED, Solar, Energy Storage, and electric vehicle businesses, is enabling its partners in MENA to tap into a wide variety of GE offerings and optimize their energy needs across their entire operation. GE’s Industrial Internet operating system, Predix, is playing a pivotal role in providing a foundation for a range of digital solutions that improve energy and water efficiency across aviation, railways, ground transportation, manufacturing facilities, power plants and buildings. The report draws on the experience of GE’s Ecomagination business strategy to deploy sustainable solutions that provide economic and environmental outcomes. Contributions to the white paper also came from the GE Ecomagination Innovation Center in Masdar City, where GE’s professionals work with UAE-based researchers and industry experts to identify sustainable solutions for today’s pressing challenges.  The white paper can be downloaded at: www.gereports.com. Copies of the white paper can also be collected at GE’s booth at WFES 2017, where the company is showcasing its advanced suite of digital solutions to support a greener future. -Ends- About GE: GE (NYSE: GE) is the world’s Digital Industrial Company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive.  GE is organized around a global exchange of knowledge, the "GE Store," through which each business shares and accesses the same technology, markets, structure and intellect.

PHOTO: AFP PublishedJan 17, 2017, 6:27 pm SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4W6K Copy HANOI (AFP) - Vietnam is courting high-tech Japanese investment and wants Tokyo to become its top investor, its premier said on Tuesday (Jan 17) during a visit by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan is the second largest foreign investor in communist Vietnam, a manufacturing hub in southeast Asia seeking to expand exports from apparel and agriculture to high-value good like electronics and automobiles. "Vietnam wants Japan to become the top investor in Vietnam," Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said on Tuesday (Jan 17) at a business forum co-hosted by Mr Abe and attended by company tycoons from both sides. Vietnam has become a fierce competitor to regional neighbours like Thailand, Malaysia, China and Taiwan in tech manufacturing. Electronic giants like Panasonic, Samsung, Foxconn and Intel have all made significant investments, taking advantage of Vietnam's comparatively cheap but increasingly well-educated and youthful workforce. Ties between Tokyo and Hanoi have warmed in recent years, and the world's No. 3 economy has invested heavily in Vietnam as growth back home has been dragged down by a greying and shrinking population. The Asian allies have also cosied up in the face of separate disputes with regional powerhouse China over disputed territory in regional contested waters. Japanese firms are currently involved in more than 3,000 projects worth roughly US$42 billion (S$59.65 billion) in Vietnam, mostly in the manufacturing sector. It is the leading investor in Vietnam after South Korea. Tokyo is also looking for new markets to sell major construction projects to. Mr Abe called on Vietnam to "continue supporting Japanese enterprises (and) listening to experiences from Japanese companies in high-tech areas". He said earlier that investments would focus on "projects to upgrade high quality infrastructure". The leaders did not outline specific areas of investment, but officials said earlier that Japan was interested in high-speed railway projects and airport infrastructure. Earlier during Mr Abe's two-day trip, officials said Japan's Mitsubishi is investing in a thermal power plant in Vietnam's central Ha Tinh province. Members of Vietnam's business community welcomed the push towards high-tech at the meeting, which was attended by several Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi, Canon and Fukuyama Transporting. "(It) will surely contribute to improving the quality of life in Vietnam," Mr Nguyen Hoang, chief executive of Vietnam's N&G Investment, told AFP. Vietnam, an authoritarian one-party state, has become a hot spot for private investment in recent years, especially in manufacturing and consumer sectors. Foreign investment shot up 9 per cent last year compared to the year before, hitting a record US$15.8 billion. Though growth has remained relatively strong in recent years, its GDP rose 6.2 per cent last year, down from 2015 and falling shy of its growth target of between 6.7 and 7 per cent. Mr Abe visited Philippines, Australia and Indonesia on his six-day tour of Asia-Pacific before his final stop in Vietnam. He said on Monday (Jan 16) that Japan would provide six new patrol vessels to Vietnam as he called for maritime security in Asia.

 Apple's MacBooks could get an internal upgrade this year that doubles the maximum memory James Cook Jan. 17, 2017, 4:16 AM 4,039 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple's laptop lineup could get more powerful this year.Glenn3095/Flickr (PD) Respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks said in a new note to investors on Monday that Apple's MacBook lineup could be upgraded to use Intel's new Kaby Lake processors. The laptops could also see maximum RAM double, according to Apple Insider. Right now Apple's high-end laptop line, the MacBook Pro, comes in two sizes: 13-inch and 15-inch screens. Kuo says that in Q4, Apple will start making a new 15-inch MacBook Pro that will come with up to 32GB of RAM. Currently MacBooks only support up to 16GB of RAM, but Kuo says that will double in the next generation of MacBook Pros. Phil Schiller, Apple's SVP of worldwide marketing, has previously defended Apple's decision to cap memory at 16GB, saying "to support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life." Apple's new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.AP As well as a new high-end laptop, Kuo also reportedly says in his note that Apple will produce new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros in Q3. He also expects Apple to begin producing a 12-inch MacBook in Q2. It will reportedly have the same design, but its memory will also double from a maximum of 8GB to a new limit of 16GB. Kuo also says that Apple has seen higher than expected demand for its new MacBook Pro laptops with Touch Bar, a touchscreen above the keyboards that can be used to control the laptops. Demand is, apparently, "better than expected" for the devices, and manufacturing capacity has been increased by 50%. Apple also released a version of the new MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar. That didn't sell so well, Kuo said, and he expects Apple to discount that model. Kuo is a reliable source of news for future Apple products. The analyst, who lives in Taiwan, has sources close to Apple's supply chain who have given accurate descriptions in the past of what products the company is working on.

Apple to launch updated MacBook Pro with 32GB of RAM? by Luke Johnson 17 January 2017 0 shares Read Comments It’s only been a couple of months since Apple radically redesigned its MacBook Pro line, but already rumours are circulating around the next update. According to industry analysts, 2017 will see the new look MacBook Pro given a sizeable specs boost, with 32GB of RAM even being slotted into the top of the line model. The claims, which come courtesy of reputed Apple tipster, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, suggest all Mac models will be updated in 2017. As part of the refresh, Intel’s new 7th generation Kaby Lake processors will be slotted into the high-end machines. This revamp will reportedly begin with the 12-inch MacBook in Q2, with the MacBook Pro to follow in Q3 - that’s between July 1 and September 30. Related: MacBook Pro vs MacBook Air: Which should you buy? According to Kuo, the desktop-rivalling 32GB of RAM will be reserved for a new 15-inch iteration of the MacBook Pro. It’s unclear whether the 13-inch model will remain capped at 8GB of RAM or move up to 16GB. Although Apple’s Phil Schiller recently explained the company’s decision to cap its current MacBook Pros at 16GB of RAM was in an effort to preserve battery life, the increased internals will reportedly be introduced to satisfy high-end users. The MacBook Pro was given a ground-up overhaul late last year, with the high-end machine on the receiving end of a dramatic redesign. As well as becoming slimmer than a MacBook Air and impressively light, the machine added an innovative new Touch Bar interface system. The touch-friendly OLED panel sits atop the laptop’s keyboard in place of the traditional function keys. Reacting to what’s on the main screen, it offers a variety of shortcuts and app-enhancing features. WATCH: MacBook Pro 13 2016 Touch Bar Tips & Tricks Is 32GB of RAM on a laptop overkill?

Ga verder Meer informatie Software-update: DC++ 0.864 Door Bart van Klaveren, dinsdag 17 januari 2017 08:39, 33 reacties • Feedback Bron: DC++, submitter: sambalbaj Het is een tijdje stil geweest rondom DC++, maar sinds enkele maanden lijkt de ontwikkeling weer te zijn opgepakt. DC++ is een van de vele programma's om bestanden via het Direct Connect-netwerk uit te wisselen. Het programma dankt de twee plussen in zijn naam aan C++, waarin het is geschreven. Het pakket wordt door Jacek Sieka ontwikkeld en is een opensourcevariant van de originele Neomodus Direct Connect-client. In versie 0.864 is onder meer een stabiliteitsprobleem aangepakt. De complete changelog sinds versie 0.850 kan hieronder worden gevonden. Changes in version DC++ 0.864 DC++ 0.864, along with changes in share filtering and an addition of testing notifications, fixes a stability issue regarding processing of search results. The issue is introduced in the previous release so immediate upgrade for users running version 0.863 is highly recommended. Changes in version DC++ 0.863 DC++ 0.863, along with minor changes, fixes a stability issue in the 32-bit builds. Furthermore it contains additional optimizations for the benefit of users running DC++ on 32-bit operating systems. DC++ needs SSE3 support from this release on which means it requires Intel Core or AMD A64 X2 or newer CPUs to run. Some steppings of older processors will still work though. Immediate upgrade for users running 32-bit operating systems is highly recommended. Changes in version 0.861: Update to GCC 6.2 & boost 1.61 Build with SSE2 support, Intel P4 / AMD A64 or newer CPU required to run 32-bit builds Update OpenSSL to version 1.0.2j [L#1626741] Fix some connectivity settings not being loaded / saved Scroll through tabs via Ctrl+PageUp / Ctrl+PageDown Changes in version 0.860: Switch feasible http links to https [L#1451223] Added support for a HTTP downloader in the plugin interface [L#1353402] Added option to autostart DC++ when Windows starts [L#1265578] Added toolbar to download queue Better security and certs related settings layout [L#1262319] Add option to quick-check encrypted hubs in search frame [L#1494809] Fix chat tab selection on Windows 10 [L#1506210] Improve IPv6 connectivity & add more settings Show list of available network interfaces for binding; add IPv6 binding setting Add setting for external IPv6 addresses to be used for specific favorite hubs and hub groups Drop Windows XP support, Vista is the minimum Windows version required to run DC++ from now Add system memory size information to the crashlog [L#236056] Add search options to right click menu in the notepad [L#1435007] Fix /clear-command scrolling problem [L#1473791] Added support to specify encoding in NMDC (favorite) hubs [L#264208] Add max extra slots option Add safeguarding for notification balloons (might fix some odd crashes?)

Reageer +1 terracide 17 januari 2017 08:48 Missschien wat offtopic maar dit is toch niet anoniem? Ik heb dit heel veel jaar geleden gebruikt. Maar in deze tijd lijkt me dat niet iets wat je moet gebruiken voor autheursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal? Niet dat ik dat nu wil gaan doen maar ik vraag me gewoon af wat het bestaansrecht is van dit soort applicaties. Toen usenet opkwam was het eigenlijk het einde van deze tool. [Reactie gewijzigd door terracide op 17 januari 2017 08:50] Reageer +1 Mirved @terracide • 17 januari 2017 08:54 Usenet was toch al populair lang voor DC++? Torrents zijn toch ook niet anoniem en worden ook massaal gebruikt? Denk juist doordat DC++ niet meer zo veel gebruikt wordt de pakkans enorm laag is. Geen grote vis om achteraan te gaan. Reageer +1 terracide @Mirved • 17 januari 2017 08:56 pakkans en aan aanbod is laag maar ik zie het gewoon niet helemaal. Usenet was nog lang niet zo groot als daarna. DC++ is uit de tijd van Napster en die andere sharingtools. [Reactie gewijzigd door terracide op 17 januari 2017 09:03] Reageer +1 rbr320 @terracide • 17 januari 2017 09:10 Ik neem aan dat je specifiek op "binary newsgroups" doelt, want usenet in zijn geheel is toch echt al veel ouder dan DC++ Op lan parties is DC++ nog steeds populair als file sharing methode omdat je in 1 keer kunt zoeken bij alle peers in het netwerk. Bovendien heeft het protocol zelf weinig overhead. Reageer +1 Chadi @Mirved • 17 januari 2017 10:03 In die tijd gebruikten alleen echte tweakers usenet. Toen was er nog alleen Xpat .. alle headers binnen halen voordat je wist wat er was. Met de komst van newsleecher werd het wat makkelijker en met de komst van spotters werd het echt groot. DC++ was toen al populair. Vooral als je toen ADSL had. Je kreeg aan de hand van je upload toegang tot bepaalde servers. Reageer +1 nobraininvolved @Mirved • 17 januari 2017 11:59 Nee joh, Dit is uit de tijd dat Usenet wel bestond maar alleen voor de 'grote jongens' was...Torrents waren ook nog niet publiekelijk bekend...er gebeurde veel via sftp op prive servers. Het riedeltje vroeger was: er werd iets 'gevonden', dan via sftp servers over en weer gestuurd, daarna kwam het wss op Usenet, daarna op torrents en daarna was er wel iemand in de DC++ hub die het deelde. Mooie old school applicatie het werkt als volgt: Je hebt allemaal 'kamertjes' waarin leden zitten. Dit kan varieren van 1 lid tot een paar duizend. Die leden delen spullen vanaf hun eigen harddisk. Andere leden kunnen vervolgens zoeken in de spullen van alle leden van een kamertje. Ik ben zelf een hele tijd administrator geweest van zo'n kamertje. Het is ondoenlijk om alle shares van alle leden te controleren op illegale content. We hadden we iets aan scriptjes om bv. kinderporno op te sporen en te kunnen verwijderen, maar zodra iemand een naam wijzigde, was het out of scoop (veel handwerk dus wat inhoudt: verdacht materiaal zelf downen en actief bekijken). Hoe dat nu gaat, weet ik niet. memory lane Reageer +1 meezcore @terracide • 17 januari 2017 08:56 Volgens mij is niets anoniem zolang je geen anonieme VPN dienst gebruikt, die ook nog eens gevestigd is buiten Europa en Amerika.

Reageer +1 Roelof @Terrestrial • 17 januari 2017 12:24 Of DC++ het al heeft weet ik niet, maar een redelijk aantal private servers gebruikt tegenwoordig AirDC++ en die heeft wel encryptie. Reageer +1 Hakker @Terrestrial • 17 januari 2017 14:37 NMDC (PtoraX, Ynhub, OpenDC, Verlihub) tussen client en server iig niet.

Reageer +1 dunpealhunter 17 januari 2017 08:50 wow, dit bestaat nog? ik herinner mij nog dat ik in 2001 toen ik voor het eerst internet kreeg dit programma gebruikte om mijn eerste illegale download te doen: Eminem - My Name Is Aaaaahh nostalgie momentje..... Reageer +1 Primuszoon @dunpealhunter • 17 januari 2017 08:55 Wij gebruikten dit 10 jaar geleden op onze locale LAN parties onder vrienden, ging veel efficiënter dan Windows bestandsdelen (als dit al uberhaupt werkte). Prachtige tool, maar nooit gebruikt om online data te downloaden. Reageer +1 MadEgg System en netwerk utilities @Primuszoon • 17 januari 2017 10:13 Hier ook, maar met dank aan snellere internetverbindingen en Steam, Battle.net Launcher, GOG Galaxy en dergelijke launchers, en Spotify en Netflix voor de media, is de noodzaak er steeds minder - dat wat nog wel gedeeld moet worden gaat meestal via USB-sticks omdat de aanwezig een DC++ client configureren te veel werk vinden tegenwoordig. Reageer +1 goarilla @MadEgg • 17 januari 2017 10:59 Tja, Terabytes TTHashen duurt wel even . Reageer +1 Mirved @dunpealhunter • 17 januari 2017 08:51 Ik dacht precies hetzelfde. Wist niet dat dit nog bestond. Reageer +1 Barryke 17 januari 2017 10:55 Kan iemand een DC++ Hub aanraden? Om zelf te hosten voor vrienden? Reageer +1 Hakker @Barryke • 17 januari 2017 14:14 Om er zelf 1 te hosten. Heb je Ptokax, OpenDC, Verlihub en Ynhub als voornaamste opties. [Reactie gewijzigd door Hakker op 17 januari 2017 14:32] Reageer +1 Wallus 17 januari 2017 09:01 Wow een blast from the past! misschien toch maar weer eens poging wagen.ik weet nog dat ik altijd uit de interessante groepen gegooid werd, omdat mijn snelheid te laag was of het aantal gedeelde gb ook niet genoeg was. Reageer +1 TheNephilim 17 januari 2017 09:50 De laatste keer dat ik dit weer eens bekeken heb was er weinig interessants te vinden. Oude bende en van lage kwaliteit. Toch inderdaad een leuke manier van sharing en natuurlijk 100% nostalgie. Reageer +1 goarilla 17 januari 2017 11:13 Het had en heeft wel iets DC. Toen bittorrent nog jong was (~2003) verkoos ik het nog regelmatig omdat de superseeds lang op zich lieten wachten. Terwijl je in DC actief probeerden om nieuwere snellere "seeders" te vinden (BB, Telia, ...) en daar meestal wel in slaagden. Als je dan nog een superieure client had (dcgui-qt/valknut) die eenzelfde bestand kon downloaden van verschillende gebruikers was de pret helemaal compleet. Je kon dan actief de snelste uploaders cherrypicken voor je bestand. Er waren ook veel topic specifieke hubs waar je uniek materiaal kon vinden. Psytrance/goa muziek vond je bij PsyIsrael, ... en die oude Ovide afleveringen van weleer vond je op "[NL] Hollands Hope". Reageer +1 rick_roox 17 januari 2017 12:24 DC++ wordt nog veel gebruikt op LAN parties zoals Campzone.

According to the report in AppleInsider, Apple’s 2017 laptop line will focus on internal component updates, notably platform-wide adoption of Intel’s Kaby Lake architecture. Essentially, the Intel Skylake CPUs used in Apple’s MacBook Pro only support up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Apple is also predicted to start manufacturing of a 15-inch MacBook Pro with up to 32GB of RAM in the fourth quarter. Beyond the high-end 15-inch model, Apple is expected to start production of new 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pros in the third quarter of 2017. Cupertino-based Apple in October introduced the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever with Touch Bar. The MacBook Pro features sixth-generation quad-core and dual-core processors, up to 2.3 times the graphics performance over the previous generation, super-fast SSDs and up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 per cent thinner and has 20 per cent less volume than before, and weighing just 1.83 kg is nearly half a pound lighter. The 15-inch MacBook Pro, also features Touch Bar and Touch ID, a 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.5GHz, 16GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. The 13-inch MacBook Pro features a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar and Touch ID features a 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage.

AppleInsider reported that the updated 15-inch laptop will go into production in Q4 2017. One of the gripes MacBook fans had with the recently-released Pro model was a maximum RAM configuration of 16GB – which could potentially restrict its professional use. “Kuo speculates the company will be forced to adopt desktop RAM due to restrictions of current memory system designs,” stated the report. Kuo also expects Apple to start production of new 13-inch and 15-inch models not aimed at the top end of the range.

In 2017, they're way past it. Not to worry. If you'd rather play your Wii games in stunning HD - and trust us, they look stunning - then all you need to do is follow these simple steps. While you can't play Wii games in HD on the actual console, no matter what kind of snake oil you're being promised, you can play them in HD on your PC. How? Simple. Using a program called Dolphin, one of the most popular and accessible emulators around. What Dolphin does is simulate the workings of a Wii (or GameCube) on your PC, turning it into the prettiest and most powerful Nintendo console you've ever seen. Getting Started To get started, you're going to need a program called Rawdump, version 2.1. You're also going to need to make sure your disc drive is compatible with the program, as not all are. The following DVD Drives are not supported to dump Wii or Gamecube Games: SONY DVD RW DW-G120A, NEC/SONY Optiarc DVD RW AD-7173A, Optiarc DVD RW AD-7200A,TSSTcorp DVD-ROM SH-D163B, TSSTcorpDVD-ROM SH-D163BSB00, TSSTcorp CD/DVDW SH-W162L, TSSTcorp CDDVDW TS-H653B FS01,TSSTcorp DVD-ROM SH-D162C, OFOD SHMBO5U381, Pioneer dvd-rw DR-TD08HB, ATAPI DVD A DH16AASH SA15,ATAPI DVD A DH20A65 7P56, ATAPI DVD A DH20A4P 95P9, LG HL-DT-ST BDDVDRW CH08LS10, TSSTcorp CDDVDW SH-S223Q, HL-DT-ST DVD-RW GWA-4082N, TSSTcorpCDRWDVD TS-H493BD200, HL-DT-ST DVD-RAM GH22LP20. Known DVD Drives that are supported: LG 8161B, LG 8162B, LG 8163B, LG 8164B, LG GH20NS15, Optiarc DVD RW AD-7203A, HL-DT-ST DVD-ROM GDR8161B. What this does is let you drop your Wii (or GameCube) disc into your PC's disc drive and "rip" the content off it. This is important because you won't be playing the game off the disc, you'll be playing it off the "image" of the disc that you get using the program and save to your PC. Drop the disc in, click "START DUMP", and when it's done you'll be left with a file ending in .Wii or .Wod. Select the file, click "CONVERT RAW TO .ISO", and you'll be left with an .iso file, which is what Dolphin needs to run. Now that we have the game ready, we need to get Dolphin so we can actually run it. Make sure you get the right one for your operating system (it runs on Windows, Linux and Intel-based Macs). After it's downloaded, boot it up. The Settings A lot of emulators out there are complex, arcane affairs, but one of the reasons Dolphin is so popular is that it's relatively simple to understand and easy to use. There are five big buttons that contain most of the settings you'll ever need to mess with, and those buttons, as you can see, are pretty self-explanatory. However, it isn't perfect. It isn't a plug-and-play affair. You'll need to mess around with a lot of the graphics and performance settings to get things running to a level that either suits you or to which your PC can handle. And yes, the better your PC, the better: Because you're only emulating a Wii or GameCube, it can be quite a strain on your processor, so if you have an older or weaker PC you may need to dial the settings down a bit. Because these settings will vary from user to user, and even from game to game, I'm not going to list them here. Feel free to tinker with them yourself, or visit the super-friendly Dolphin forums for more specific guidelines. The Hardware Because you're playing on a PC, you can entirely customise the way the games are controlled. Dolphin lets users individually select each button press and axis of movement, so if you'd like to use a keyboard, control pad or combination of the two, you can. For GameCube (and some Wii) games, all you'll really need to do is plug in a control pad, configure the settings (just click on the big GCPAD or WIIMOTE buttons) and you're off. For Wii games, though, you have some choices. While it's possible to play games using the keyboard, control pad and mouse to replicate the movements of a Wii controller, it's a shoddy workaround. The best way to play Wii games, especially those like Skyward Sword which require MotionPlus, is to use your actual Wii controller. To get one running on your PC, you'll need two things: A Bluetooth adaptor (if your PC or Mac doesn't already have the capability) and a wireless sensor bar. Some people will say you don't need the latter, but it will save you a lot of hassle. The Bluetooth adaptor lets you sync your Wii controller to your PC so it can read its movements, and using a wireless sensor bar means all you need to do is take the bar away from your console and put it under your monitor instead. Get them running and bam, you have the perfect Wii control system, right in front of your PC. Get Playing! Now that you're all set up, it's time to play! Click on the yellow "OPEN" folder icon on Dolphin's main dashboard and browse to the .iso file you got from your Wii disc. Select it then, gods willing, your game should start up and look amazing. If it doesn't, or if there are glitches, or the controller isn't working, or something else goes wrong, relax. Like I said, this isn't plug-and-play. Most games usually take a little fine-tuning to get working, and once again, the best place for advice on specific games (since some can be a little twitchy in Dolphin) is to head to that title's thread on the Dolphin forums. And that does it! Hopefully those of you who have enjoyed their copies of Skyward Sword, or any other big Wii game recently (Okami and Mario Galaxy come highly recommended), can now go back and enjoy them all over again, only this time in shiny HD. Ditto for your GameCube collections as well, as Wind Waker looks amazing.

Just like if you were to copy a video or DVD from said rental shop. Of course that doesn't necessarily mean you can't return them guilt-free, that's a matter entirely for your own moral compass.

Reply 2 WiseHacker @wisehacker Jan 17, 2017, 5:04pm ^ This ^ That point has been used successfully by the likes of Sony and others since the 90s to successfully shut down emulation products.

Reply 0 fenix @fenix Jan 18, 2017, 10:06am Yeah, good luck with that lol. I'm sure they want it gone but if people are smart enough to create these emulators then they're smart enough to keep this content alive through many avenues, it would be a pointless exercise. Reply 0 Gooky @mrtaco Jan 17, 2017, 5:20pm Just from a quick google it sounds like you don't necessarily need that to run it? Or at least it's not provided with the emulator and you need to get it through some alternative means if you want to enable it. Was curious since some of the stuff that's come up about the bad blood between the Dolphin devs and the DolphinVR dev made it sound like the kind of thing they wouldn't be doing (they were militantly standing by the terms of the GPL and claiming the inclusion Oculus runtime libraries contradicts that, or something). Reply 0 moabboy @moabboy Jan 17, 2017, 4:37pm Good luck finding a video rental store, let alone Wii games in it. Reply 3 benredbeard @benredbeard Jan 18, 2017, 7:59am Hahahaha yeah thats true Reply 0 cubits @cubits Jan 17, 2017, 3:58pm Can recommend the mayflash dolphin bar for setting up the controllers. It's incredibly easy, and surprisingly versatile! I have one hooked up which I use for wii games, my wireless arcade sticks (in SFV, GG, Fightcade), psx lightgun games (point blank on an lcd TV!), and for playing guild wars 2 from my couch.

The renowned analyst from KGI is predicting that this year’s generation of MacBook Pros will finally break through the 16 GB RAM limit. While 32 GB on a “professional” computer might seem normal these days, that has actually become a sore topic with the late 2016 models as Apple refused to go any further, sacrificing power for the sake of longer battery life and portability. It is sadly both a matter of physics as well as marketing and there was no compromise to be made based on last year’s technology. MacBook Pro users, particularly those that use the computer for video editing, wanted more than 16 GB RAM to use. Apple, however, was limited by both technology and its product goals. On the one hand, Apple wanted to be able to boast about how its MacBook Pros remained petite and light, relatively speaking, while still maintaining long hours of battery life, which some are contesting anyway. More RAM would have sucked the life out of the MacBook Pros, not to mention stealing some precious space from the battery. This is mostly due to the limitations of current technology, as Intel’s notebook chipsets didn’t support anything more than 16 GB LPDDR3. While LPDDR4 does exist, it isn’t supported yet. The market, however, might force Apple’s hands this year given the large outcry for 32 GB RAM MacBook Pros. If Intel doesn’t catch up with support, Apple will be forced to use the desktop-class DDR4 memory type. While more powerful, it is also more energy-hungry and will inevitably incur penalties in other places. Along with a 32 GB RAM model, Kuo believes that Apple will also update the ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB. While 8 GB was still on par with ultraportables back when it launched in 2015, it will become a liability and maybe even a butt of jokes if a 2nd gen this year launches with still that little RAM.

The noted analyst says the new notebooks will feature Intel’s next-generation Kaby Lake processors and updated RAM options. Kuo says the refreshed 12-inch MacBook models will enter mass production as early as March, and may offer a new 16GB RAM option (currently capped off at 8GB). As for the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models, he doesn’t see production starting until early third quarter. Interestingly, Kuo’s note also mentions that Apple is planning a “15-inch MacBook” with 32GB of RAM  for later in the year—possibly Q4. He believes the RAM will be “desktop class” to satisfy high-end users, but other than that and faster processors, they’ll be very similar to the 2016 models. Apple received quite a bit of backlash for its latest MacBook Pro release. While the laptop features the new Touch Bar/Touch ID support, it also lacks legacy ports, a 32GB RAM option, and has a higher price tag than previous models. It’ll be interesting to see how the company responds in future updates.

The inputs related to the planning of the terror outfits were received by the intelligence agencies that have been keeping a tight vigil on the movements of these outfits. According to highly-placed sources in the Intel agencies, specific inputs have been received that these outfits including Hizbul Mujahideen (HuM), Lashkar-e-Tayiba (LeT), Indian Mujahideen (IM), Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) are hatching a plot to launch a terror attack in various parts of the country at one-time.  Inspired by the terror strikes of ISIS, the banned terror outfits in India are plotting 'Nice-style' lone-wolf attack to sabotage the Republic Day celebrations (pictured - terror attack in Nice) Another input reveals that the militants may try and target the Parliament, too.  'Heavy vehicles could be used deliberately to be driven into crowds to kill maximum number of people like Nice (France) attack,' one of the inputs reveals. The security forces have been informed and instructed to keep a tight vigil on movements of heavy vehicles. Also, the forces have been planning to prohibit the entry of the heavy vehicles for at least a day or two, sources said.  Recently, after the NIA busted an ISIS module that had planned a Nice-style attack in Kerala, it was learnt that as many as 30 radicalised men were actively recruiting terror sympathisers from across the country using Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  Meanwhile, senior officials said after demonetisation, terror fundings along with hawala transaction have remained as major hit. Paramilitary soldiers take position as they cordon off the area near the government building, Jammu and Kashmir 'They have activated the sleeper cells and sympathisers.

the indispensable need of every individual to remain healthy, the healthcare sector has been a key element in the overall growth of society and economy. With the ever increasing global population that currently stands at 7.4 billion, healthcare management is a primary challenge as more and more people become aware about fitness and health. In order to address this challenge, the industry is obligated to revise, restructure and improve its services and methodologies. The trend has recently shifted towards the adoption of a more proactive approach in healthcare; this is being achieved by focusing on early detection of any / all adverse health conditions and implementing preventive measures. A blend of information technology within healthcare sector has resulted in several revolutionary developments for personalized healthcare. Examples of such innovations include genome sequencing, use of robots in healthcare and remote patient monitoring; in fact, smart wearables form a key component of remote patient monitoring while offering several associated benefits. Defined as wearables that contain active electronics such as sensors, audio / video feedback mechanisms and data processing / transmission capabilities, smart wearables are becoming quite popular amongst the masses. Such wearables allow an individual to monitor and share critical insights on his / her health with the physician without having to visit a healthcare professional. These wearables are generally classified as smart wrist wearables, smart patches, smart clothes, smart head / neck wear and smart ear / eye wearables while their applications span across activity / fitness tracking, monitoring & diagnostics, therapy and other areas. At present, smart wrist wearables dominate the market with presence of a large variety of wearables, primarily for activity / fitness tracking. Several start-ups, with innovative wearables, have surfaced in the past 6-7 years and have continuously encouraged the use of novel technologies. A sizeable proportion of these companies are focused on gaining foothold in the field of monitoring & diagnosis and wearables offering therapeutic benefits. The current market is primarily concentrated in North America and Europe; these regions have presence of a large number of companies focused on development of smart wearables. It is fair to state that, in the long term, emerging markets of Asia (specifically India and China) are likely to emerge as credible contributors; commoditized prices will be a significant factor that could result in mass adoption amongst the wide consumer base in these regions. The overall interest continues to rise as is evident from the number of partnerships / agreements that have taken place amongst the stakeholders. Product development agreements have been very common and are likely to play an active role in industry's development.

We identified close to 250 smart wearables, being developed by over 150 companies, across different segments of the industry. The current landscape is dominated by activity / fitness trackers; in fact, wrist wearables, made available by leading players on several B2C platforms, are widely used. 2. Of late, the focus has broadened; the companies have intensified their efforts towards development of more complex applications in monitoring critical parameters such as ECG, EEG, EMG, blood pressure, blood glucose monitoring, aiding in timely and accurate diagnosis. Such wearables represent ~40% of the products we identified. In addition, the trend has also shifted towards smart wearables that provide therapeutic benefit. These wearables currently have applications in pain / stress / anxiety management. 3. The overall market is highly fragmented across the different segments highlighted above. Despite the presence of new players, several well-known non-healthcare stakeholders such as (indicative list, in no specific order) Apple, Adidas, Asus, Acer, Huawei, Intel, LG, Microsoft, Nike, Philips, Samsung, Sony and Xiaomi have strengthened their position on the market, specifically in activity / fitness tracking. The other two segments namely monitoring & diagnostics and wearables for therapy have also attracted several start-ups and SMEs that have developed innovative technologies. Examples of stakeholders in these segments include (indicative list, in no specific order) Atheer, Brain State Technologies, Chrono Therapeutics, dorsaVi, Empatica, Force Impact Technologies, G-Tech Medical, Hexoskin, Hocoma, iSono Health, Lumo Bodytech, Numera, Orpyx and Proteus Digital Health. These companies are expected to foster significant technological advancements in the near future. 4. With more and more people becoming aware about smart wearables, trends on social media platforms have demonstrated the growing popularity. In fact, we were able to capture over 80,000 mentions of relevant keywords on different social media platforms in the last five years. The activity has increased dramatically over the last 2-3 years. The same behaviour was observed on Google Trends. 5. Venture capitalists have strongly backed the innovation. We identified over 180 instances of funding across 70 companies over the last few years. The total amount invested has been close to USD 3.1 billion; of this, USD 2.1 billion came during the last three years alone. This clearly depicts the high interest of venture capital firms and other strategic investors in this area. 6. During the same time, several agreements were inked amongst the stakeholders. We captured over 120 partnerships across product development / integration, distribution / marketing agreement, supply agreements, mergers / acquisitions and others. Over 90 collaborations were signed in the last 3-4 years with product development / integration accounting for 44% of the total agreements. It is fair to state that such collaborations are one of the key enablers that are expected to drive new products in the market over the coming years. We expect the overall market for smart wearables within the healthcare industry to grow at an annualized rate of 13.6% over the coming 15 years. Relatively higher growth is expected for novel wearables under monitoring & diagnostics and therapy segments. As the market evolves, North America and Europe will continue to be the biggest contributors. These regions are likely to drive the market in the mid to long term before a wider adoption is seen in the emerging markets of India and China (likely to happen as price declines over time).

Peter Bright - Jan 16, 2017 10:30 pm UTC reader comments 324 Share this story Windows 7's extended support ends on January 14, 2020. The operating system left mainstream support in 2014, meaning that for the last two years—and next three—it only receives security fixes. But Microsoft is telling corporate customers that even with those security updates, the 2009 operating system isn't really cut out for the world of today. According to Redmond, enterprises should plan to move to Windows 10 sooner, rather than later. The reason, according to Markus Nitschke, head of Windows at Microsoft Germany, is that Windows 7 "does not meet the requirements of modern systems, nor the security requirements of IT departments." There are two elements to this. Companies buying new hardware using Intel's Skylake or Kaby Lake processors have little choice but to use Windows 10. Installation and driver support for Windows 7 and 8.1 is limited to certain systems since changes in the Skylake platform, such as the integrated USB 3 controllers and processor-controlled power management, aren't supported in Windows 7. PC OEMs can still make the older operating system work, but it requires extra effort on their part. AMD's new Ryzen processors and Windows machines built using the Qualcomm 835 processor will similarly need Windows 10. With so many companies holding onto their PCs for so long, that may not be a big reason to drop the older operating system. This is where security comes in. Windows 10 includes a wide range of security improvements that aren't found in Windows 7: stronger built-in biometrics with Windows Hello, cloud-based threat analytics with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, built-in sandboxing with AppContainer (used for Store apps, the Edge browser, and certain aspects of font-handling), virtualization-based security to protect against certain kinds of credential theft, and much more. The value of these improvements is not that they address individual security flaws, rather they make whole classes of flaw harder to exploit, protecting the operating system against both known and unknown threats. Microsoft argues that it is these systemic, architectural protections that mean corporations should adopt Windows 10 over Windows 7. This was demonstrated in a write-up of two zero-day exploits published by Microsoft last week. The Strontium group (aka "Fancy Bear," aka "APT28") is believed to be involved in the hacks of the Democratic National Committee, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and others. They're believed also to be tied to Russian intelligence. In a spear-phishing campaign conducted in October, the group used then unknown vulnerabilities—one in Windows' windowing subsystem, one in Windows' font management, and one in Adobe Flash—to attack think tanks and non-governmental organizations in the US. The two Windows flaws that were targeted, however, wouldn't be exploitable in Windows 10 with the Anniversary Update. Windows 10 includes additional validation of internal structures, and it performs certain aspects of font handling in an unprivileged, sandboxed process. The result is that even though Windows 10 had the same underlying bugs, its defense in depth made those bugs harder or impossible to successfully exploit. This kind of protection isn't going to be retrofitted to Windows 7; organizations that want the best available protection against both known and unknown flaws will have to upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft has, of course, made this same pitch to corporations before. Windows 7 may be looking long in the tooth today, but it represented a substantial improvement, especially with regard to security, over Windows XP. Windows 8.1 introduced further structural security improvements. In spite of this, many companies stuck with Windows XP for years past its prime. Often, compatibility with legacy browsers or legacy applications made migrating to newer versions of Windows expensive. Nitschke says, "As we saw with Windows XP, companies should take early steps [to move to Windows 10] to avoid future risks or costs" from being trapped on the older operating system. The longer organizations wait, the argument goes, the more institutional knowledge and expertise about those problematic applications leaves the company, and the harder it becomes to upgrade them to work on the new operating system. Migrating away from Windows 7 should be less problematic than dropping Windows XP was, because Windows 7 applications are less ill-behaved than many Windows XP ones were. Still, Microsoft is clearly keen that customers heed the lessons learned from that migration and not leave upgrades until the last minute. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Within weeks of the election, Trump had already claimed a victory. Through a mix of inducements and intimidation, he prevailed on the heating and cooling firm Carrier to keep some of its operations in Indiana, “saving” around 1,000 US jobs. Touring the Carrier plant subsequently, he warned other US firms that he would impose stiff tariffs on them if they moved plants overseas and shipped products back home. His Twitter account has produced a stream of commentary in the same vein. He has taken credit for Ford’s decision keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky rather than move it to Mexico. He has threatened General Motors with import tariffs if it continues to import Chevrolet Cruzes from Mexico instead of making them in the US. Trump has also hounded defense contractors for cost overruns, berating aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin on separate occasions for producing planes that are too expensive. His policy style represents a sharp break from that of his predecessors. It is highly personalized and temperamental. It relies on threats and bullying. It is prone to boasting, exaggeration, and lies about actual successes. It is a type of public spectacle staged on Twitter. And it is deeply corrosive of democratic norms. Economists tend to advocate an arm’s-length relationship between government and business. Public officials are supposed to insulate themselves from private firms, lest they should be corrupted and engage in favoritism. This is a prized principle in the US, but one that is more often breached than observed. An obvious example is the undeniable influence over US government policy exercised by finance moguls during the last three decades. Yet close business-government interactions also lie behind many of America’s successes. The history of US economic development is one of pragmatic partnerships and collaboration between the public and private sectors, rather than arm’s-length relationships and rigid rules. As historically minded economists and policy analysts such as Michael Lind, Stephen Cohen and Brad DeLong have reminded us, the US is heir to a Hamiltonian tradition in which the federal government provides investment, infrastructure, finance and other support that private enterprise needs. US technological innovation owes as much to specific government programs, such as loan assistance or government purchases, as it does to American entrepreneurs’ and inventors’ ingenuity. As Harvard Business School Professor Josh Lerner notes, some of the most dynamic technology companies in the US, including Apple and Intel, received financial support from the government before going public. Electric carmaker Tesla was a beneficiary of the same public loan guarantee program as Solyndra, the solar cell company that went bust in 2011 in a spectacular public collapse. As the Solyndra example illustrates, many public initiatives fail. However, the ultimate test is whether the social return on the portfolio as a whole is positive, taking successes together with the flops. Such broad evaluations tend to be rare, but one analysis found that US programs to boost energy efficiency had produced positive net benefits. Interestingly, the bulk of the benefits were attributable to three relatively modest projects. Sociologists Fred Block and Matthew Keller have provided perhaps the best analysis of the US “developmental state,” a reality they say the reigning market-fundamentalist ideology has obscured. Block and Keller describe how a “decentralized network of publicly funded laboratories” and an “alphabet soup” of financing initiatives, such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, work with private firms and help them commercialize their products. They and their colleagues have documented the extensive role of both federal and state governments in supporting the collaborative networks on which innovation rests, whether in biotech, green technologies or nanotech. Such industrial policies, based on close collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors, have been the hallmark of East Asian economic policymaking. It is difficult to imagine China’s transformation into a manufacturing powerhouse — and the attendant success of its export-oriented model — without the Chinese government’s helping and guiding hand. It is ironic that the same people who extol Chinese gains from globalization are often alarmed that a US administration may copy the Chinese approach and explicitly endorse industrial policies. Unlike China, the US purports to be a democracy. And industrial policy in a democracy requires transparency, accountability and institutionalization. The relationship between the government and private firms has to be calibrated carefully. Government agencies need to be close enough to private enterprises to elicit the requisite information about technological and market realities on the ground. For example, what are the fundamental reasons for the loss of manufacturing jobs in, say, automobile production, and how can the government help, if at all? However, they cannot get so close to private firms that they end up in companies’ pockets, or at the other extreme, simply order them around. That is where industrial policy à la Trump fails to pass the test. On one hand, his appointments to key economic positions indicate he has little intention of severing government ties to Wall Street and big finance. On the other hand, his policymaking-by-tweet suggests he does not have much interest in building the institutionalized dialogue, with all the required safeguards, that sound industrial policy requires. This means we can expect the Trump administration’s industrial policy to vacillate between cronyism and bullying. That may benefit some, but it will do little good for the overwhelming majority of American workers or the economy as a whole. • Dani Rodrik is professor of international political economy at Harvard University’s John F.

Image: hp australia By HP Australia2017-01-16 20:00:00 UTC It’s people that make your business operational, and it’s people who will make your business succeed or fail. However, the resources you provide for those people—even if you’re the only person in the business—will directly affect how much they’re able to get done, how efficiently they’re able to do it, and how organised they remain into the future.  To put it simply, if you want your business to run smoothly into the new year, you’ll need to make sure it’s got the right equipment to make that happen. That’s why you need these absolute office essentials—even if you’re just working from the dining room table most days.   A high-quality printer  Even if you’re trying to reduce your paper usage, you’re going to need a printer and/or copier at some point—but not just any printer will do. You’ll want something that’s easy to use, compatible with all your devices, and capable of printing high-quality images that will make an impression to your clients. The HP Office Jet Pro is one of the best printers on the market, and will help you print better-looking documents more efficiently—and is incredibly reliable, even when printing remotely via your mobile device.   High-tech primary devices It may be tempting to go with a less expensive primary device for you and your workers; you may opt for a mid-range laptop, try to find a deal on a used tablet, or go with last year’s model of smartphone. In the short term, this may save you some money, but remember—technology develops quickly, and there’s a reason the newer devices are more expensive. As Intel points out, upgrading your devices can give you a massive boost in productivity—not to mention making you and your employees happier—so go with newer, more advanced devices when you can, and upgrade if you’re stuck with older inventory.  Reliable internet Next up, you’ll need reliable internet. With practically every business action—from sending email to storing documents—happening over the web, you would be crippled if your Internet unexpectedly gave out or suffered from low speeds. Do your research and go with a provider with a track record for consistent success, and invest in a router that’s going to provide sufficient and stable coverage throughout your home or office. If you’re not sure how to buy a router, this guide is highly informative.   Filing cabinets and label-makers  Filing cabinets may seem like they belong in offices from decades ago, but they can still help you store, protect, and organise your documents. Keeping your office organised will make everything else run smoother—especially if you end up facing an audit or some other mechanism that forces you to produce documentation. Label makers, like the P-Touch 1290, are also good to have on hand.   A paper shredder  Though there are a wide variety of paper shredders available on the market, you don’t need the cutting-edge technology here. The more complex and fine the shredding is, the more secure it will be, but even a basic paper shredder can help you protect your business from fraud. You should be shredding any and all documents that contain any information about your business you wouldn’t want someone to know.   Desk supplies  Perhaps because they’re so basic, they’re often forgotten, but you should have basic desk supplies on hand. Even if you don’t regularly take notes, having pens and paper available will come in handy the day you realise you need them. The same goes for sticky notes, paperclips, binder clips, binders, folders, and other common materials you’ll eventually need.   Apps and software   Finally, you’ll need to choose the best apps and software to keep your business running smoothly, whether it’s accounting software like QuickBooks, CRM platforms like SalesForce, or a project management platform like Producteev or the HP All-in-One Printer Remote app. The user experience, usability, learnability, and general performance of apps like these can have a major impact on your overall performance as a business—so do your research and choose your options carefully (and don’t be afraid to switch if one isn’t working out).   With the right investments in these areas, you (and your entire workforce) will be better able to plan, manage, and execute your work. You’ll be faster, more efficient, and more capable than ever before, which means you’ll be able to attain higher profitability and deal with less stress than ever before. Make these items a priority for your new year in the office if you don’t already have them, and make sure you invest in the right equipment in each area.   Topics: Business, hp officejet pro, office supplies, printers, Small Business About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

the online world to physical stores News provided by BT Jan 16, 2017, 08:29 ET Share this article DALLAS, January 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- BT today announced that leading shirtmaker and luxury clothing retailer Thomas Pink has deployed the Acuitas Digital Internet of Things (IoT) platform, which helps retailers to digitize the physical store, at its Wall Street New York City store. Thomas Pink installed the pilot Acuitas Digital IoT digital store solution as part of its digital strategy. It will enable the retailer to track in real time the movement of merchandise and people around the store, use big data analytics to predict shopper behavior and provide a foundation for real-time interactive in-store experiences. This will help the retailer personalize customer service, optimize store layout, improve employee workflows, reduce cost and grow sales. Launched in January 2016, the Acuitas Digital Alliance brings together like-minded technology innovators determined to bring the full benefits of the new digital era across the entire retail supply chain. Its members are BT, Intel, RetailNext, NexGen Packaging, SATO Global Solutions and Valmarc Corporation. Acuitas Digital's solution uses IoT multi-sensors to automatically scan the whole store in real-time to improve efficiency and unlock new interactive in-store experiences.  The IoT powered Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors provide real-time inventory visibility and movement tracking of merchandise throughout the store, increasing efficiency and delivering near 100 per cent stock accuracy. This new IoT approach to digitizing the store overcomes the limitations of legacy handheld RFID systems that rely on manual weekly or daily store scanning.  Manual scanning can be error prone, time consuming and of limited value to retailers looking to deliver in-store interactive customer experiences or for real-time analytics. The IoT powered video sensors within the Acuitas Digital solution will allow Thomas Pink to understand the behavior of customers in the store.  They will provide insight and intelligence on what customers are buying, who goes where in the store, merchandising effectiveness and how the stores are performing. Alex Field, marketing director, Thomas Pink, said: "The Acuitas Digital solution will give us the insight to ensure that we have the right products, in the right place at the right time, all of the time. This is fundamental to delighting our customers and delivering great new digital experiences to the store. "We will now be able to use big data analytics to improve store efficiency and performance to help our people to spend more time with customers rather than getting tied up in admin tasks.  We're incredibly excited about how it will transform the store for our people and customers.  It will bring our digital store strategy to life and will show how it can become a real driver of growth." The Acuitas Digital solution is offered world-wide by BT.  It brings together best-of-breed components powered by the Intel® Responsive Retail Sensor, in-store analytics by RetailNext, software by SATO Global Solutions and RFID tags by NexGen.  This is underpinned by global BT's Cloud of Clouds and networking capability and international support. Bas Burger, BT's president for the Americas, said: "There are many solutions on the market designed to help retailers predict customer behavior and improve experiences for shoppers. However, these solutions do not easily integrate with each other, and that lack of integration translates into data silos and limited usefulness. "BT is working with Thomas Pink to maximize the business benefits of our Acuitas Digital solution, bringing together the power of IoT sensors, software and analytics to give a single comprehensive view of store operations and customer behavior.  This will help to grow sales, boost productivity and deliver a greater experience for customers." The Acuitas Digital solution will help Thomas Pink and its customers in a number for ways. For example, if a customer picks up a men's shirt, carries it elsewhere in the store and then abandons it for another product, the next person who's looking for that shirt may not be able to find it.  A sales assistant will then get tied up searching for the item, while the new customer waits.  With the Acuitas Digital Alliance solution, the Thomas Pink sales assistant will know exactly where to find the item, saving time, removing frustration and giving the customer a better shopping experience. Moreover, if a garment sold happens to be the last one of its style and size in the store, the real-time nature of the Acuitas Digital solution will allow for a replenishment order to be made instantly and automatically by sending an alert notifying a sales assistant, rather than waiting until the end of the day for a stock check. When combined with digital signage, the solution could also prompt a customer buying a shirt to consider a matching tie or cufflinks, improving service and helping grow sales.  Fitting rooms will be transformed.  New Smart Fitting rooms will improve customer experience and increase sales conversion. Mike Beedles, chair of the Acuitas Digital Alliance, said: "Today's customers have higher expectations of the retail experience than ever before.  Digital solutions are key to helping retailers meet this challenge and seize the opportunities new shopping behaviors offer.  We're delighted to be working with Thomas Pink as it develops its digital store strategy and look forward to our mutual success."

About Thomas Pink Thomas Pink was founded in London in 1984 by the Mullen brothers, whose founding inspiration was the history of Mr. Pink, the 18th century tailor credited as the originator of 'hunting pink' - referring to the scarlet jackets of hunt staff. The Mullen brothers appreciated the fundamental quirk of British humour that something so obviously red could be referred to as Pink. This quirk so appealed to them that they saw it as a tension right at the heart of the brand they were founding - namely a men's brand called PINK - an obviously feminine colour. Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired the brand in 1999. From business and casual shirting to evening and Made To Order shirting, PINK shirts are made using traditional, time-honoured methods with exclusive fabrics from world-renowned mills. Detail is everything – the collars are hand turned and are composed of up to 14 individual pieces. Pink shirts are available in Classic, Slim and Super Slim Fit and in addition, the brand also offers tailoring, separates, knitwear and accessories. Celebrated for innovative design, Thomas Pink made its name with the renowned original Classic Fit shirt. The style is a modern take on the classic Jermyn Street cut and is generously designed for style and comfort. It features a long tail that stays tucked, as well as signature PINK gussets. Since then, Thomas Pink has launched a number of pioneering shirting solutions – including the Athletic Fit and the Independent collar. 2015 saw the Jermyn Street shirtmaker extended its popular 'Personally Pink' Made To Order service. An extensive choice of more than 160 fabrics span long staple Egyptian cottons, Sea Island cottons, linens. and fine cotton poplins in two-fold 100s, 120s, 170s, 200s and 300s. The service also encompasses options for evening and special occasions. The shirts are made in the United Kingdom and delivered back to clients within three weeks. Final details include a choice of buttons as well as monogramming and engraved collar bones. The 'Personally Pink' Made To Order Service is available at Thomas Pink's London flagship store on Jermyn Street as well as in Heathrow T2, Sloane Street, Blomfield Street, Canary Wharf and Selfridges. A very patriotic brand, Thomas Pink has proudly dressed The British & Irish Lions rugby team, designed an exclusive Team GB Collection for Rio, and ferried many an international guest around central London in its iconic union jack clad pink Morgan. Today, Thomas Pink is a modern British shirtmaker with over 100 stores worldwide and flagships in London's Jermyn Street, Madison Avenue, New York and Rue Francois Premier, Paris.

US Army may need foreign weapons to keep up Annoyingly precocious teen who ruined Trek is now an asteroid Data Center Storage Market researchers big up NRAM Silicon to carbon change could boost Nantero's business 16 Jan 2017 at 09:29, Chris Mellor A market-research report suggests carbon nanotube storage developer Nantero could be on the verge of a breakout after years of disappointment and struggle. A tipping point could be its licensing deal with Fujitsu, which the BCC Research report, "Is NRAM Creating Market Volatility?" mentions. Nantero did not sponsor the BCC report. The trend-report-pusher suggests NRAM revenues could be $75m in 2018, $120m in 2019 and $850m in 2023, a 62.5 per cent CAGR. We've covered the technology in a little detail in the Fujitsu licensing article and explain there how its basis is the movement of the ends of carbon nanotubes to connect or break current-carrying connections and so provide binary ones or zeros. So far, NRAM has been positioned as a potential candidate resident of the DRAM-NAND gap, being faster than NAND, up to DRAM in speed, and with virtually unlimited endurance. So it is competing with Intel/Micron's XPoint, PCM, STT-RAM, and other candidate tech. But the report makes it clear that NRAM can be faster than DRAM, as well as using less power, which would lead to longer battery life in mobile devices. Unlike DRAM, it does not need refresh power sent through it to maintain its state. The report notes: NRAM read and write consumes lower energy in comparison to flash or DRAM. Due to which NRAM is expected to have much longer battery life. In addition, it is expected to be much faster to write than flash and DRAM. However its speed is gated by the interface used, DDR4 currently, and associated protocols. Since NRAM is non-volatile, it does not need, as the report emphasis, the "refresh" part of the DDR4 interface. How fast is carbon nanotube memory? Ann Jacoby, client solutions director at BCC Research, tells us: "[The] media (ie, carbon) has an intrinsic response time down to picoseconds. One needs to have an interface just as fast in order to take advantage of that speed. The first wave of products will use the standard DDR4 interface – so that's the DRAM speed. Some early application engineers are working to optimize NRAM for the specific tasks on their wish lists. These will be faster than DRAM." A picosecond, a trillionth of a second, is 1/1,000th of a nanosecond. If we say DRAM access latency is in the order of 14ns then that would mean 14,000ps. To describe NRAM as having picosecond speed needs it to be lower than 1000ps. We haven't seen actual numbers and so cautiously assume that we are looking at speeds of 800ps – 999ps. It could be much lower, but we need to see numbers. The report goes on to say NRAM can be made in logic factories as well as at mass-production semi-conductor fabs, and that, therefore, NRAM dies could be customised, unlike DRAM. It means NRAM customers, such as mobile phone manufacturers, could order NRAM chips designed specifically for their phones. A downside is capacity. The report quotes Mark Webb from MKW Ventures Consulting as saying: "Initial reported plans for 2018 are [a] 256 Mbit range of density, which is significantly lower than we expect from RRAM and 3D Xpoint in 2018. As such, it would appear to be competing in the NOR, FRAM, MRAM, embedded memory space for the next few years. RRAM, NAND, Xpoint will fight it out for the 128 Gbit and higher market." Productisation with this kind of tech is a long, long and rocky road. The BCC Research report suggests that NRAM could be about to make it, even though the initial market destination is going to be a niche. The market researchers want $2,650 for a single user licence for the report. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 3 Comments More from The Register Someone just chucked another $21 million at carbon nanotube memory techies Nantero’s NRAM crowd's tech has already been licensed 10 Comments Deep inside Nantero's non-volatile carbon nanotube RAM tech Biz has signed up Fujitsu as a licensee for its technology 36 Comments Big Blue welds bits of carbon for nanotube transistor Bonding beats Ώ-ophobia 8 Comments Carbon nanotube memory tech gets great big cash dollop Forget NAND, this here carbon tube stuff is the future, baby 19 Comments Fujitsu seeks PC exit, finds willing buyer in Lenovo But can they fund the deal? 13 Comments Strike day struck off as Fujitsu and Unite negotiate job cuts It's good to talk... with Acas Whitepapers Hunting insider threats Insider threats are a real risk to business because they threaten both customer and employee trust.

When Cars Fly Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent 1/16/2017 00:22 AM EST  4 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet "HD Mapping" and "Connectivity" (V2V, V2I) are both viewed as indispensable predictive tools for highly automated driving. In the context of highly automated driving, describing HD mapping simply as “mapping” is misleading. Today, HD mapping is considered must-have data for highly automated driving. It can provide information just as critical as other sensory data generated by vision, lidar and radar. HD Mapping (Source: Here) Liran Bar, CEVA’s director of production marketing, had his finger on it. Asked why mapping is such a big deal, he said, “It’s all about prediction.” HD mapping enables you “to predict before lidars and radars detect that a road is blocked ahead, for example,” he explained. It’s a hugely important element in the advancement of the robo-car. “HD Mapping” and “Connectivity” (V2V, V2I) are both viewed as indispensable tools for “prediction.” But much of their implementations needs a buy-in from everyone in the automotive industry, and a consensus to build common infrastructure. We’ve witnessed some progress. But I don’t think we’ve gone far enough. In this column, let me zoom in on the HD mapping issue. At the CES last week, Here, owned by a consortium of German automotive companies including Audi, BMW and Daimler, garnered numerous partnership deals. Aside from Intel’s announcement to buy a 15-percent stake in Here, Here and Nvidia also announced at CES an extended collaboration to develop Here HD Live Map into a real-time, high-definition mapping solution for autonomous vehicles. Mobileye also disclosed that it is now working with Here to provide Mobileye’s own crowd-sourced, high-definition mapping technology called Road Experience Management (REM). Phil Magney, founder and principal advisor for Vision Systems Intelligence (VSI), explained, “Here brings value by providing the location platform and the infrastructure to support it. Mobileye brings a crowd source of data that collectively will pool with Here data to create a localization platform.” REM is a technology unique to Mobileye. As Mobileye describes it, REM is “is an end-to-end mapping and localization engine for full autonomy.” The solution consists of three layers: harvesting agents (any camera-equipped vehicle), map aggregating server (cloud), and map-consuming agents (autonomous vehicle). The harvesting agents collect and transmit data about the driving path’s geometry and stationary landmarks. Mobileye’s real-time geometrical and semantic analysis, implemented in the harvesting agent, allows it to compress map-relevant information – facilitating very small communication bandwidth (less than 10KB/km on average). Crowd sourced Roadbook (Source: Mobileye) Under this scheme, the relevant data is packed into small capsules called Road Segment Data (RSD) and sent to the cloud. The cloud server aggregates and reconciles the continuous stream of RSDs – a process resulting in a highly accurate and low time-to-reflect-reality map, which Mobileye calls “Roadbook.” Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder, CTO and chairman, sees Roadbook as a layer above what Here offers. He stressed, for Mobileye, “Mapmakers are not competitors.” Aside from Here, Mobileye announced a partnership with Japanese mapmaker Zenrin and an OEM to complete HD-Mapping of Japan. “By October, 2018, we get this done,” Shashua promised. The ultimate goal for Mobileye is to develop “World Roadbook” in collaboration with a variety of OEMs. HD mapping isn’t the only thing that needs to be shared among car OEMs, however.

It should be up to the car company that writes/maintains the software to insure it can only operate autonomously in areas where it is legal to do so. In areas where the legal status isn't known for sure, the vehicle should refuse to operate autonomously. Perhaps it might include some method to override that in an emergency (i.e. you are injured and need to get to a hospital) but only in cases where the owner overrides the vehicle's restrictions should the owner be liable. Making the owner criminally liable for what an autonomous vehicle does is the fastest way to insure they never take off. That would be like putting you in jail because you bought some consumer product that unbeknownst to you leaked RF on restricted bands.

A vehicle that may be quite capable of driving itself might find its owner fined, or even jailed if it excercizes that capability without the consent and regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction. Not only will industry standards be necessary, but will have to be approved by government agencies. It would make sense for at least part of the infrastructure to be publically built and operations publically funded. It seems to me that crowdsourcing road data might have advantages, but disadvantages too. Stationary cameras and other roadside sensors could be more robust. In either case though, the robustness and timeliness would be of the utmost importance. These vehicles could be totally autonomous, not requiring a local infrastructure separate from the vehicles themselves. It would take making these vehicles part of a mesh network. Of course, here (no capital H), would definitely require industry standards.

Years of major efforts to bring together many parties, from past efforts of the AdaptIVe consortium, ERTICO-ITS Europe, Vehicle and Road Automation (VRA) Group, SENSORIS Innovation Platform, Navigation Data Standard (NDS) Association, Open Autodrive Consortia, ADASIS Forum, up to the present efforts from entities such as OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, or Dynamic Map Development Co. (SIP-adus in Japan) or HERE or TomTom, would provide evidence that any outsider not directly involved in these discussions and negotiations simply cannot project any reasonable assessment of the depth, details or timing of such monolithic agreements. Observing that even as we speak the telecommunications industry, the cloud providers, the big data analytics leadership, and other supporting providers are signing contracts for committing substantial resources to the infrastructure required to faciltate this monolithic model, even before the final announcement is consummated, supports an analysis that needs much elaboration and underpinning. An announcement of a master data sharing plan for mapping could easily be presented to the marketplace tomorrow, and this article is then essentially void of any real analysis or accuracy, or merits.   I am miffed why those who reside in California seem to be touted as the leading experts in the Auto Industry.

Market watchers shared long-term forecasts for mid-single-digit growth, with this year performing above average. Ballooning design costs and geopolitical wild cards stood out as two of the biggest risks ahead in talks at the event famous for providing a view that spans macroeconomics to nanotechnology. Scotten Jones, president of IC Knowledge, gave perhaps the most upbeat assessment of the technical roadmap. His talk also provided a kind of decoder ring to decrypt the smoke and mirrors surrounding today’s process nodes. “I don’t believe [that] Moore’s law is dead, and the deep techs don’t believe it either,” he said, noting that both Intel and GlobalFoundries now report cost savings in post-14-nm nodes. “I think [that] we have a path that produces transistors that scale down in cost,” he said. He predicted that a 5-nm node could hit starting in late 2019 using EUV in at least some steps, probably still using some form of FinFETs as transistors. Beyond that, a 3.5-nm generation moving to horizontal nanowires could mark the last node for classical scaling. Nevertheless, a 2.5-nm generation stacking n- and p-nanowires could deliver 60–70% density increases into the year 2025, he said, citing a simulation run by process-modeling specialist Coventor. In a separate talk, GlobalFoundries chief technologist Gary Patton shared his optimism. He predicted that chip makers will move to gate-all-around transistors somewhere around 2020 as device structures approach atomic limits. “There’s a view [that] Moore’s law is ending, but we always figure out how to move things forward,” Patton said. In the short-term, it's becoming a neck-and-neck race among chip makers, said Jones. In the chart below, he showed his view that TSMC recently took the lead from Samsung, which took it from Intel last year. The x86 giant will retake the lead with its 10-nm process early this year, with GlobalFoundries stealing it back with its 7-nm node in 2018, he predicted.

Reuters/Shannon Stapleton Microsoft is said to be developing a Surface Phone and also developing an upgraded version of the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Pro 5. Tech enthusiasts are divided in their opinion as to when the two highly-anticipated devices will be released. While some believe they will be unveiled in March, others think it’s April. Earlier it was reported that the Surface Pro 5 will be released in the first quarter of 2017 and since then has been subjected to a lot of speculation. According to Tech Times, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is rumoured to sport an Intel 7th Generation Kaby Lake processor. The device is expected to come out in three processor variants namely, Core M (dual core), Core i5 (dual-core with two threads), and Core i7 (quad-core with eight threads). Higher processor speeds and better battery life are two highly-anticipated boosts fans are expecting in the Surface Pro 5. A 12.5-inch 4K screen is also expected in the device that will offer 3D support at 60fps. Microsoft may also drop the Super AMOLED screens in favour of an IPS touch one. The device may run on the Windows 10 Redmond 3 version. Storage versions of 16GB and 32GB are expected. The Surface Pro 5 will likely support 512GB to 1TB storage SSD. Microsoft is also expected to severely enhance Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and camera of Surface Pro 5. A fingerprint scanner and trackpad may be incorporated into the device. It may also have an upgraded Surface Pen. The stylus could have a rechargeable battery capable of being recharged wirelessly when docked into the tablet. Microsoft may be waiting for the Kaby Lake processor to be implemented. Hence, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date may be pushed back further. The starting price of the device could be US$899 (AU$1,200).

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Windows 7: Microsoft waves an early goodbye By Martin Brinkmann on January 15, 2017 in Windows - Last Update:January 18, 2017 83 Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system is still the world's most widely used OS, but that does not stop Microsoft from waving an early goodbye to the operating system. The company informed customers on the German Microsoft press site that support for Windows 7 will end on January 14, 2020: about three years from today. This means, according to Microsoft, that devices won't receive security updates or technical support anymore if they still run Windows 7 by that time. If you are a regular here on Ghacks, or on other tech sites, you know that support will run out. You know about the Windows lifecycle, and that Windows 7 won't be supported forever by Microsoft. Microsoft waving goodbye to Windows 7 Microsoft's press release paints a grim picture, highlighting that Windows 7 is the cause for high operating costs, that Windows 7 is susceptible for malware attacks causing a reduction in work time, and the cause for an increase in support requests. In addition, manufacturers have begun to stop providing drivers for Windows 7 for hardware they release; Windows 7 won't support the newest chips by AMD, Intel or Qualcomm on top of all that. Microsoft's solution for all of this is the company's newest operating system Windows 10. It states that it was never easier to switch from an older version of Windows to Windows 10. Windows 10 furthermore would offer better and exclusive security features and non-security features such as biometric authentication or the personal assistant Cortana. My Take Microsoft gets some of the facts right. Windows 7 support will run out in 2020, there is no doubt about that. It is also okay to inform customers about the end of support for a much used operating system, even three years in advance. Home users may not have any issues changing an operating system from one week to the next, but companies may need months or even years in advanced to prepare for that. But the press release is not entirely fair when it comes to Windows 7. I cannot really confirm for instance that companies have stopped distributing drivers for Windows 7 with their hardware components. While that may be the case for a small selection of components, it seems highly unlikely that companies would stop producing drivers for the most used operating system out there at this point in time. If there is one company that did that, it is Microsoft itself as company executives made the decision not to long ago to support newer chips by AMD or Intel only on Windows 10 and not on older versions of the Windows operating system. That decision was made deliberately by Microsoft. Windows 10 offers better out of the box security than Windows 7, but it should be clear that security can always be better, and that third-party software, and making good use of common sense, may improve it significantly. Closing Words It is clear that the time that Windows 7 has left is running out. Three years is a long time however, and the prospect of migrating to an operating system that gets new feature upgrades twice a year may not be to the liking of companies who prefer as little change as possible when it comes to operating systems. Sure, there is the long term servicing branch of the Enterprise edition of Windows 10, but it is reserved to the Enterprise edition. Small businesses, and medium sized businesses who use Pro versions of Windows 10 face the tough challenge of having to upgrade their devices to these new feature upgrade versions of Windows 10 regularly. There is also the privacy issue. Microsoft promises to improve privacy options with the release of the Creators Update, out April 2017. The company burned lots of bridges however, not only because of increased telemetry collecting in Windows 10, but also because of the aggressive pushing of the free Windows 10 upgrade to customer systems. Now You: Windows 7, Windows 10, or another operating system? What will your devices run?

Because Win10 is no more than an option as far as I"m concerned. No hurry. The OS was delivered 18 months ago. How will it evolve within the next 3 years I have no idea. If it ever gets to run smoothly and if its privacy issues appear to be seriously taken into consideration by Microsoft then I'll start viewing the upgrade as a possibility. The end of win7' life-cycle in perspective is not a problem when it comes to Windows Updates since I've stopped all updates last October 2016. But should the PC start coughing or appear to no longer support latest drivers and software (I'd be surprised on the short-medium term, I rather believe the market is on a slow-down demand) then I'd advance the switch to a new OS. That will be either Linux either Win10. I dislike to close doors (and Windows!) in a definitive manner but, as I perceive Win10 eighteen months after its launch I don't believe Cortana is likely to hear me sing "O Sole Mio" !!

I dislike Windows 10 for all the usual reasons. So I have bought an official Microsoft Windows 8.1 DVD, which I will install in late 2019 (shortly before Windows 7 SP1 support ends). For me, Windows 8.1 is a lesser evil than Windows 10, and it will keep me going for another three years, until 2023.01.10. After that, who knows what might be available? What hardware will I have then? Of the offerings available now (six years before the fact!), I would tend towards a rolling-release Linux distribution, such as Arch Linux (which I already keep installed and maintained for occasional use), or OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. Reply Pants January 15, 2017 at 10:04 am # One of the other aspects to take into consideration, is what will MS push to Windows 7 and 8.1 in that time period. & is quite different, but AFAIK, a lot of 8 architecture is the same, and Windows 10 features (especially those that allow MS monetisation/knowledge/leverage) will roll down .. you know .. in bundled updates you can't opt out of. Whatever direction 10 takes, expect 8 to incur a lot of the crap as well.

This article doesn't tell the full story though. I'm sure MS will release updates for Windows 7 Embedded (or whatever it's called) than can be installed on regular Windows 7 by tweaking a registry key and then using a tool like WSUS. I might even seek out a retail copy of Windows 8.1 Embedded just in case. Reply T J January 15, 2017 at 12:44 pm # This is a typical MS ploy which is designed to sow Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt ( FUD ) in the minds of Win 7 users. Why ?

Remember the OS called Warp. It was a good try & fun for a while. Another idea as the virtual machines are getting better perhaps we can always have win7 or similar run as a virtual tfn.

"highlighting that Windows 7 is the cause for high operating costs" If you are a regular here on Ghacks, or on other tech sites, you are probably wondering how much this new disastrous "picture" is going to cost to Microsoft, to PC vendors etc. "that Windows 7 is susceptible for malware attacks causing a reduction in work time, and the cause for an increase in support requests." If you are a regular here on Ghacks, or on other tech sites, and your combat is each day to stop Microsoft to harass you, you have nothing to learn about nagware, malware, etc. Please stop calling Windows 10 an "OS", call it an "OS as a "grim" service".

Microsoft might like this attitude, but if you look at real life, it's plain wrong. A minority of people is using Windows 10 today -- 7 / 8.1 users may well remain the larger group for some years to come.

Reply Gary O'Connor January 15, 2017 at 2:18 pm # When Windows 10 came out, and for months afterwards, any mention of Windows 10 on a blog would solicit complaints from hundreds of Anti-Microsoft trolls who were working tirelessly to destroy any chance of Windows 10 being successful. Lots of those were avid Apple followers but many were from the Linux hopefuls working in the vein hope that they might actually be able to create the fabled 'Year of Linux on the desktop' without having to claim Android as Linux when it is actually Java. Now, look at the response here, only about 20 of you have turned up? What has happened to all your mates? Probably off being creative on their Windows 10 machines because they've discovered that W10 is the best OS that Microsoft have produced yet and it even includes a Linux sandbox for them to play in. They have also realised that it is far better than anything that Apple or Linux have yet produced. Now donning my body armour :) Seriously though folks, I am a software developer, I sit at a desk that has a Windows 10 desktop, a Widows 7/Linux dual booting desktop and an iMac running El Capitan. I have various Android tablets and a couple of iPads as well as an iPhone 6s a Samsung S7 Edge and a Lumia 950XL and I use them all and I can tell you that I, and every one of my clients that have upgraded, believe Windows 10 IS the best OS that Microsoft has yet produced. I do agree with a couple of you here though when you say that if you're not happy with Windows 10, just hang onto W7 for the next three years and I guarantee that by then you will more than likely agree that W10 is the place to be and happily upgrade. I'd also like to thank you for all the bitching and wailing that you do because I suspect that you have caused Microsoft to work on improvements that they otherwise might not have, so thank you for that. Reply Clairvaux January 15, 2017 at 4:21 pm # "Complaints from hundreds of Anti-Microsoft trolls." You're projecting. Incidentally, the word you're looking for is users. Not trolls : users. "Lots of those were avid Apple followers but many were from the Linux hopefuls." That's absurd. This just shows you haven't been following the thousands of discussions going on. Those were, and are, Microsoft users trying to hang on their beloved Microsoft products. How does liking and using Windows 7 qualifies one as an "anti-Microsoft troll" ? Did you ever read Woody Leonhard's blog ? As for Apple users, they are busy usings their Macs, and generally quite happy with them. They don't need to troll discussions that don't relate to them, the way you do. (I don't know what an "Apple follower" is ; why don't you speak of "Microsoft followers", or of "Windows 10 followers" ?) Regarding Linux, yes there's often mentions made to it, and generally they are from old-time Microsoft users looking at reluctantly making the switch, in the wake of all the hostility and nonsense they have had to suffer from once-reliable Microsoft. Also from Linux converts or dual booters, encouraging others to transition. What's wrong with that ? What's wrong with people helping each other ? Beats your snickering anytime, in my opinion. "Hang onto W7 for the next three years and I guarantee that by then you will more than likely agree that W10 is the place to be and happily upgrade." This, again, shows you don't know what you're talking about. Nobody can "guarantee" anything about what the Microsoft landscape will be in three years. Not even Microsoft themselves. It's funny how some people can't just be content with using happily the systems and products they've chosen for themselves. They also feel an urge to berate those who don't use the same tools for different reasons. How stupid and immature can that be ? Reply Steve V.

Reply Tom Hawack January 15, 2017 at 6:05 pm # @Gary, I have to agree with Clairxaux's comment above. Yet maybe do I understand what you have in mind, maybe do you believe the Web carries an atmosphere of hysteria and that a few bright minds have the ability to impact the vast majority of us, including in the fact of manipulating our ideas with a series of programmed interventions in social sites, blogs ... This may be true but I believe it would concern ideas, philosophy, societal problems, religion, politics but far less the situation where an acquisition is concerned. There's money, possession and above all pleasure in the air or at the horizon. And also, this is not the situation of a dandy spreading his word on how awful the last Ferrari behaves but a context with, what? 2 billion users connected? I don't believe this is a situation which would enable a minority to influence a majority. This said, it is true that we are many to prefer strong feelings to luck-warm objectivity. But the point is that besides objectivity stands devotion as well as hatred : some people may look as if they enjoy wrecking a product"s reputation and when you meet them the day after you'll see/hear/read their most enthusiast comments on another product. So the question is ; does it make any sens to consider that those who dislike would have been manipulated and that those who like and them only would be objective? Obviously not. Everyday shows us happy users and who say why they are happy, but when such an amount, such a percentage of users (world-wide, this is not a psy laboratory with seven students) who detail their experience, for others who learn everyday from the former the amount of problems with a product... well, they remain aware but also slightly annoyed (to put it mildly) about the nerve of a company who dares threaten those, reluctant to move on to Win10. People loved XP, cried over Vista, loved (and still do!) 7 ... no one, who could? created a trend to have a planet endure problems and evoke them. This is planetary, no World Guru yet!

So, how do you cope with all the problems that your "happy" Win 10 clients need you to fix with every new iteration of this flawed OS ? The latest Fast Ring release, 15007, has 23 KNOWN FAULTS !! I realize that it is for testing by Win 10 fanboys like you so that you can act as unpaid QA staff for MS and feed the fixes back to them. But, even on the Fast Ring, these known faults should have been corrected before the release. However the bosses and programmers at MS cannot be arsed. Why? Because the "useful idiots" (like you) on the Fast Ring can't wait to show what clever programmers you are.

Reply Admin07 January 15, 2017 at 7:42 pm # It must be really painful for some users to realize that Microsoft has been collecting browsing history and search history for each user (without stripping personally identifying information) and who knows what other information. Microsoft stated that it would remove all identifying information from the telemetry and it was a blatant lie. You can log into your account Microsoft account on a Microsoft server and 'clear' the information. I have a feeling that 'clear' in Microsoft's (misinformation) language means 'hide' and not 'delete'. By the way, the current changes were due to the Swiss government intending to take legal action against Microsoft for breaching privacy and this was Microsoft's response to avoid the legal action. It had absolutely nothing to do with your idea of 'trolls' and I doubt Microsoft would have admitted taking the browser history and search history except that it was forced to do so by the Swiss government. It turns out the anti-bully, pro-privacy users were a much better judge of character than the trusting loyal Microsoft users. There is very little chance of a significant number of users moving to Windows 10 when it contains blatant spyware. It steals user's browser history and search history and who knows what else. Very few users will accept this blatant violation of their privacy and security. It's as simple as that. Windows 10 is dead as an OS for many users because of these reasons and there is zero chance that these users will ever use it. It wont matter if its 3 years or 10 years.

I do actually agree that Windows 10 is a good OS. However, it has a few major issues that greatly sour things, and they're not actually that difficult to fix either.

"Quite like Win10. Many many Vast improvements over win7/8.1" That is a very vague statement. Please post another comment in which you detail exactly what these improvements are. This is a short list of non-improvements: Deleted drivers, apps removal, uninstallable security updates, botched Fast Ring releases (15007 has 23 known problems), OS upgrade builds which hang leaving the user with unusable PCs, etc. There are many other problems which should have been fixed by now. After all, Win 10 has been available for 18 months and IMO it is still only beta quality.

One is an HP Stream 7 tablet that originally came with Windows 8.1, and I put 10 on it just to see if it would work. So far, nothing has broken it, which is tryly remarkable considering it cost so very little ans so many other computers have been hosed by Window 10 updates over the past year. But I really don't use if for anything, it's just there. I will likely reinstall Windows 8.1 some time this Spring, or give Ubuntu touch a try to see if I can make that work just for fun. My other Windows 10 device is a fairly new, decently spec'd laptop (I6 CPU, 8GB RAM, 1TB hard drive, high res touch screen, optical drive) I bought on sale to replace the year-old Windows 8.1 laptop I gave to my daughter when her laptop went up in smoke last fall. When I took the laptop out of the package, I updated W10 to whatever was current that day, then I disconnected it from the internet, made 2 full image backups in case I ever need to go back to W10 on that machine, and then I reconnected and installed Linux Mint 18.1 on it to use as the primary OS, and It runs as smooth as silk.

Reply MikeFromMarkham January 16, 2017 at 5:40 am # @420, Thanks for the reminder. I did have a USB key with a live version of Manjaro several months ago, but never got around to trying it out. However, It is one of the 2-3 other distros I want to examine further before I make a final decision. Tinfoil_Hat January 15, 2017 at 8:23 pm # Windows 10..... AKA that famous (in)operating system made to 90% fulfill M$ needs and 10% left to users? IMO whe should update the term "user" into "used" (by M$) Meanwhile last week I performed the 27th forced rollback since 1st dec., to win7-8 of win10 infected PCs. complaints where the nearly the same for almost all owners: ads everywhere, general poor performance, PC experiencing "demoniac possession", loss of data... yesterday those files where there, today no more. Only two where concerned about their privacy, one being a lawyer. One decided to buy a coreboot/libreboot machine. Everyone of those poor souls received transcript of Gleen Greenwald why privacy matters talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b17sq6c8-gg) Reply LD January 15, 2017 at 9:19 pm # I have a valid and binding contract with Microsoft that does not expire until January 2020. I do not want to renegotiate or cancel that contract as I am very happy with my purchase - that happens to be a license to use W7/Pro. I like this software - I am a delighted MS customer. I have a 5 year old Lenovo business laptop that cost me a pretty penny and it came optimized by the OEM for W7/Pro. It is well built and very responsive. That too was a binding contract (warranty now expired), but this little Chinese gerbil will probably last through to 2020 also. I like the hardware - I am a delighted customer. Microsoft should be delighted to have a satisfied customer. The most valued customer, is a return customer. That does not mean an intimidated customer. I will not bend to intimidation. Marketing is a source of pure entertainment to me. The current mob at Redmond are a laugh a minute. "Microsoft's press release paints a grim picture, highlighting that Windows 7 is the cause for high operating costs, that Windows 7 is susceptible for malware attacks causing a reduction in work time, and the cause for an increase in support requests." - That is a classic. Reply randy January 16, 2017 at 1:24 am # LOL, who honestly didn't see this coming? Just another attempt from the Microborg Collective to try and scaremonger ignorant folks into switching to their W10 spyware platform sooner rather than later. I guess the telemetry updates are not being applied by W7 users, so this is plan B. Can't wait to see what plan C is.

Reply Simon Ch January 16, 2017 at 10:24 am # (following up previous comment) Yes, I've been swinging back and forth between Linux and Windows, since the force Windows 10 debacle, but have been swinging back to Linux more and more, I basically have CentOS as my base OS, with Windows 7 running in a KVM with a dummy virtual network adapter that goes nowhere, it's happy and I'm safe. I have a Windows 10 on KVM also with a dummy network connector to prevent Microsoft malware. Windows 10 complains a lot about no network connectivity, giving themselves and their agenda away in the process. Reply vosie January 16, 2017 at 4:12 pm # "In addition, manufacturers have begun to stop providing drivers for Windows 7 for hardware they release; Windows 7 won't support the newest chips by AMD, Intel or Qualcomm on top of all that." It's nothing more than cartel conduct and planned obsolescence by corporations. There is absolutely no point and reason to install Windows 10, not even Windows 7. Windows XP works perfectly. Who cares if Microsoft will stop supporting Windows 7? They already stopped supporting XP, yet XP is still working perfectly. Even at my workplace, in the council all computers run Windows XP with disabled Windows updates, but with up to date antivirus and a router-based security. So XP is still good for everything, except if you want to play the latest games and you need DirectX or the latest .NET framework which they didn't make for XP because of planned obsolescence. And that's why the latest DirectX is available only on Windows 10. They want to force people to use Win 10. Reply Clairvaux January 16, 2017 at 5:58 pm # Unfortunately, anti-virus and routers are not enough to protect against exploits. XP has long been unsupported, which means it's an open avenue for attack. Even the harshest Microsoft critics among the experts warn against using XP anymore. Unless you're not connected to the Internet obviously, and don't have any USB ports. Hopefully, your concil has multiple backups and they are regularly tested. Such organisations are prime targets for ransomware. Reply Sum Guy January 17, 2017 at 1:45 am # See my comment (above) about Win-XP. Microsoft is *STILL* supporting XP -> by way of updates to POSReady 2009. POSReady 2009 is what Micro$haft strategically called a specific version of XP-SP3 intended for POS (point-of-service) PC's. Those are PC's used by bank tellers, airline check-in counters, retail cash registers, etc. All you have to do is add or modify 4 registry entries on your XP-SP3 machine and as far as WindowsUpdate is concerned, it's now a POSReady 2009 machine. Then have it do a Windows-Update check. You'll see that it will magically discover new updates, fixes and patches. Just search for POSReady XP hack. Read about it on the MSFN XP forum. POSReady 2009 will be getting updates until April 2019. And for those of you using Win-7, I think there's another newer version of POS based on Windows 7, and that OS will be getting updates for years. Clairvaux January 17, 2017 at 2:11 am # Yes. I know. I read your comment. Just because it's possible does not mean it's safe. What you're talking about is basically a hack. We don't know if it's supported by Microsoft (on the face of it, it isn't). It's meant to trick your computer into thinking it's a cash register. Cash registers don't access the Internet, or at least they don't surf the Web, exchange mail, do instant messaging and the like. It's highly unlikely that Microsoft updates meant for point of sales terminals address the attacks levelled at a PC facing the Internet all day long. There's no place you can turn to for assistance. Regular Microsoft updates for supported operating systems create all sorts of problems by themselves. It's already a full-time job for some people to keep their systems running and secure while they are officially supported, and you're telling us that just changing a few register keys in Windows XP will magically make it safe and smooth, while this simulates an environment completely different from one's own, and unfamiliar to most ? It might "work", and it might give one bragging rights ("Look ! I receive Windows XP updates !"), but there's no way this will make it safe. To begin with, a vast number of application software don't support XP anymore, and might even be downright incompatible. So you need to use ancient, unsupported programs, which are bound to be wide open to their own set of exploits. Microsoft updates meant for POS terminals might even break things which are never attached to POS terminals, but are routinely used with PCs. It's a hack. It's fun to know you can make a hack work, but there's a world of difference with a real, reliable solution. vosie January 18, 2017 at 8:17 am # Antivirus and routers are perfectly enough to protect XP. You just got manipulatedy by the marketing that want to create fear and alienate people from XP and to deceive them to buy newer Windows. www January 18, 2017 at 12:41 pm # @voise, the only browser left that has XP support is Firefox and that will end sometime in this year. According to this article, they are predicting March, 2017. http://www.ghacks.net/2016/09/27/firefox-53-no-support-for-windows-xp-or-vista/ What are you going to do then? As time goes on, websites change and won't render properly because you are using an outdated browser and won't see them properly. Ever try using IE10 nowadays? That's what it will look like. Broken, disjointed text and javascript because you refused to update with the times. And that's not even taking into account the security aspect of it. The only future for XP is as a standalone machine not connected to the internet running legacy programs that you are too attached into giving up. Really, man. Get a clue. Try to learn some Linux if you hate newer M$ OSes so much. Or find out the hard way which I suspect you'll be doing, anyway. Clairvaux January 18, 2017 at 8:51 am # Yes, I'm a victim of marketing. And you're the lone genius who knows, in the face of all the evidence and informed analysis, that XP is perfectly safe. Show me one world-known computer expert who says as much. Show me the research papers having audited XP recently, and their conclusion that XP is exploit-free and safe to use. Show me the IT professionals who advise businesses to stay with XP, because "it's OK with just a router and anti-virus". Who are they ? When did they go on the record saying that, and betting their reputation on their claims ? We live in a world where the director of the goddam CIA has his personal mail hacked by a low-level prankster, and you're telling me that running a whole organisation on XP is perfectly safe ? Have you ever heard of drive-by infections ? Do you know that 30 % of NHS trusts in Great-Britain have been hit by ransomware ? Do you suppose they were running CP/M, and were devoid of anti-virus and routers ? Reply dt January 17, 2017 at 1:28 am # Am currently running Win 7 and am happy with it, it’s what my laptop was designed for. When I bought it, the first thing I did was turn off “updates”. So no real interest in Win 10. In three years who knows what OS will be the defacto standard. The one thing I do know is that I wouldn’t be using one sold on a subscription basis. Reply 420 January 17, 2017 at 7:18 am # I would highly recommend anyone who is blocking all updates to use this tool martin has wrote about http://www.ghacks.net/2017/01/11/wsus-offline-update-10-9-download-security-updates-only/ It will allow you to update windows 7 and other windows with only security updates automatically, which previously was not possible automatically. Then you will have a nice win 7 with only security updates and no nonsense you still should go configure the group policy editor, like turn off telemetry etc... I have done this with a fresh win 7 pro install and it works great, feels faster without all the other crap too. Reply Clairvaux January 17, 2017 at 2:36 pm # That's what Woody of AskWoody calls group B, and it's heavily covered on his blog with all sorts of advice by all sorts of people (which seems to be necessary ; updating is now a job in itself, unless you consent to Microsoft's blind dumping which includes telemetry). Reply www January 18, 2017 at 12:21 pm # @Clairvaux, Do you have a link for that particular discussion? I tried googling it and must have used the wrong criteria. Clairvaux January 18, 2017 at 2:14 pm # www, his whole blog is dedicated to that, so it's difficult to point you to one particular thread. Hang on, though, because he's about to launch a forum appendage to his blog, where presumably old discussions will be much easier to search. Here is a thread a bookmarked, just in case : https://www.askwoody.com/2016/the-case-for-not-updating-windows-7-ever/ (That's group W. Luddites. People who've decided not to update anymore in disgust. Group A is Microsoft-compliant, and takes automatic updates for both security and "features". Group B updates manually for security only.)

That said, getting compromised involves a great many variables, witness the fact that so many are now proudly proclaiming that they have turned off all updates on various Windows versions with no issues. We don't actually know what sorts of updates POSReady 2009 does or does not get but uninstalling and reinstalling Microsoft Security Essentials afterward will see it getting regular malware updates and showing the computer as protected. My point is that you are speculating about risks and treating your conclusions as facts. While you are most likely correct at least in part, we are both just guessing so I would moderate my condemnation somewhat if I were you. And in case I haven't been clear, it's a gamble I don't recommend either but if someone is going to stay on XP, it may be the lesser evil. Reply Clairvaux January 17, 2017 at 2:47 pm # Lesser evil, obviously. When dealing with risks, it's speculation by definition. You can drive recklessly for years and not have a single accident. It does not make it advisable. I myself have stopped updating for several months, not by choice, but because my Windows Update is broken, repair seems a pain, I would have to deal with the new Microsoft way of doing things and I'm postponing it.

Print   Email   Font Resize Local News HerdDogg shows 'Fitbit' for cows at National Western Stock Show New technology brings precision ag to ear tags By Jerd Smith Boulder Daily Camera Posted:   01/17/2017 07:02:07 AM MST Texas Longhorn steer "Smoosy Bar" owned by the Silverado Ranch in Monument Colorado, sports a wearable biometric ear tag from HerdDogg at the National Western Stock Show Jan. 13. The tags collect biometric data that is collected from another device, a dog-bone shaped device that is placed close to the cattle, that is then transferred to an app or data base that tracks the health and proximity of the cattle. (Andy Cross / The Denver Post) Shoot Em Up, a well-known Texas longhorn from Ellicott, was ready for his Twitter performance during the National Western Stock Show parade last week. The weather, however, was not. That didn't faze Melissa Brandao, the woman behind the Longmont startup HerdDogg. The company has developed a small, rugged Bluetooth-enabled device designed to improve herd health and profitability by giving ranchers an easy-to-use, affordable tracking and data gathering system. Instead of the parade, which was clearly going to be a snowy challenge, HerdDogg systems will debut with Shoot Em Up's assistance at the Wild West Show on Jan. 14 and 15 at the National Western. Herddogg CEO Melissa Brandao. Longmont-based startup Herddogg, using a compilation of smartphone technology, has developed a new, ultra-tough tagging system, that allows cows to be tracked, herded and analyzed, in ways that save money and improve cow-health. (Lewis Geyer / Daily Camera) At the same time, Brandao and her small team of tech gurus are pushing hard to send out the first batch of commercially available smart tags this spring. She describes them as the equivalent of a Fitbit, except for very large, non-verbal mammals. Social media savvy steers When Shoot Em Up, who weighs nearly 1 ton, showed off the new technology during the National Western Stock Show, he sent out tweets letting the audience know, for instance, how fast he's walking, how many steps he's taking and his internal temperature, among other things. This information once was collected manually by ranchers as they physically inspected their animals — often multiple times a day — looking for those who were ailing or who were preparing to give birth. Advertisement The advent of Bluetooth technologies, which allow data to be gathered and stored locally, and cellphones have changed all that, according to Brandao. Now, using HerdDogg, a cow with one of the young company's tags implanted in its ear can walk up to a watering trough in a far-flung pasture and take a drink of water. While the animal drinks, the data from the HerdDogg tag is being gathered by a device attached to the trough, which the young company calls a dog bone. The data stays at the trough in the rugged, plastic, bone-shaped device, ready for a rancher to collect it via an app on a cellphone. If the rancher is standing in a field, he or she simply taps the icon on the cellphone that reflects the numbered tag of the cow being monitored, and information on that cow appears. In addition, an LED light in the tag lights up. "Our goal is to create a technology that is rancher friendly," Brandao said. "The data is stored and transmitted when the rancher needs it." Ranch animals have been tagged for years. In the early days, the simple plastic tags held a number that was the animal's ID. Then, as production became more sophisticated, the United States Department of Agriculture, began requiring radio ID tags. But HerdDogg is helping take the ag tag into a new world of precision agriculture, where animals can be tracked remotely, around the clock, without the use of tall radio towers or expensive networks. With more data, producers can make better-informed decisions that should help them improve herd health and profitability. Brandao said she believes the technology can allow small- and medium-sized producers to grow their herds without having to add staff, a critical factor in an industry in which family farms are shrinking in number and consolidation is rampant. Healthier cows, greener pastures Ryan Rhoades, who is Colorado State University's statewide extension specialist for beef producers, said devices such as the HerdDogg tag can help ranchers finely tune their operations, improving the health of herds and saving money by reducing the need for expensive drugs and veterinary visits required when animals go from simply feeling poorly to actually being sick. They can also help improve the sustainability of ranching by, for instance, helping ranchers track which areas of pasture land cattle are using for grazing, and then redistributing the cattle to ensure lands aren't overgrazed. "Producers are looking for strategies to be more sustainable," Rhoades said, "to increase their efficiency and to increase the bottom line. They're also looking for tools to improve herd management and health." Antibiotic resistance and medication use in feedlots is a big issue, Rhoades said. "Historically, we've not been very good at diagnosing sickness," he said. "There is a consumer perception that we're treating everything and mass medicating. This kind of tech allows us to be much more precise. With the price of drugs these days, there is probably a significant reduction in medication cost as well." The White House and reality TV Shoot Em Up isn't the only one who has been tracking HerdDogg's progress, of course. The young company, which relocated to Longmont last summer after launching in Oregon in 2013, has already raised $750,000 and is seeking another $1 million to $2 million this year. It spent much of last year participating in an agriculture-based Techstars program in Minneapolis and Brandao and her team won a visit to the White House in 2015 as part of a demo-days program. They were also featured on Intel's reality TV show, "America's Greatest Makers," in 2015. Rob Schultz is managing partner of Champaign, Ill.-based Serra Ventures, a venture capital company with an interest in ag technologies. Schultz and his partners invested $500,000 in HerdDogg and plan to participate in the next finance round as well. Prior to backing HerdDogg, Serra had invested in a data-gathering technology used on tractors, an investment that paid off when the company was acquired by the giant Monsanto Corp. "That was all about creating data sets to allow farmers to be more precise and improve yields. The next great frontier is livestock," Shultz said. "Imagine you're a rancher. All of your assets are roaming around outside your immediate access and control, and you have very little information on them. Being here in the Midwest, I talked to friends who are farmers and ranchers and was able to get their perspective. If they could save one cow or even detect illness earlier and treat it with one antibiotic shot rather than a vet visit, these are big deals for these farmers." Pilot projects and social media As with all startups, much work lies ahead. For now, the chips that go into the tags are manufactured in Brooklyn, N.Y., and quality control is being done in Longmont. New algorithms are being developed almost weekly, including those that will measure how often a cow is eating, chewing and swallowing, or "ruminating" as they say in the ag world. The technology is being tested in California, Oregon, Colorado and Brazil and HerdDogg has several notable partners, including Land O' Lakes and Shoot Em Up's home operation, the Silverado Ranch east of Colorado Springs in Ellicott. Gary Lake, who owns Silverado Ranch with Stan Searle, has 10 Texas longhorns in the pilot program. The full herd — 150 strong — graze on roughly 2.5 square miles of open pasture and Lake has attached the plastic dog-bone devices on watering troughs through the range area. While he's impressed with the biometric data the tags gather, he loves the novelty of its interface with social media apps such as Twitter and Instagram. "Most people who buy Texas longhorn cattle have just a few head. They love them for their color and horns. These are the kind of people who will really enjoy getting a tweet from a cow as she is heading up to the house from the pasture," Lake said. While Brandao is a big believer in social media, she has her eye on the worldwide livestock market, which is two billion animals strong. "I'm not a rancher," she said. "But it is so exciting to be around animals who've never had a voice. Maybe this will help ranching become more common again."

More like this Windows 10 posts user-share gains after multi-month stall Microsoft tries (again) to get people off Windows 7 Microsoft stops sales of Windows 7 Professional to OEMs Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Microsoft on Monday reminded customers running Windows 7 that they have just three years of support remaining, told them that the aged OS was "long outdated" and urged them to upgrade to Windows 10. Windows 7 will exit what Microsoft calls Extended Support on Jan. 14, 2020; at that point, the company will stop all security updates. [To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page.] Microsoft used the three-years-and-counting milestone to simultaneously denigrate Windows 7 and promote its successor. "Windows 7 is based on long-outdated security architectures," said Markus Nitschke, the head of Microsoft Germany, in a post to a German-language company blog, adding that the OS "does not meet the requirements of modern technology, nor the high security requirements of IT departments." On the other hand, Nitschke continued, "with Windows 10, we offer our customers the highest level of security and functionality at the cutting edge." The praise-the-new-denounce-the-old technique is as old as software, and one Microsoft has regularly applied. Three years ago, the company used some of the same tactics when it disparaged Windows XP, whose retirement was then quickly approaching, and trumpeted Windows 7 as its replacement. It repeated the claim, but with less effect, when it touted Windows 8 over 7 in 2012. But Microsoft's call to abandon Windows 7 has been louder, a shout in comparison. Not only has the firm done the usual -- favored the new over the old -- but it has also significantly changed decades of practices thought inviolable, such as patching, when it eliminated reasons why enterprises stayed with Windows 7. Other steps Microsoft's taken this cycle have been just as unprecedented. It gave away Windows 10 upgrades to millions of customers -- primarily consumers, but also businesses running Windows 7 Professional -- for a year. And although it eventually retreated from an aggressive deadline, Microsoft plans to support neither Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 after July 2018 on devices powered by Intel's newest Skylake silicon. Microsoft's assertive, even zealous, push of Windows 10 may have multiple motivations. It may want customers, particularly enterprises, to avoid repeating the mad rush near the end of Windows XP's lifecycle. Or it might be aiming for a faster adoption tempo to monetize Windows 10's software-as-a-service model as soon as possible. But while Microsoft has convinced more than a quarter of all Windows customers to take up 10, its efforts have been less successful in depressing the user share of Windows 7. According to analytics vendor Net Applications, Windows 7 powered 53% of all Windows personal computers last month. That's a decline of 14 percentage points from Windows 7's peak in June 2015, but nowhere near the pace necessary to push the OS to extinction within three years. Windows 7's current user share, however, is less than Windows XP's at the same point prior to its retirement, showing some progress. In April 2011 -- three years before being pushed off the support list -- XP accounted for nearly 60% of all Windows PCs.

The structurally deficient bridge, which spans the Potomac River from D.C. to Arlington, Va., will be closed to all vehicle traffic during Inauguration Day on Friday due to weight limits that have been imposed in recent years. In a letter to Trump’s nominees to lead the Interior and Transportation departments, Democratic Sens.

They called the bridge “a vital, yet dilapidated, artery for our nation’s capital.” ADVERTISEMENT “We request that you do all in your power to see that the rehabilitation of Memorial Bridge is fully funded,” wrote Warner and Kaine, the former Democratic vice presidential candidate. “Designed to be an ‘Avenue of Heroes’ and celebrate the reunification of the nation following the Civil War, the bridge is adorned by statues dedicated to valor and sacrifice. Memorial Bridge is not only a national memorial, but a critical multimodal link in the national capital region’s transportation network.” The bridge, which is marred by decaying steel, crumbling concrete and peeling paint, is considered one of the most vulnerable structures in the federal system. Although the Department of Transportation recently awarded the project a $90 million federal “FASTLANE” grant, the bridge needs a total of $250 million in repairs or else officials estimate that it will be forced to close in the next five years. “Without additional funding, however, Memorial Bridge will be forced to spend millions of dollars in the coming years for emergency repairs and will still face permanent closure if full rehabilitation is not achieved,” warned Kaine and Warner. About 68,000 vehicles pass over the bridge every day. Park service officials have emphasized that the bridge is continually checked and is currently safe to drive on. But the bridge will close without significant additional funding, which would cost local governments $168,000 per day, or $75 million per year, according to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. Transportation advocates have been cautiously optimistic about Trump’s pledge to usher a massive infrastructure bill through Congress, with Democrats identifying the issue as one of the few areas of compromise in the new administration. So far, Trump has floated a proposal that would offer $137 billion in federal tax credits to private firms that back transportation projects. But some critics say that private-sector dollars would only help projects that can recoup their investments costs through tolls or user fees, meaning some critical infrastructure needs would go neglected. “We’d be willing to talk about an infrastructure bill,” Pelosi said during a news conference Friday, “as long as it’s a real infrastructure bill that rebuilds the infrastructure of America, creates good-paying jobs, increases the paycheck of American workers and is not a tax break at the high-end, disguised as an infrastructure bill."

According to the FTC, Qualcomm used its dominant position as a modem supplier to muscle out competition by essentially giving smartphone manufacturers two choices: pay extra for use of its patents, or don’t make a widely available phone. Qualcomm denies the allegations, saying they’re “based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support, and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry.” “No license, no chips.” The FTC says that Qualcomm maintained a “no license, no chips” policy, whereby it would refuse to sell modems to companies that wouldn’t agree to its onerous licensing terms. Companies didn’t have much choice but agree to its terms, the FTC alleges, because Qualcomm is one of the only companies that can supply large quantities of high-end modems. If companies didn’t agree, they wouldn’t be able to make enough phones. Qualcomm’s licensing terms required that smartphone manufacturers pay a higher-than-usual fee for phones built with a competitor’s modem, according to the commission. In effect, Qualcomm is said to have made competitors’ modems more expensive than they should be. The FTC calls this a “tax” on competitors’ products, which it says “excludes these competitors and harms competition.” Qualcomm agreed to license these patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (also known as “FRAND”) terms, because they’re essential to industry-wide standards. It apparently won’t license these patents directly to competing modem suppliers, therefore allowing it to overcharge phone makers by threatening their access to modems altogether. Everyone loves a good FRAND dispute The lawsuit says that Qualcomm’s fees are “disproportionately high” relative to how much value they contribute to an overall device. They’re also too high relative to what competitors charge to use similar technologies, according to the lawsuit. Additionally, the FTC says, these added costs get passed down to consumers. For its part, Qualcomm says the FTC is flat out wrong about all of this, including the core of this lawsuit. “The portrayal of facts offered by the FTC as the basis for the agency’s case is significantly flawed,” Qualcomm says in a statement. “In particular, Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC’s allegation to the contrary — the central thesis of the complaint — is wrong.” Qualcomm painted the decision as a rushed one, designed to get ahead of the change over to a Trump administration — one that will certainly have a kinder outlook toward businesses — later this week. “We look forward to defending our business in federal court, where we are confident we will prevail on the merits,” says Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. Apple cut an exclusivity deal to get lower costs The lawsuit includes purported details of an agreement between Apple and Qualcomm that help to illustrate how harmful the alleged anti-competitive behaviors have been. In order to obtain relief from Qualcomm’s excessive patent licensing fees, the lawsuit says, Apple made an agreement not to use any other company’s modems for a period of five years. In exchange, Qualcomm paid back some of its fees. The supposed agreement helps to explain why it wasn’t until this year, when the deal is said to have ended, that Apple began using Intel modems in addition to Qualcomm modems. Intel has been trying to break into the smartphone chip space pretty much any way it can, but, from the sound of it, Qualcomm’s licensing terms essentially prevented it from making much headway. Intel declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The commission alleges that Qualcomm violated the FTC Act with these actions. It’s asking that a court “undo and prevent Qualcomm’s unfair methods of competition.” The lawsuit could be a big problem for Qualcomm. While the company is best known for making smartphone processors, most of its profits come from licensing patents, according to Bloomberg. This isn’t the first time regulators have come after Qualcomm’s licensing tactics either. It was fined $853 million by South Korea in December. And in 2015, Chinese regulators fined Qualcomm $975 million over anti-competitive licensing terms. Update January 17th, 5:48PM ET: This story has been updated with comment from Qualcomm.

Finance Search Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm hit with US antitrust suitAFP – Wed, Jan 18, 2017 12:46 AM AEDT Related Content View Photo In its court filing, Apple said it has been overcharged "billions of dollars" by Qualcomm's "illegal scheme" Mobile chip giant Qualcomm was hit Tuesday with a US antitrust suit alleging it abused its dominant position in the market for processors used in cell phones and other devices. The US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit in federal court in California claiming Qualcomm's practices amount to "unlawful maintenance of a monopoly in baseband processors," which are devices that enable cellular communications in phones and other products. Qualcomm rejected the agency's case as "significantly flawed," arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong. "In our recent discussions with the FTC, it became apparent that it still lacked basic information about the industry and was instead relying on inaccurate information and presumptions," Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a released statement. Qualcomm, which is the dominant provider of chips for smartphones, has faced similar antitrust investigations in the European Union and China, and last month was hit with a record fine of $850 million by South Korean enforcement regulators. In the US lawsuit, the FTC said Qualcomm's policy is to supply its processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm's "preferred license terms" for patents which are essential for mobile communications. "By using its monopoly power to obtain elevated royalties that apply to baseband processors supplied by its competitors, Qualcomm in effect collects a 'tax' on cell phone manufacturers when they use non-Qualcomm processors," the lawsuit said. "This tax weakens Qualcomm's competitors, including by reducing demand for their processors, and serves to maintain Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband processor markets." Qualcomm's actions have hurt competitors including Taiwan-based Via Technologies, which was acquired by Intel in 2015, and another Taiwan firm, MediaTek Inc. The suit also alleges that Qualcomm "extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties," which prevented the iPhone maker from getting processors from Qualcomm's competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm general counsel Rosenberg maintained that the FTC sped up the investigation, filing the suit just days before a change in the US presidential administration and with only three of five agency commissioners in place. "This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint," Rosenberg said. "It became apparent that the FTC was driving to file a complaint before the transition to the new administration." The San Diego, California, group in 2015 agreed to pay $975 million to settle antitrust charges in China. The tech group is challenging an EU competition inquiry which could result in a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual sales, which amounted to $26.5 billion for Qualcomm in 2015.
