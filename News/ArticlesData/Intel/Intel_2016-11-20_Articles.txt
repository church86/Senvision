Roston - Nov 21, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 8/10 Pros All-aluminum unibody Crisp and bright display Latest Intel processor Watchband hinge Very responsive touchscreen Cons Webcam is positioned beneath the display Right Shift key is small No SD card slot Lenovo has an update to its previously launched (and quite gorgeous) YOGA 900, and it is called the YOGA 910. This new model is no less beautiful than its 900 counterpart, bringing with it all the luxurious underpinnings and elements of the 900 with some notable updates, including a fully CNC-machined aluminum body and a 7th-gen Intel processor. Is the 910 worth the extra cost over the older 900? Read on to find out. Hardware The YOGA 910 is, first and foremost, a beautiful creation. The watchband hinge found on the previous model (and some other YOGA offerings) is included with the YOGA 910, as well as an all-aluminum body that, while slightly heavier than the previous version, takes the premium feel to a new level. The lid meets the base with a great deal of precision, and the watchband complements that with its slender, almost diminutive appearance. The watchband hinge is the perfect choice for a convertible laptop like the 910, enabling the display to be positioned at any angle from barely opened all the way back into full tablet mode. The display stays put wherever you position it; the hinge doesn’t have any wobble or any give, and it opens smoothly. The hinge aside, the aluminum on the lid, base and palm rest have a satin finish that’s pleasant to the touch, lending a nearly white appearance that isn’t prone to glares or smudges. The laptop’s edges, though, have a brushed high-shine look, adding an element of contrast without deviating from the all-aluminum construction. The left edge is unspoiled, featuring only two small USB-C ports, one for charging (USB 2.0) and the other for video-out (USB 3.0). The right edge features the power button, a 3.5mm headphone/microphone combo jack, and a USB 3.0 Type-A port. Joining these is a 720p webcam nestled below the display (when in regular laptop orientation), and a square silver fingerprint reader beneath the keyboard. The display is shrouded by very slim bezels save for the bottom edge (in laptop orientation), which features an atypically large — though in no way bothersome — black base. Two display resolutions are available with the YOGA 910, both of them with the 13.9-inch touchscreen offering: 3840 x 2160 UHD and 1920 x 1080 FHD. Our review model features the FHD resolution, so I can’t speak for the Ultra HD version’s quality. However, the 1920 x 1080 display is great itself, featuring both saturated (but not inaccurate) colors and a crisp look that doesn’t tread into over-sharpened territory. The YOGA 910’s keyboard and trackpad are arguably its two best features, at least in terms of everyday use. The low-profile keyboard is generously sized with keys that feel very pleasant while typing: they have a somewhat high level of resistance that doesn’t translate into stiffness. The trackpad also stands out as above average, not only responding well to touch but also being very easy to press. Unlike some past Lenovo models, I’ve not had any issues clicking or selecting items using the trackpad — it is very snappy with a low degree of travel and a sharp click when pressed. Finally, the YOGA 910 features four small rubber feet on the bottom, as well as a pair of speaker grilles drilled into the underside of the front edge. You won’t notice the speaker grilles unless you’re looking for them — they’re both relatively small and completely smooth with the underside of the laptop, being nearly imperceptible to the touch. Lenovo paid particular attention to the laptop’s audio; it features two JBL stereo speakers alongside Dolby Audio Premium. The speakers’ position on the rounded portion of the bottom edge means sound travels freely from the laptop to the user when in laptop configuration on a flat surface. Though it does become somewhat muffled in tablet orientation, the sound isn’t entirely sandwiched between the lid and base due to the bottom edge’s rounded design. One of the notable upgrades over the YOGA 900 is the newest model’s inclusion of Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. Buyers can get the YOGA 910 is various configurations that include up to a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor, as well as Intel HD graphics 620 and up to 16GB of DDR4 2133MHz memory. Storage, meanwhile, is available with up to a 1TB PCIe SSD. TECH SPECS Processor: Up to Intel® Core™ i7 processor OS: Up to Windows 10 Home Graphics: Intel® HD graphics 620 Webcam / Microphone: 720p with dual array microphone Memory: Up to 16 GB DDR4 2133 MHz Storage: Up to 1 TB PCIe SSD Audio: 2 x JBL®stereo speakers with Dolby Audio™ Premium Battery: Up to 9 hours with local video playback Display: – 13.9″ FHD IPS Multi-touch (1920×1080) with integrated camera – 13.9″ UHD IPS Multi-touch (3840×2160) with integrated camera Material: Aluminum Dimensions (inches): 12.72 x 8.84 x 0.56 Weight: Starting at 3.04lbs Backlight keyboard: Yes Fingerprint security: Yes Connectivity: – WiFi 802.11 ac – Bluetooth® 4.1 Ports: – USB 3.0 Type-C with video-out – USB 2.0 Type-C with charging – USB 3.0 with always-on charging – Audio combo jack Software & Performance The YOGA 910 only features two included bits of software: Lenovo OneKey Recovery and Lenovo Utility. The laptop runs Windows 10 Home 64, and so obviously you’ll also have access to Cortana and the other latest Windows features. Lenovo rates the YOGA 910’s battery life at up to 9 hours, depending on usage. This isn’t the longest run time Lenovo offers by any means, but is pretty great for an ultrabook of the caliber. Assuming you’re not doing something that’ll drain the battery rapidly (mining Bitcoins, perhaps), you shouldn’t have much issue reaching that 9-hour mark. Performance, meanwhile, is excellent in terms of both practical usage and benchmarks. Our review model features the 7th-gen Intel Core i7- 7500U 2.70-2.90GHz processor, and its Geekbench score reflects that. You can compare the results to the previous model in our YOGA 900 review from earlier this year. After using the YOGA 910 for a while, my complaints are very few and very minor. The webcam’s position at the bottom of the display is a bit awkward. Imagine taking a selfie by holding your phone near your chest pointed upward — it’s not the most flattering angle, and so you’re going to have to rotate the screen backwards for a more traditional angle — which means losing access to the keyboard for typing in chat at the same time. The only other issue I encountered was the right-side Shift key, which is a small square rather than a large rectangle (the left-side Shift key is a rectangle). This means the average typist is going to hit the “Up” arrow key when moving for the right Shift key until they adjust their muscle memory. If you’re someone who does a considerable amount of typing, this small design choice could be a huge annoyance for the first couple weeks. It should be pointed out that the YOGA 910 does not feature an SD card slot, as is increasingly becoming a trend. You’ll need to use a USB-to-SD adapter. While this may not be a big deal to some users, it does make the laptop a few ticks less attractive for photographers and others who frequently deal with these media cards. Wrap-up The Lenovo YOGA 910 stands out amongst the crowd. It is an eye-catcher in every sense of the word, boasting an all-aluminum unibody, the attractive watchband hinge, slim bezels, and a satin finish. Things only get better from there, with an excellent display and the option of a 4K resolution, both USB-C and USB-A ports, and the latest Intel processors. Even a machine as great as the YOGA 910 is not without its foibles, though, which largely center around the bottom-positioned webcam, the decision to use a small right Shift key rather than smaller arrow keys, and the lack of an SD card slot. If none of those things bother you, the YOGA 910 would make an excellent primary laptop. Price starts at $1,049.99 USD on Lenovo’s website.

Here's what it plans to do with it. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 21, 2016 at 4:10PM Back in August, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced it would purchase deep-learning chip startup Nervana systems. Re/code, citing a "source with knowledge of the deal," says Intel paid around $408 million for the company. Image source: Intel.  Although this acquisition is quite small for Intel, which raked in $3.4 billion in net income last quarter, the company seems to be quite bullish on Nervana's technology for its deep-learning and artificial-intelligence efforts. Let's take a closer look at what Intel's near-term plans are for this technology, then I'll finish off with what I expect to see Intel do with the technology in time. "Lake Crest" arrives in 2017 Intel says it will "test first silicon" of a deep learning-specific chip code-named Lake Crest during the first half of 2017 and will "make it available to key customers later in the year." Lake Crest is probably Intel's name for the Nervana Engine chip that Nervana was working on before Intel scooped the company up. According to Nervana's website, the Nervana Engine is a chip that can deliver deep-learning training speeds "10 [times] faster than conventional [graphics processing unit]-based systems and frameworks." The Nervana Engine. Image source: Nervana.  That chip is manufactured in what the company says is a "commodity 28 [nanometer] manufacturing process." This, the company claimed, "affords Nervana room for further improvements by shrinking to a 16 [nanometer] process in the future." Knights Crest comes later After Intel makes Lake Crest available, it intends to release a product that it calls Knights Crest. That chip, Intel says, "tightly integrates best-in-class Intel Xeon processors with the technology from Nervana." Lake Crest is manufactured on a commodity 28-nanometer technology, and Nervana indicated that the successor to Lake Crest would be manufactured in a 16-nanometer technology. Since only Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) offers a 16-nanometer technology, this points to TSMC as the manufacturer for Nervana's products. That means any Intel product that integrates Nervana technology launched in the near term will probably involve two separate chips together on the same package, rather than a single piece of silicon with both Intel and Nervana tech in it. Beyond Knights Crest I suspect that the next step for Intel as it relates to Nervana will be to bring a future version of the Nervana Engine to its own manufacturing technology. Indeed, one of the main reasons Intel bought programmable logic vendor Altera last year was that the company believed it could gain a competitive edge by moving Altera's products over to its own manufacturing technology. We'll see over the next few years how that all plays out. But I don't see why Nervana's technology, which seems as though it should benefit from advanced manufacturing technology, wouldn't be a prime candidate for Intel's manufacturing technology as well. Once Intel can pull that off, I see the company putting together a whole new type of chip that integrates the company's Xeon processor technology as well as Nervana's technology into a single piece of silicon. Such a product could be much more efficient than two separate chips bolted together on the same package. Business implications If Intel's Nervana buy is successful and if the market for deep learning continues to boom, then Intel stands to see increased revenue and profit from the sale of standalone deep learning-oriented products such as Lake Crest and, later, from integrated products. I don't see much of a future for standalone chips, and in the longer term I think all Nervana technology will be integrated with Intel's either on the same package or on the same silicon die as traditional Xeon processors. So once Intel starts selling integrated products, the ultimate financial impact will probably manifest itself as an increase in Intel's server chip average selling prices. This isn't going to be a game changer for Intel's business from a revenue perspective, since it's very hard for any one new product category to move the needle for a company as large as Intel. However, the better Intel can address profitable growth markets, the better off the company will be over the long term. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Brandon Lewis, Technology Editor - Leave a Comment Do you remember when one advantage of the ARM architecture was its limited number of instructions? After all, the “R” in “ARM” stands for reduced instruction set computing (RISC), and the benefit of this smaller instruction set architecture (ISA) was that it was simpler to program than complex instruction set computing (CISC) ISAs such as the x86-64 instruction set (which currently includes more than 2,000 instructions[1]). The more intuitive approach to programming and the fact that instruction sets for all ARM CPUs up to version 2 were available in the public domain helped the architecture gain popularity, and eventually aided in the mass adoption of ARM-based processors seen in the market today. However, as ARM IP took hold in segments ranging from mobile to networking to embedded systems, it became necessary to develop new cores tailored to those applications (Cortex-A, Cortex-M, and Cortex-R variants among them), and with them, new instructions. As a result, an ISA that originally included fewer than 100 instructions ballooned to 1070 in the ARMv8 architecture according to researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and ARM eventually elected to make their instruction sets proprietary in order to maintain them in accordance with their burgeoning semiconductor IP business. Unfortunately, the upfront licensing fees for an ARM IP core can range anywhere between $1 million and $10 million depending on the design[2], making the microarchitectures, and hence, the ISA, impractical for consideration by many academics and small startups. Realizing the complexity of the Intel ISA and the exclusivity (and explosion) in ARM’s, a team of academics at the University of California, Berkeley embarked on a what they thought would be a short project to develop a new RISC-based ISA. After completing the ISA in 2010 they made it available to the open source community, but received several complaints when attempting to make a change to it shortly thereafter. At that point the team realized the opportunity for an open-standard RISC ISA that was locked down – indefinitely. And so, RISC-V was born. Fewer and freer RISC-V is an open standard ISA, but as opposed to other open-source RISC implementations like OpenRISC, it is not standardized around a particular processor microarchitecture. Rather, RISC-V defines four base integer ISAs for 32-, 64-, and 128-bit processors that contain fewer than 50 hardware instructions each: the 32-bit RV32I; the 64-bit RV64I; the 128-bit RV128I; and the RV32E, which is a 16-register subset of the RV32I. A number of standard extensions also exist, including the general-purpose ISA (classified extension “G”); integer multiply/divide (classified extension “M”); atomic memory operations (AMOs) and load-reserved/store conditional (LR/SC, classified extension “A”); single-precision floating-point (classified extension “F”); double-precision floating-point (classified extension “D”); quad-precision floating-point (classified extension Q); and an optional compact subset for reduced code sizes (classified extension “C”). In addition, vector and crypto extensions are currently underway in working groups at the RISC-V Foundation. RISC-V was designed to operate independently of microarchitectural features, and, as mentioned, once work on an ISA component is finished by the Foundation it is frozen, forever. The ISA also provides clear separation between system software layers, with straightforward communications between an operating system (OS) and the system or applications facilitated through a system binary interface (SBI) and application binary interface (ABI), respectively (Figure 1). [Figure 1 | The RISC-V ISA communicates with the system execution environment (SEE) through a system binary interface (SBI), with the application execution environment (AEE) through the application binary interface (ABI), and with the hypervisor execution environment (HEE) through a hypervisor binary interface (HBI) in systems that employ a hypervisor.] What this means for chip makers is that, outside of the locked down opcode space reserved for the base ISAs and extensions (both current and planned), the Foundation has guaranteed not to intrude on remaining greenfield opcode space with future modifications. That greenfield opcode space is therefore available for developers to create their own instructions, allowing the standard to be extended in a proprietary way that, as Ted Speers, Head of Product Architecture and Planning for the SoC Group at Microsemi and a member of the Board of Directors at the RISC-V Foundation reveals, allows them to innovate around the “secret sauce that is really in the microarchitecture that you build around it.” “What’s important about the ISA at the end of the day is it’s not important. What’s important is that people can build and innovate a computer architecture with something that is well done,” Speers says. “Ultimately, the goal is that RISC-V becomes the common language of all new computer architectures going forward. “Although at its root it’s just another ISA, a lot of thought has gone into making RISC-V extensible, so there are natural groupings of instructions that you might want to use,” he continues. “For a microcontroller (MCU) you might just want to use the compressed instructions, or not the floating-point instructions. The point there is that the language is built and architected with different extensions that are appropriate for your application.” The minimalist flexibility and technology agnosticism of the RISC-V ISA makes it applicable in processor designs ranging from embedded MCUs to high-performance data center processors, as well as in heterogeneous system on chips (SoCs) that include multiple IP cores (Figure 2). Traditionally, the various IP in complex SoCs has required vast amounts of expertise spread out over large teams just to get the assorted cores talking to one another, much of which can be eliminated through comprehensive RISC-V libraries, such as those being developed by NVIDIA. [Figure 2 | The Microsemi SmartFusion2 SoC FPGA is among the first embedded processing solutions compatible with the RISC-V ISA (RV32IM implementation), and is supported by the company’s Libero SoC Design Suite and Eclipse-based SoftConsole integrated development environment (IDE).] Equally as important as the technology is the fact that RISC-V is license- and royalty-free, and operates under a BSD open source license, not a GNU license. Under a BSD license the standard can be used and extended without having to return those proprietary extensions to the open source community, enabling companies to leverage the foundations of RISC-V while still protecting the differentiation of special instructions tied to a microarchitecture that set their solutions apart. “If you’re in college or you’re at a startup and you want to make an innovation in computer architecture, your starting point should be RISC-V,” Speers says. “With RISC-V you can have complete control over the architecture you want to build with a well-designed ISA.” Reigniting innovation in semiconductors Tech industry giants such as Micosoft, HP, and Google have joined the RISC-V Foundation, alongside startups like Codasip and SiFive that are already bringing RISC-V-based solutions to market. RISC-V has been upstreamed by major open source projects including the Free Software Foundation, BeanUtils, the GCC, and Fedora, all of which indicates not only a growing amount of interest in RISC-V as an accessible technology, but also one with real commercial viability. But it’s just another ISA, right? “The whole vision is how to drive down costs, everywhere actually, starting with the ISA,” Speers explains. “I view RISC-V as the kernel for reshaping how design is done in semiconductors, and starting to dramatically lower the cost of producing new chips. That’s the end goal in mind. It’s not that the RISC-V Foundation can proudly say that they have this ISA, it’s that they want to dramatically lower costs – reignite innovation in semiconductors.” To learn more about RISC-V, the RISC-V Foundation, or upcoming workshops, visit riscv.org.

The big challenges ahead... By Kanishk Karan | Nov 21, 2016, 03.37 PM IST FacebookLinkedinTwitterGoogle+Reddit Continue reading After recently scrapping its SoFIA and Broxton mobile Atom chips comes off as another spoiler from the most popular chipset maker – Intel. According to a report by Techcrunch.com, the company is about to lay off the wearable market, majorly due to poor performance in its budding wearables business. Sources close to the company had disclosed the company’s plan to withdraw from wearable space, says the report. The move will have a significant hit on the employees in its wearable group, a portion of the company that was working on smartwatches, earbuds and electronics which were to be embedded in daily wears and other emerging technologies. However, the company is denying its move to step back from the wearable but has already informed a number of employees about the changes, with many expected to lose their jobs before year ends. Reports so far have been varied, but all point to a large job loss for those in the New Devices Group (NDG) and the possible shut down of the group altogether. Although no official remark has been given about the layoff, going by the previous records, it is clear that Intel has made sudden transitions in their business strategies, specifically by backing away from mobile phones where the overall investment crossed over $10billion in total. Intel’s Basis peak smartwatch was recalled back by the manufacturer and the company failed to provide details of the problem. With many online complaints and device overheating problem the company had nothing but refund as an option in order to recompense. MICA bracelet first and Basis Peak smartwatch are both dead now. Intel’s finest produce in wearable is the Intel Curie SoC, which is currently used by some of the top wearable makers out there such as Fossil, Oakley, New Balance and Tag Heuer. Also, having Qualcomm as a rival, Intel is having a stiff competition in wearables, with Qualcomm’s announcement of 100+ wearable products by end of this year; with shipping across 30+ countries, it is ready to take the lead. Watch manufacturer Nixon is the latest example of another company using Qualcomm technology. Intel is still in its nascent stages in wearables; even if the company would like to step back from the ongoing business, it wouldn’t be as substantial as the cutbacks that were announced in April when the chipmaker said it planned to quash 12,000 jobs. According to data obtained by The Oregonian/OregonLive last spring, Intel's entire new devices group had just 579 employees in the United States following those layoffs. Intel is sprightly focusing on other divisions like drone technology, virtual reality and autonomous driving which seems to have more promising business segments than the wearable consumer market. However, with increase in consumption of wearable, analysts have predicted the market to be worth $25billion by 2019. “The wearables market is set to treble in size in the next five years and become worth over $25 billion,” according to CCS Insight report. Its new global forecast for wearable devices — which includes smartwatches, fitness trackers, augmented and virtual reality headsets and wearable cameras — indicates the market is set to grow from 84 million units in 2015 to 245 million units in 2019. Looking at the predicted vertical and horizontal growth in the wearable market it is sure that the industry has potential, howbeit, Intel’s laying off is related more to its expansion in other technological segments.

Image: txking/Shutterstock In this era of acqui-hiring and pressure for tech firms to exit, there may be a danger that start-ups will sell out before they reach their full potential, writes John Kennedy. About a year ago, I met some start-ups in the life sciences world and marvelled at all the regulatory and financial hoops they had to go through, just to come up with a viable product they could bring to market. “Yeah, all I really want to do right now is get it to the point where we can make an exit,” one of the company founders said wearily. ‘In the last 18 months, a number of very exciting businesses were sold that I believe could have gone on and potentially become the next Kerry Group or Ryanair’ – RONAN PERCEVAL “Sacrilege!” my mind screamed. But yet I sympathised. You see, I still dream of a day when an Irish tech company will be a household name worldwide. When I hear of or report companies being acquired, part of my mind wonders: “What might have been?” Every exit is different A decade ago, there was a real sense that when a company was acquired – or sold out, depending who you were talking to – there was frustration that they could have gone the distance and gone public, like the numerous Israeli companies that float on Nasdaq by comparison. Now, an exit is an exit. The buck stops there and no one really asks: was it a successful exit though? Why did they exit? Did the founders get anything for their efforts? Who really wins here? We applaud exits through trade sales as if that was something to celebrate, not asking ourselves what might have been. This is not a black and white issue. Companies sell for many reasons. In the present era, acqui-hiring (buying a company to bring in the talent) is an accepted norm in the technology world. Companies like Apple and Google do this all the time and with such frequency that it rarely hits the news radar. Sometimes, a trade sale is the logical next step for the technology to develop. A tech giant like Microsoft or Intel may have the resources to bring the technology further along, and it is a nice result for the founders and investors. Movidius, the Irish chip firm behind AI technology in Google devices and drones from DJI, was acquired by Intel for a rumoured $300m. I sense it was the logical next step if the technology was to have a future. With Intel’s resources behind it, anything is possible. I sense the logic was the same for Cork firm InfiniLED, which was acquired by Facebook-owned Oculus to bring the technology forward. This was actually good news for Cork, because the company is likely to double employment. The same is likely for Barricade, the Cork company led by David Coallier, which was acquired by infosec giant Sophos for both its people and its AI-based technology. Then there is the mammy and daddy of all exits in Irish tech industry history: Verizon’s $2.4bn acquisition of Fleetmatics, a company founded above a shop in Terenure in 2004, which grew to connect 37,000 business customers and 737,000 vehicles. In a sense, Fleetmatics did go the distance; it became a multinational player and it listed on Nasdaq. Its acquisition came just two months after Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $25bn in cash. And then, of course, there are the acquisitions probably brokered by venture capital investors who want a return on their investment after five to seven years of round after round. This begs the question: how many companies prematurely sell out before their time because investors require a return? This isn’t so much a dirty little secret of the tech world as much as it is going to be an ongoing reality, as venture investments peak but the trickle of tech firms to IPO slows. Twilio and Atlassian were the two biggest IPOs of 2016, and now all eyes are on Snap Inc, with an IPO valued between $20bn and $25bn when it floats in March 2017. Its investors, who backed it to the tune of $1.8bn earlier this year, will do quite nicely out of the flotation. There are a myriad of reasons why a trade sale makes sense. One such reason is that it is the right thing to do for the technology and for the founders to develop to the next step of the journey. But the elephant in the room is the issue of trade sales that happen because investors require the exit for their balance sheets. It is nothing personal. That’s just business. Research in September by Mind the Bridge and CrunchBase on transatlantic M&As focused on 6,000 start-up acquisitions performed by US and European companies. It revealed that a total of 82pc of the deals have been completed by US companies. Only 18pc were by European companies. In other words, three out of four start-ups have been acquired by US companies. Some 21pc of the deals have been completed by Silicon Valley companies. Among the top 15 acquirers in the ranking, there are 11 Silicon Valley companies. None of them are from Europe; the first European one – Germany’s SAP – ranks 33rd. Long-term vision My thoughts on the long-term viability of young Irish tech companies were stirred in the past week by two founders I spoke to, who have eschewed successive rounds of venture capital in order to do things on their own terms. Business software company Teamwork, led by Peter Coppinger and Daniel Mackey, is ploughing $2m of its own cash into a new office refit, aimed at enticing the top developers in Europe to consider Cork. This comes two years after they spent €500,000 on the Teamwork.com domain name. At first, Coppinger recalled, people on internet forums thought this was a pair of entrepreneurs spending VC cash irresponsibly. “We weren’t VC backed, it was our own money,” Coppinger explained at the recent Web Summit in Lisbon. “We could have gone off and bought two Maserati cars but we decided instead to double down, reinvest in our company, and we spent half a million on a domain name. It was the biggest decision we ever made and it was amazing for us. Things have really taken off since that point.” Founded in 2007, Coppinger said that Teamwork – which employs 73 people and has 2.8m users worldwide from among 268,000 paying companies, including PayPal and Disney – is in charge of its own destiny. Turnover at the company has increased year-on-year and in 2015, the company is understood to have recorded €14.5m in revenues, and is eyeing a €20m target for 2016. The objective, says Coppinger, is to become a €100m per annum company. At the Web Summit, Coppinger said he had a boilerplate email prepared for venture capitalists who wanted to meet him. “I politely pointed out that we are not taking on investment but I’d be happy to meet for a coffee or a beer if they wanted to discuss tech trends.” He added: “We have millions in the bank, we are totally self-funded, there are only two owners; myself and Dan. We’re putting a share option scheme in next year to give a chunk of the company to all of the long-term employees. “We don’t have any plans to exit in the foreseeable future. We have a nine-year plan. We have a huge vision for where we want to take the company,” Coppinger said. Another company I spoke to that has no plans to exit any time soon is Phorest, the salon-booking software company founded by Ronan Perceval, Dylan Collins and Sean Blanchfield in 2003. While Collins and Blanchfield went their separate ways to form Demonware, which was bought by Activision in 2007 for $17m, Perceval steadily built Phorest up through tough times and a lot of bootstrapping. Today, Phorest has 110 employees and is profitable with revenues of around €9m. He told me last week that he believes start-ups are actually under too much pressure to sell. “We don’t intend to do another round of funding if we can help it, because we are of the belief that the real opportunity in this industry is over the long run of over 20 years. If we raise more money, then the outlook of the company will naturally become more short-term, as investors need a return within 5-7 years.” Aside from an initial angel funding round of €1.2m, Perceval said the decision not to take further investment had actually been the saving of the company when it went through ropey times and might have had to sell too early. “People sell out too early in my opinion. This isn’t to rain on anyone’s parade, because I know how hard it is to get a company to any sort of scale. But once a half-decent offer comes along, not only are your investors keen to realise their investment, but it means you would be financially secure for life. It is very hard to turn down. “Once a company exits, it usually means the end of the road for that idea. I know there are exceptions but they are very rare. In the last 18 months, a number of very exciting businesses were sold that I believe could have gone on and potentially become the next Kerry Group or Ryanair. “So how do we change that mindset? One way is for companies to bootstrap or be more self-funded, because then they are less under pressure to sell. Another is to encourage a situation where entrepreneurs can take more off the table, so that they aren’t under financial pressure or temptation when an offer comes along. I know the top guys in Enterprise Ireland are thinking deeply about this and am hoping to see some changes in policy from them around this,” Perceval said. The state agency Enterprise Ireland’s role in changing this mindset should indeed be interesting. After all, it ranks third in the world for seed investment, according to PitchBook. I used to hear of consternation at Enterprise Ireland when good software companies sold too early for any number of reasons. Today, those reasons are less obvious in an era where acqui-hiring as the destiny of the technology is seen as good business practice. But if companies are also under pressure to sell too early, that should be setting off alarm bells in the highest circles.

The segment didn’t really manage to take off how the tablets segment did. Some companies are known to have abandoned their plans for building the next smartwatch, and looks like Intel is all set to join the list. A new report claims that the company is laying off almost all of its staff from the wearable division. The report also talks about the unannounced Basis Ruby that can been cancelled, owing to the recall of the Basis Peak earlier this year due to overheating issues. The Basis Ruby was likely to be armed to track heart-rate, activities, sleep and more. The layoffs are likely to take place before the year end, if the report is to be believed. “The NDG was already folded into Intel’s New Technologies Group back in April, so an entire closure of the NDG could lead to wider restructuring within the division,” points out Slashgear. However, Intel had responded to the news article and told TechCrunch that it isn’t stepping back from wearables. However, it didn’t comment on the lay offs directly. An Intel spokesperson told the news site, “Intel is in no way stepping back from the wearables business. In fact, we have several products in the works that we are very excited about, as well as prior launches that highlight our wearable technology such as the TAG Heuer Connected watch and recent Oakley Radar Pace smart eyewear.” Back in 2014, when the smartwatch and fitness tracking segment looked promising, Intel had acquired the fitness-tracking watchmaker Basis.

Qualcomm-powered iPhone 7 models on Verizon network should have higher download speeds on paper than Intel-powered ones AT&T, however, in testing, Bloomberg reports it was found that iPhone 7 models from both Verizon and AT&T had similar speeds in real life. The Bloomberg report cited researchers at Twin Prime and Cellular Insights for testing. Recode in a separate report citing sources claims that Apple indeed limited some iPhone 7 models featuring Qualcomm chipset to match the speeds of Intel-powered chipsets. "It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible," said Ina Fried in her report. Apple has however refuted the claims of different download speeds.Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller commenting on the report said, "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models." For those unaware, the iPhone 7 models sold through Verizon (and Sprint) feature Qualcomm's X12 modem which is claimed to offer maximum download speeds of up to 600Mbps while iPhone 7 models on AT&T (and T-Mobile) are powered by Intel chipset with a maximum download speed of up to 450Mbps. Gabriel Tavridis, Head of Product at Twin Prime, on similar LTE speeds on the iPhone 7 models from Verizon and AT&T said, "The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon's network capabilities. I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip." Twin Prime from its internal testing claimed that the Samsung Galaxy S7 powered by the same Qualcomm X12 modem was way faster than the iPhone 7 on Verizon. There's no question that two models powered by different modems will perform same, but if the test reports are correct, then it seems Apple thought it would be awkward if iPhone 7 models on Verizon were faster than the ones on AT&T (and T-Mobile).

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Nov 20, 2016 at 3:35PM Image source: Disney. The next generation of nighttime entertainment kicks off at Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Florida resort tonight. The theme-park giant is teaming up with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), sending a fleet of 300 illuminated drones up in the air for a nightly spectacle at its Disney Springs shopping and entertainment complex.  Disney received clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration to use drones for entertainment purposes earlier this month, and after a few test runs in recent days we've arrived at tonight's debut of "Starbright Holidays -- An Intel Collaboration." The show features the drones with multi-colored lights forming swirling versions of Christmas trees, doves, and other pieces of illuminated art, synchronized to a soundtrack of classic holiday songs. The shows will run at 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. nightly through Jan. 8.  The show will take place over the lake that wraps along the perimeter of Disney Springs, offering decent viewing angles through most of the property. Keeping the drones over the lake also helps with safety concerns, as drones that fail during a performance would simply fall into the water. The drones are all backed with sensors so they don't collide with one another.  It's the season of giving Intel and Disney have a win-win relationship here. Intel gets to show off its Shooting Star drones, and while this is solely an entertainment application the real goal for Intel is synchronized drones in commercial operations that can help speed up everything from security operations to infrastructure inspections. Disney, in return, gets a high-tech spectacle that requires little in terms of human labor in this collaboration. Just one person can control the operation of the 300 drones. It also goes without saying that having a marquee attraction that will draw thousands, if not tens of thousands, of tourists and locals to Disney Springs will pay off in an even bigger way. Disney recently updated what used to be called Downtown Disney, adding several new high-end restaurants and stores to what was renamed Disney Springs earlier this year. This nightly holiday show will be successful, and it's safe to say that it will morph into a non-holiday drone show come January. The world's largest theme-park operator was struggling with Disney World attendance issues earlier this year, but it's fair to say that Disney Springs is drawing better now than Downtown Disney was in the past. Now that Disney's theme-park attendance turned around in Florida during the summer quarter and on-site hotel bookings are starting to pick up it sets the stage for a strong showing at Disney World in general and Disney Springs in particular during the peak holiday shopping season when it matters the most. Disney's drone show takes flight tonight, and if the media giant's aim is true, it will be the only thing that's still up in the air. Rick Munarriz owns shares of Walt Disney.

Buz Investors INTC Stock remains Bullish In October, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reported earnings that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Everything seemed great until Intel management threw a wrench into the party and disappointed the street and investors when they lowered their fourth-quarter guidance. The investing community punished INTC stock by taking it down 5.9% the next day. This was only the beginning of the slide as INTC stock continued to sell off until support was finally met at $33.42. All this selling pressure was putting my bullish view on Intel stock to a test, and this is exactly what this investment was doing as it was completing a backtes INTC Stock remains Bullish INTC Stock remains Bullish All this selling pressure was putting my bullish view on Intel stock to a test, and this is exactly what this investment was doing as it was completing a backtest.

This pattern has the potential to take Intel stock back to levels not seen since the dotcom mania. That is when INTC stock peaked at $52.87 in August 2000. The backtest serves to reaffirm that this is still a possibility. In July 2016, INTC stock broke out of this consolidation pattern, signalling that a new impulse wave is underway. The price got off to a good start, but the rise in the price was halted after the disappointing earnings report that sent INTC stock tumbling. The good news is that the weakness in the price has done little in the way of damaging the overall picture. INTC Stock: Backtest Year-to-date, Intel stock has set up and traded along a well defined uptrend line. This line is created by connecting the troughs on the price chart, and this trend line has effectively acted as support when any selling took place in INTC stock. The sell-off in INTC stock, caused by the the earnings report, ended immediately after the price tested this trend line. As long as the price remains above this trend line, the trend toward higher prices is intact and the impulse wave should continue to develop. This article was written by Richard Dambrosi for on .

Ian King, Bloomberg News 7:57 p.m. EST November 20, 2016 “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. (Photo: Kiichiro Sato / AP) It turns out not all iPhone 7s are created equal. The latest Apple Inc. smartphones that run on Verizon Communications Inc.’s network are technically capable of downloading data faster than those from AT&T Inc. Yet in testing, the two phones perform about the same, according to researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights. Neither firm is clear on the reason, but Twin Prime says it may be because Apple isn’t using all the potential of a crucial component in the Verizon version. “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models." It would be an unusual step for a major phone company to restrain its devices. Normally, companies battle to make the fastest, most reliable handsets. Apple may be doing this because it wants to ensure a uniform iPhone experience, according to analysts. "They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better," said Jan Dawson, founder of technology advisory firm Jackdaw Research LLC. "If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.” But the move could backfire if customers realize their device isn’t performing to its full potential, or that it’s less capable than other handsets, analysts said. "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product," said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. The firm does paid analysis for smartphone suppliers, including Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. The component at the root of the performance gap is the modem, a tiny chip buried deep inside a phone’s innards that turns wireless signals into data and voice. The iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone for several years to have versions with different modems. Verizon users get an iPhone 7 with Qualcomm’s latest X12 modem — capable of downloading data at up to 600 megabits per second. AT&T customers get a handset with an Intel modem that tops out at 450 megabits per second. Apple likely went with multiple suppliers to keep component costs in check. In field tests by Twin Prime, the Verizon version is a little faster than its AT&T stablemate — but not as fast as it could be. The firm proved this by doing the same tests onthe Samsung Galaxy S7, which also runs on Verizon’s network and uses the Qualcomm X12. The S7 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip, Twin Prime found. This was based on data from more than 100,000 phones downloading an image in large U.S. cities. Qualcomm’s X12 is capable of dealing with more channels of data simultaneously than its Intel rival, according to a report by Milan Milanovic, an analyst at Cellular Insights, which tests phones and networks. Apple didn’t enable this feature "to level the playing field between Qualcomm and Intel,”Milanovic wrote. Cellular Insights tests phones in labs with equipment that can vary the strength of the signal, basically approximating a phone moving from good coverage to poor coverage. The differences in performance between the handsets Milanovic tested were greatest when the phone signal was weakest, he said. Twin Prime and Cellular Insights have no relationships with chip makers, phone makers or wireless carriers. Four other network testing firms contacted by Bloomberg News said measuring phone data speeds is difficult because performance can be influenced by weather and other factors beyond the control of wireless providers and phone makers. Though none of these other firms disputed the findings of Twin Prime and Cellular Insights. In addition to creating a unified iPhone 7 user experience, leveling the playing field would also keep wireless carriers happy, according to some industry analysts. “Apple likely has some incentive to balance the performance of its iPhones across its U.S. operator partners," saidJeff Kvaal, an analyst with Instinet LLC. "It would be difficult, for example, to explain to AT&T, which remains the U.S. carrier with the most iPhone subscribers, why Verizon is offering a superior product." Representatives of AT&T, Verizon, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Companies that "de-feature or go with a less-advanced modem" may be left behind as the networks offer faster data speeds, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf said in a recent conference call, without naming specific firms. Apple is in this situation because it chose different modems for the latest iPhone. By pitting Intel against Qualcomm, the company may be trying to improve its negotiating position on price. Qualcomm’s modems have for years been almost ubiquitous in high-end smartphones, including iPhones. Intel has struggled to break into this market and has used subsidies to try to win share in mobile. Sacrificing performance in return for cheaper components may not go down well with Apple users. "It was probably multiple factors that drove that decision. But in the end, it was a bad decision," said McGregor. "It is really hard to argue for doing this because Qualcomm really does have the best modem technology." Still, many users may not realize their iPhone is different from their friends’ iPhones. And even if they do, they may decide Apple isn’t responsible. Most consumers blame their wireless service provider when a phone doesn’t work well, Milanovic said. 37 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2gbvPnH TOP VIDEOS Rossetti architects design Ashe Stadium's retractable roof 4:58 Utica schools students study science in 3D 1:21 Innovative Vehicle Design Challenge 1:01 Crash test dummies brought to life at Humanetics 3:04 Mary Barra on the next generation Volt 13:47 Mary Sue Coleman says universities should be 'innovators' in economy 8:18 MSU plant geneticist explains his work 1:50

You Can Run ExTiX Linux with LXQt 0.10.0 and Kernel 4.8 on Intel Compute Stick GO The ultimate Linux system now runs on Intel Compute Stick Nov 21, 2016 01:35 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  GNU/Linux developer Arne Exton announced the availability of a new build of his ExTiX distribution, which has been designed to run on the Intel Compute Stick device. ExTiX Build 161119 is the new version of the Linux-based operating system, powered by the latest Linux 4.8 kernel and using the lightweight LXQt 0.10.0 desktop environment as default graphical interface. However, the most important change in this release is that it ships with a kernel engineered to support the Intel Compute Stick mini computer. "I have made a new version of ExTiX – The Ultimate Linux System. I call it ExTiX 16.5 LXQt for the Intel Compute Stick. Build 161119 is only for Intel Compute Sticks. i.e. you can’t run the system on other computers," said Arne Exton in the announcement. "Build 161119 uses 'my' kernel 4.8.0-26-exton-IntelAtom with special patches." Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" and Ubuntu 16.10 "Yakkety Yak" Just like previous releases of ExTiX, Build 161119 is based on Canonical's latest Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) operating system, and the Debian Testing repositories, which will become Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" sometime in spring 2017. But, as mentioned above, it replaces the Unity user interface with LXQt 0.10.0. All packages included in ExTiX Build 161119 are at their latest versions as of November 19, 2016, and you can study the full list if you're curious to know what exactly landed in the new version. The most important software pre-installed are Google Chrome as default web browser, BlueGriffon WYSIWYG editor, and LibreOffice office suite. Users will also be able to use the Mozilla Thunderbird e-mail and news client, SMPlayer video editor, GParted partition editor, and Samba for reaching Windows computers. GCC and other compilation tools are available as well if you want to install software from sources.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Nov 20, 2016 at 3:35PM Image source: Disney. The next generation of nighttime entertainment kicks off at Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Florida resort tonight. The theme-park giant is teaming up with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), sending a fleet of 300 illuminated drones up in the air for a nightly spectacle at its Disney Springs shopping and entertainment complex.  Disney received clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration to use drones for entertainment purposes earlier this month, and after a few test runs in recent days we've arrived at tonight's debut of "Starbright Holidays -- An Intel Collaboration." The show features the drones with multi-colored lights forming swirling versions of Christmas trees, doves, and other pieces of illuminated art, synchronized to a soundtrack of classic holiday songs. The shows will run at 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. nightly through Jan. 8.  The show will take place over the lake that wraps along the perimeter of Disney Springs, offering decent viewing angles through most of the property. Keeping the drones over the lake also helps with safety concerns, as drones that fail during a performance would simply fall into the water. The drones are all backed with sensors so they don't collide with one another.  It's the season of giving Intel and Disney have a win-win relationship here. Intel gets to show off its Shooting Star drones, and while this is solely an entertainment application the real goal for Intel is synchronized drones in commercial operations that can help speed up everything from security operations to infrastructure inspections. Disney, in return, gets a high-tech spectacle that requires little in terms of human labor in this collaboration. Just one person can control the operation of the 300 drones. It also goes without saying that having a marquee attraction that will draw thousands, if not tens of thousands, of tourists and locals to Disney Springs will pay off in an even bigger way. Disney recently updated what used to be called Downtown Disney, adding several new high-end restaurants and stores to what was renamed Disney Springs earlier this year. This nightly holiday show will be successful, and it's safe to say that it will morph into a non-holiday drone show come January. The world's largest theme-park operator was struggling with Disney World attendance issues earlier this year, but it's fair to say that Disney Springs is drawing better now than Downtown Disney was in the past. Now that Disney's theme-park attendance turned around in Florida during the summer quarter and on-site hotel bookings are starting to pick up it sets the stage for a strong showing at Disney World in general and Disney Springs in particular during the peak holiday shopping season when it matters the most. Disney's drone show takes flight tonight, and if the media giant's aim is true, it will be the only thing that's still up in the air. Rick Munarriz owns shares of Walt Disney.

We have hardly had time to take in the economic trauma of Brexit. Now we have Donald Trump's equally unexpected victory in the US presidential election. During the US campaign, Irish observers may have found Trump's malevolent banter about "crooked Hillary" and his outrageous coiffure compelling, but The Donald phenomenon did not seem to have much to do with us. Google in Dublin at the Grand Canal. Photo: Steve Humphreys His victory seemed so unlikely that few took time to study his policies, including his plan to lure US multinationals back home from Ireland by dropping the corporate tax rate from 35pc to 15pc. Now, if some predictions prove correct, that could become a reality. The American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland, which represents the companies involved, was quick to offer reassurances that we are not about to suffer a mass 'Trexit' of companies. To Mark Redmond, chief executive of the chamber, Ireland's attractions to US are not all about tax. "US business leaders in Ireland view talent as the main reason why companies invest here," he said this week. There is a lot at stake for Ireland, as US multinationals currently employ 140,000 people. In areas dominated by these American corporate behemoths, it is not just the employees themselves who are utterly dependent on the US paymasters. It is also the vast network of linked companies and small businesses around them. Read more: Bannon is 'most dangerous political operative in the US' As well as employing 4,500 in Leixlip, Intel has depended on 756 Irish suppliers since it opened in 1989. The company supplies computers to local schools and offers scholarships. It subsidises sports clubs and the local Tidy Towns group. Apple employs 4,000 people in Cork, mostly at its Holyhill plant, but it is estimated that a further 2,500 people depend on the tech giant for their livelihood - from the makers of components, to builders working on the plants, to the fishmonger Pat O'Connell from the city's English Market who supplies the canteen. Around Dublin's Silicon Docks this week, there was understandable consternation at any suggestion that big US multinationals would be tempted to move. A whole economy of coffee shops, restaurants and swanky apartments has grown up around the hi-tech cluster that includes Google, Facebook, Linkedin and many other companies. In his thriving barbershop on Grand Canal Dock, Alan Austin says he's concerned by the latest developments, and Trump's promise to cut taxes in the US. "I would be absolutely devastated if any of these companies moved," says the Austin, who welcomes hundreds of the casually-attired employees from the nearby tech companies. He opened his first barbershop just as the economy was about to crash in 2008, but he couldn't have picked a better place. While businesses elsewhere went belly up, and property prices collapsed, Google continued to grow and with other companies eventually arriving, Silicon Docks was dubbed the most potent symbol of Ireland's economic recovery. We may complain about their low taxes, but Austin believes the multinationals kept businesses ticking over during the recession. Alan McQuaid, economist with Merrion Capital, agrees. "I would say that during the financial crisis that without the multinationals, the Irish economy would have been well and truly knackered," he says. But now the doomsayers warn that if Trump and his acolytes do what they say they want to do, it could be the biggest threat to Irish prosperity since the crash - and its effects could be deeper and more long-term. Read more: Do you have TDS? (Trump Derangement Syndrome) There were alarm bells in recent days when one of Trump's top economic advisors, Stephen Moore, issued a stark warning after the election. The man who helped devise Trump's economic policies warned that a "flood of companies" will leave Ireland under the President-elect's planned new tax regime. The news comes after Brexit, which has already led to the collapse of some Irish businesses, and seen a flood of shoppers crossing the Border to snap up bargains. Trump himself has described his successful movement as "Brexit Plus, Plus, Plus". Would the multinational jobs really be under threat if Trump succeeds in pushing through his measures? If we want to read the tea leaves and predict our economic future, we should perhaps ignore the humdrum goings-on in the Dáil. Instead, we should watch the real -life House of Cards drama playing out in New York and Washington, as right-wingers jostle for position in the US government. The wrangling was described as a "knife fight" by CNN as different factions fought for positions. Part of Ireland's future may rest on which faction wins out, and whether they wish to go along with the massive corporate tax cut. According to some estimates, it could cost the US government up to $9 trillion over the next decade to implement it. "It is not clear what Trump will be able to do, because he is just the president, and at the end of the day he still has to get things passed through Congress. Obama also made noises about changing corporation tax, but nothing much came of it because it was blocked," says Dr Edgar Morgenroth, economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). Dr Morgenroth believes that even if the US corporate tax is lowered to 15pc, it is unlikely to have a dramatic effect in the short term. Massive corporations have spent billions opening factories and office complexes in Ireland in recent years "If you have spent a lot of money on a new headquarters and hired staff and everything is going okay, you're not just going to suddenly say 'We're out of here'." The economist says changes to corporate tax rates may have an effect in the long term, however. While Google and Apple might stay, some economists believe there will be less incentive for US companies to move their operation over here. Dr Morgenroth says the negative effect of the Trump phenomenon is that it has increased uncertainty in Ireland. "Uncertainty is a bad thing, because people can't make decisions on investment if they don't know what is going to happen." He says Ireland now finds itself in an uncomfortable place, with the difficulties caused by Brexit, and pressures from the European Commission to change our system of corporation tax, combining with the Trump phenomenon. As one commentator joked this week: "Ireland is in a difficult position. There's Trump to the left us, Brexit to the right. We're stuck in the middle with the EU." The future of new investment by American companies in Ireland may be uncertain as a result of the Trump measures, but companies such as Intel are deeply embedded. Leixlip county councillor Joe Neville was still a child when the plant was being built, and remembers being impressed by the spacesuit-like gear worn by the staff in the "clean rooms". "People of my generation grew up with it and four out of my 10 best friends work there. Both Intel and Hewlett Packard are very community oriented." Neville has seen for decades the effect of Intel on the economy in the area and says that hundreds of local people, apart from the employees, depend on the factory for their livelihood. "There are many people who work as contractors doing cleaning, landscaping and construction. "It is impossible to forecast what he will do. "Personally, I wasn't all that concerned when Trump won, because we have heard of proposals to cut the corporate-tax rate in America before, and it has never happened. "Obama talked of doing it and no doubt it could have been part of Hillary's agenda as well," Neville says of Trump's corporate-tax plans. Read more: 'Two Trump supporters asked me if I was legal... now I engage less with customers' In the short term, economists seem to be more concerned about the effects of Brexit than Trump's political soap opera. As well as trying to predict what might happen in Washington, they are observing what is happening in Number 10 Downing Street as the British Government tries to implement Brexit. A leaked memo prepared by the consultants Deloitte painted a picture of chaos at the heart of the British government, with splits between ministers and the civil service struggling to cope. "It is clear that they don't have a plan in London, and I don't know why anyone is even talking to them," Dr Morgenorth of the ESRI says. The economist predicts that there will be a "hard Brexit", which would mean much tighter restrictions on movement and trade between the UK and EU countries. So far, there has been little sign of a resolution to the question of what would happen to the Border between North and South. One notion that has been floated is the idea that Britain is seeking to shift the frontline of immigration controls to Ireland's ports and airports to avoid having to introduce a "hard border". But Dr Morgenroth describes this idea as "utter and total nonsense". He says it is quite possible that Britain will leave the customs union, the free trade area in the EU, and in that case there would have to be Border controls. The collapse of sterling in anticipation of Brexit has already hit Irish businesses, particularly in the food sector, as Irish exports to Britain have become less competitive. Up to five mushroom producers have gone out of business since Brexit. But even when Britain leaves the EU, and if Trump lowers corporation taxes, there may still be a silver lining for Ireland, according to economist McQuaid. "Ireland will be the gateway to Europe for US companies, and it will help us that we are the only English-speaking country in the EU." McQuaid says a 15pc corporate tax rate may be hard to implement in America. He points to differing opinions in the Republican party, with some influential figures advocating a 24pc rate. It is possible that a compromise will be reached with a figure of 20pc, but this is likely to be phased in over a long period. "We can't take things for granted, but this is not the end of the world by any means," McQuaid says.

This was what made last week’s AI Day from Intel so interesting for me.  Yes, they had the typical comments on performance and smart robotic devices which catch everyone’s interest, but they also uniquely had a focus on AIs that could be used to make us better people.  After the last few months of a nasty primary election here in the U.S., I’m pretty sure I know at least two people that could have used one of these things.   Let’s talk about how an AI could make you appear a ton smarter and less likely to hurt people you care about.  The Technology Problem We all do things we later regret, ranging from shopping to tweeting under the influence, to responding in anger inappropriately, to forgetting that what sounds funny in our head may sound racist, sexist, or like grounds for termination to the folks that receive our poorly thought through email, instant message, social media post, or text.  Sometimes just spending an extra few seconds thinking about what folks might actually think when they read what we wrote could save a friendship or a job and yet, I’m sure, every one of us has said or written something, likely a number of something’s, that we now wish we hadn’t.   This isn’t just an electronic issue either, as I’ve ended important relationships with letters that were ill thought through, and this was after I’d observed my father, who was particularly bad at this, destroy companies with his ill thought through correspondence.  But, at least sometimes, because it took so long to write and then post a letter, there was at least the chance we’d think better of what we were doing and not actually mail the thing.  Back then a lot of us wrote things that we never actually mailed because our slow brains actually kicked in before we took that final step of putting the letter in the mailbox.  But technology made things faster; particularly with Twitter, where you can formulate and execute a comment often before you’ve even thought through what you are writing, let alone whether you should hit send.  So, technology, at least with regard to our doing stupid things, focuses first on speed, with the end result being that a lot of us are doing far more public stupid things.  What we need is an alert system that warns us, before we hit send, of the implications of our action.  AI Guardian Angel You know there are two modes for the AI being considered for autonomous cars; one is where you don’t drive at all and the car does all the work.  The other is called “Guardian Angel,” and this is where you seem to be driving but, should you do something stupid or unsafe, the car instantly takes over and prevents it.  A drunk driver, in that latter mode, would be like a child in a car seat with a steering wheel, completely disconnected from the car’s systems but still thinking they were driving and free to say “vroom, vroom” anytime they wanted.  This can be applied to social media and email. What Brian Krzanich, Intel’s CEO, seemed to be talking about is a system that would intercept your hasty post and first advise you not to send it, articulating the likely repercussions, and then actually help you formulate something else that made you look far smarter and would be more likely to accomplish the goal you intended rather than the one you did not, like getting fired.   This same AI could flag fake news before you clicked on it, or worse, before you forwarded it. This would work not by preventing you from seeing it, but by suggesting you take that extra step and make sure you either assured its accuracy or included the language “I found this interesting but, be aware, my AI says this may not be true” when you forward it to others, better protecting yourself.  Like you, I have a number of relatives that apparently believe anything and I’ve given up chastising them about it, concluding, like I expect many on their distribution list, that they are incurable idiots.  If an AI like this could make people that seem to relish in being idiotic look smarter, think what it could do to those of us who actually try to think before hitting send? Wrapping Up: Over the next few years we’ll have AIs that translate what we say, with nuance in place, to any other language; AIs that can, with punctuation, do speech-to-text for us, speeding up our correspondence and decreasing dramatically our chances of looking stupid and ending our careers.   It is somewhat comforting to know we will also have AIs that could be used to significantly offset, and perhaps eliminate, this risk so that instead of appearing insanely foolish we actually look smarter.   With so many warning that AIs will be the end of us, it is nice that firms like Intel are working to prevent that eventuality—even if it is only to make sure we don’t become our own worst enemy.   Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles The Myths and Legends of Artificial Intelligence By: Special Guest    12/27/2016 Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the hot and trending topic everyone's been talking about these days.

While a number of TVs and set-top-boxes already support 4K Netflix streams, the PC has largely been left out of the high-quality streams due to piracy fears. Netflix is now supporting 4K streaming through Microsoft's Edge browser, but you'll need a new PC to actually make use of it. Netflix is only supporting 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processors, and there aren't many laptops that actually support both the 4K display required and the new Intel processors. As a result, Microsoft is using the 4K Netflix support as a marketing effort for its Edge browser and to encourage people to upgrade their hardware to watch new episodes of the Gilmore Girls. It all might seem like a bit of a con, but it's largely the fault of DRM requirements from Hollywood studios and TV networks. Content providers have strict controls for 4K playback, so that streams can't be captured and redistributed illegally. The latest hardware decryption features simply aren't available on older Intel processors, and the new Kaby Lake chips now support 10-bit HEVC, a popular 4K video codec. So if you don't have a new PC, you'll have to wait until you need a hardware upgrade before you'll be watching Netflix in 4K. Or, just buy a streaming stick like the Chromecast Ultra or the latest Roku to take advantage of Netflix in 4K.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Rumor: Intel Coffee Lake will take hexa-core CPUs mainstream in 2018 by Bruno Ferreira  11:54 AM on November 21, 2016 Laptops with Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs inside are becoming more and more common, but the company's seventh-generation CPUs have yet to materialize on the desktop. That's not stopping the rumor mill from dredging up information on products that are further out still. Today's leak comes from BenchLife and contains info about Coffee Lake CPUs, which are purported to come out in 2018. Most tantalizingly, the new chips might come in variants including a six-core desktop part. Source: BenchLife What we can glean from Google's translation indicates that Coffee Lake (henceforth known as CFL) come in U, H, S, and X lineups. The H version seems to be aimed at mobile devices, the S version appears to be targeted at desktops, while the X model will be the high-performance model for Socket 2011. BenchLife suggests the U variant has a "4+3e" die arrangement, which we can interpret as a quad-core CPU with Iris Pro graphics and eDRAM on board. The listed die size is particularly large, something that at first sight would indicate a desktop part. However, the U label has historically been reserved for mobile parts, so your guess is as good as ours. The rumored desktop S parts will come in four- and six-core flavors. Don't expect much in the way of GPU changes in the new lineup, since all the listed variants mention Kaby Lake's "Gen9" graphics architecture. Meanwhile, CFL-H is only available with six cores. Interestingly enough, there's no mention of any dual-core parts at all. That might lead one to wonder if Intel will just keep Kaby Lake humming along to fill out the range of low-end CPUs. Source: BenchLife The leaked slide mentions an "LGA 37.5 mm x 37.5mm" socket for CFL-S, but it's tricky to assume that means Intel will continue using the LGA 1151 socket, especially since a new chipset called Cannon Lake will reportedly underpin the CFL chips. Cannon Lake should bring native USB 3.1 support and direct connectivity to NFC readers and fingerprint sensors, in what we presume is a Secure Enclave-like arrangement. BenchLife says all these new chips will arrive in 2018. The desktop S version will reportedly arrive in February 2018, while the U variant will come in March of that year. Meanwhile, CHL-H should arrive in April 2018.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem Apple reportedly limits Verizon iPhone 7 modem speed to match AT&T model Verizon iPhone users will have to survive with "only" 450Mbps download speeds. by Jon Brodkin - Nov 21, 2016 5:20 pm UTC Login to bookmark 45 The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Andrew Cunningham Apple has been limiting the modem speeds of the iPhone 7 built for Verizon Wireless's network in order to match the slower speeds of the AT&T iPhone, according to reports Friday by Bloomberg and Recode. The Verizon iPhone 7 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon X12 modem that is capable of LTE download speeds of up to 600Mbps, while the AT&T model uses an Intel XMM 7360 that goes up to 450Mbps. But Apple limits the Verizon model so that it performs similarly to the AT&T one; to achieve this, Apple may disable certain features of the network chip, Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg's report is based on data from testing firms including Cellular Insights, which wrote about its findings on its blog. "Out of all supported features by Qualcomm’s solution, Apple has chosen to implement 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink for contiguous Band 7 or Band 41," Cellular Insights analyst Milan Milanovic wrote. "Higher Order Modulation (DL-256QAM, UL-64QAM), and Higher Order MIMO (4×4 MIMO) have not been implemented. Therefore, the peak theoretical downlink speeds are limited to 450Mbps when aggregating three 20MHz wide LTE component carriers." The Verizon iPhone was still slightly faster than the AT&T one despite not reaching its full capabilities, according to field tests by Twin Prime, Bloomberg wrote. The iPhone was significantly slower on Verizon than the Samsung Galaxy S7, which uses the same Qualcomm chip. The Verizon model is also used for the Sprint network, while the AT&T model is also used on the T-Mobile USA network. The AT&T/T-Mobile variant does not support the CDMA voice and data networks used by Verizon and Sprint. An iPhone user isn't going to hit 450Mbps under typical network conditions, so it's unlikely anyone would notice the speed limitation without doing some extensive testing. But the enforcement of consistent speeds despite the use of different chips demonstrates how Apple and carriers view the importance of similar performance across networks, even when that requires limiting one phone's capabilities. Apple historically used Qualcomm modems for the iPhone but this year decided to use both Qualcomm and Intel ones. "By pitting Intel against Qualcomm, the company may be trying to improve its negotiating position on price," Bloomberg noted. Apple also uses components from multiple suppliers to make sure it can produce enough iPhones to meet consumer demand. For example, Apple used both Samsung and TSMC to make the A9 chip for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. Since carriers had no control over the modem decision, "it would be a little unfair if Apple allowed, say, Verizon and Sprint to say that their iPhone performs better than AT&T and T-Mobile’s," Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said, according to Recode. Dawson also noted that it isn't uncommon for phone makers to leave some features disabled to save on battery life, "so you rarely see a phone that’s maxed out on all possible performance parameters." Apple provided a statement to Bloomberg and Recode confirming that iPhones across different networks perform similarly, but the statement did not address how Apple limited the speeds of the Qualcomm modem. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models," Apple said. We contacted Apple today, but the company declined to provide any further information. Expand full story Reader comments 45 You must login or create an account to comment.

How Rogue One's Imperial stormtroopers SAVED Star Wars and restored order More like this Xpoint Wikibon Data Center Storage Wikibon invokes the old gods to make six tech predictions for 2017 Consumer volume driving ARM and OpenCAPI forward, and its lack hobbling XPoint 21 Nov 2016 at 17:04, Chris Mellor Analysis Wikibon's chief technology guy, David Floyer, has put out his top six disruptive tech tips for 2017, seeing that ARM and Open CAPI will separately grow at Intel's Xeon expense, the cloud at on-premises' Server SAN expense, and flash at disk drive's expense, while XPoint will be a 2017 dud. Here's his list: AWS will introduce server SAN software storage system for enterprises Introduction of volume ARM-based servers Big Data and Map-reduce functionality inside flash drives announced Open Power with CAPI and NVIDIA GPUs will radically outperform x86 for big data and AI computing Steep decline of HDDs shipped XPoint will stall Amazon introducing a Server SAN offering? Why? He thinks it's growing in acceptance because "the cost of moving data, especially large amounts of IoT data, is far more expensive than processing the data locally". Wikibon supports the idea of Server SAN replacing SAN. He says that with large amounts of IoT data both in the cloud and on-premises (local clouds) then "having the same storage software and APIs in both the central and local clouds is a giant step towards cost-effective and performant hybrid clouds". Floyer believes consumer acceptance of and hence volume for a technology is vital for its development and adoption by business. The phenomenal rise in smartphones using ARM processors is displacing low-end PCs and eroding the PC market, leading to declining x86 processor volumes. This, together with Xeon's upmarket functions, feature set and cost is proving the impetus for developing ARM servers. Indeed, he sees a role for ARM CPUs to be embedded in flash controllers to run Big Data applications at a drive level, such as Map Reduce. This is a different take on Seagate's smart drive idea, which they applied to disk drives with the Kinetic technology of Ethernet-accessed, object-style, key:value store disk drives. As far as market acceptance goes, Kinetic disk drives appear to have fallen short, and Floyer evidently prefers smart flash drives. The Wikibon CTO sees OpenCAPI, with its CPU-memory-IO adapter interconnect scheme, as a game-changer, not least because NVIDIA GPUs have consumer volume support. The progressive flash takeover of disk drive storage responsibilities will continue in 2017. Performance disk drives (15,000rpm) are being given the heave-ho by flash, with 10,000rpm spinners facing an increasing onslaught as 3D flash gains layers and so capacity, and loses per-GB expense. The proportion of PCs using SSDs instead of disk drives is steadily increasing. Flash foundries are increasingly talking of QLC (4bits/cell) flash as a fast-access, cold data store, raising the prospect of disk archiving getting squeezed out between cheap and fast flash on the one hand, and cheaper-still tape on the other. The lack of any consumer acceptance for 3D XPoint systems or volume application demand for XPoint leads him to believe XPoint will not be a significant aspect of the 2017 tech scene. This is at least partly due to Intel over-hyping the technology and indications that products using it are coming in way under early specifications. He doesn't think that XPoint ship volumes will be too low to fund future investments and manufacturing volume increases, which might drive down prices. There is a prospect here that XPoint could fail. Alternative post-RAM non-volatile memory technologies such as Resistive RAM are being developed and the bulk of the non-volatile memory foundry suppliers have absolutely no interest in XPoint succeeding, meaning Samsung, SK Hynix, WD-Toshiba, and others. With Diablo and Xitore pushing the idea of DRAM caches front-ending flash or ReRAM or even XPoint and so enjoying DRAM speed rather than slower NAND, ReRAM or XPoint then the relative speed on NAND vs ReRAM vs XPoint becomes less important. XPoint isn't the only filler for the DRAM-flash gap and Intel, with its marketing function's effectiveness devalued because of the seemingly gross over-hyping of XPoint, has a tremendously difficult job in establishing a generally perceived role that only XPoint can meet. XPoint could be coming closer to a crossroads. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Intel's Optane XPoint DIMMs pushed back – source First media unsuitable for DIMM use and ASIC tuning needed 2 Comments Double-DIMMed XPoint wastes sockets Analysis It makes me cross 15 Comments Want to use 3D XPoint DIMMs with Intel Purley Xeons?

We have fourteen different teams and fourteen different takes on which system configuration is best suited to take on the applications in this year's competition. We're seeing some changes from previous competitions. Average node counts are down significantly from 6.5 nodes and 9 nodes per team at the last ISC and ASC competitions to 4.2 nodes (when the outlying 37 node FAU system is subtracted). We're also seeing accelerator usage spiking, with the average team using 7.9 accelerators (almost all GPUs) versus 6.8 at the International Supercomputing Conference (ISC16) and 4.0 at the Asian Student Cluster Competition (ASC16). Average memory per cluster this year is down, with students running 760 GB per system at SC16 versus 1.1 TB at ASC16 and 948 GB per system at ISC16. Interesting trends indeedy... It's all over the map this year. Let's go through it team by team... FAU: This is the third competition for Friedrich-Alexander University, Germany, and the first time they're running an unaccelerated cluster. The team is hoping that having a lot of CPU cores (592) and the most memory (by a large margin) will give them the upper hand on the applications. They're using the highly modular HPE Moonshot system, equipped with 37 nodes of ProLiant M510 server cartridges. Like most teams, they'll be throttling down their processors in order to stay under the 3,000 watt power cap. Interconnect wise, the team is utilising the integrated 10GbE RoCE, which gives them the ability to use RDMA over Ethernet. HUST: This team from Huazhong University of Science and Technology won the ASC16 cluster competition in their hometown of Wuhan. Huazhong is using their standard time-tested configuration of four Xeon nodes plus eight accelerators. This is same basic configuration that gave them the win at ASC16 and punched their ticket to ISC16. The major difference is that they're using NVIDIA P100s rather than K80, which should give their cluster a lot more punch. The HUST team is sporting the least amount of disk in the competition, giving them a bit more power to use for processing, but shorting them on disk capacity when it comes to application storage and check-pointing. Nanyang: This veteran Singapore-based team from Nanyang Technological University won the LINPACK battle at ASC16 so they've tasted the sweet nectar of victory and are hungry for more. They seem to favour smaller node counts with lots of accelerators, which tends to make me think they're again aiming for the LINPACK title. At SC16, they're running a Dell four-node box with 176 CPU cores, and a total of eight NVIDIA P100s, with 512GB of memory. It's all tied together with speedy 100Gbps Mellanox EDR InfiniBand, which is what most teams are using these days. Nanyang is a team to keep an eye on, they feel like they're ready to break out of the pack. NTHU: National Tsing Hua University from Taiwan is another university that has participated in plenty of cluster competitions and has notched more than their share of victories. NTHU was one of the first teams to win with accelerators and is always a solid competitor. They typically sport eight-node systems, but this year, they're slimming down with a four-node sportster. Like other teams, they're augmenting their 176 CPU cores with eight NVIDIA P100 GPUs. They've also configured an above average amount of memory with 1 TB total. NE/Auburn: The combined team of Northeastern University and Auburn University turned out to be the one to suffer significant hardware problems at the SC16 competition. In this case, "significant" problems turned out to be their entire cluster being lost in shipping. They were forced to scour the show floor to find enough systems to cluster up, which they did very well. Unfortunately, they ended up with a small mishmash of three boxes that yielded 44 CPU cores, some memory, four NVIDIA K40 accelerators, and four AMD R9 Nano accelerators. They did a hell of a job putting all of this together at the last minute and being able to run all of the applications – so hats off to them for showing the real Student Cluster Competition spirit. Peking University: Now this is a team that's breaking barriers when it comes to cluster competition hardware. They are the first team to run with the whole schmear of OpenPOWER gear. Their cluster consists of dual nodes fuelled by dual Power 8+ processors running at 4GHz for a total of 32 CPU cores. What's really exciting is that this system includes the NVIDIA NVLink connector to give Peking's 10 (TEN) P100 GPUs an up to 80GBps connection directly to the CPUs. But the team didn't stop there. They added dual Xilinx FPGAs in order to help out with the password-cracking application. This is one hell of an accelerated system and it'll be interesting to see how it does in the competition. San Diego: This is the first student cluster competition for the San Diego State University. The Aztec Warriors are driving an Intel Kennedy Pass motherboard-based system with four nodes and 348 CPU cores on the compute node (28 cores on the head node). The system is rounded out with 256 GB total memory and an Mellanox InfiniBand FDR interconnect. MGHPCC: A perennial competitor, Massachusetts Green HPC Center is a combined team from several Boston area universities. They've also been dubbed (by me) "Team Boston" or "Team Chowder". Some of the team members competed at this year's ASC, where they were initially confounded by InfiniBand. This year, the team seems much more comfortable with this technology, using it to drive their three-node cluster. Their system this year should be called "the unity cluster" since it's a combination of AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon nodes. They've also cobbled together dual NVIDIA P100 GPUs and four AMD R9 Nano accelerators. Like the team itself, it's quite an eclectic bunch of equipment. TUM: The Technical University of Munich is another team that's setting new precedents in the cluster competition. They're the first to field a cluster entirely made up of Intel Knights Landing processors – used in host mode. Their cluster consists of eight one-socket nodes, each with one 72 core Phi processor running at 1.5 GHz. They've gone all in with Intel, using Omni Path Architecture as their interconnect. As you'll see in the upcoming team video, they've also started a "Phi Club", complete with rules (the first two being "you must talk about Phi Club"). EAFIT: The Universidad EAFIT team from Colombia is rapidly becoming one of the most experienced in the competition. I've seen this version of the team at ASC, ISC, and SC competitions over the past few years. This year, they are driving a OpenPOWER 8-based cluster complete with four NVIDIA K80s and a speedy Mellanox EDR interconnect. While the processors and interconnect are pretty fast, bringing the venerable K80 to SC this year is like bringing a knife to a machine gun fight. I'm not sure the plucky kids from Colombia have fast enough hardware to hang with the big boys. Experience counts for a lot in student clustering, but it can't overcome a lack of hardware. Illinois: The team from University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana (or Urbana-Champaign, according to the team) is another first-time competitor. They're running a fairly standard cluster with five compute nodes, each outfitted with dual Xeon 20 core processors (total 200 cores), a NVIDIA K80 GPU, and 256 GB of RAM. They have a decent enough cluster, but are a bit weak when it comes to accelerators in comparison to other teams. USTC: The University of Science and Technology of China is really bringing it this year. This will be their third cluster competition and it looks like they're going all out to either take LINPACK or break the power monitors on the PDUs. Their six-node system is jam-packed with 216 CPU cores and 18 (eighteen!) NVIDIA accelerators. They're sporting ten P100s and eight GTX 1080s. The rationale is that the P100s will help them out with LINPACK and general application processing, while the GTX 1080s will be particularly useful for the rendering associated with the Paraview application. This is a LOT of hardware – we'll see if it can take them to glory. Texas: This team is a combination of students from the always powerful University of Texas at Austin and Texas State University programmes. As all cluster competition aficionados know, the Austin team was the first to three-peat at SC cluster competitions – a feat yet to be duplicated. However, they're sporting all-new personnel, although it does have highly experienced coaches. Their cluster is a bit of a departure for the Texas team. In past competitions, they've shied away from accelerators, figuring that the applications just weren't accelerator-centric enough to justify their use. This year, however, the team is using six NVIDIA P100s to accompany their eight-node, 224-core system. Will this approach take the Lone Star State back to their past glory? Utah: The University of Utah is the home team this year, since the competition is being held on their doorstep in Salt Lake City. This Dell backed team is driving a smallish two-node cluster with only 40 CPU cores. For extra compute power, each node is stocked with dual NVIDIA P100s. The team is also using Intel's Omni Path interconnect to link their two nodes together. As the team points out in their proposal, using only two nodes allows them to minimise internode communication – which is absolutely true – but does this give them enough compute power to challenge for the title? In our next updates we'll meet the teams via the miracle of video, discuss the LINPACK results, show some more video content, then slice/dice and analyse the overall results.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple possibly throttling data transfer speeds on certain iPhone 7 models Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, November 21st, 2016, 05:48 Category: Hardware, iPhone, News, Samsung The bad news is that Apple may be throttling the LTE performance on the Verizon iPhone 7 to keep it on par with the AT&T model. According to research conducted by Twin Prime and Cellular Insights, the Verizon iPhone 7 performs about as well as the AT&T iPhone 7, but it does not reach the data transfer speeds that it is capable of hitting. The Verizon (and Sprint) iPhone 7 models use different LTE hardware than the AT&T (and T-Mobile) iPhone 7 models, adopting a Qualcomm LTE modem instead of an Intel LTE modem. The Qualcomm modem is capable of reaching a maximum theoretical download speeds of 600Mb/s, while the Intel LTE modem tops out at 450Mb/s, but the Qualcomm-equipped Verizon iPhone 7 is only marginally outperforming the AT&T iPhone 7. Researchers believe Apple may be hobbling the Verizon iPhone 7 by not taking advantage of “a crucial component,” thereby ensuring all models of the iPhone 7 perform at a similar level. Field tests show the Verizon iPhone 7 as “a little faster” than its AT&T counterpart, but not as fast as it could be. Tests were conducted by comparing iPhone 7 performance on the Verizon network to a Samsung Galaxy S7, which also uses the Qualcomm X12. Data collected from more than 100,000 phones downloading the same image indicates the S7 was twice as fast as the iPhone 7. Apple offered the following comment on the situation: “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.” Past testing by Cellular Insights suggests that data speeds change somewhat when signal strength is an issue. In areas of weak reception, the Verizon iPhone noticeably outperforms the AT&T iPhone by maintaining a stronger connection and enabling faster low-signal transfer speeds. Other network testing companies have stated that reliably measuring data transfer speeds is difficult due to the many factors that can affect performance, but the information collected from Cellular Insights and Twin Prime was not disputed. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Intel stock reached levels not seen since the turn of the century in mid-October and it has struggled ever since. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr Indeed, INTC stock is off more than 6% since its last peak. Note that you can’t blame the surprising results of the general election for this underperformance. Intel stock slumped well before voters went to the polls and shrugged off the outcome. Rather, the selloff looks like profit taking after Intel stock reached such lofty levels. But you can bet it will get up there again. In addition to offering a compelling valuation, INTC is making big bets in a number of growth areas. Robotics, self-driving cars, virtual reality and the Internet of Things are just some of the endeavors Intel is plowing resources into. Perhaps most exciting is the company’s breakthrough in its core chip business. In a development that one analysts says “could be one of the most important of our generation,” INTC may have found a way to overcome limitations in silicon chip performance. The 10 Best Pharma Stocks Under President Trump Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland describes it this way: “Early this year, Intel released Silicon Photonics (SiPh) transceivers used to optically connect servers and network equipment. While this announcement was important, it is NOT the type of silicon photonics technology we will be discussing. Early this year, Intel released Silicon Photonics (SiPh) transceivers used to optically connect servers and network equipment. While this announcement was important, it is NOT the type of silicon photonics technology we will be discussing. We understand that Intel has ‘proof of concept’ silicon, is looking to improve today’s low yields, and that a commercialized product could be ready in as little as three to five years. This technology is nothing short of miraculous and we view it as a potential game changer for Intel and the semiconductor industry.” Intel Stock’s Affordable Valuation If these areas of investment pan out — especially the new chip technology — Intel stock is clearly underpriced. But even absent those growth drivers, INTC stock isn’t particularly pricey. Intel trades at about 12 times forward earnings on a five-year compound annual growth forecast of 10%. That’s cheap by the standards of today’s bull market.

[x] Countdown to 2017 with HEXUS and ARM [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU News 12 Intel's 9th gen Coffee Lake chips to make 6-core mainstream by Mark Tyson on 21 November 2016, 10:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadbc5 Add to My Vault: Chinese tech site BenchLife.info has leaked (via VR Zone) some interesting information regarding what are purported to be Intel's 9th generation Core processors. It has published slides said to show an Intel roadmap which includes 'Coffee Lake' processors. These processors look to bring six-core CPU designs to the mainstream. BenchLife also published a platform layout diagram and a chart comparing the various features of Coffee Lake U, H and S (Desktop) processors. A slide bearing Intel's logo and corporate house style, shown above, charts a roadmap that extends to 2018 and outlines the Intel H and U processors at the top end of the mobile product roadmap. Right at the end of the time period covered we begin to see the emergence of the 'Coffee Lake' (CFL) chips. You can see that the CFL-H processors will have a 45W TDP and 6C configuration, while the lower power 15/28W CFL-U chips will be limited to 4C parts. Above you can see BenchLife claims that the desktop Coffee Lake Core (DT CFL-S) processors will be made available in both 6C and 4C configurations. The new platform will go further along the integration road, with new interfaces and connectivity stuffed in the chipset. Thus it is expected that Coffee Lake S processors won't be compatible with earlier motherboards and sockets. A 14nm 6C Coffee Lake chip is expected to measure 149mm squared, while the 4C parts won't be core disabled but actually purposely designed and measure 126mm squared.

Intel is laying out its roadmap to advance artificial intelligence performance across the board and Nervana technology appears to be everywhere. The high-performance silicon market is dominated by GPUs. However, with Nervana inside, Intel hopes its new corporate tech with its a fully-optimized software and hardware stack will give that business model a good kicking. Nervana hardware will initially be available as an add-in card that plugs into a PCIe slot. The first Nervana silicon, codenamed Lake Crest, will make its way to select Intel customers in H1 2017. Intel is also talking about Knights Mill, which is the next generation of the Xeon Phi processor family. Intel said that Knights Mill will deliver a 4x increase in deep learning performance compared to existing Xeon Phi processors and the combined solution with Nervana will offer orders of magnitude gains in deep learning performance. Diane Bryant, Executive VP of Intel’s Data Center Group said that the Intel Nervana platform to produce breakthrough performance and dramatic reductions in the time to train complex neural networks. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that Nervana’s technologies will produce a 100-fold increase in performance in the next three years to train complex neural networks, enabling data scientists to solve their biggest AI challenges faster.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology iPhone 7 Apple limiting speeds on iPhone 7 with Qualcomm modems: Here’s why Apple limiting speeds on iPhone 7 with Qualcomm modems: Here’s why Apple iPhone 7 smartphones with the Qualcomm modem are capable of faster downloads, show reports. By: Tech Desk | Published:November 21, 2016 1:08 pm Apple iPhone 7 with Qualcomm modem can outperform the ones with Intel. (Source: AP) Apple iPhone 7 smartphones with the Qualcomm modem are capable of faster LTE downloads, but it seems Cupertino is intentionally reducing these speeds. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple iPhone 7 devices running on Verizon network in the US are capable of delivering faster speeds than those on AT&T. But research from Twin Prime Inc shows they are performing at the same speeds. Bloomberg quotes Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime as saying, “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities.” He adds that it looks like Apple has not enabled certain features of the chip. However another report in Re/Code which quotes sources says Apple has a perfectly good reason for doing this: To ensure a similar and uniform experience for iPhone 7 users  regardless of the network.  The report points out that the Verizon version might be superior, but it is not working at its full “potential,” for uniformity of experience. An Apple spokesperson had also issued a statement on the Bloomberg report saying all devices meet their quality and standard tests, and “there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.” Even analysts admit the reason for Apple is to do this is to offer a uniform experience across the board. An earlier report from Cellular Insights, which had released in October, had also shown the Qualcomm chip to be outperforming the Intel one. The report said iPhone 7 devices powered by Qualcomm did 30 per cent better in performance, and 70 per cent better in terms of signal strength compared to the Intel ones. Also read: Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: Buy it for camera Cellular Insights had done the tests on the iPhone 7 devices in three different LTE bands in the US. In its report, the research firm wrote, “In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem. We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple’s decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone.” For now, the controversy is on whether Apple was right to scuttle the performance of the faster Qualcomm modem. However analysts told Recode this was the right decision to ensure an equal performance for iPhone across network carriers. Also it is not unusual for manufacturers to limit the potential of a component and there are variety of reasons for choosing to do so. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple iPhone 7 Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

The Royal Shakespeare Company's collaboration with technology giant Intel has dominated much of the attention surrounding this new production of The Tempest. The two companies are given equal footing on the programme, alongside performance-capture company Imaginarium Studios. Yet for all the puffed-up, digital wizardry on show, it is the human moments of deflation, exhaustion and forgiveness and that truly resound.   The technological contribution mostly orbits Mark Quartley's Ariel, a spirit that flits between forms to guide, mislead and occasionally terrify the island's shipwrecked parties. With the help of real-time motion capturing, and avatars projected onto smoky tubes lowered from the rafters, these transformations are interpreted literally. We are told Prospero found Ariel trapped in a cloven pine, for example, and lo-and-behold a tree-like avatar is writ large above the heads of the actors. There is a clear justification for this approach to the character, described as he is through Shakespeare's text as a shape shifting, ethereal being. Indeed, the use of digital technology chimes with the play's overall theme of illusion, and the falsity of those illusions. But instead of leaning into these very potent ideas of technology – foregrounding the digital as a theme that rings true with Prospero's talk of “baseless fabric” – these novel techniques are framed as little more than tools for spectacle. The RSC puts this approach in the context of Stuart masques. These were lavish extravaganzas, stemming from the court entertainment of King James I, which would use experimental (candle) lighting, mechanical apparatus and elaborate costumes to deliver illusionistic spectacles. Real-time motion capture and floating digital avatars are here pitched as successors, and so the emphasis is on creating an opulent piece of theatre magic. You are not supposed to see the strings, as it were. This is fine, in theory. But it doesn't entirely work for one main reason: we are so much more inured to digital technology; have had so much more experience with touching, controlling and manipulating digital visuals, than a Stuart audience would with the effects of a masque. In theory, an enormous, fiery, real-time projection of an actor should knock our socks off, in reality it taps into our already-brimming grammar of CGI, of computer interfaces, of video games, and it ultimately falls a little short. The most effective and intelligent use of digital technology in the play comes around the actual masque scene, where Prospero conjures up a lavish play-within-a-play to delight his daughter and soon-to-be son-in-law. The scene itself is a garish wash of fields and flowers. It may have been intended to be spectacular, but it comes across as excessive and gauche – like a particularly ostentatious screensaver – complete with Opera-singing goddesses and dancing, charmingly pastoral sprites. Chastising himself for wasting time with such an “insubstantial pageant”, the stage becomes a void. The flip, then, when Prospero pulls the plug, is a powerful gut-punch. Chastising himself for wasting time with such an “insubstantial pageant”, the stage becomes a void, the lights gone, the actors all frozen. We are shown, if only for a moment, the empty computer screen, and are left with Prospero's sorrow and self-reproach. Simon Russell Beale's take on Prospero is masterful. While this review is understandably angled towards the play's use of technology, to talk about these things separate from Beale's performance misses a crucial tension. More scientist than magician, Beale's unassuming physicality is coupled with an unpredictable inner anxiety. When he isn't gripping his staff he stuffs his hands in his pockets, pointed and uneasy with his own daughter, as he is with his moral standing in the latter stages of the play. Yet he seemed distanced from his own powers – embodied through the computerised spectacle – as if unconvinced by the digital projections that seem to captivate other characters. In many ways I wished the RSC had gone further in this direction, foregrounding the glitchy, abject falseness of the digital avatars, as opposed to treating them like convincing illusions. Stephen Brimson Lewis's set, built of a rotting ship hull, is brilliant, but it would have been interesting to see such a tangible design clash against something explicitly contemporary and screen-based. Ultimately, though, that is a different production – one that wants to look at technology as a theme rather than a tool. What I took away from this production isn't the illusion, but what remains when the illusion is switched-off, and you're left facing the bodies who betrayed you, and have to decide between revenge or forgiveness.

Daniel Miller (TMFTwoCoins) Nov 20, 2016 at 2:00PM The automotive industry is quickly expanding from Detroit to include Silicon Valley. Image source: Getty Images. If we've heard it once, we've heard it a million times: The auto industry is going to evolve more in the next two decades than it has in the past century. While fully autonomous vehicles are a long ways off, there's no denying that our vehicles are becoming more connected to every facet of our lives. It's this wildly enticing potential that has lured in many companies not historically associated with the automotive industry. Here are two recent, and somewhat surprising, examples of tech companies leaping into the auto industry. Let's forget about exploding smartphones Given Samsung's recent smartphone "issues," expanding into automotive electronics to help diversify its revenue streams can only be even more enticing. Samsung certainly made a splash when it announced it would acquire Harman International Industries (NYSE:HAR) for $112 per share, or a total equity value of about $8 billion. Harman is mostly known for its premium audio speakers, but what many investors unfamiliar with the company may not realize is that it does so much more. Harman designs and engineers connected products and solutions for consumers and automakers such as navigation systems, audio and multimedia systems, telematics and even cybersecurity solutions, to name only a few. In fact, roughly 65% of Harman's $7 billion in sales during the  12-month period that ended Sept. 30 were automotive related. And, as previously mentioned, the potential market for the products that are making our cars increasingly smarter is vast. Image source: Samsung's acquisition presentation. This is a great move for Samsung, and signals the company's sincerity about being a big player in the evolving auto industry; for instance, Harman offers 36 global auto brands with a backlog of orders worth $24 billion, and roughly 30 million vehicles already have Harman technology. In the grand scheme of things, this is Samsung's next step in creating an ecosystem for its products that can rival those of its major competitors, as it will have connected products in your home, on your person, in your car, and at public venues. And hey, despite the price tag that was 28% premium to Harman's closing price on Nov. 11, 2016, it's instantly accretive to Samsung's earnings. A computer chip juggernaut wants in on the fun Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) splash was in a different area, more focused on the technology for autonomous vehicles, and it was a much smaller investment than Samsung's $8 billion acquisition of Harman. Intel announced at the Los Angeles Auto Show that it plans to invest more than $250 million over the next two years to develop autonomous vehicle technology, including vision processing, 5G connectivity, cloud computing, and security. In fact, just this summer Intel partnered up with Mobileye and BMW to develop a self-driving system for the iNext BMW, which is poised to play a big role in the automaker's future. This is part of a shift in strategy for Intel, which hasn't had a long history of supplying products to the auto industry, but it has recently done roughly $1 billion of wide-ranging business with well-known automakers such as BMW, Infiniti, Jaguar, Lexus, and Tesla, among many others. It's abundantly clear with the rush of tech companies into the auto industry that things are rapidly changing. Investors who keep abreast of these moves and stay on the lookout for businesses with high-quality auto technology could find the next big winner.

Linux 4.9 Has Tear-Free PRIME Offloading Between Intel & AMDGPU Written by Michael Larabel in AMD on 20 November 2016 at 10:46 AM EST. 21 Comments Quietly landing last week into the mainline Linux kernel as part of the AMDGPU fixes is support for tear-free PRIME offloading between Intel and AMDGPU. The drm/amdgpu: Attach exclusive fence to prime exported bo's. (v5) patch was merged fairly late into the Linux 4.9 kernel merge window. The patch by Mario Kleiner explains, "External clients which import our bo's [buffer objects] wait only for exclusive dmabuf-fences, not on shared ones, ditto for bo's which we import from external providers and write to. Therefore attach exclusive fences on prime shared buffers if our exported buffer gets imported by an external client, or if we import a buffer from an external exporter... Prime export tested on Intel iGPU + AMD Tonga dGPU as DRI3/Present Prime render offload, and with the Tonga standalone as primary gpu." This should allow for tear-free PRIME offloading on the multi-GPU systems with the Intel DRM driver and an AMDGPU-supported Radeon GPU.

"The figures for the composition of growth in 2016 could indicate that the current growth rate is not necessarily sustainable," the Ministry of Finance chief economist states in his weekly review published today. The chief economist warned that the "bubble" of car purchases and the upgrade of Intel's fab were among the main causes of the higher growth rate in recent quarters. Since these are one-time factors, the growth rate is liable to fall in the near future. RELATED ARTICLES Israeli economy grew at 3.2% in third quarter Intel inaugurates Israel production line The third quarter GDP growth rate estimate published by the Central Bureau of Statistics last week was 3.2%, reflecting growth in all GDP elements other than exports. Private consumption (especially higher vehicle purchases) and upgrading of the Intel fab were the main factors in the accelerated growth rate. At the same time, the chief economist notes that the rapid growth trend in private consumption slowed slightly in the third quarter, contributing "only" 1.7% to third quarter growth. "A look at the composition of growth in 2016 arouses concern that the current composition of growth is not necessarily sustainable," the Ministry of Finance emphasizes, adding, "The relative slowdown in private consumption in the third quarter could indicate that some of the reasons for the growth in private consumption in recent quarters are short-lived."

 Presence Capital's Phil Chen tells us why he turned down $100 million for his VR-only venture capital fund Jim Edwards Nov. 20, 2016, 4:12 AM 3,017 facebook linkedin twitter email print Phil Chen, at Web Summit in Lisbon. Jim Edwards Phil Chen is best-known as the founder of the Vive virtual reality headset at HTC. More recently, he became a managing partner at Presence Capital, a venture capital fund that only invests in VR and "augmented reality" tech startups.  Presence is in the process of investing $10 million in dozens of early-stage VR companies, in the hopes of growing the nascent ecosystem around headsets, game platforms, movies and content creation. Presence has already done about 28 deals, earning a reputation as the single most-active VR-focused VC fund. We sat down with Phil at Web Summit in Lisbon to get a deep dive into the new world of immersive 3D content his companies are hoping to grow. He also described how he wants to keep Presence small, and why he turned down a proposed investment of more than $100 million from a Chinese LP investor. Jim Edwards, Business Insider: OK, so - where are you based? Phil Chen: I’m based in Hong Kong but two of my partners - one is based in the San Francisco Bay area, and one’s just all over the world.  JE: Tell me what’s happening with Presence Capital right now. PC: We’re just aggressively pursuing deals, we ... there was CB Insights reports a few weeks ago and they put us as the No.1 most active VC firm in VR and AR. JE: And how big is the fund? PC: It’s a $10 million fund, it’s a seed fund. We’re the tiny guys, but this ranking put us on top of Andreessen / Google / Comcast / Intel. JE: In terms of total number of deals done or what? PC: The word they use it is ‘most active’. I think it’s crazy - but we’ve done 28, 29 deals in VR. JE: Wow, in what kinds of companies? PC: So in the beginning we started out with content, our first deal was Rock Band VR - the one that Oculus launched. Then another one was Resolution Games - Tommy Palm’s company. But since then it has been platform, it’s been computer vision, it’s been middleware … And we’ve even done some hardware companies.  One is Meta, Meta the AR company, the HoloLens competitor. And we did Thalmic Labs. Rock Band VR for Oculus. Oculus JE: How important is it that companies like Baobab Studios get this funding? Is there a lack of content on VR devices? PC: Right now most of the content in VR is gaming. I think most people do want to see some type of entertainment / storytelling on VR - whether it’s live action or computer generated. And there is a lack of quality content. I have a strong opinion about 360 video - I’m very bearish on 360 video. JE: Why’s that? PC: I think 360 video is absolutely the wrong direction for VR, it’s a mismatch in media. JE: Why? I’ve seen some 360 video that’s very impressive. One was for Star Wars – the Force Awakens. And in the news business it would seem to me that if we were covering a live event with riots or a protest demonstration, then having 360 would be fantastic. A scene from the Star Wars: The Force Awakens 360 video. Disney PC: For documentaries - and for those events that don’t require a beautiful picture, like a close-up shot - you get a general sense of kind a riot, kind of sense of looking around, but it’s there’s no storytelling. You get a general sense of the riot experience, but you don’t… JE: Hold on, what if I could make a movie as good as Casablanca but in 360 video, so any viewer could choose where they want to stand inside Rick’s Café? Imagine being able to see Casablanca from the perspective of any character you wanted - or even as an anonymous guest of Rick's Cafe. Warner Bros. PC: OK, that is what traditional directors hate right now about VR because as a director, “I want you to see ‘this’, I don’t want you to see ‘this’.” JE: No, I would think that’s thinking too small. I would have thought the whole ability to see a movie from your own point of view would be compelling. PC: But from a director’s point of view, who is a dictator, in terms of what I want you to see, to tell you my point of view - to tell you a story, I’m limited. The limit is part of the artist’s canvas, right. But this whole spherical frame is a huge debate right now between the storytellers, the gamers. If you think about - and this gets to the question of agency - does the audience enjoy being put into the VR story? Do they have any agency? Are they just a passive consumer watching a movie experience? Or are you trying to programme some type of serendipity or agency into this world? A deep-sea diving scene from an HTC Vive demo reel. HTC JE: That’s interesting because right now movies and TV have survived as content - it’s very, very healthy. TV shows and movies are better now than they’ve ever been. And on the other end, games, where it’s 100% agency from the consumer - the game doesn’t work unless you play it - they’re very healthy too. There’s not much in the middle for someone who wants to watch an experience but maybe make a few choices about how they see it. PC: So the way I see the spectrum is: if you say 2.0 is interactivity, that’s gaming; 1.0 is sort of the director’s point of view. Is there an opportunity - is there a 1.3, 1.7, 1.5? What’s that kind of mix and match? JE: I don’t know if I have de-railed this conversation, but do you want to grow a generation of directors who would work in VR and in 360? PC: Absolutely, absolutely. But when I say 360, I want to be... JE: But you’re bearish on 360. PC: I want to be more precise: what I am excited about is ‘volumetric’ - so volumetric is a concept … I’ll give you one example and you’ll understand what volumetric is. Have you heard of a company called NextVR? JE: I have not. PC: OK, they are probably one of the top three most highly valued VR companies and they do live sports streaming in 360. I sat in one of their NextVR demos, I sat beside courtside watching a basketball game, so it makes you feel like you’re courtside. To me that’s not interesting - because, 1: the subject is here, I don’t care about the rest - maybe for 2 seconds I’ll look around the audience. 2: I’d rather watch it on TV. TV is such a well-produced medium right now, OK. So it doesn’t make any - there’s no differentiation for putting on a headset. But what volumetric will allow you to do - one company can put 16 cameras around the arena - they shoot it outside-in, they basically capture this whole volume, and what that allows you to do is, I saw a Manchester United game in VR, but from the point of view of the goalie. JE: Oh wow. PC: I can see a point of view of any of the players, I could traverse, I could run around on the field during the game. JE: Because they have captured 100% of the cuboid? PC: Yeah, the whole volume, that’s what volumetric means - and that’s interesting. JE: That is very interesting. That’s very interesting for replays if nothing else! PC: Yes, for highlights, replays. And that is what I think is much more native to VR and AR. Whereas 360, this whole 360 2D flat way of thinking is an old medium, an old way. So that’s my kind of bias. JE: Is content, rather than a specific platform or technology, going to drive the entire industry? The HTC Vive headset. Stuff Magazine PC: Yes, but it has to be new experiences, different experiences, that’s native to the medium. And so to go back to the question - is there a lack of content: yes, but also a lack of new thinking, instincts, It’s still a lot of old thinking - like ‘what I understand in mobile, in movies but applied in VR’. Instead of understanding the medium as it is. JE: OK, so now I understand why games are the first into VR, because it’s easiest to transfer a 2D screen game, the concept is very similar, you can move in space differently but, it’s a similar thing… PC: Well more fundamentally, the development tools for gaming are the same for VR, and so - in the beginning - the developers, it was natural for them to work in this new medium. JE: What is the revenue model for VR - is it just gaming? PC: Right now, basically, yeah. I would compare VR - very much like the console business right now. JE: But it’s gonna destroy the console business. PC: Erm, destroy? You know… JE: From my very first time inside an Oculus, I realised instantly video games on a console with your TV, or on your PC - that is dead. I don’t wanna play those games anymore, like just being inside the VR world is so much more compelling and fun than seeing it on a screen. PC: Sure, yeah, I think it’s a different use-case. I don’t take that extreme view that it would destroy the console. I think it will get just as big as the console business, but it’s not a zero-sum game. JE: TV didn’t destroy radio. PC: Mobile didn’t destroy TV, the internet didn’t destroy TV. JE: So is the revenue model just games, initially? PC: Yeah right now it’s games, mostly games, and short experiences. JE: This isn’t a question, it’s just my thoughts: One of the reasons I’m so enthusiastic about seeing a proper VR movie is, have you ever been to ‘Sleep No More’ in Manhattan? It’s a theatre experience set inside a spooky hotel in which audience members are encouraged to wander at will from room to room. Every time you go, you see it differently. You choose which scenes to see, in which order, and from which angle, and I’m like - that’s would make a fantastic film! In Sleep No More, a theatre production, the audience can move around wherever they want, watching or ignoring as much of the show as they please. Emursive, Punchdrunk PC: Yes, so the way I say it, is VR storytelling is closer to theatre than it is to cinema. JE: It is, because everyone in the theatre gets a slightly different view of the stage. PC: Yes, yes - this goes back to the whole, I mean Shakespeare - he knew that too. He would tell stories that ‘this’ audience couldn’t hear … JE: I think the plays at the Globe were staged almost in the round too. PC: Yeah. C. Walter Hodges / Wikimedia, CC JE: OK, so is Presence Capital trying to grow this new generation of directors who are going to create this content? Are you just investing in everything? PC: So in the beginning - yeah we are invested in the whole stack. We are the first VR/AR-only sector focused fund. We invest in anything in the VR area. JE: What are the current stats for VR? What’s the total universe of developers, the total universe of users? PC: For Vive and Oculus together - I wanna say there are around 250,000 developers in this business. On users, if you count the mobile side, there have been almost 5 million Samsung viewers out there. Let’s say there are half a million Vive and half a million Oculus’ and a million sort of PS-VRs. That’s my estimate. It’s still niche, for sure, it is still considered fringe. JE: And how, in terms of the content on the various platforms - how transferable will this content be? If someone makes a product for Oculus, will it run on Vive, will it run on Gear? Or will they stay inside their platforms? A scene from an Oculus demo where the viewer stands on the ledge of an impossibly tall building. Oculus PC: Yes, you can - theoretically, you can. JE: It would seem to me that if Vive became superior, or got a larger audience, you might say, “You know what? If you launch this title with us, the title is not going on Oculus.” PC: I think that will happen. And Oculus is doing that, they’re negotiating exclusives. JE: Are they exclusives for a period of time, or for all time? PC: Right now it’s for a period of time. But you know I think - just like with Xbox did with Halo - they probably acquire it if it was the blockbuster. JE: Are you seeing any resistance amongst consumers to wearing a headset? It strikes me that one of the big problems here is that you can only use it in an environment where you can trust everyone around you - because you’re blind. So you can only use it at home, you can’t sit in a park and enjoy the sunshine while you play a game. Is there resistance there? Is it a barrier to adoption? How do you think about that? PC: With the Google AR glass - it was considered very awkward to be sitting here looking at you taking pictures. But if I were sit here and I were to wear my Samsung Gear and I’m consuming my own content - I think that’s socially acceptable, you’re doing your own thing now. Or you’re riding on the bus… JE: Maybe on a plane. PC: I haven’t seen people do it. It would be a good experiment. Why don’t you sit over there and put on a headset and see how they react? A scene from an Oculus demo reel. Oculus JE: I’ve sort of done that. I was at a conference, where they had the new Oculus demo and of course I tried it out. There’s one where you’re on a tall building, you’re standing on a ledge of a tall, futuristic building and the woman who was showing it to me suggested that I peer over the edge. But the illusion is so real I ended up on my hands and knees because I was scared of falling off the building. And then, of course, you take your headset off and you’re in a crowded room on your hands and knees and people are laughing at you. PC: We’ve done the same tests, and we asked people to jump - 80% of the people don’t jump, because it’s very real. JE: Yeah, it’s very real. Talk to me about the front-facing camera, the 3D room sensor on the Vive. How big a differentiator is that? It creates a different type of theatre than Oculus has. PC: The technology is called ‘Inside-Out positional tracking’ - meaning that the headset can position you in the room as you walk and traverse through content. I think that’s a huge difference, and that’s even more immersive. I think if you were in the same tall building demo, and you were sitting down, you wouldn’t feel the need to crawl because you already feel safe. Thinking on your feet, it puts you in the spot. JE: I can see how it creates a more intense experience, but it also limits - maybe I’m wrong - does it limit the type of content you’re gonna get on the Vive, to stuff that fits into a room? PC: No because the Vive can do both. You can sit down and not have that type of content either. It adds another dimension to the already existing lean back experience. JE: What’s the most interesting thing you’re seeing in VR right now? PC: So there are a few, companies like Lytro. A company called Uncorporeal - they’re one of our portfolio. A company - 8Eye. JE: What does Uncorporeal do? PC: They are also building cameras for the volumetric-cinematic cameras. JE: And what does 8Eye do? PC: 8Eye also - they have cameras shooting outside-in like these vertical shootings, there has actually already been an exit in this company - a company called Replay Technologies, based in Israel, that got acquired by Intel. And I don’t know, have you seen - I’m sure you’ve seen it, do you watch basketball or football? They have the 16-camera rig I was telling you about, they had highlights where somebody dumped the basketball and you can pan around like the matrix, and you can see every angle of that particular highlight. JE: That sounds cool. Sometimes these things stumble though - like 2 or 3 years ago, watching the Premier League in 3D was a thing, and it kind of went nowhere. I think the technology was not that great at the time, because it didn’t work - a lot of Premier League action, it turns out, occurs far away where the 3D effect is very minimal. Sky TV briefly experimented with showing the Premier League in 3D but viewers needed special glasses to see the games. Sky TV PC: Yeah, I think that’s - the way I think about 3D for TV is the way I think about 360 for VR - it’s the wrong technology for the medium. … I’m excited about a company called BigScreen. They are working on a social VR company and the way I describe them is - they are a virtual co-working space - a virtual WeWork. So you bring in your desktop and your mobile into this space, I bring in mine - and we feel like we are working in the same space. You’re in San Francisco, I’m in Hong Kong. We create this space, and we come in with our desk. JE: Are we avatars? PC: We’re Avatars, I can see your screen, you can come over and check out my screen - and we’re sharing a big screen, and we can project stuff we’re working on together. JE: But I can’t tell if you’re in your pyjamas? The BigScreen work collaboration tool. Oculus / BigScreen PC: No. JE: Is that a good thing or a bad thing, how do I know you’re really paying attention? PC: Right now, it’s currently a distraction. I don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing - I don’t know. JE: An avatar might be helpful, because if you’re working remotely, you don’t wanna put on a tie. PC: But I think it’s the right direction for the next labour force, the rise of co-working and more freelancing. JE: It feels like that would kill Slack, if it was successful? PC: Er, Slack would be a feature. You would have your desktop and you would still have a chat system. Slack would be one of the apps in this space. JE: OK, OK, interesting. PC: I’m excited about Baobab, so Baobab Studios, the Pixar of VR. About a month ago they created a short story in VR and, a Hollywood first-tier studio licensed their IP - the character they built in VR - to do a feature for them. So it’s the first time original content being created in VR is being licensed. It’s this bunny, it’s a rabbit - I don’t know what the name of it is, the name of the show is called Invasion! [and it involves a witless rabbit accidentally foiling an invasion of inept aliens]. The aliens land in Invasion! Baobab Studios JE: AR is interesting to me because Apple CEO Tim Cook has made a very distinctive position here, he doesn’t think VR is gonna be Apple’s thing. He thinks AR is gonna be the most interesting thing. What is your take on that? PC: I think AR has the opportunities to be the next computing platform. I think VR is more like a gaming console business - I think the size of it is about the same. But I think AR has the potential to challenge this thing [points to his mobile phone]. JE: For instance how? What would a good scenario be, or a use-case? PC: Right now, this gesture of me reaching into my pocket, unlocking it, opening it - it’s a cumbersome gesture already. I want my information right in my field of view, when I need it. I wanna be able to work hands free. And so we’ve invested in a company called Scope AR, for example. They’re basically a development tool company. Right now they’re focused on the industrial workers and the medical space. Two types of workers that need to work hands free, because I’m caring for my patient, or I’m fixing an engine. Apple CEO Tim Cook. (Illustration.) AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images JE: Do they wear glasses? PC: Yeah they wear some type of glasses. JE: So this was the view of Google Glass though, which didn’t work. PC: Well a lot of reasons why Google Glass didn’t work - the battery didn’t work, the computer vision wasn’t really there, the gesture recognition wasn’t there, and I’m not saying it’s there right now, but I certainly think to make it work for the masses, it has to work for these professionals  - these are the best prototypes. And the reason why I mentioned Scope AR is for the industrial and the medical space. They’re the first early adopters to see if that’s the right form factor. JE: Is this the thing that Tim’s talking about there, or is Tim talking about holding up your phone to scan something and getting an overlay? PC: I don’t know, I don’t know Apple’s plans. But I’ve heard rumours about the next iPhone being a transparent iPhone. JE: I’ve heard rumours that it will be all glass, but it still has insides, there’s still gotta be chips and cameras and lenses in there.  PC: It could just be a pure display and the computing is wirelessly driven, locally. I simply don’t know. JE: So you’ve invested in 28 companies - are you still looking for companies to invest in? PC: Yes - so this is a little history - we were very adamant about raising a small fund, there were Chinese LPs that wanted to give us $100 million, $150 million, but - and this is from my experience in the mobile space, we’ve been in mobile for almost a decade, we launched the first Android phone in 2008, iPhone launched in 2007 - but as an investor the best time to invest in mobile was 2011. The best thing as an investor was to go to sleep for 2 or 3 years and then come back and invest. JE: Because companies took that long to figure it out. PC: Because people are experimenting, people are failing, people are iterating, people are trying new stuff to use the medium. So our goal is to do 40 deals in two years, learn and become the world expert in this space, and prepare our war chest for our big investments. JE: So of the $10 million, how much is invested now? PC: About $4 million. We’ll probably do more but we also will do some follow-on. NOW WATCH: This machine solves the most time-consuming things about doing laundry Loading video...

You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. You're listening to Saturday skeet with Ryan Whitney rear admiral and and layered on Sports Radio WEEI. Some some decent Tennessee's when. We forgot its coverage because for the most part they are anywhere from else. Pluck bush out yet. Good defensive effort to road he's going. Tuukka Rask who dropped this bomb on a life yes and covers that was really highlight the game Thursday night. Most exciting action of the night David. In letter admiral and a tie Anderson in four Ryan Whitney of former NHL or will be on the show at some point it brought us Pletcher. Play went through Scott particulates podcast with them in the arsenal is like the even. For you guys this week he was on some connection with a ushering in a. I think am I think he was deep put like O'Neill will follow up and then there was some countries' refusal to accept some some I think there's some like that don't mind. I don't know of these in in that deportation Cortes a lot. Stability is stars such as well so yeah right as we have our vision Ozzie candidates and until they don't wanna they don't want allowed back on the country they wanna keep them there on their networks 24 hours a day with his. Sardonic size sides. And not cheap for the charming extant. Our net or NHL looked player taste still LB Lyndon byers gonna Joe's gonna top the hour to add some expertise this discussion views Koppen and another garden for a early in Winnipeg socking a lot about why the offense is now for the Bruins the how involved the trade possibility should they be coming up but we are discussing to go but you're right it is really not mean they can't be considering trading Rask. At this point crate she till I do think it's it's a possibility so the textures bring up Ryan Spooner who is a possibility to move on. And crate G I guess they dangle in the offseason right now you review hubris. Yes face an Intel that yeah they've they've they tried it. They've they've through his name out there but. Mike has said that the values too low and coming off hip surgery knows that I take that in the years into this to me years left his no trade and he's waiting in the first place. But I just think that there's a lot of things working against a creature E*Trade last year for a number of reasons from both the Bruins standpoint and the you know potential buyers standpoint so he's a bad players are not average second line center at this point right when you said. Spooner a great real quick. I mean he's healthy baby Obama I mean look at a guy he was I mean I thought it a couple years really was a top line definitely a number ones and I hey I know since you know the last couple years Bergeron is kind of usurp that number one line title for them in this town. I'm yeah I would definitely Kama top six its formal tops export Devlin a look to senate. That has been about great GM and end it. My only reluctance in just kind of sell low won him a solid sound at all as. Here's a playoff supply and twenty elevenths when he thirteen an old eleven was a while Google but he led them. The whole league and scored both the bullish both of those years when he did he need Portland which each to do. Is the question would would he beat it back in the playoffs Spiller. Is going to be seeing. I sent my doubts lobbying that's as humans born is going to be on his one complain actual arm which that's sulphide battle line remains to be seen. But at what point penis is Reza may have playoff performances is pretty good. And I think you know I mean god given the benefit of the belt that he's capable of doing that again on this personalities are had a hip surgery. So. You know I mean if it again if there's a deal it's always what you gonna get back that's that's a key in any trade mean you know you don't wanna just trading guy because wanted to trade him. But I think that that's some they'd have to spend a lot out of bottoming because he was I mean he's one of those guys he raises level and when the games are brought there and I know each heats. This sometimes play his play is almost a little full of full item about a word. I he he's not you know the most I engaging fellow at times he's not a dynamic personality Ed by any stretch. And I think that meet meet meet people like. Easy for them to get rid of him because he's not you know this kind of funny guy nearly QE I mean. Think about no one really knows much about daily creature in the Stoppard has been there as long as he has Armenia's European he's not an American guy so. You know he's just I kind of kept to himself and that's fine that's you know show his prerogative but. I I think that people feel like they also don't I don't think the fans have that that much of an of an emotional attachment with the meant to do with other guys. Maybe not maybe the organization doesn't either I don't know that I mean I could see Bacchus at some point in the second senator creature move on for some package of players maybe not this year but. Next for the year after that it could actually I mean if they decided. You know that better serves haven't haven't acts as the number two senate. I like Backus person I like them on the wing I think you know with with him. Especially with our over the set up man like crate G I mean that's kind of an ideal setup man forms for if they had notes that the plot 2530 goals. It's are closest connection to court and exactly he had of that kind of big haul that window which which needs of honor treat fox farm rights to do that got me pretty but he can do. Exactly exactly so I I think I think those 20. You know and in another maybe month or so wanna get a little bit what chemistry I think they'll be fine but. You know you don't wanna just treating guy for the sake of trade immigrate crate G again I I loved what he did the playoffs those those two years he was he was a monster man. I think he still has an and in him again. Saturday's game heroes which rated the media abruptly ETT it's the market falls ago Stephen Boston's building on policy are you. They didn't. Wear a duty to radiate out accurately. Also is set ticket TV. All of our licensee. Yale Harvard finished. Now that but now I can't watch college football or product again.

You know I'm gold. I can't remember as a goaltender. Much you are. But I actually call. The only slip. Are you looking colts and at Caltech for a while it is. Aren't these games can. Scoring chances. Nobody school. Connecticut tumbling army generally seen. No no. Almost all put all those stages on his face you know I was diversity. Of practice to you know that. I did didn't know that even up frosty forest thought. We'll outfield steals former trainer for the old ruins the 772 Bruins won't let me rest one of those and Tom. It's part is what you blame that for the price tag as you make it seven million a year we got into that discussion I Xavier thinking about making a blockbuster trade. You gotta give something to get something that would be a commodity something like you said Dallas would want. Nearly been looking for a marquee goaltender you get seven million off the books and bang you're gonna add some offensive or or or tell the Blue Line. But the Odyssey did listings with closed system their bill or rats so much that stuff. Now you know if you Eds Zain. MacIntyre in waiting in the wings and he was saying like what Martin Jones analysts are for you know for the kings a year or two ago in addition to trademark jet -- well let us and you know it's ice ice is funny said that Miley got no one know once of the trade him back down and of course on one person on would have pulled out there tweets from when the Bruins actually had my Jones at three days not a light scented. I saw him by do you you'd you be viewed and you said you're the one you're in the Internet data you'll with a one person said that deterrent to trade a rat's butt. Again you know you'd trade a number one goalie you better have somebody like who can do the job. It waiting in the wings right now MacIntyre. I don't know that he's that I have a prospect I think EC on eagle rock yet if he certainly better than to shoot man right now but. You know idea if he looks a lot better right so annoying Niemi back for a year yeah any calling berg. Make it in that Al Mahdi Abbott's damn console like that was why your yes. I don't know I don't I naught I don't. It but why bring the hey why even bring in the white gonna downgrade your most important position that Israel I pray fifty out of here. You get upgrade everything else let let's go globe put deep but what's cents a don't know if you get a crappy eagle tell you missed the playoffs figures are over here. Absolutely and I listen three as an arrow are you sure. If with him trade him to or ask for anti Niemi here you muzzled his cell everybody at that point I mean. You know you meet number one goalie Matt bask in it resent Rask is if some want the Kabul that paid which he's not he's paid. You know with perfect v.'s biggest market value of not underpaid right now out this year. They're easily overpaid because the Bruins allowed to because they. You know they will haggle back and what they could sign of the decent money and they they gave him a contract yet they singular sign a one year deal which in effect. Was a contract in any when he played his ass off and and they had a payment that the money makes outsold the fact these particular as money is. Really the draw is fault of the in the first place they should've recognized would anybody watch hockey recognized back and Tuukka Rask does that ease the real deal I like him enough IR EF 525 million mobile whatever it was asked vote wasn't crazy money. And the only non all we wanna see what little blunt he showed it to the man now that's lays make all the money's main house I think they got the wrong they get themselves. The blame for his contract if a hard rebuilt comes Charley moved before to grasp and moved and sold it nearly as much. None of course not but it but that's that would be the first sign of them tearing it down and starting hollering and I'd be a charge trade than a restaurant. I LBS and a serious hockey smarts this conversation in May tropical as well Lyndon byers WA AF joint deceit setters gay killer rear admiral it's I Anderson but you my AT&T it's our markets which rated B yeah. Rear admiral for Clark school sports and I'm like yeah sure. Hosted by Jim Blair from the curtain Callahan for Saturday's games he's brought to you by AT&T and star market need is great. Got a lot of losses. Thanks so much for some bees talk right now on Sports Radio don't you. Against all odds back for a second straight weekend Laird in the general here on Saturdays gate next week for the Bruins admiral picks week. Good and bad to be at this week to get into that coming up with a cast of thousands four to six points on the road trip for Boston since we last spoke it wants seven out of ten. Big picture that one of the hotter teams in the NHL built with that stretch. It'll Steven Stamkos for four months that's good news if you're a Boston fan and at 40% of the season on Bruins are definitely in the race bad news is. Get shut out Minnesota gets really the only good team they played over this three games been Amaral and just scoring is down. Second brutal loss of a point in the last one minute and some change I you feel about this as the Bruins seem right now. Killer tables get the speed admirals that like the public that number five eligible Craig. Feel like it is a deal if I'd gotten to have back on my way things normally go to. Yeah I was you know other a top fence of the trip it was a quick three game trip kind of an odd you know what you know Arizona outside. I've Minnesota Colorado distance kind of an unusual trip as far as the travel by. Yeah I was a bomber and ending and that's like that's like while I headlines had an impossible as Qichen and adds that she's euthanized when I wrote. You know it's just a tough loss died yet the play good I mean it it wasn't really an offensive game Minnesota like that it was talking about the doubles cup weeks of them a month chart was here or another location but. Just basically how the organization we have been a boring team to watch even though they've. They've moved on from certain GMs and certain coaches don't play that style and they brought in in a lot of stars guys who can score but they. This just sucked sucked that a bolt Minnesota Wild it just doesn't really appealed Junius was it's likely that you'll that right nineties great and in its cycle but I don't see why they'd. With a new coach brought in with new. What is truly supposed to be offensive why they always kind of played and it just every time you put a wild game even if the plane a pro is just not really gaining huge OpenId seed natural we saw the other night that. Was very defense about the Bruins are playing a good road game I mean they you know and didn't you lovable (%expletive) Nineteen minutes and live a sixteen seconds or whatever it was. I'm in which is what the bounces a means to me that was one of those like. Allows frustrate me had a goal called back on on a replay which yell like tonight out of the new wage Allen and have announced that instant replay. But it was just one those things I mean it. What's it Michael Grammy goes to make Nassau surpassing its share and close by to cry it's just like us you know 882 games it's gonna happen me happened while. Didn't lose off which I deflection but Montreal same thing it's. You know you play it play about off fought for the whole game and then you get a bad bounce I think of it and of course 82 games it all comes out in the wash. All the Montreal game was. To be a backup goaltender at a bad moment at the end this would rewind the tape just before the goal. Riley Nash is in their for posture and act as he's injured right top line can't get it out of zone and didn't. And seconds ago in any compounds that by. Jacket guy into the back of Adam Kuwaiti ego the Seattle tumbled. Head over in over heels in the crease then McQueen gets back up but he said puck goes off Sheehan and instill well the warships of weeks earlier from Riley Nash in that spot. Yet it was but made it out he was the stop before that mean you're the play itself was one of those bouts but right before him a Quaid. Good cream to say you know like I it I loved the fans on its way to. One of those is welcome at all notre embattled agency that got him aquarium like Aaron did you see 'cause he Nash buried commencement where it raises. He can't call what are not the other right. And now ices you know would McQuay was slow get not been in of people wonder what it was that was sliced as well bought a raps that's a tournament is an offensive opportunity. They typically don't blow the whistle especially in that situation. So it was not the guy kind of precursor to the actual goal itself but. You know if if not a pass goes you don't throw his legs are it's television cattle whatever and you know they got a point and we talk about how successful the report solid it's you know I like a cliche that it's a game I brought games of inches all sports I guess but. That's just you know another example why hockey. You know every little inch every little bounced and has so much. Here's the thing with a bruised right now to meet her there ahead of where I thought they would be put at the same time you watch them without Pasternak scoring now 23 in the lake. In average goals per game 2.3 five goals per game and in this stretch didn't help and as you say Minnesota's oldest defense teams and leagues you'll overreact to one game. But right now they're they're profiling is one good line which in a funk. And the rest. They're trying to figure it out. And crate she is still some signs of life he's coming off the injury actually he had a goal on the strip but. You're just not get Netflix it would posture necks out. Trickle down effect now you get Dominic abortion third wants it or not you gotta pump Riley Nash at the top line TB case it's normal roster beyond. Beyond anybody's. Belief and has no points to fifteen games so you got a bunch of plumbers here who were just not getting the job done and I think. In the end they're gonna come down to a fundamental question here. Are they gonna go at the trade deadline or sooner than the trade market to try to again add some pieces somewhere. To get over the hump to get into the playoffs this year like they did last year or even in a bigger blockbuster order they take the big picture and say hey. We're in every bit familiar more than anything. I know we got Corvel we gotta we gotta play along game and I think you've seen enough from some your stars like grass that you gotta be tested it to make a blockbuster trade in yet another piece in need help. These gets yeah I think enough when the market does. It's kind of warm up to see you very seldom see trades before the well before the deadline mean. Last year if it was last year everything kind of went to had a cup after awhile. They are down you Hanson set Joseph straight I was a monster trade that's very rare to have a pure hockey trade like that play a player. Golf one team to one other shall I wouldn't expect anything anytime soon with with the Bruins but yeah I think when the deadline approaches. Even hatchery by the way it was after January early Sebelius in Okie I was fairly well you know that the basically my point is that before the deadline is there's not a lot of trades you'll be you might get a that was our main in my league I mean in my early trade the other day. I think involve an Edmonton it was 22 guys and you know assure prospect night you would need and don't know anyone until this. There's really not a lot of trades are and the the first down the of the season. I think the Bruins I mean provided in assuming they going to be in the thick of things and an Aussie I know reasons that they did not mean. You take a look at if the Eastern Conference and it's insane how close to the area. I mean you know right now Columbus is eight seed with twenty points in. Just below them you have you know Carolina is. Carolina Detroit Florida Philadelphia Toronto Boston all within four points of the play of the last playoff spot. So you know the Bruins I I think they're going to be a late in. The other gonna take a long look at what they have and I'm sure they always kind of adds up and I mean they never really gold up that the blockbuster rude and Thomas Campbell it was. We probably allow as quote unquote big game that they brought in in you know I mean. It's it's kind of an audit of not an odd Naimi get odd reactions to people like roll their eyes Ameen. I think what you see on the cup team he that I mean I think people forget that he actually you know was pretty good and at the Stanley copy wasn't you know he wasn't a step final. He he's he did take a lot of adjust the teeny wasn't as great as everybody. And hope because you heard about the so long come and yet. But I mean I thought I had time a couple of concrete that has little late I thought he played pretty good in the Stanley Cup but. That's me the ability I think get so they'll definitely make some sort of trade whether it just. You know shorn of defense in depth look at some veteran help or or going out and trying to get a top six wing of that which would be ideal because you know what you just like you just said they're not get a lot of Smart right now and and we need to kind of look at the roster even if you drop us an active and that who would so he's gonna be out again tonight by the way. You know it's not an are rocks that jumps audience is these were up what a lot of scorers this shall. You know he mentioned Tyson Tyson Pat Riley Nash get moved up to the arm the first line unimpressed right now. You know I I thought flowed maybe it is that is Jimmy he's been going I think what club might have thrown him up did you sight if not because you know. When you play adequately no matter how like how data you go on how bad you locked and I am on the can be 82 pissed like route ready caught. Ice hockey to help ice like yep up school. I play with two guys one guy at a state a state ring true to each of the state rain what the boss the one's seen him I was terrible skater. And I would left and right that you're gonna get set Abby put two good guys. You got it question it would probably. A year and he was a staff bill and look where he is now he's getting scraps are another team this year I think Washington week. I mean he's he was just a guy who is not gonna get Iraq calmly think. But Jimmy I think they showed a may be thrown out there it's and it looked bad if you can't get a goal at these two guys than them. And they don't know some don't what absolutely but you know now I mean they put Riley Nash still we've we didn't you know decades showed a couple little flashes in and out of of offense but I don't think he's you write that top six like I Arlen at all but I would elect us and you know just maybe get Jimmy don't mean all. Sometimes it just takes one goal and I mean I'm I'm showed confidence is probably is a major issue right arm that's. Such a huge factor in and how these guys go right and sometimes that gets overlooked but. You know no bulls no points no no assist app though I think fifteen games of course it's gonna being had by. I am you know platinum with Tim Shaw or chuck or Alley on a check online at least that's not really gonna put their positions are. To succeed unless he got to you know be ought or the random awed fourth one angle shall. Yeah I I think and I certainly hope that they'd you know when the deadline rolls around some of these unrestricted free agents that you know one on. Teams that on the playoffs yeah I mean obviously we're total with a got to be now but. I abroad are always seem to be an almost guys whether they get who fans want that's a different story but yet the bronze and a really shy at the deadline I would expect them to be Xia. These so last year didn't help when after. John-Michael aisles at least not yet in and hit a gap somewhat on the Nixon of course the disaster in the final game Nazis at the last a drug that not disable 42 foreign on the trade route though. And finally listening to Saturday skate and later rear admiral of hopefully Ryan Whitney joined us on the phone from Toronto with some point here India our oral Tai Anderson and Julius and Lyndon byers LB WA AF gonna sit in for the 4 o'clock hour we brought you by AT&T mobile mobilizing your world. And by star markets he would make to shine. The offense is down the decency you would have expected this to be the other way. Artist won their only defense is sixth right. Why is the offense struggling right now. Half I think it's probably I'll a lack of finish in talent on the on the the top twelve right now on India obviously my shyness is that he does he does Bergeron in the 32 Leo last year. Write its Bora we haven't got a ton out of him yet he obviously played a one cent a last year. But playing on crate she's way he should be you know he should get somewhat but Sony's or he should be able to take advantage of the job too easy gets. Well this roster should be better than last year's Ford. She admitted they were fifteen goals last year. Down traffic and live there there's been a change air list on aliases but late exact that's kind of really interchangeable via. You know what you did take a look olasky hasn't been doing the he's a guide out that that you know you you should count off a twenty goals but. Again I go back to see in the best position to slow play on the third line you know what while Dartmoor it was a senate the other night because of the injury but. I am you know is Riley Nash Demi has been the best set up the map allows you to play it I don't know I don't already as I think. I think bullets you'd better serve on the op plan a great Jim Bacchus I happily played wood but what we are blessed deeply with great she last year. Had some success of them and Boehner back the new third center. Yes I would I would maybe do that right now I mean. I've I just don't people ask each I mean he's very a second third line guy and he's probably not a top line guy. I think eating him up on the on the wing with great Jim backers would be perfect. But you know close clos to mean maybe he'll get to at some point in stickler that by. You know he I got one thing I'm a quote guy I like asparagus coach him but one thing it's always kind of but me is is reluctance to sort of like put guys what do the guys you just kind of goes at the same thing opened some happens and then. You know when they're really the backs are really against the wall that's you know finally make a change but. You know Mike map the last email he just he's kinda had a rotating cast we aren't. You know he's a guy who should have five or six gold by now we get a breakaway in the third period gathers yeah very. Yeah I well I loved I. You know what a goalie comes bombing us 67 gully comes bottomed out yet you know like data Internet and he showed it yet he he had he had his head up he might have shot coming out. Might have been able to make double but. You know that that's the type of situation and you know and not not too many guys or expect and I'm going to come bombing away like that. Pretty scary situation Gary Devin do Mikell like he says that he's about 66 he's a big dude so. Yeah he's got he's got to get going global scheme and it's it's our it's been too long have I think he's got what I want one or two goals by now and he should have more about it but again as he in the best one is he in the best position to succeed right now animal I don't think. Ideas which could be partly injuries and I guess the first question to drop era Saturday skate just plain it's simple wise the offense worse. And why is indeed believe that the 617779797. One obvious place to turn would be. The power play which was pretty good last year yes and for some reason. They're not get it done this year part of that was the terrible start to the year they were what one for thirty niners have been out of the gates. Lately there just like in many chances they had like to a game at best I think the Arizona gated in and have a chance last Saturday itself. I don't know there there are a lot of people have been culled from marsh and get some some cracks in the top power play unit these what are your better scores wise air. So people would like to posture right there when he's healthy course that they'll get that chance that night. What they were successful last year's heart for me to say. Crush him on the power play that can't be everything. Right. AI AI sometimes it's it's not that put a finger on exactly what ails them I don't dislike or just mention confidence or Jimmy Hayes but a lot of times I think. That's such a shoot fact what guys as you know they just they get down selves and in if one guy on a probably when it is not feel on it than in any kind of affect the whole unit in open got a guy whose work on the half wall saint. If he's you know that confidence level lower he's just not feel on how lovers play is not good. You know it's gonna affect the whole unit. I was still is a fight it's a yet this guy's gone bad disguised not doing good. Marchand finally got a lot of power plates camera Hashemi before last year it's easy I he had a ridiculously low number Apollo play in the goals in the first grade because coaches did you isn't and it's just it makes Nazis when he about schools' scores. And it I also has some no punishment full full whatever for Brad be and Brad. Company is it will a lot of the peak in Italy you know bridle Paul let's yeah got a lot of guys that he's you know he's he's in his prime he's done yet paid a lot of me in a lot of guys kill penalties in in on the power play this week. I'm made you know curiously he should be Claudette Jimmy is out there about not picking on Jimmy again but. Just include maybe got maybe that's how close was trying to get Jimmy don't get on a public intimate. An easy one they are relentless gauges put zest in front yeah you won exactly out of fur for the you know that's probably way that's a good point probably puts on because he's 65 he takes up a lot wrong similar to what he does which are all day. Just go block the goalie don't even worry about handle on the park. So yeah does not like just like one the easy answer. As far as the deed that deep down. I keep getting like I mean you're not gonna hear his name of the call looked Calder trophy running at all because of who's in it this year and he's a defenseman who's not rated and quote unquote part Russian defenseman but. I'm impressed every game Brendan Kyle he's just like a means for in a nineteen year old kid 820 I think next week. It's for him to just step in like that the plane with jar on our talk here on NHL team in and really not miss a beat it's it's been incredibly impressive. The watch area press fact he had asked the Nike the hope that that's lamps and when he backed the trade front you get those who swing in. Beyond expectations. And you get to grass green now playing. As good as he's ever bit right and it -- numbers and yes this is part of the best stretch of his career exit atlas clone has changed I don't think that's the case they've been a good offensive team under Julie on the quartet did it with just the style you know he's too conservatively packs in whatever but you look back at colds career he's been a consistently good. Goal scoring team. Except for a couple of years ago two years ago they were bad. But otherwise you know the year they lost much real thirdly Eagles your before that eleventh second before that eight the year they want cups and the score goals. In terms of blaming the system verses. On it other problems that I don't think that's it only gets Julie it's fault. Now they are right now. I think they'll again looking at those that talent here you know you got that. Nash who I think he had even angles at Carolina one year but he's got an offense of the animal. Austin's not as a rookie who. He may turn out to be a top 61 eagle score a couple of years but you know he sees a rookie right now and I'm not an undersized one at that. Sean corral yet another another kid we don't know if he's gonna be a grand aero Marca. Tim shell out he's you know he's not a goal scores see you know you look at the roster and there's not. That's you know half the half full it's who won I'd goal scorers not not everybody's going to be a goal scorer we know that but. You know you're you know he got what part Marchand very dry and Kris she Backus. You know one sport is not blown up bless he's not the not so I think it's a combination of you know guys under achievement in guys who. You know products should are expected to school or shall I it would be huge to add a top six I mean if they could. If they of figuring right wing to take a plug right in would be ideal in all but you know and in the NH idea I have to give up to get something. But the Bruins to a lot of prospects I mean a lot of good ones right now. I don't know who would you want a pot with or even who's available like it's just like exits really too early in the it even speculate is there's so many teams still alive he. I think another month the showed that the kind of you separate the wheat from the chafe a little bit and you get a much better idea or vie exactly who's going to be selling that the deadline. No Bergeron is six games a lot of point. Longest stretch for him since November 2013 month. Martian as scored in five games. So like you say look back the last year those guys had to wash it certainly did 37 goals yet career year. So now he's off to a five goals start. Seventeen games maybe that's just the biggest reason but it's hard to blame those guys because the lines still pretty good posture next been producing. I mean I think they'll come out and I'm not worried about that group but our other teams finding a recipe to beat the Bruins and that's displayed simple take that line out you know. Now I don't think this variant of a recipe I mean how big is really choose many mystery or a win hockey mean in ya. Shut down at the top two lines it just it just the chess match between coaches and who they decide to put help yet for each guy. You know the they have Bergeron marsh on prospect I mean that's a mama stay I think bill 12 and three while Martin. I forget who's one who's too that the the top three guys in possession in the possession metrics I mean Colin I think course before course he won the possession mattered. You go fifty cents a gallon a day yeah outlaws the rear admiral that's not not Ahmad Ali semite anti I don't I just Denon and end all be all there a good indicated they can help ball you know. You know and when those three guys are all open all its 61%. I think I'm in the top three in the league that does they'd they have a puck pretty much all the time. They are getting opportunities I mean Bergeron getting 45 shots a game it's just his shooting percentages ridiculously low actually ball. Might buy bride actually wrote about in today's EI comet is has gone up yet rob just said he's put an optional. And I met I talked about a shooting percentages I think three point 8% this year which is well below is that. It's not a good exercise could and it it's you know well below his career average of I wanna say ten point one of some potential. You know it's it's probably a bit dad puck block and it that's again a hockey cliche but. You know what he's get up Tony he's getting shots that just it is not on his way right now. But you know that these guys these tools Bergeron a marsh on the dynamic duel they're proven commodity. If there's any two guys you don't have to worry about those two. That this is right you know a little slump I mean it is uncharacteristic Bergeron I think he's would it east play it's in fourteen games in. He had a goal went five games and old anything head to a systemic Goldman the last six games as batting eventual that is very unusual for him by. I get he's he's playing. Bergeron hockey out there he's going as being a ball that is the ice you worry about him to get a chance yeah so I I you know that'll they'll come around I mean. You know about the got to get another win and it sure they they have had a little liver rotate and cast on now like to with you know birds on not stopped the season on time and with the injury and then we'll have passed up for a couple games here but. Yeah but those guys you know they'll come around to it means that I should say they'll come back around is they've already been around certain much on decides that. Are you tell us why is the Bruins offense in a bit of fog 23 in the league in offense right now do you believe that the dias fixed at least to the point of six in goals allowed per game. Rask playing. As good as we've seen him. We have a tie Anderson join us he was over its gates date tells what's wrong with David possible QB signaled this also Lyndon byers. LB do to help me out we got we got to crank up a little lamb. Though it was a black Betty out of the battles. The ram jam that we gotta get that going LB comes is that is that is that all the value out that Alan Al becomes and he got a low low Blackberry for activities in that was it examined nearly man that. That was the big there was a big civil back in the day. While he told me listen last week he was once so either he's coming into slap us around a little bit that wanted to be part of the frame when you do it we take. Yeah tomorrow Marcella stepped in and nobody I would take your calls go to next six or 7777837. Its next 37937. It's Saturday seat rock you by AT&T it's our market tailored and rear admiral here on Sports Radio done media. You were listening to Saturday skate with Ryan Whitney. Rear admiral and Ken layered on Sports Radio WEEI. I think we have to produce a little bit more. Or it's sort of the win. I came here and I know some close scores through four also arrested there are chances. And that's an open office was furious. Brad marsh Jenny or Saturday skate but you may eighteenth tee and star market Taylor rear admiral Tai Anderson from a website to be I don't count joining. Our show one of the few guys that think after that Minnesota game. That was spewing that we got to score more you know. Most of that chatter that her they game Wallace at bad bounce offside play rear that you referenced in noble. Will be better down the road kind of a fluke he lost but other martians. Summed up what I was feeling just as a spectator Hague can bury some of those chances. I think beard down as my favorite hockey play cliche able to sound like we got the bid down like that is. The eye pucks in deep beats that man died yeah I don't Beers he had done it's just it's just Ali any team any play can sit and any losing night and the you know I'm not knocking those guys it's. You know of those guys that did this train to say is puck liked to talk without saying as little as little as they have to. The I I loved beard down we need to be a down and a it's just Yahoo! just likes the because it down it's not the same and we we gave our Ellen didn't come up and we gonna try again next week you're holding them all waters and are not exist this is they got to throw throw all the hockey cliche is a great it is is he could play big goal at the Manila's and so I'm update our march on him by any stretch as any player like your sanity losing team any night. He you're guaranteed if you like the same five or six races throughout the locker room. Cliche city practice this morning attire they they are right for. Luckily for tonight's game not that they understand need to establish home ice advantage. They simply don't have one right now on hand for two years I played that much that's exactly so they understand that to come out pot's not mean being out that's a big thing for them in the need to find scoring. From somebody else lineup that hasn't been consistent enough. So it knows why in any answers one what's Raleigh office north senior. Yeah show it and think yep yep some guys pulling out position I think Ryan Spooner on the wing is not nearly as effective as Bryant's clearance center. I I think you you have some guys that. Have necessarily stepped up in the way you thought they would. You know I look at a guy like Jimmy Hayes at Annapolis in that regard. A blessing game's coming around for sure and I think Hayes has been better these last two games but still you expect more goals those guys I think on a nightly basis. And and for me I think a big thing comes back down tipper front martian. Teams are sort of adjusting to what these guys have done and what they've had success with over the past 2235. Years for that matter. On special partly o's and teens really eliminating that bumper rolled up Bergeron has taken on that's limiting his chances on nightly basis. And I think teams now they realize that Brad marsh and as an elite player in this league and they have to defend improperly and see you're seeing teams really serve load up on these two guys. And I think what you get beyond that you don't necessarily have the talent. You know you have a Louis arch from a third lines such like make fun of them you know for Louis Erickson forty dead. There was a legitimate secondary scoring presence but Louis Ericsson and and they don't have that right now Backus is great but if you're relying on back score thirty goals are pregnant you're probably disappointed more often than not he's got three at this point. I mean. He's been a disappointment. But now I I had mpeg than tangible pats them for about 25 you know like I in the Dallas unreasonable. Again and I would not necessary had that before I watched the play us but what's in the playoffs he he still looked to me like a guy like let a lot left in the tank yet the elbow thing he's on pace for what fifteen now so that would be below the everybody's expectations keeps up this way yeah but he missed a chunk of Eagles all against Columbus writes. All which has not had actually the most impressive win lately look at the jackets it looked pretty good and yet they've exceed they spout off stuff everyone thought ought to ought to roller ball of blob but then I mean they've won three in a row there and the eight seed right now and you know I think it's safe to say they'll affiliates in the bronze and we balance football player oppositional for the rest of the season if they wanna game Calvert which puck in the face last guests on yeah 36 stitches and gimmicks and angle that's hockey player right I was lost. Now tie housed armed palace that the crowd been the last couple games I have been in the bill dispassionately to wheat and security than a much by. I know that caves game it was it was good it was is probably the best it's been all yep but it is across the Montana black. The buffalo crowd history I think that was I think the Columbus crowd. Obviously the Bruins scored four goals early helps but but I I think you're seeing some more energy in that building and one of the big problems that you really don't have. The rhythm that you need a you know for home team to get to get the crowd and aside it's been one and then three away right three away right it's been tough so I think it's been tough sledding for the for the Bruins fans in the crowd. Because they don't feel it energy don't feel that closeness of the team hopefully this trip this homestand rather gives them that. That's her feeling to get some good games Patrick lining come to town yeah. And then next week if saint Louis blues always great team that he feels that he Hilton's climax of the blues will be out in full force. It or interception. I shouldn't I mean the supplier of the year so if you can't get up for a Black Friday game at the holiday weekend. Come on yeah I'm gonna X an old village and town on the LA. Used to be a matinee every every day. I every every it was a matinee game and then they stay switched it back we'll switch to it not back switched its I did the Rangers are yet about Nate NBC took it from them can be out basically and then of the Bruins a plan the night gamers gallery because actually I'm gonna he had that game myself because sound. School that's our rail homecoming because he's he's from tactically Arizona than the mid west but I am that you can Jack who's still has a lot of CME and enable it he's going to be plan. Well presumably in the lap the Calgary that night he's obviously a local ties dad come from mom while Retief meet Boston and with the method. At a hell of an NHL career and now is kids you know 25 years after Keith broken delete his son's broken instantly so. Should be fun it'll watch out general pulse slowed the son of a local legend anyways to vote go see him on the affords. We'll speak edit it seems imminent. You that you would take tonight a look this is one of those western teams I'm looking forward to seeing which is he wants prior in the year and the brewers handle them but. As opposed to last week which that a bit of a tough watch when two of the worst teams in the league last week Arizona Colorado. Just think in a yet to be a bit of purest the watched the wild played another third good scenery decent squad rather boring yeah or sell more important Buzek a most office chairs the nets know there should still after that game. I dominated early MS and this is Alzheimer not gonna get back and I hope everyone realizes that this is we are not getting his minutes back ally unfortunately but here's an exciting team with two release dorsal league yeah he'll want AZ eighteen shy -- been put on the map at six leave no leave lead in the NHL scoring 22 points are now. Very impressive self. You wanna seed Justine and they got a guy back torture rates and whether this team rule or make up blockbuster or is in the market for traits deal. Jake a true book we talked been about last week on Saturdays game. Who finally came inside he wanted to ask to be traded. Eventually signed a two year deal. You get to watch this play tonight and decide is this is this a guy that you really would we'll see the Bruins did make a deal for the were able to get an end. Could he spark into a in on not only better play a is it really generating nearly the offensive numbers is that kind of a silent killer for the team right now. Yeah right now I mean you don't have production to me back and in terms of points and goals and sometimes you talk to people most say Al goals by defensemen that's fool's gold you care they bank on that. But the truth is that the Bruins were they don't have anything from their back and right now to recruit gets a goal off Scott Arnold's butt and that's that's basically what you've had for scorn from that back and so far so. That's simply concern you as funny about true is. The other Naimi heard that next that your about. Was Matthew gamba from from Minnesota and we've seen done that twice now this year and both times I left on my guys not very impressive does that give away it was sun at all as brutal and yeah so I I look at troop that I am a similar light we're I think a lot of people don't necessarily see. Juba enough to be like us sell the whole farm farm killed Karla gave up crew get it anyone they offer for Jacob sure about that such a good test I think to see how he handles. A quicker Abbas and you know wing wing court than you're used to seeing in the past so. But at the chirp I mean this guy who. Now he's an ease and it. Top pairing top three kind of role as see how he handles these men especially are on the road against a team like Boston. A team that. Has been dumping the puck for not scoring so let's see if if he. Changes the way that is has been going for the Bruins and and for the jets for that matter what would you give up for troop whoa whoa the gas of people there were like. Yeah 33 or four player trade you ask the ask was Carlo Spooner and a first round pick and maybe maybe even a little bit more prospect lies that stuff. But the caller. Yeah having seen I mean it may be people to sit yeah out of that sight unseen with cal as we did know will be added at bud. Yeah I'd have a hard time throwing him in any trade right now just done like he says this is 190 going to be twenty sooner what we've seen out of him just this first year. I mean that's the skies for Ritalin with the kid I wouldn't I'd I'd put him on my littlest of untouchables right now. Now Rask is point so well. It looks like. A team that if they get into the playoffs could steal a couple of series but you know going back the offseason. The biggest chip that the proposed seven people were talking about to trade was probably took. Yeah some people wanted to mount after it printed a down year for him and and defense problem. Is there any thought I know he's got a no trade clause now. Probably another adds another year and Sudan as this summer yes the modified on he would bring somebody called last week a series instead. Trade immigration we talked about that their rear. But if you're gonna sell you're gonna sell when guys played well. What about trading Rask in a blockbuster if he would get back on eighteen you know the goaltender in return. A top four defenseman. Is it can even considerate enough like it would collapse right now they it is Tuukka Rask in the net but. If you try to piece in. Mom what it seems to need goaltending help Saint Louis Dallas and that it used to but they've made some. She he had doubts that seed now that they had treatment dallas' you know Dallas is gonna expect you to take one of the awful goaltenders in return and then terrible salary that they signed him to a immunity if if the Bruins ever treated Rask I don't care who they brought back. It might unless it was PDs type stick and included what do you cleared juggling birth rate. I mean offensive minded defenseman and house and it to bring an anti Niemi and Gary let him back I I wouldn't be good. Sign off on Apple's I mean those guys just a big I mean it didn't Emmy did win a cup 2010 Blackhawks he was Palestinian. Sensed any what he went sign of San Jose as a free agent did social media. Oh to Dallas has been batted down lists compared to is its on time in Chicago. Gary Latin and that's hasn't gotten it done down here I mean I just. I don't even think of trade raster as anywhere even like close to the Bruins rated guy and I mean that it's something that anyone there is even considered as a why why would. A mile someone blew real way at some awful. Did you know that you'd give you wanna trade Rask that you're gonna you gonna still lead the number one goal and you needed proven number one goal I don't think it's anywhere near the Bruins six. Bennett showed anything it might it might be more realistic possibility yeah I think one of the big things through that with a two day trading after it considers that it's not a great market for goalies right now. You know next summer Ben Bishop is a free agent and he's probably gonna go to whatever whatever one of these cities were talking about that would trade you. That would treaty pieces for two grass so. The so bad this a bad market if you're if you're if your team kind tradable tender. Mimic it like it Andrew Hammond yup on waivers today by the Ottawa Senators and this is a goalie that sort of stole the show not Hamburg look at no I know bad news right now but that'd I think is a bad market for goalies that's the big thing that observant. Pushing all summer and keyboard talking about trading to their ask it was like OK you'll. First volleys he's come he was coming off a bad season as for his worst season essential career. Suddenly it was a great market for goalies you have Brian Elliott on the movie had Ben Bishop almost on the movie he'd talked to cap Calgary. They could make a trade he couldn't Hebron extensions that didn't happen. An and you look elsewhere and I mean this is a lot of guys that are sort of the lot of teams there are waiting for that for trademark after a flurry is great example of that Pittsburgh where. Members clearly the guy and he will be the guy. They just a matter of finding a suitor for Marc-Andre flirt if you will slow it not a great market triple. I would if you're gonna make a trade which you consider. Great sheet or some member of the court more on this coming up Saturdays he continues are brought by eighteenth tee it's our market Kelly rear admiral Tai Anderson from the UI dot com. LB get a join us and buyers and WA AF he's considered for the 4 o'clock hour Saturday skate. Three to five every Saturday here a sports rated a B yeah.

Friedman: Dancing in a hurricane Trump rode in on howling winds of change November 22, 2016 12:00 AM By Thomas L. Friedman Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union followed by Donald Trump’s election in America constitute a single giant political event — one that makes 2016 a vintage year in history that will long be studied. Big political events have big causes. For the last three years I’ve been working on a book about what’s been happening beneath the surface — in the plumbing and wiring of the world — that’s roiling politics in so many places. My answer begins with a question: What the hell happened in and around 2007? 2007? That’s such an innocuous year. But look again. Steve Jobs and Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an internet-connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet. In late 2006, Facebook, which had been confined to universities and high schools, opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally. Twitter was created in 2006, but took off in 2007. In 2007, Hadoop, the most important software you’ve never heard of, began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyze enormous amounts of unstructured data. This helped enable both Big Data and cloud computing. Indeed, “the cloud” really took off in 2007. In 2007, the Kindle kicked off the e-book revolution and Google introduced Android. In 2007, IBM started Watson — the world’s first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options. And have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome? It goes from $100 million in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around … 2007. The cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007. Airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change.org started in 2007. GitHub, now the world’s largest open-source software sharing library, was opened in 2007. And in 2007 Intel for the first time introduced non-Silicon materials into its microchip transistors, thus extending the duration of Moore’s Law — the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years. As a result, the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day. Finally, in 2006, the internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide. In time, 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history. And we completely missed it. Why? 2008. Yes, right when our physical technologies leapt ahead, many of what the Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker calls our “social technologies” — all of the rules, regulations, institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst — froze or lagged. In the best of times social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies, but with the Great Recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered, this gap turned into a chasm. A lot of people got dislocated in the process. How could they not? What happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast, cheap, ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power — in really differentiated ways — all at once: the power of one, the power of machines and the power of ideas. What one individual or small group can now do — the power of one — to make or break things is phenomenal. When President-elect Trump wants to be heard, he now gets his message out directly from his New York penthouse through Twitter to 15 million-plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases. And the Islamic State does the same from a remote province in Syria. Machines can now not only beat humans at “Jeopardy!” or chess, they are starting to become truly creative, offering architectural and other designs and writing news stories, songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans. At the same time, ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and farther than ever. As a result, new ideas (including fake news) can suddenly take root, and long-held ideas — think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights — can suddenly melt away. So if you look down from 30,000 feet you see that technology, globalization and, I would add, Mother Nature (in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth) are all accelerating at the same time, and feeding off one another: More Moore’s Law drives more globalization and more globalization drives more climate change. And together, climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration. I recently met with economic and climate refugees in West Africa who made it clear to me they didn’t want aid from a rock concert in Europe. They want to come to the Europe they see on their cellphones — and they are using WhatsApp to organize vast illicit migration networks to get there. No wonder many in the West feel unmoored. The two things that anchored them in the world — their community and their job — are feeling destabilized. They go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering. They go into the men’s room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender. They go to work and there’s now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job. I celebrate this diversity of people and ideas — but for many, diversity has too fast for them to adapt. That’s why my favorite song these days is Brandi Carlile’s wonderful ballad called “The Eye,” the main verse of which is: “I wrapped your love around me like a chain/ But I never was afraid that it would die/ You can dance in a hurricane/ But only if you’re standing in the eye.” These accelerations in technology, globalization and Mother Nature are like a hurricane in which we’re all being asked to dance. Mr. Trump and the Brexiters sensed the anxiety of millions and promised to build a wall against the howling winds of change. I disagree with them. I think the challenge is to find the eye. For me, that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to adjust to these accelerations and to draw energy from them — but also to provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them.

It’s been a strange old year, and it’s a testament to just how strange that this headline doesn’t seem too out of place anymore. Microsoft – once the poster company for closed software – has joined The Linux Foundation as a platinum member. What was unthinkable just a few short years ago makes much more sense if you track the company’s recent conversion towards elements of open source. .NET Core 1 was made openly available; the company partnered with Canonical to build Ubuntu into Windows 10; and it worked with FreeBSD to release an image for Azure. When Microsoft acquired Xamarin, they open-sourced the company’s software-development kit, and they seem to have a good working relationship with the likes of Red Hat and SUSE. In short, Microsoft’s attitudes have been changing for some time, and in joining The Linux Foundation as a platinum member (something that costs around $US500,000), it's joining companies such as IBM, Fujitsu, Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung, Oracle, Facebook and Cisco. “As a cloud platform company, we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know,” explained Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of the Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Group. “The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community’s most innovative open-source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalise on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.” Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation, was warm in welcoming the group’s old rivals to the fold, despite acknowledging to TechCrunch that the move might prompt “some scepticism”. “Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open-source technology,” he explained. “The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects,” he added. “Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open-source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company’s expanding range of contributions.” For Microsoft’s part, membership of The Linux Foundation grants – according to the group’s website – “events, training and certification, open-source best practices, marketing, and promotion necessary for corporate members to build, scale, and sustain critical open-source projects and communities for commercial adoption”. But perhaps more importantly, this is another big step in Microsoft’s plan to win over the hearts and minds of the open-source sector.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Walmart Black Friday 2016: Best Deals, Store Hours And Everything You Need To Know Posted: Nov 21 2016, 3:26pm CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 22 2016, 7:45am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links. Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad   The Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale is possibly the most popular of the season. Here is what you need to know to get the best Walmart Black Friday 2016 deals. I'm doing that Black Friday thing since over a decade. The Walmart Black Friday ad was always the highlight of the season. This year is different. The advertised deals are ok, but nothing really is exciting or totally unique. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries Walmart killed what I thought was one of their best ideas for Black Friday. This year there are no 1-hour guarantee deals, despite what some reports I have seen on major newspapers are still claiming. This year all customers at Walmart have to get wristbands for the doorbuster deals. Once the wristbands are gone, there is no way to get the deal. The Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad features 4K Ultra HDTVs deals, such as a Phillips 55-inch Smart 4KTV for $298 and a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4K TV for $398. Other television offers consist of a Vizio 60-inch HDTV for $398, a 40-inch HDTV for $125 and $225 50-inch Emerson 1080p HDTV.  Best Walmart Black Friday Deals $98 24" Samsung UN24H4000 720p TV $99 10.1" RCA Atom 2GB 32GB SSD Laptop $99 New Nintendo 3DS $99 iPhone 5S StraightTalk (Prepaid) $125 40" Hisense 1080p TV $199 iPad mini 2 32GB $199 15.6" AMD E2 4GB 500GB HDD Laptop $225 50" Emerson 1080p TV $249 Sony PS4 Slim Uncharted 4 Bundle w/ $30 Gift Card $249 15.6" HP Touch Intel Pentium 4GB 500GB HDD Laptop $279 Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Bundle w/  Controller $298 55" Philips 4K Smart TV $349 15.6" HP AMD A10 8GB 1TB HDD Laptop + Accessories  $369 DJI Phantom 3 Standard $398 60" Vizio D60N-E3 1080p TV Walmart has unveiled the Walmart Cyber Monday 2016 Deals. Now customers can compare the Cyber deals with the offers Walmart has on Black Friday. The deals Walmart is offering on Black Friday and Cyber Monday are different. Walmart's Cyber Monday deals are not beating Black Friday deals. Walmart Pre-Black Friday Deals In the days ahead of the Walmart Black Friday sale, the retailer is offering Pre-Black Friday deals online at walmart.com. The offered deals are already of Black Friday quality. Walmart is added new deals every day. Walmart Samsung Savings Event The Walmart Samsung Event is a special Black Friday sale on Samsung device, mostly dominated by deals on Samsung TVs. Walmart is offering deals that go beyond the announced Samsung Black Friday deals as the retailer has vast inventory on 2015 Samsung TVs. The Samsung Savings event continues all Thanksgiving week on walmart.com. Time of Walmart Black Friday Online Sale  Walmart confirmed the launch time of the Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale online. The Black Friday deals will be released at 9pm PST on Wednesday, November 23. This is midnight for east coast shoppers. Based our observations of the Walmart Black Friday sale, deal hunters can expect to find leaked Black Friday deals available before 9pm PST. It is advised to visit walmart.com before the official launch time. Walmart Black Friday Store Hours Walmart will once again open on Thanksgiving Day. The 6pm store opening time is the same as last year. Wristbands for doorbuster deals could be handed out as early as 2 hours before the Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale begins. Ask at the associates at your local Walmart store when wristbands have been handed out last year to prepare your shopping schedule. Walmart Black Friday Store Maps The Walmart Black Friday 2016 store maps are available for download online and in the Walmart Shopping app. Walmart lists the locations of 24 Black Friday deals in the Walmart Black Friday 2016 store map. The listed deals include the DJI Phantom 3 drone, HP Touch Laptop, HP Non-Touch Laptop, 40-inch TV, the Philips 55 4K TV deal, Samsung 24" TV and 50" TV.

Apple Intentionally Keeps Verizon iPhone 7 From Reaching Max Speed, To Match AT&T Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Intentionally Keeps Verizon iPhone 7 From Reaching Max Speed, To Match AT&T Image courtesy of YouTube November 21, 2016 4:38 pm EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc not actually the same apple iphone iPhone 7 at&t verizon wireless You would think an iPhone 7 is an iPhone 7, right? Apple’s famous for making one consistent device that’s the same inside, and works the same way, from carrier to carrier. So it’s a little surprising that one carrier’s version of the phone actually could work faster than another’s… and even more surprising that Apple’s set it up not to perform as well as it can. The Verizon Wireless version of the iPhone 7 is technologically capable of downloading data at 600 Mbps over LTE. That’s super fast! But as two research firms told Bloomberg News, in practice the phone is not optimized, and can’t exceed 450 Mbps — the maximum download speed that the competing AT&T iPhone 7 can reach. Now, granted, most users won’t notice the difference. Real-world tests, like the one PC Mag runs every year, find that the average 4G LTE connection speed you get ranges between 19 and 30 Mbps depending what city you’re in and which of the four major carriers you’re using. The top download speed recorded in their tests last year was 160 Mbps, on a Verizon phone in the northwest part of the country. That means the 450 Mbps download speed a Verizon iPhone 7 limits itself to, and that AT&T users get, is still a solid four times faster than anything most users will ever be able to connect with. iPhone parts are sourced from a whole bunch of different companies. It’s not just that one company makes glass and another makes CPUs and a third makes modems; for a huge number of internal components, there are several different manufacturers for each individual part, too. That’s basically the key difference here, the research firms tell Bloomberg: the Verizon/Sprint model has a Qualcomm chip in it; the AT&T/T-Mobile one uses a sligtly different Intel chip. The Qualcomm one is both newer and faster than the Intel one. MORE: It takes dozens of companies to make your iPhone Still, analysts told Bloomberg — it’s straight up weird for a technology company to throttle itself in this way. But that brings us back to the top, and most consumers’ (and developers!) assumption that an iPhone is an iPhone is an iPhone. “They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better,” one analyst told Bloomberg. “If Apple had a guiding principle, it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.” Other analysts pointed out that not only does Apple need to create a unified customer experience, but also will want to keep all wireless carriers equally happy. “Apple likely has some incentive to balance the performance of its iPhones across its U.S. operator partners,” a different expert told Bloomberg. “It would be difficult, for example, to explain to AT&T, which remains the U.S. carrier with the most iPhone subscribers, why Verizon is offering a superior product.” Was this helpful?

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet By Thomas Friedman - - Published: 4:00 AM, November 22, 2016 Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union followed by Mr Donald Trump’s election in America constitute a single giant political event — one that makes 2016 a vintage year in history that will long be studied. Big political events have big causes. For the past three years I have been working on a book about what has been happening beneath the surface — in the plumbing and wiring of the world — that is roiling politics in so many places. My answer begins with a question: What the hell happened in and around 2007? 2007? That is such an innocuous year. But look again. Steve Jobs and Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an Internet-connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet. In late 2006, Facebook, which had been confined to universities and high schools, opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally. Twitter was created in 2006, but took off in 2007. In 2007, Hadoop, the most important software you have never heard of, began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyse enormous amounts of unstructured data. This helped enable both Big Data and cloud computing. Indeed, “the cloud” really took off in 2007. In 2007, the Kindle kicked off the e-book revolution and Google introduced Android. In 2007, IBM started Watson — the world’s first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options. And have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome? It goes from US$100 million (S$142.6 million) in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around … 2007. The cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007. Airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change.org started in 2007. GitHub, now the world’s largest open-source software sharing library, was opened in 2007. And in 2007 Intel for the first time introduced non-silicon materials into its microchip transistors, thus extending the duration of Moore’s Law — the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years. As a result, the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day. Finally, in 2006, the Internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide. In time, 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history. And we completely missed it. Why? 2008. Yes, right when our physical technologies leapt ahead, many of what the Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker calls our “social technologies” — all of the rules, regulations, institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst — froze or lagged. In the best of times, social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies, but with the Great Recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered, this gap turned into a chasm. A lot of people got dislocated in the process. How could they not? What happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast, cheap, ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power — in really differentiated ways — all at once: The power of one, the power of machines and the power of ideas. What one individual or small group can now do — the power of one — to make or break things is phenomenal. When President-elect Trump wants to be heard he now gets his message out directly from his New York penthouse through Twitter to 15 million-plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases. And Islamic State does the same from a remote province in Syria. Machines can now not only beat humans at Jeopardy! or chess, they are also starting to become truly creative, offering architectural and other designs, and writing news stories, songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans. At the same time, ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and further than ever. As a result, new ideas (including fake news) can suddenly take root, and long-held ideas — think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights — can suddenly melt away. So if you look down from 30,000 feet (9,000m) you see that technology, globalisation and, I would add, Mother Nature (in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth) are all accelerating at the same time, and feeding off one another: More Moore’s Law drives more globalisation and more globalisation drives more climate change. And together, climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration. I recently met economic and climate refugees in West Africa who made it clear to me they did not want aid from a rock concert in Europe. They want to come to the Europe they see on their smartphones — and they are using WhatsApp to organise vast illicit migration networks to get there. So no wonder many in the West feel unmoored. The two things that anchored them in the world — their community and their job — are feeling destabilised. They go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering. They go into the men’s room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender. They go to work and there is now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job. I celebrate this diversity of people and ideas — but for many others they have come faster than they can adapt. That is why my favourite song these days is Brandi Carlile’s wonderful ballad called The Eye, the main verse of which is: “I wrapped your love around me like a chain/But I never was afraid that it would die/You can dance in a hurricane/But only if you’re standing in the eye.” These accelerations in technology, globalisation and Mother Nature are like a hurricane in which we are all being asked to dance. Mr Trump and the Brexiters sensed the anxiety of many and promised to build a wall against these howling winds of change. I disagree. I think the challenge is to find the eye. For me, that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to move with these accelerations, draw energy from them — but also provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them.

DatArcs Is Aiming For Dynamically-Tuned, Self-Optimizing Linux Servers Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 21 November 2016 at 02:24 PM EST. 9 Comments DatArcs is a new software start-up aiming to provide software to dynamically tune Linux servers for maximum performance and energy efficiency in the data-center. The DatArcs optimizer analyzes the server's workload over time and optimizes the server "several times per minute" to achieve better performance or lower power use. DatArcs appears to be like an Intel PowerTOP on steroids but is self-learning and tunes the system by itself for maximum performance (or lower power use). The company says, "The 100’s of knobs in your system are tuned for your workload within hours, with no manual intervention...DatArcs Optimizer achieves the greatest speedups and greatest energy reductions on bare-metal servers that run native applications and containers. It can even tune within virtual machines." So far DatArcs is in a closed-beta so there isn't easy access to it for testing. It also appears that it will be a closed-source, commercial product when launched. The company did share some basic results via the Phoronix Test Suite when running Apache and the results are promising. CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 16.04 appear to be the supported operating systems so far for their closed-beta.

Shares Are Up Today The circuit and microchip maker got a flattering offer. Bradley Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Nov 21, 2016 at 2:31PM Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (NASDAQ:AMCC) are up more than 11% as of 2:18 p.m. EST today following the news that the microchip company is going to be acquired by the larger Macom Technology Solutions Holdings (NASDAQ:MTSI). This follows a similar jump in October when Applied Micro reported better-than-expected Q3 sales growth.  So what Macom's offer of $770 million to acquire Applied Micro Circuits is a 15% premium over the price of shares at the time of the announcement. The deal as announced would provide Applied Micro Circuits shareholders with $8.36 per share made up by $3.25 of cash and 0.1089 Macom shares per AMCC share.  Image source: Applied Micro Corp. The reason for Macom's move seems to be that the large chipmaker is trying to consolidate power in an attempt to compete with its even bigger rivals in the space like Intel. A few different law firms have already filed today for increased scrutiny of the buyout deal, but so far the market's reaction seems to indicate that Wall Street expects the deal to go through.  Now what Macom is not the only one in the industry looking to consolidate power and gain more market share of some of the high-growth areas these chipmakers are vying for, including autonomous driving cars, artificial intelligence, defense technology, and much more. Macom's purchase of Applied Micro seems to be a play specifically to gain in the data center segment of the market, but it could help the company to grow in various segments. This highly competitive industry is one that benefits those companies with the best technology, the most resources for increased innovation, and the best brand name to land big partnerships, which is why a company like NVIDIA is thriving in this space now. For Macom, we will wait to see how well this acquisition can help it to gain ground in these new segments and compete with this much bigger rivals.   Seth McNew has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Fruit Street is a leading telehealth software platform that is licensed to healthcare professionals allowing them to conduct HIPAA-compliant video visits to monitor their patients’ health, diet, and lifestyle using medical and wearable devices. The conference will be held at the Four Points by Sheraton located at 1471 N 4th St, San Jose, CA 95112. More information on the event can be found at the conference website: https://vsee.com/telehealth-failures-conference/ The size of the telehealth market is expected to expand to $30BN by the year 2020, yet many of the most well-funded telehealth startups continue to fail. The purpose of the conference is to identify best practices in the telehealth industry through an examination of industry case studies.  The conference will be attended by leading companies in the telehealth industry including MDLive, Salesforce, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Dell, CloudDX, Get Real Health, International SOS, DaVita, Qualcomm, CEP America, Ascension Healthcare, Cooper University Hospital and the University of Michigan. Fruit Street CEO and Co-Founder Laurence Girard will address the conference on the use of telehealth for weight management. Fruit Street will also be represented at the conference by Co-Founder and CTO Dr. Milton Chen, PhD who will deliver an address titled “The Telehealth Adoption Black Hole” in which he will analyze the challenges of Health Spot, Doctor on Demand, American Well and other leading telehealth companies. Dr. Chen is also the founder of VSee, Fruit Street’s joint venture software development partner, which is well-known for being selected by NASA as the provider of video software for use on the International Space Station and is the same video technology used in Fruit Street. On the telehealth industry, Laurence Girard recently remarked that “obesity costs the US healthcare system over $147BN each year and two in three Americans are overweight or obese. Our healthcare system must use technology such as Fruit Street to find more cost-effective solutions to address the obesity epidemic.” About Fruit Street Telehealth Fruit Street Telehealth is a public benefit company, licensing telehealth software to healthcare professionals allowing them to conduct HIPAA-compliant video consultations with their patients to monitor health, diet and lifestyle using medical/wearable devices and mobile applications.

(Reuters photo) In a new prophecy shared at The Elijah List, Stephen Powell, a revivalist minister who preaches the word under Steve Toliver of Abundance of Rain Ministries and Todd Bentley of Fresh Fire Ministries, says the election of Donald Trump and Mike Pence was the first step in what could lead to third Great Awakening in America. The day after Trump's election, he said he saw "two peacocks come together as one mighty bird," which then took off into the air with "an incredible sound of power," while a large eagle landed on the ground at the same time. He then heard the voice of the Lord, booming from the heavens, say, "The Eagle has landed, and now the prophet will soar." He said the eagle landing represented God securing the presidency in the Cyrus anointing of President-elect Donald Trump. He said the double portion peacock is "the double portion seer prophetic anointing being released in the nation right now." "This anointing is for the nation, and is being offered to the nation, to be received like never before," he wrote. "Prophetic authority is rising in our land and will influence our government in increasing ways moving forward. "God is offering Heaven's Intel to governments in the nations, including our own. This prophetic authority will pierce the news media establishment as well as the entertainment mountain like we've never seen. This will continue to weaken the antichrist spirit's hold on these establishments and thus the entire nation, even the mind of the nation." He delved deeper into this prophecy, and then offered another regarding prophetic justice in America: <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1458229201" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1458229201" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Those who would harm these little ones, says the Lord, it would be better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself into the waters; for you will not be able to hide from My justice as I release it on the wings of the fear of the Lord in the days to come. I will be a Terror to terror, a Force against evil, a hindrance to wickedness, a plague against those who would bring harm to these innocent ones, says the Lord. You will not find a place to hide, a place to cover yourself, in my renaissance of justice, if you harm My little ones, says the Lord. You will flee across the sea from whence you came. You will find no shelter, no harbor for your wickedness in My nation of liberty and justice for all, says the Lord. You will run for I will chase you, because I will not rest day nor night, until all of My little ones are safe in this land, says the Lord. My prophets will speak and expose your ways, and My arm of justice will be extended in this land, to take hold of the syndicates, to take hold of the rings, to take hold of the cartels, the traffickers—even the power brokers. Their evil shall not breathe. I will snuff out their funds, I will capture back their wealth, turn the flow of their riches for the poor, the widow and for those in need. I will send you back from whence you came. Watch and see, watch and see.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers The top stories of the week on iDB How to use AirPods like a pro   skip to main content skip to main menu     Schiller: doubling MacBook Pro RAM would’ve reduced space for batteries By Christian Zibreg, Nov 21, 2016 Tweet 21 Comments Software developer Ben Slaney asked Apple via email to give a more detailed clarification as to why the new MacBook Pro does not provide a 32-gigabyte build-to-order option for power users looking to max out the RAM. He allegedly received a response from Phil Schiller, who is boss of worldwide marketing at Apple and the steward of the firm’s developer relations. Schiller’s response reveals that doubling the RAM from 16 to 32 gigabytes would have required a different logic board design versus the notebook’s mustache-shaped logic board, one that would have reduced space for batteries. Schiller’s alleged response, in full: To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life.  In other words, doubling the RAM would have required using DDR4 RAM that’s unsupported by the Intel chips powering the new Pro. Slaney found out that LPDDR3E RAM chips in the new Pro (a low power, enhanced version of DDR3 RAM) normally use 1.5 watts of power whereas faster DDR4 memory would use about 3-5 watts of power: It’s impossible to get an exact figure on it, but depending on the usage it can be estimated that between two and five watts are saved using LPDDR3E RAM instead of DDR4. And since the system averages to drawing about 20 watts on battery in normal usage, this can be said to be the difference of the RAM using two watts versus three to six watts for DDR4. Translated to overall power usage that would make the difference of ten percent of power being dedicated to RAM versus the 20-30 percent it would be for DDR4. When an average notebook with DDR4 RAM enters sleep mode, which is known as background power draw, the RAM itself consumes nearly half the overall power draw versus just 20 percent when using LPDDR3 RAM. Using DDR4 RAM would have decreased the Pro’s standby time from 30 days to less than one week, he concluded. With DDR4 they’d have produced a notebook that would have a completely drained battery if it was at 50 percent charge and you closed the lid and left it for a few days. Not only would that be annoying, but by running the battery flat often it would end up damaging a percentage of their batteries because they’d frequently get 100 percent discharged, which puts a lot of stress on them, and sometimes even kills them. In conclusion, Slaney wrote that several high-end Windows notebooks that utilize DDR4 RAM don’t get nearly as much battery performance as advertised. Battery life of the Dell XPS 15 with 32GB RAM was found to be disappointing, garnering only 5 hours 40 minutes of video playback from its 84 Whr battery. “This is a far cry from Dell’s advertised battery life of 17 hours,” wrote ExpertReviews. Schiller previously emailed a reader inquiring about the RAM situation on the new MacBook Pro, saying doubling the RAM would have negatively impacted battery life: To put more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook. I hope you check out this new generation MacBook Pro, it really is an incredible system. The 16GB-limit stems from Apple’s decision to use Intel’s Skylake chips rather than the latest Kaby Lake platform that was unveiled in August. As we thoroughly explained, while Skylake chips in the new Pros do support 2133 MHz LPDDR3E RAM—they don’t support for LPDDR4 RAM. Summing up, costly Kaby Lake chips are needed to support DDR4 RAM. It gets even more complicated than that because Kaby Lake is set to include support for a power-sipping “LP” variant of DDR4 RAM, but only for the slower “U” category of chips for ultra-thin notebooks like the MacBook Air and the twelve-inch MacBook. Kaby Lake may not support LPDDR4 RAM on notebooks until late next year or 2018.

That first quote was 37 words long. Your TL;DR version of it was 46 characters long JulianZH First world problem right there. Agneev Mukherjee WTF? Rolf Bause What is next? “Schiller: Including physical ESC button would’ve dramatically reduced space for batteries too.” Mr_Coldharbour Maybe if the chassis wasn’t obsessively thin, battery capacity would not have been an issue. askep3 Honestly, I have the 13 inch and the battery life is 6-7 hours so far Kevin Paterson Remember when you first get a MacBook it’s doing lots of first-time stuff like indexing and updates. Battery life should level out soon. askep3 It’s almost been a week (will be on Wednesday) how long does it usually take to finish indexing? I set up as new so it doesn’t have old files Mr_Coldharbour It depends what you do on the Mac, if you do any graphics intensive or CPU intensive tasks then it’s normal. Also it depends how old your battery is. There might also be a bad process or something running rampant causing less than expected battery life. The next time you’re on your Mac, open up Activity Monitor found in the Utilities folder, click on the Energy tab and see what’s eating away at the battery. Maybe take into the Apple Store or have Apple send someone over to take it in for a checkup and possibly change the battery. Also, if you happen to be sitting on your desk all day it’s better to just leave it plugged in to the power outlet. The less charge cycles the less wear on the battery in the long run. When not in use unplug of course. Use the actual Mac’s battery no more than once a week and don’t be in the habit of draining it completely or reaching the red too much. askep3 I’ve been keeping tabs on activity monitor all the time, the mac is brand new, and I’m just web browsing occasionally watching videos and listening to music via headphones. I’m guessing the issue is that it is the MacBook Pro Mr_Coldharbour If you feel there’s something wrong then take it in to Apple for repairs or you can call them up and they’ll send someone over to pick it up for you. As I said, if you do a lot of your work sitting on a desk on your Mac then keep it plugged in while in use then unplug when not in use. Use the battery no more than once a week but do not be in the habit of completely draining it, it just puts more wear on the battery. Idea is to keep charge cycles to a minimum if you can. Let a charge cycle last longer. leart I’m with you but for the most people I know who have a MacBook they go crazy for the slim size of their Mac burge Instead of telling your customers (Apple) what they want, why don’t you listen to what your customers are asking for. mwpitt52 Hate to break the news but the new MacBook Pro is nothing more than a 13 -15 inch iPhone. gary Lol you can’t be serious… Go back to whatever Windows circle jerk blog you came from. mwpitt52 Nope. Just bought the 2015 MacBook Retina. Maybe your profile pic can be used for the Windows circle jerk blog. gary So then why did you just buy a MacBook if it’s nothing more than a large iPhone? Also, I think it’s funny you don’t recognize my profile picture… mwpitt52 Gezz your an idiot. I said the new MacBook Pro looks like an iPhone. The 2015 MacBook Pro is the old style. gary lol I know exactly what you said, and I have the same MacBook. And you didn’t say it LOOKS LIKE an iPhone, yout just said it’s LIKE an iPhone. Which couldn’t be more wrong. mwpitt52 I guess your right, Apple did leave in the headphone jack. No usable ports, keyboard is horrible, no more iconic glowing Apple logo just a metal sticker( like the iPhone), smaller ( getting close to iPhone Plus size),cannot upgrade storage. What a deal for a higher price. jaimem17 I’m sure people looking for a new laptop will choose the Macbook because it is the same as last gen except thinner. Next Macbook will be a screen and a touchscreen as a keyboard, same RAM, same screen, same battery life, one USB C port and paper thin. Same same but different.

Seagate nibbles on tiny slice of SSD pie But world SSD shipments up 46%, 128-layer 3D incoming 21 Nov 2016 at 15:39, Chris Mellor The utter irrelevance of Seagate as an SSD shipper is shown by TrendFocus's estimated total SSD unit ship numbers for 2016's third quarter, with just 0.1 per cent of the 38.25 million units shipped, 46 per cent up on a year ago. Stifel MD Aaron Rakers has revealed some of the TrendForce numbers. They cover both enterprise and client SSDs. The enterprise portion of the total ship number was 4.54 million, an increase of 47 per cent annually and up 12 per cent quarter-on-quarter. Of that total, PCIe drives numbered 417,000, which Rakers says is "up significantly from ~200,000 and ~113,000 units shipped in the prior and year-ago quarters". He says: "SATA SSDs totalled 3.41 million versus 3.2 million in the prior quarter, while SAS enterprise SSDs grew to 712,000 units shipped versus 450,000 SSDs shipped in the year-ago quarter." Client (PC) SSDs totalled 33.7 million, up 46 per cent year-on-year and up 14 per cent sequentially. A pie chart we have crafted from the numbers shows the dominance of Samsung, WD, Toshiba, Intel, Lite-ON, Kingston, and SK-Hynix. The latter shipped 1.61 million SSDs, while Seagate shipped far less, just 38,300 – 0.1 per cent of the total. Trendfocus's total SSD unit ships by supplier Q3 cy2016 Rakers writes: "Trendfocus's estimates would imply total SSD capacity shipped equates to approximately 8 per cent of combined HDD and SSD capacity shipped in 3Q16, up from 5 per cent in the year-ago quarter and flat sequentially." 3D NAND roadmap Currently SSDs are adopting 3D NAND as it is more cost-effective to grow die capacity by layering planar or 2D NAND than by shrinking 2D NAND cell size below c15nm. We understand that Samsung is at 64 layers now, and WD (SanDisk) and Toshiba will be mass shipping 64 layers (BiCS3 technology) in the first half of next year, having started pilot production. Rakers attended a LAM Research analysts' day where it revealed that the bulk of the flash industry will be at 64 layers in 2017-18, with 96 layers starting production towards the end of 2018. We understand that this means it provides a theoretical 50 per cent capacity increase at the die level, from say 256Gb to 381Gb, unless a die shrink takes place to increase capacity further. LAM research NAND roadmap The company sees 128 layers starting production mid-2020, with another 50 per cent capacity increase. We understand that QLC (4bits/cell) NAND will emerge and play an increasing role in data storage from next year onwards. Planar, 2D NAND effectively stops production in 2017; 3D NAND being more cost-effective at the 64-layer point. DRAM carries on shrinking slowly, below 16nm from the end of this year onwards. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register You know how that data breach happened?

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: [Update: Sold out] Eve launches the Eve V at Indiegogo, starts at $699 1 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Nov 21, 2016 at 18:50 GMT1 month ago Update: The Eve V has sold out already, all of the available variants can no longer be ordered at Indiegogo. However, Eve is allowing users to reserve a device by making a downpayment: You can reserve your Eve V of any configuration today by making a downpayment. If you do so you will get: Eve V at a very special Indie GoGo price (saving up to 770USD off retail MSRP) Guarantee that next time we run preorders we you will not miss the chance to buy. Preordered device will be shipped in April-May 2017 (Original article follows below) The Eve V is finally going on sale. Eve, the company behind the Eve V today announced its Indiegogo campaign on its official website and revealed the prices. Eve’s V is a device which the company likes to call “the first-ever crowd developed computer” as all of the main parts of the device were based on feedback from the Eve community. Eve’s V device is a lot like Microsoft’s Surface Pro line of devices and that’s not anything surprising to see. However, Eve V’s specs are better than what you get with the Surface Pro 4 which is quite interesting. First up, the Eve V comes with Intel’s 7th gen Core i7/i5/m3 processors. As for the RAM, you can get up to 16GB of LDDRP3 RAM with the Eve V and up to 512GB of internal storage (128GB and 256GB variants are also available). For the display, Eve is including a 12.3-inch IGZO LCD panel with a resolution of 2736×1284 pixels that’s protected by Gorilla Glass. As for the security, you can’t get Windows Hello’s face recognition feature on the Eve V but there’s a fingerprint scanner that’s integrated into the power button of the device. In case you are wondering about the ports on the device, there’s 1 Thunderbolt 3 port, 1 USB Type-C port, two regular USB ports, a 3.55mm port for audio and there’s also a microSD card reader. More importantly, the device boasts a 48Wh battery which, according to Eve, provides 12 hours of battery life.  All of this comes in a device that weighs less than a kilogram and has a thickness of 8.9mm. Gallery Eve is also selling a keyboard (the V Wireless Keyboard) for the Eve V similar to the Surface Touch Keyboard, and a stylus (the V Pen) as well. The device starts at $699 for the Core m3 model with 8GB RAM, and 128GB of internal storage. For $959, you’ll get the Core i5 variant with 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. The company is also selling the Core i7 variant with 16GB of RAM, 512GB of internal storage for $1399. All of these variants come with the V Pen and the Alcantara Keyboard. The device comes with Windows 10 Home out of the box, but you can pay $50 now to get Windows 10 Pro. You can pre-order the Eve V at Indiegogo here, and it should start shipping in February 2017. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Microsoft Surface Book Receives November 2016 Firmware and Drivers Pack The firmware improves the device’s overall system stability Nov 21, 2016 12:15 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Microsoft has made available the download link for its November 17, 2016, cumulative firmware and driver update package developed for its Surface Book device, which improves the unit’s system stability through a new NVIDIA GeForce GPU (21.21.13.6961) driver. In addition to that, the present update package also installs the 90.1380.768.0 Surface UEFI version that improves stability once more, as well as a new Intel Precise Touch Device driver, namely version 1.2.0.70, which reduces false touch events when the device is closed. When it comes to applying this release, the task can be performed either automatically through Microsoft’s Windows Update service or manually by downloading and installing the update packages. However, take into account that via the Windows Update service, every update is provided to customers in stages, which means that you might not receive it right now. Still, all Surface devices will get this update at some point. On the other hand, if you don’t have the time to wait, you can always manually download, extract, and install all the drivers using the link below. Also, after applying all packages, don’t forget to reboot your tablet to ensure all changes take effect properly. With this in mind, download Microsoft Surface Book Firmware November 17, 2016, install it and enjoy all changes mentioned above.

"Everyone should learn how to programme a computer, because it teaches you how to think," Apple tycoon Steve Jobs insisted 20 years ago. And it seems parents have taken the message to heart since CoderDojo was set up as a charity five years ago. The multi-national movement, which was set up in Cork, has provided free classes in coding for more than 70,000 people, both in Ireland and abroad. Kids aged seven to 17 sign up to a Dojo, where they can learn to code, build a website, and create their own apps and games. Often they teach themselves or each other, and the adult volunteers simply act as facilitators. In some areas, such as Dun Laoghaire in South County Dublin, there are long waiting lists of up to 300 kids for coding classes. Now, there is a clamour for coding to be taught in schools from primary level upwards, and there are calls for a fully-fledged computer science subject at second level. Big computer companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft want Ireland to copy the example of Britain and turn computer coding into a significant part of the school curriculum. "The US and the UK are quite advanced in introducing computing and coding in schools. It is seen as giving them a competitive advantage. Computing and coding in schools are an attribute that companies will be looking at when they are making long-term investment decisions," says Paul Sweetman, who represents the tech industry as director of ICT Ireland. "Other countries are stealing a march on us and companies are noticing this." In schools in England and Wales, kids are now taught to code from the age of five, and computer science is part of the curriculum for students aged five to 16. Education Minister Richard Bruton has asked Ireland's curriculum planners to consider coding classes for all primary schools. Coding is seen as the key to a brave new world, but some sceptics wonder whether forcing it onto the curriculum is just a faddish nod in the direction of the tech economy with little educational value. Should our schools be led by the needs of tech giants in terms of what they teach? Teachers wonder whether it should be added to an already crowded curriculum in primary schools, where maths and English have to compete for time with religion, Irish, science, and creative arts, and other subjects can be squeezed out. Publisher Norah Casey, who used to be an ambassador for CoderDojo, has no doubt that coding should be taught in schools. She first brought her son Dara to CoderDojo classes at the Science Gallery in Dublin when he was 10, and believes he grew enormously in confidence as a result. "When you look at what kids are being taught about computers in schools, it is light years away from what the CoderDojo kids themselves are doing - it's almost like they're in a different century." So what is coding all about? Coding, in simple terms, involves telling a computer what to do through a string of typed instructions. It could be anything from the instruction "print 'hello world'", to developing the code used for logging on to Facebook, withdrawing money from an ATM, or even blasting a rocket into space. All rely on instructions developed by a coder or programmer. Smartphones, laptops and tablets are everywhere, but how many of us actually know how their apps and websites work? "For my son Dara, learning to code took the mystery out of how things work, but it also helped him to be more creative," says Casey. "Because he knew how to code, Dara could do animation and develop his own games. He ended up building his own computer." The point made by the publisher, that schools sometimes seem as though they are working in a different century, seems like a valid one. The current primary curriculum in schools was launched in 1999 in an era before Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, iPhones and iPads. Google had only just been launched the previous year. While the technological world is in a constant state of revolution, the education authorities move at snail's pace in devising what should be taught in schools. By the time they have planned their curriculum, it may already be obsolete. However, some Irish teachers have not waited around to introduce the subject in their classes, and have moved ahead themselves in teaching kids to build computer programmes. They often use a simple coding programme called Scratch. Using Scratch, children may move a cat called Felix across the screen, using simple commands. Children customise the background and the cat's appearance, and select its activity by putting blocks in sequence. At St Peter's primary school in Little Bray, Co Wicklow, teacher Ciara Brennan gives lessons in coding. In a typical experiment on a Wednesday, pupils are using computer programming skills, learned from Scratch, to turn themselves into a human piano. Brennan does not believe that coding should be introduced as a separate subject at primary level, partly because of the enormous time demands on teachers," she says. "I am more interested in taking the principles of coding and applying them to other subjects. "We have done it here with music and maths. It can be a very useful way of teaching problem-solving. "Many schools are passionate about bringing this into other subjects, because the children are already doing this in their spare time - it could be at CoderDojo classes, or informally themselves at home." At Lacken National School, Co Cavan, pupils learn coding and are able to use these skills to fly mini-drones around the room. "They have to use code to make it work. The kids jump right into it, because of course they want to fly a drone," says resource teacher Tony Riley. "We are helping children understand how the world around them works. Coding is part of that, it prepares them for when they leave school. There are going to be numerous jobs in the future where they are going to need to have coding skills or design skills, or other creative skills." One problem for teachers, particularly at primary level, is that they are preparing their pupils for a world that it is impossible to envisage, given the pace of changing technology. "We don't know what is going to happen beyond a certain time. We need a populace that is as broadly educated as possible, so that they cope with the issues that confront them," says Shane Bergin, professor of science education at UCD. Professor Bergin believes the education system only rewards a narrow range of skills. "Giving kids the opportunity to do things like coding is as important as giving them the opportunity to play on a sports team, play in an orchestra or do art." However, he has mixed feelings about industry getting involved in what should be taught in schools. "I would be cautious about letting industry dictate too much the curriculum that should be used in schools. Our current Government has a view of education that is driven too much by the market." While he has reservations about tailoring the curriculum to the needs of industry, Prof Bergin gives credit to companies such as Intel and Google for pressing for reform in education. Minister Bruton may hope to introduce coding into the curriculum, but school principals could face a tough job trying to implement it. Multinational tech companies frequently complain that they cannot find staff with the right programming skills. If schools try to teach computer and coding curriculum, they are likely to face the same problem in trying to find qualified staff. "Schools will also have to have the resources and equipment to be able to do it, and in many areas the lack of good broadband is a huge issue," warns Professor Bergin. Coding may be the word on the lips of ministers as they try to keep up with the cool kids on Silicon Docks, but, in many ways, the cultivation of the creative arts in schools is just as important. A study published last month by the Economic and Social Research Institute found that Irish children who participate in artistic and cultural activities at the age of nine perform better academically by the age of 13. These activities could include painting or attending classes in drama, dance or music. "The findings clearly show the positive emotional and educational effects of taking part in artistic and cultural pursuits," says Dr Emer Smyth, who carried out the study. Dr Smyth believes children should not only be delving into the digital world, but also engaging in the physical activities of painting and drawing. Professor Bergin says: "The creative arts should be a crucial part of our education system, but usually they are the first thing to be cut." It now seems likely that coding will be part of the curriculum in the future, but the Education Minister will have to ensure that enough teachers are properly trained and classrooms suitably equipped to make it successful.

Ohio Turnpike Listen Listening... / 3:43 In the next month you could start seeing self-driving vehicles in Ohio. The state has been quietly marketing itself to manufacturers as a ready, willing and able partner in the self-driving vehicle arena. According to the Executive Director of the Ohio Turnpike Randy Cole, companies have already done some preliminary mapping in central and northwest Ohio and are preparing to do more on the Ohio Turnpike and St. Rt. 33 between Columbus and Marysville. The robot car market is projected to be worth $42 billion by 2025. Intel just announced its investing $250 million to drive the development. It makes the processors for sensors, sonar and cameras in the cars. Many manufacturers expect to produce self-driving cars by 2020. Ohio is drafting legislation for autonomous cars. Seven states and the District of Columbia already have laws. Will the testing be safe in Ohio? According to Cole, "What we've been contemplating here is having a driver in the seat. So even if the vehicle itself is driving in a self-driving capacity there is still a human ready to take control if necessary and even a second engineer that's watching the systems to make sure is operating and anticipating where there could be problems." He says, "We're making sure every bit of safety that can is being followed and all the rules and regulations and insurance are in place." Ohio is among several states competing for a share of the self-driving market. People in Pittsburgh can now get a ride with a self-driving Uber. Ride along with an NPR reporter from Pittsburgh. Ohio is expected to release the specifics of tests on the state's roadways sometime in December.

Steve Dent, @stevetdent 11.17.16 in Mobile Comments 2099 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Reuters/Albert Gea/File Photo Qualcomm has unveiled its next-gen Snapdragon 835 flagship SoC (system on a chip) and confirmed rumors that it will be built by Samsung using its 10-nanometer FinFET process. Compared to the current 14-nanometer Snapdragon 821 (also built by Samsung), the new processor packs 30 percent more parts into the same space, yielding 27 percent better performance while drawing up to 40 percent less power, the company says. It also improved the design, which will yield "significant" improvements to battery life Other companies, including Intel and TMSC, are working on 10-nanometer chips, but Samsung said it's the first to start building them. Samsung VP Jong Shik Yoon says "this collaboration is an important milestone for our foundry business," and no doubt a shot of good news to distract from Samsung's smartphone problems. Qualcomm expects devices with the first Snapdragon 835 processors, possibly including Samsung's Galaxy S8, to arrive in the first half of 2017. It reportedly has a Snapdragon 830 coming too, but is still mum about that SoC. The new chip comes with Quick Charge 4, which supports 20 percent faster charging than Qualcomm's last-gen tech. That, the company says, will give you up to five hours of extra battery life with just a five minute charge. In just 15 minutes, it'll give Snapdragon 835 phones a half-full battery. The system uses its "INOV" (Intelligent Negotiation for Optimum Voltge) tech, and says the tech is compatible with Google's new guidelines for USB Type-C charging. Google previously said that Qualcomm's Quickcharge 3.0 was not, in effect, compatible with its Nougat specs (above). Mountain View was trying to avoid multiple charge standards that could make it easy to plug the wrong charger into a phone and possibly fry it, or worse, cause a fire or explosion. For instance, OnePlus released a cable that works fine on the OnePlus 2 but can damage other phones or chargers. However, Qualcomm says its system has "advanced safety features for both the adapter and mobile device." It can gauge current, voltage and temperature to safeguard the battery, cables and connectors. "An additional layer of protection is also being added to help prevent battery overcharging and regulate current throughout every charge cycle," its press release notes. The addition of "compatibility with USB Power Delivery" means that it should meet Google's compatibility specs. That's a good thing, as Google said it may take a harder line on future releases. "While this is called out as 'STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.' in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers," its spec says (emphasis theirs).

Apple has been the leader in this market for some time, producing high quality designs like the MacBook, but over the past year we’ve seen PC manufacturers join the party in a significant way. Just a few months ago I was reviewing the attractive HP Spectre, which was surprisingly decent for a laptop so thin. Over the past few weeks I’ve been testing Asus’ competitor in this space, the ZenBook 3. Of all the ultrathin laptops I’ve reviewed, the ZenBook is most like Apple’s MacBook from a design perspective. It packs a 12.5-inch display, an edge-to-edge keyboard, and a single USB-C port for charging and all connectivity. Where the ZenBook pulls away from Apple's ultraportable is on the inside. While the current MacBook packs an Intel ‘Skylake’ Core M processor, the ZenBook uses a current-generation, full-powered ‘Kaby Lake’ Core i5/i7 CPU. The performance difference between Core M and Core i7 is significant, and allows the ZenBook to deal with more tasks simultaneously. The ZenBook 3 is certainly impressive from a design perspective. The entire laptop is 11.9mm thin and 910 grams heavy, which makes it slightly thicker than the HP Spectre but a good 200 grams lighter. It’s more closely matched with the current MacBook, and no doubt Asus is celebrating the very slight size and weight advantage over Apple’s offering. As soon as I unboxed the ZenBook 3, I was impressed with its portability. The lightweight build is especially impressive, even more so than the extreme thinness. The footprint of the ZenBook isn’t significantly smaller than my Dell XPS 13 – partly because the ZenBook packs larger bezels around its smaller display – however it’s a step up in portability purely because it’s so slim and light. Asus hasn’t skimped on build quality, instead giving the ZenBook 3 the most impressive design I’ve seen from the company. The metal unibody both looks and feels excellent, and I’m a huge fan of the blue finish with gold trim. The glossy finish to the display, while not a touchscreen, helps complete the premium, expensive vibe you get from viewing and holding the laptop. The circular brushed finish to the lid is a nice touch as well, as it retains one of Asus’ more familiar design elements. For the most part, though, the ZenBook is clearly inspired by the MacBook. The wedge design, the curved edge around the lid, the edge-to-edge keyboard, the hinge, and even the cutout below the trackpad are all features ripped directly from Apple’s laptop. That’s not a bad thing, as the MacBook is a beautiful piece of hardware, but Asus should be careful there. Above the large keyboard are two defined speaker grills, which work in tandem with two additional bottom firing speakers for a “distortion-free, cinema-quality” experience, according to Asus. I wouldn’t describe the ZenBook’s audio as cinema quality, but the Harman Kardon-enhanced speakers are decent quality and provide a lot of volume. With that said, the speakers do lack bass, making them more suited to video than audio. One of the more interesting aspects to the ZenBook 3 is the integrated fingerprint sensor, which supports Windows Hello. Rather than placing the sensor near the power button, which makes the most sense, Asus has strangely chucked it in the upper right corner of the trackpad. While the sensor is responsive and great for security, its position is awkward and occasionally impacts the usability of the trackpad. For some inexplicable reason, Asus decided to replicate the MacBook's single USB Type-C port. I don’t understand why the ZenBook 3 had to have just a single USB port, when there is comfortably enough space along the edges for a second or even third port. The ZenBook’s single USB-C port does not support Thunderbolt 3, and you’ll need to load up on dongles to use this laptop with multiple peripherals. You’ll also struggle to charge the laptop and plug in a USB device at the same time without a hub of some sort. The ZenBook 3 is definitely a product for those comfortable with #donglelife. Oh, and I tried two basic USB-C to -A adapters and both didn’t work on the ZenBook 3, which was frustrating. This is why I prefer not to use dongles wherever possible. Ideal laptops pack multiple full-sized USB-A ports, but obviously on the ZenBook 3 this is not possible due to its thinness. The next best thing is multiple USB-C ports, so it’s disappointing that Asus couldn’t even manage that. But hey, you get a 3.5mm headphone jack, too, so at least that’s something. It’s also worth mentioning that the ZenBook’s blue design is a fingerprint magnet, particularly on the lid, which has received a glossy finish. It might be a good idea to buy a few cleaning cloths along with the ZenBook to ensure its finish remains in pristine condition.

Reuters/David Gray Apple is finally responding to “touch disease” claims by providing an official avenue of repair. Users of the iPhone 6 Plus whose devices have been struck by this issue will be able to have their smartphones fixed for a particular price. READ: Apple iPhone 8 specs & features: Digital camera with light splitter, Intel partnership & wireless-charging tech discussed “Touch disease” occurs when a flickering bar appears at the top of the phone’s display and the touchscreen feature stops responding completely. Apple has issued a statement saying this occurs with the iPhone 6 Plus whenever the unit hits a hard surface multiple times and correspondingly faces additional stress. Because of the widespread claims, the Cupertino-based company is now offering its repair services. The repair is quite costly at US$149 (AU$204). In addition to the fee, Apple has required that all units up for repair must be in working condition, without a cracked or broken screen. The company also stated that previous customers who have already paid for the repair via Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will be contacted and reimbursed for the difference. According to repair tech site iFixit, however, the issue is not necessarily a problem with users dropping their devices and the stress that is made to the iPhone 6 Plus. Instead, the company alleged that the trouble is in the design itself. The touch disease is essentially inherent with the handheld. The design placement of various touchscreen-related chips are supposedly the cause of touch disease. These chips become dislodged even with standard use, which is why the screen itself becomes unresponsive after some time. Some iPhone 6 devices have also claimed the same issue, but Apple is only willing to fix iPhone 6 Plus devices at this time. READ: Apple iPhone upgrade: Camera may soon boast of new feature In August, three California users launched a suit against Apple over the touch disease issue. The case outlined that the Cupertino-based company knew about the flaw, yet refused to take the necessary steps to correct this. Since its initial filing, the lawsuit has expanded to include a case from Utah.

If you have been doing Android application development using Android Studio, some of the items discussed here might already be familiar to you. However, there are some Android Wear platform specific items that may be of interest to you. (For more resources related to this topic, see here.) Android Studio Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is based on IntelliJ IDEA platform. If you had done Java development using IntelliJ IDEA platform, you'll be feeling at home working with Android Studio IDE. Android Studio platform comes bundled with all the necessary tools and libraries needed for Android application development. If this is the first time you are setting up Android Studio on your development system, please make sure that you have satisfied all the requirements before installation. Please refer developer site (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Requirements) for checking on the items needed for the operating system of your choice. Please note that you need at least JDK version 7 installed on your machine for Android Studio to work. You can verify your JDK's version that by typing following commands shown in the following terminal window: If your system does not meet that requirement, please upgrade it using the method that is specific to your operating system. Installation Android Studio platform includes Android Studio IDE, SDK Tools, Google API Libraries and systems images needed for Android application development. Visit the http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html URL for downloading Android Studio for your corresponding operating system and following the installation instruction. Git and GitHub Git is a distributed version control system that is used widely for open-source projects. We'll be using Git for sample code and sample projects as we go along the way. Please make sure that you have Git installed on your system by typing the command as shown in the following a terminal window. If you don't have it installed, please download and install it using this link for your corresponding operating system by visting https://git-scm.com/downloads. If you are working on Apple's Macintosh OS like El Capitan or Yosemite or Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Kubuntu or Mint, chances are you already have Git installed on it. GitHub (http://github.com) is a free and popular hosting service for Git based open-source projects. They make checking out and contributing to open-source projects easier than ever. Sign up with GitHub for a free account if you don't have an account already. We don't need to be an expert on Git for doing Android application development. But, we do need to be familiar with basic usages of Git commands for working with the project. Android Studio comes by default with Git and GitHub integration. It helps importing sample code from Google's GitHub repository and helps you learn by checking out various application code samples. Gradle Android application development uses Gradle (http://gradle.org/)as the build system. It is used to build, test, run and package the apps for running and testing Android applications. Gradle is declarative and uses convention over configuration for build settings and configurations. It manages all the library dependencies for compiling and building the code artifacts. Fortunately, Android Studio abstracts most of the common Gradle tasks and operations needed for development. However, there may be some cases where having some extra knowledge on Gradle would be very helpful. We won't be digging into Gradle now, we'll be discussing about it as and when needed during the course of our journey. Android SDK packages When you install Android Studio, it doesn't include all the Android SDK packages that are needed for development. The Android SDK separates tools, platforms and other components & libraries into packages that can be downloaded, as needed using the Android SDK Manager. Before we start creating an application, we need to add some required packages into the Android SDK. Launch SDK Manager from Android Studio Tools | Android | SDK Manager. Let's quickly go over a few items from what's displayed in the preceding screenshot. As you can see, the Android SDK's location is /opt/android-sdk on my machine, it may very well be different on your machine depending on what you selected during Android Studio installation setup. The important point to note is that the Android SDK is installed on a different location than the Android Studio's path (/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/). This is considered a good practice because the Android SDK installation can be unaffected depending on a new installation or upgrade of Android Studio or vice versa. On the SDK Platforms tab, select some recent Android SDK versions like Android 6.0, 5.1.1, and 5.0.1. Depending on the Android versions you are planning on supporting in your wearable apps, you can select other older Android versions. Checking on Show Package Details option on the bottom right, the SDK Manager will show all the packages that will be installed for a given Android SDK version. To be on the safer side, select all the packages. As you may have noticed already Android Wear ARM and Intel system images are included in the package selection. Now when you click on SDK Tools tab, please make sure the following items are selected: Android SDK Build Tools Android SDK Tools 24.4.1 (Latest version) Android SDK Platform-Tools Android Support Repository, rev 25 (Latest version) Android Support Library, rev 23.1.1 (Latest version) Google Play services, rev 29 (Latest version) Google Repository, rev 24 (Latest version) Intel X86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer), rev 6.0.1 (Latest version) Documentation for Android SDK (Optional) Please do not change anything on SDK Update Sites. Keep the update sites as it was configured by default. Clicking on OK will take some time downloading and installing all the components and packages selected. Android Virtual Device Android Virtual Devices will enable us to test the code using Android Emulators. It lets us pick and choose various Android system target versions and form factors needed for testing. Launch Android Virtual Device Manager from Tools | Android | AVD Manager From Android Virtual Device Manager window, click on Create New Virtual Device button on the bottom left and proceed to the next screen and select Wear category Select Marshmallow API Level 23 on x86 and everything else as default, as shown in the following screenshot: Note that the current latest Android version is Marshmallow of API level 23 at the time of this writing. It may or may not be the latest version while you are reading this article. Feel free to select the latest version that is available during that time. Also, if you'd like to support or test in earlier Android versions, please feel free to do so in that screen. After the virtual device is selected successfully, you should see that listed on the Android Virtual Devices list as show in the following screenshot: Although it's not required to use real Android Wear device during development, sometimes it may be convenient and faster developing it in a real physical device. Let's build a skeleton App Since we have all the components and configurations needed for building wearable app, let's build a skeleton app and test out what we have so far. From Android Studio's Quick Start menu, click on Import an Android code sample tab: Select the Skeleton Wearable App from Wearable category as shown in following screenshot: Click Next and select your preferred project location. As you can see the skeleton project is cloned from Google's sample code repository from GitHub. Clicking on Finish button will pull the source code and Android Studio will compile and build the code and get it ready for execution. The following screenshot indicates that the Gradle build finished successfully without any errors. Click on Run configuration to run the app: When the app starts running, Android Studio will prompt us to select the deployment targets, we can select the emulator we created earlier and click OK. After the code compiles and uploaded to the emulator, the main activity of the Skeleton App will be launched as shown below: Clicking on SHOW NOTIFICATION will show the notification as below: Clicking on START TIMER will start the timer and run for five seconds and clicking on Finish Activity will close the activity take the emulator to the home screen. Summary We discussed the process involved in setting up the Android Studio development environment by covering the installation instruction, requirements and SDK tools, packages and other components needed for Android Wear development. We also checked out source code for Skeleton Wearable App from Google's sample code repository and successfully ran and tested it on Android device emulator.

Linux Kernel 4.4.33 LTS Introduces Minor MIPS and Btrfs Fixes, Updated Drivers GO Users of the Linux 4.4 LTS kernel branch must update Nov 20, 2016 23:45 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Immediately after informing the community about the release of Linux kernel 4.8.9, which is currently on its way to your favorite GNU/Linux OS, Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the availability of Linux kernel 4.4.33 LTS. Just like Linux kernel 4.8.9, Linux kernel 4.4.33 LTS is here only four days after the release of the thirty-second maintenance update to the long-term supported branch, but it looks like it's a small version, changing a total of 37 files, with 268 insertions and 162 deletions, according to the appended shortlog and the diff from Linux kernel 4.4.32 LTS announced on November 15, 2016. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.4.33 kernel. All users of the 4.4 kernel series must upgrade," said Greg Kroah-Hartman. "The updated 4.4.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.4.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary." Includes mostly updated drivers It looks like Linux kernel 4.4.33 LTS includes mostly updated drivers, for ACPI, GPU (Intel i915), iiO, IOMMU, DMA, CLK, MMC, Ethernet (Intel i40e), NFC, SCSI, TTY, USB, and PINCTRL devices, but there are also minor changes to the s390, MIPS, and ARC hardware architectures, a fix for the Btrfs file system, and an updated sound stack that adds small fixes to the sun4i-codec and Cirrus Logic CS4270 ASoC. Therefore, if you're using a Linux-based operating system powered by a kernel from the long-term supported Linux 4.4 series, you are urged to update to version 4.4.33 as soon as possible, or more precisely as soon as it lands in the stable repositories of your favorite distro. OS vendors and power users can download the Linux kernel 4.4.33 LTS source archive right now from kernel.org and compile it themselves. #Linux kernel 4.4.33 LTS#Linux 4.4.33#Linux kernel#Linux LTS#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Chakra GNU/Linux Users Urged to Tweak Their Systems for Pepper Flash and CUPS Linux Kernel 4.8.9 Adds SunRPC and s390 Improvements, Lots of Updated Drivers openSUSE Tumbleweed Users Received KDE Applications 16.08.3, VirtualBox 5.1.8 Linus Torvalds Announces the Sixth RC of Linux Kernel 4.9, Only Two More to Go New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Linux kernel 4.4.33 LTS released New Linux Apps Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Otter Browser: An Internet browser software that tries to recreate the classic Opera UI using the Qt toolkit Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Reader comments Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository more on: Ubuntu 17.04 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Skip Article Header. Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Cade Metz. Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 11.17.16. 11.17.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Giant Corporations Are Hoarding the World’s AI Talent GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images General Electric builds jet engines and wind turbines and medical gear. But the 124-year-old industrial giant is also transforming itself for the digital age. It’s fashioning software that pulls data from all this hardware, hoping to gain an insight into industrial operations that was never possible in the past. The problem is that analyzing all this data is difficult, and the talent needed to make it happen is scarce. So GE is going shopping. The company just paid an undisclosed amount to acquire a Berkeley-based machine learning startup called Wise.io. “There’s thirty of them,” GE CEO Jeff Immelt says gleefully of the Wise.io team, which is heavy with astrophysicists. “You match them with aviation data, and they’re killer.” That’s great for GE and Immelt—and for their customers. But what if you’re a small software company trying to inject some AI into your operation? Wise.io was on a mission to “democratize AI”—to creating tools anyone could use to build machine learning services—but it’s now disappearing into GE. And at a time when machine learning is the prime way of staying competitive in the software world, that’s a notable thing. In the battle for scarce AI talent, companies like GE have an overwhelming advantage. The cost of acquiring a top AI researcher is comparable to the cost of acquiring an NFL quarterback. Not everyone can go out and grab thirty AI-happy astrophysicists. And if you can’t do that, the talent pool becomes very small very quickly, since these machine learning techniques are so new and so different from standard software development. Even the big players talk about the tiny talent pool: Microsoft research chief Peter Lee says the cost of acquiring a top AI researcher is comparable to the cost of acquiring an NFL quarterback. Over the past few years, other heavyweights have snapped up so many other AI startups you’ve never heard of. Twitter bought Mad Bits, Whetlab, and Magic Pony. Apple bagged Turi and Tuplejump. Salesforce acquired MetaMind and Prediction I/O. Intel acquired Nervana. And that’s just a partial list. And it’s not just software and Internet companies doing the buying. It’s also giants like Samsung and GE that are incorporating AI into physical things. As soon as startups spring up to meet the AI need, they get sucked up into the maws of the hungriest, richest corporations. “These big companies are establishing their advantage,” says Chris Nicholson, the founder of Skymind, a still-independent deep learning startup. “Technology is always a battlefield, and they’re tilting it with these acquisitions.” A Shrinking Pool Nicole Shanahan is seeing this firsthand. Her startup, ClearAccessIP, is building software that seeks to automatically analyze patent portfolios. The company uses the latest in machine learning techniques to mine relevant information for patent transactions. That means Shanahan needs data scientists, people with experience in deep neural networks and software like Google’s open source TensorFlow engine that drives this increasingly important form of AI. She’s trying to hire four data scientists who specialize in machine learning, and she can’t land even one. Last week, she put an offer out to a candidate in Canada, but he declined, saying he couldn’t make the move to the States. “It really slows us down,” Shanahan says. “We may end up hiring him as a contractor and letting him work from there.” Can’t she just hire ordinary coders? Not really. Building this machine learning technology is quite different from standard software engineering. It’s less about coding and more about coaxing results from vast pools of data. The irony is that Shanahan’s domestic partner happens to be Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, one of the main companies soaking up so much of the available deep learning talent. In 2013, Google acquired DNNresearch, nabbing one of the primary forces behind this technology’s recent rise: University of Toronto professor Geoff Hinton. Then it snapped up DeepMind, the company that recently shocked the AI world by building system that could crack the ancient game of Go. These acquisitions were the start of the industry’s buying spree.

We’ll Train Them Like Dogs But it’s not just that big players like Google are buying up so much of the talent. It’s that these big players are nabbing so many startups that were trying to make AI development tools accessible to all kinds of businesses—tools that would let businesses take advantage of AI without needing as much in-house talent. Like Wise.io, Metamind aimed to provide tools that anyone could use to build machine learning services, but it has now disappeared into Salesforce. Nervana, another option, is now part of Intel. So, in a way, the world needs even more AI talent than it otherwise would—though there are signs that some of the big players will pick up the mantle of democratized AI. In the wake of the US presidential election, it may be even harder for small players to find talent. Last week, University of Montreal professor Yoshua Bengio, another key player in the deep learning movement invited AI researchers and data scientists to Quebec, where he is trying to bootstrap an entire community of companies around deep learning research. “In the depressing aftermath of the US elections, I would like to point out that interesting things are happening in the great Canadian North, with a very different kind of government,” he wrote on Facebook. Yann LeCun, the French born head of AI at Facebook, reposted the invitation, no small thing in the tiny, close-knit global community of AI researchers. “Montréal looks like a good landing site if you are an AI researcher looking for a job in North America and you belong to one (or several) categories of now-undesirable people for the newly-elected US government,” LeCun said. That potential brain drain is not a big problem for big companies like Facebook and Google and Microsoft and, yes, GE. As Immelt points out, they’re international companies that can employ researchers practically anywhere. In his post, LeCun points out that Facebook now operates an AI lab in Paris. But that dispersal of talent could add one more layer of difficulty for smaller players here in the States. If researchers flee the country and others decline to come, the pool of available talent shrinks even further, receding beyond US borders and even further into the biggest companies. For smaller companies, the hope is that some of that expertise will trickle down in the years to come. Correction: This story has been updated to clarify the mission of ClearAccessIP. Go Back to Top.

Naveh explained that the Central Bureau of Statistics data released last week depended to a large extent on one-time factors, such as car purchases and the upgrade of the Intel factory, and thus could not be relied upon to support long-term growth. The third-quarter GDP growth rate estimate published by the CBS was 3.2 percent, reflecting growth in all GDP elements other than exports. Private consumption (especially higher vehicle purchases) and upgrading of the Intel fab were the main factors in the accelerated growth rate. At the same time, the chief economist notes that the rapid growth trend in private consumption slowed slightly in the third quarter, contributing “only” 1.7 percent to third-quarter growth. “A look at the composition of growth in 2016 arouses concern that the current composition of growth is not necessarily sustainable. The relative slowdown in private consumption in the third quarter could indicate that some of the reasons for the growth in private consumption in recent quarters are short-lived,” the report stated.

Daniel Miller (TMFTwoCoins) Nov 20, 2016 at 2:00PM The automotive industry is quickly expanding from Detroit to include Silicon Valley. Image source: Getty Images. If we've heard it once, we've heard it a million times: The auto industry is going to evolve more in the next two decades than it has in the past century. While fully autonomous vehicles are a long ways off, there's no denying that our vehicles are becoming more connected to every facet of our lives. It's this wildly enticing potential that has lured in many companies not historically associated with the automotive industry. Here are two recent, and somewhat surprising, examples of tech companies leaping into the auto industry. Let's forget about exploding smartphones Given Samsung's recent smartphone "issues," expanding into automotive electronics to help diversify its revenue streams can only be even more enticing. Samsung certainly made a splash when it announced it would acquire Harman International Industries (NYSE:HAR) for $112 per share, or a total equity value of about $8 billion. Harman is mostly known for its premium audio speakers, but what many investors unfamiliar with the company may not realize is that it does so much more. Harman designs and engineers connected products and solutions for consumers and automakers such as navigation systems, audio and multimedia systems, telematics and even cybersecurity solutions, to name only a few. In fact, roughly 65% of Harman's $7 billion in sales during the  12-month period that ended Sept. 30 were automotive related. And, as previously mentioned, the potential market for the products that are making our cars increasingly smarter is vast. Image source: Samsung's acquisition presentation. This is a great move for Samsung, and signals the company's sincerity about being a big player in the evolving auto industry; for instance, Harman offers 36 global auto brands with a backlog of orders worth $24 billion, and roughly 30 million vehicles already have Harman technology. In the grand scheme of things, this is Samsung's next step in creating an ecosystem for its products that can rival those of its major competitors, as it will have connected products in your home, on your person, in your car, and at public venues. And hey, despite the price tag that was 28% premium to Harman's closing price on Nov. 11, 2016, it's instantly accretive to Samsung's earnings. A computer chip juggernaut wants in on the fun Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) splash was in a different area, more focused on the technology for autonomous vehicles, and it was a much smaller investment than Samsung's $8 billion acquisition of Harman. Intel announced at the Los Angeles Auto Show that it plans to invest more than $250 million over the next two years to develop autonomous vehicle technology, including vision processing, 5G connectivity, cloud computing, and security. In fact, just this summer Intel partnered up with Mobileye and BMW to develop a self-driving system for the iNext BMW, which is poised to play a big role in the automaker's future. This is part of a shift in strategy for Intel, which hasn't had a long history of supplying products to the auto industry, but it has recently done roughly $1 billion of wide-ranging business with well-known automakers such as BMW, Infiniti, Jaguar, Lexus, and Tesla, among many others. It's abundantly clear with the rush of tech companies into the auto industry that things are rapidly changing. Investors who keep abreast of these moves and stay on the lookout for businesses with high-quality auto technology could find the next big winner.

On the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed to withdraw from or renegotiate global trade pacts he contends kill American jobs, and raise tariffs on foreign-made goods. But Trump has also called himself a free-trader and chose in Mike Pence a running mate who has long-advocated such policies. The businessman's sizable array of branded products include dress shirts, mirrors and vodka that were made overseas. "No one's really certain which Mr. Trump is going to stand up," said Andy Anderson, executive director of the Western United States Agricultural Trade Association. For Oregon, one of the nation's most trade-dependent states, any limitation on free trade could do outsize damage to the state economy. But some in the farming world say they're encouraged by Trump's business acumen, and are hoping he will fight for them by reducing regulatory burdens and avoiding a repeat of the West Coast port crisis. The Trans-Pacific Partnership The future under Trump may be unclear, but one thing is certain. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have renegotiated portions of the North American Free Trade Agreement and paved the way for trade between the U.S. and 11 Pacific Rim countries -- though not China -- is all but dead. Though negotiations concluded a year ago, the agreement failed to garner enough support in Congress. What's more, Trump had promised to withdraw from the trade deal upon entering office. Gail Greenman, the Oregon Farm Bureau's director of national affairs, said the trade agreement would have been "extraordinarily helpful" for Oregon ranchers and farmers. Oregon exports, which include farm products, wine and - above all - Intel's microprocessors - totaled $20.1 billion in 2015, the U.S. Department of Commerce reports. Of that, $5.4 billion went to the U.S.'s free trade partners. Per the Port of Portland, nearly half of Oregon's total exports went to the would-be members of the TPP. According to Greenman, only about 20 percent of the products grown in Oregon stay in the state. Roughly 40 percent heads to other states, and the other 40 percent leaves the country. "You're talking about farmers and ranchers adding jobs," she said. "Not just for our products, but products going through Oregon." Proponents say TPP would have helped companies looking to expand in such countries as Japan, New Zealand and Vietnam by reducing tariffs on American-made goods and expanding market access. John Tapogna, president of Portland consulting firm EcoNorthwest, said the accord would have been disproportionately beneficial to Oregon. In Japan, which already has strong cultural ties to Oregon, the state's winemakers would have finally been able compete against labels from Australia and Chile, Tapogna explained. And ranchers could have tapped the country's growing appetite for beef, he said. In an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive, Alison Sokol Blosser, chief executive of Dundee's Sokol Blosser winery, expressed disappointment the trade deal fell through. "I was looking forward to our wines being more competitive in foreign markets, and being able to grow our export sales," she said. "The end of the TPP may hamper our ability to grow outside of the U.S. market." The unraveling of the trade deal is also a blow for apparel companies like Nike, Tapogna said. The Washington County-based sportswear giant contracts with factories in Vietnam to make its shoes, and some tariffs on shoes coming into the U.S. would have been eliminated, he said. "[The deal's] demise is a missed opportunity for Oregon," he said. "Trade deals on net are positive, but create winners and losers. On balance, Oregon was poised to be a winner from the TPP." Ivan Maluski, policy director for Oregon lobbying group Friends of Family Farmers, believes the TPP would have led to more corporate control of Oregon agriculture and wouldn't have been much help to the majority of the state's farmers. And though congressional leaders signaled last week that there is no path forward for the trade pact, Maluski worries it's not completely dead. "The worst parts of it could come back," he said. "I don't have a lot of hope that we're necessarily going to see better policies for small- and mid-size farms. We'll just have to see, I guess." Revisiting NAFTA On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly promised to renegotiate or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 deal that expanded trade relations between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. According to a memo by Trump's transition team obtained by CNN, the president-elect would begin his presidency by reversing "decades of conciliatory trade policy." First on the list? Reforming NAFTA. But a trade treaty that spans the continent cannot be dissolved with the snap of a finger. Even Trump's memo concedes this, and he's ordered the Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to study the legal requirements for withdrawal and its ramifications. Article 2205 of NAFTA says a member nation must simply provide six months' written notice to the other parties to withdraw. It is unclear whether the president has the unilateral power to do this or whether congressional approval is needed. Oregon exports Oregon exports totaled $20.1 billion in 2015. China is Oregon's top export market, followed by Canada, Malaysia, Japan and South Korea. Oregon's top export category is computer and electronic products, followed by machinery, chemicals, agricultural products and transportation equipment. In 2015, exports from the Portland area (including Hillsboro and Vancouver) totaled $18.8 billion. Oregon exports supported 81,547 U.S. jobs in 2015. The U.S. currently has 14 free trade agreements with 20 countries. In 2015, 27 percent of Oregon's total exports went to U.S. free trade partners. Source: U.S. Department of Commerce Despite Trump's promise to get to work on NAFTA on his first day in office, negotiations could be lengthy. And Tim Duy, director of the Oregon Economic Forum at the University of Oregon, said it's unlikely that the jobs lost domestically due to global trade will return. "It's not going to be this smooth process," he said. "It's going to be as messy going backward as it was going forward. And there's no way you're going to pull all those manufacturing jobs back. That's just a fantasy." If any manufacturing jobs do return, he said, they're more likely to return as mechanized jobs performed by robots, he said. If Trump does manage to abolish NAFTA, Duy said, it could have some benefits for Oregon. "Without NAFTA, maybe we'd have reduced imports of Canadian softwoods," he said. "That's a substitute for Oregon lumber. If Canadian firms lost their access, that might increase opportunity for Oregon timber companies." Then again, halting all trade with Mexico would result in a shortage of Mexican-grown fruits like avocados, limes and mangos, and could prevent the U.S. from outsourcing manufacturing. But Trump may not want to cut all ties with U.S. neighbors. The memo obtained by CNN shows that by Trump's 200th day in office, he hopes to be formally withdrawn from NAFTA and working to pursue bilateral trade agreements with Canada and Mexico. A trade war? Trump has said he would to impose tariffs on foreign-made goods to protect American jobs. He's taken particular aim at China, at times threatening tariffs as high as 45 percent. This could profoundly disrupt the state's economy. Last year, Oregon had more than $4 billion in exports to China, the sixth-most of any state. (Washington was number one.) However, tariffs could benefit some businesses, Duy said. "The idea of pulling back from global trade is going to have winners in the sense that U.S. firms competing with foreign firms are going to find themselves on firmer footing, but U.S. firms that operate overseas are going to find themselves facing more challenges." In a worst-case scenario, countries would respond to U.S. tariff increases with duty hikes of their own, effectively shutting American goods out of foreign markets by making them less competitive. That would spell trouble for any U.S. company that manufactures or sources materials overseas. For Daddies Board Shop, a Portland company that sells skateboards, shoes and apparel to customers throughout the world, any restriction on foreign trade could hurt. Daddies assembles its skateboards in Portland, but the components -- the decks, trucks and wheels -- come from as far away as China and as close as California. The company values that flexibility. "We like to keep a relatively lean inventory," Daddies co-owner Daron Horwitz said. "Lead times are much quicker when we order in the States. We prefer to buy here in the States, and we do when price differences aren't so wide." But Daddies usually isn't able to choose the manufacturer when it comes to the apparel or footwear it resells. Should tariffs on foreign made goods rise, Daddies would be forced to raise its prices, hurting sales, Horwitz said. But Horwitz has enough on his plate without worrying about worst-case scenarios. "My hope would be that that would have been more campaign talk than anything else," he said of Trump's threats to raise tariffs. Hope for farmers Instead of worrying whether Trump will follow through on his campaign promises, some are counting on it. Greenman, of the Oregon Farm Bureau, said farmers want the new administration to ease regulations, which address everything from labor and health care to pesticide and water. Because each of these requirements is enacted in a vacuum rather than in conjunction with existing laws, she said, complying with all of them is "basically impossible." "There's hope that there will be reform and more reasonable regulation," she said. "The regulatory burden that the federal government has placed on farmers and ranchers has increased astronomically. You have people getting out of the business because the requirements just aren't attainable." Trump's business know-how is appealing for many in Oregon, especially those affected by the recent West Coast port slowdown and the Port of Portland's loss of its container business. Since that loss, Shelly Boshart Davis, who grows grass for compressed hay near Salem, has had to reroute her shipments to ports in Seattle and Tacoma. This takes more people and more trucks, she said, and has raised her costs. When it comes to the labor disputes at the ports, Boshart Davis is hoping Trump will be more aggressive than the Obama administration. The new contract between port operators and longshore workers expires in 2019, during Trump's presidency. And because West Coast ports span multiple states, Boshart Davis feels that the president is the only one who has the ability to step in. "The hope is that it (the next round of contract negotiations) won't be as bad as it was two years ago," she said. "Because that was a mess." Boshart Davis is less worried about Trump's policies on international trade. "Regardless of what your trade policy is, if you don't have a productive port and you can't get those products to the customers," she said, "what good is that?" -- Anna Marum amarum@oregonian.com 503-294-5911 @annamarum Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

Michael Flynn, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, speaks in Washington, D.C. on July 24, 2012. Credit: Erin Kirk-Cuomo/DOD More like this U.S. response to election hacks gets bogged down in politics Trump calls for U.S. to use offensive cyberweapons Obama vows to punish Russia over election hacks Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now Michael Flynn, the man President-elect Donald Trump plans to name as U.S. national security advisor, believes the government is falling behind on cybersecurity. Trump named Flynn to his cabinet on Friday after the former military intelligence leader acted as the top military advisor to Trump's presidential campaign. Flynn previously was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and has served in U.S. intelligence operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn holds strong views on cybersecurity. He’s called U.S. cyber capabilities “underwhelming.” “We have competitors out there that are rapidly catching up with us,” he said in a speech posted online last year. In 2014, after retiring as a general, he started a consulting firm called Flynn Intel Group that specializes in preventing cyber threats for clients. “It is stunning how often nation-states such as China, Russian or Iran, or transnational criminal organizations, attack our networks,” he said in an interview last December. “It’s something we are frankly not prepared for.” On the campaign trail, Trump said the U.S. government needs to be ready to use offensive cyberweapons in response to hacking attempts from other nations.    Flynn said he agreed with that position during a separate interview with the Security Ledger last month. Experts have said a key challenge in retaliatory cyber attacks is attribution. Accurately pinning down the true culprit in any hacking attempt is often difficult. Jeffrey Prunera/DOD Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn speaks in Washington, D.C., on June 24, 2014. "We cannot win playing on one side of the playing field, on the defensive end," Flynn said. "You only are going to win if you go on the offensive once in a while.” To do so, the U.S. needs to have a technological edge over the enemy, he said. "In order to win, you want to have an unfair advantage.” The outgoing Obama administration has also considered cyber retaliation. This became an issue in October when U.S. intelligence agencies blamed Russia for trying to meddle in this year’s presidential election by hacking high-profile political targets. During the presidential campaign, Trump said he was skeptical that Russia was involved. However, Flynn said it made sense that the country would have tried to tamper with a political campaign. “We should not be surprised that a communist state run by a totalitarian dictator wants to expose the weaknesses of capitalism,” he said. In that same interview, Flynn also discussed overhauling the way the U.S. approaches cybersecurity, given the rapid changes to the IT industry. He called for a “storyteller-in-chief” who can explain to the public complicated cyber matters in way everyone can understand. He also advocates a task force that would meet frequently to discuss new legislation and policies on technology. Leaders from the private sector as well as federal and state government would participate in the task force. “There has to be some means to speed up how the government functions in this world,” he said. “There has to be an acknowledgement that we are falling behind.” To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

If you're looking for the fastest phone on Verizon, you may want to steer clear of the iPhone 7. According to researchers at Twin Prime Inc and Cellular Insights, Apple may be throttling its flagship phone on that network. Credit: Sam RutherfordMore Credit: Sam Rutherford The researchers shared their results with Bloomberg, reporting that the Galaxy S7 was twice as fast as the iPhone 7 on Verizon after collecting data from more than 100,000 phones that downloaded a large image. This huge delta exists despite the fact that the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 use the same advanced Qualcomm X12 modem. MORE: Why You Might Want to Skip iPhone 7 and Wait for 8 Why would Apple possibly throttle its own phone? Perhaps to make the device's performance more consistent across carriers. The iPhone 7 for AT&T uses a slower Intel LTE modem that's capable of 450 megabits per second speeds, while the X12 modem on the Verizon model has a theoretical max of 600 Mbps. Apple didn't deny that it might be throttling its own phone, telling Bloomberg only that the "iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards." The spokesperson added that "there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models." That may well be true, but it's important to note that Apple is comparing only iPhones to iPhones across networks and not handsets from other manufacturers. In a follow-up story, sources told Recode that Apple did in fact throttle the Qualcomm modem on the Verizon iPhone 7 in order keep the different versions of the phone "as similar as possible." Apple has another motive: to realize the cost savings of having two chip suppliers. Recode went on to say that it would be difficult to know how well the iPhone 7 would perform if the Qualcomm modem was used to its full potential because one doesn't exist. But the Galaxy S7's much better performance on the same network seems like a pretty good clue. A phone's 4G LTE throughput is only one aspect of a its performance. The overall speed, camera quality and battery life are all important. But consumers should be able to get the most out of Verizon's network, especially given that its plans tend to cost more than that of the competition.

And now, it continuing the hot streak with the Vanquish S, which the Brits have dubbed an "ultimate super GT."

This year, that change in focus even killed the long-running Los Angeles Auto Show press days, when journalists get a preview of what’s coming to the show floor: That gathering now calls itself as “Automobility LA.” Despite the rebranding and speakers from Intel, venture capital firms, and even Hyperloop One, there is still plenty of metal to ogle on the show floor, which is open to the public until November 27. Alfa Romeo and Jaguar showed off all-new, luxury SUVs. Porsche and Mazda brought race cars. Aston Martin added a lot of oomph to the Vanquish, Chrysler made the minivan cool and electric. And McLaren announced it is reviving the spirit of the glorious F1 with something it is calling the BP23. If you can’t make this year’s show, or want to know what to look for, ride through the gallery above to see the latest and greatest the auto industry has to offer.   Go Back to Top.

Back to top #2 C0lumbo   Members    4101 Like 1Likes Like Posted 20 November 2016 - 06:49 AM I'm using just a single queue. I think it's fine - if you try and split up a frames worth of rendering across multiple queues you're going to have a hell of a time synchronising up everything between those queues.   I think the rule of thumb should be that you'd only use multiple queues in situations where you want the work to be performed at different rates and/or with different priorities. For example, you might be using the GPU to decompress textures on the fly (like Rage say). The timing of that work has a degree of separation from the main business of rendering a frame, so it might make sense for it to be done on a different queue. I don't think there'd be big gains to spreading out a single frame's worth of work across multiple queues.   "I guess its theoretically possible that a GPU/driver could reorder command submissions to obtain some level of parallelization, but I don't know if any actually do." - Even using a single queue, you're still going to get an enormous amount of parallelization on pretty much every task you perform. The advantage of multiple queues is that it gives the scheduler an option to be clever in the event that there are bubbles that are preventing you from keeping the cores busy. I think multiple queues are slightly analogous to hyperthreading behaviour on CPUs, they give the hardware an opportunity to go off and do something else when one task is stalled, to stretch the analogy, imagine your GPU is like a CPU with 128 cores, it's not like using a single queue will utilize only a single core, it's more like you're using all 128 cores, but have disabled the hyperthreading on them.   Edit: This might be useful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37575012/should-i-try-to-use-as-many-queues-as-possible Edited by C0lumbo, 20 November 2016 - 06:56 AM.

Back to top #5 JoeJ   Members    1828 Like 1Likes Like Posted 20 November 2016 - 10:55 AM I generate per frame command buffers only for debug output.   Anything serious is: Create command buffers once with indirect dispatch commands, at runtime fill the dispatch buffer from a compute shader (e.g. doing frustum culling). This makes the whole idea of multithreaded rendering obsolete - per frame the CPU only needs to submit the same command buffers so there is no point to use multiple threads.   I think this approach can scale up well to a complex graphics engine with very few exceptions. E.g. if you want to keep occlusion culling on CPU, per frame this only results in a buffer upload to identify visible stuff. No new command buffer is necessary.

Personally i don't think using one queue per render thread makes a lot of sense. After multiple command buffers has been created we can just use one thread to submit them.   Welcome to the world of hardware differences and the lies they tell So, NV.. ugh.. NV are basically a massive black box because unless you are an ISV of standing (I guess?) they pretty much don't tell you anything about how the important bits of their hardware work, which is a pain and leads to people trying to figure out wtf is going on when their hardware starts to run slowly. The first thing we learn is that not all queues are created equally; even if you can create 16 queues which can consume all the commands this doesn't indicate how well it will execute. The point of contention doesn't in fact seem to be the CUDA or CU cores (NV and AMD respectively) but the front end dispatcher logic, at least in NV's case. A bit of simplified GPU theory; Your commands, when submitted to the GPU are dispatched in order the front end command processor sees them. This command processor can only keep so many work packets in flight before it has to wait for resources. So, for example, it might be able to keep 10 'draw' packets in flight but if you submit an 11th, even if you have a CUDA/CU unit free which could do the work the command processor can't dispatch the work to it until it has free resources to track said work. Also, iirc, work is retired in-order : so if 'draw' packet '3' finishes before '1' then the command processor can still be blocked from dispatching more work out to the ALU segment of the GPU. On anything pre-Pascal I would just avoid trying to interleave Gfx and compute queue work at all; just go with a single queue as the hardware seems to have problem keeping work sanely in flight when mixing. By all accounts Pascal seems to do better, but I've not seen many net wins in benchmarks from it (at least, not to a significant amount) so even with Pascal you might want to default to a single queue. (Pre-emption doesn't really help with this either; that deals with the ability to swap state out so that other work can take over and it is a heavy operation; CPU wise it is closer to switching processes with the amount of overhead. Pascal's tweak here is the ability to suspend work at instruction boundaries.) AMD are a lot more open with how their stuff works, which is good for us Basically all AMD GCN based cards in the wild today will have hardware for 1 'Graphics queue' (which can consume gfx, compute and copy commands) and 2 DMA queues which can consume copy commands only. The compute queues are likely both driver and hardware dependant however. When Vulkan first appeared my R290 reported back only 2 compute queues; it now reports 7. However I'm currently not sure how that maps to hardware; while the hardware has 8 'async compute units' this doesn't mean that it is one queue per ACE as each ACE can service 8 'queues' of instructions themselves. (So, in theory, Vulkan on my AMD hardware could report 64 compute only queues, 8*8) If it is then life gets even more fun because each ACE can maintain two pieces of work at once meaning you could launch, resources allowing, 14 'compute' jobs + N gfx jobs and not have anything block. When it comes to using this stuff, certainly in an async manner, then it is important to consider what is going on at the same time. If your gfx task is bandwidth heavy but ALU light then you might have some ALU spare for some compute work to take advantage of - but if you pair ALU heavy with ALU heavy, or bandwidth heavy with bandwidth heavy you might see a performance dip. Ultimately the best thing you can do is probably to make your graphics/compute setup data driven in some way so you can reconfigure things based on hardware type and factors like resolution of the screen etc. I certainly, however, wouldn't try to drive the hardware from multiple threads in to the same window/view - that feels like a terrible idea and problems waiting to happen. - Jobs to build command lists - Master job(s) to submit built commands in the correct order to the correct queue That would be my take on the setup.   A third option would be to write separate rendering pipelines for each card type. Write one solution for NVidia, one for AMD, etc... but this isn't something I'd like to do.  I think you should. I'm still on AMD only at the moment but in the past i've had some differences just in compute shaders between NV / AMD resulting in +/-50% performance. I expect the same applies to almost anything else especially with a more low level API To a degree you'll have to do this if you want maximal performance; if you don't want max performance I would question your Vulkan usage, more so if you don't want to deal with the hardware awareness which comes with it However, it doesn't have to be too bad if you can design your rendering/compute system in such as way that it is flexiable enough to cover the differences - at the simplest level you have a graph which indicates your gfx/compute work and on AMD you dispatch to 2 queues and on NV you serialise in to a single queue in the correct order. (Also, don't forget Intel in all this). Your shaders and the parameters to them will require tweaking too; AMD prefer small foot prints in the 'root' data because they have limited register space to preload. NV on the other hand are good with lots of stuff in the 'root' signature of the shaders. You'll also likely want to take advantage of shader extensions too for maximal performance on the respective hardware. Edited by phantom, 21 November 2016 - 08:02 AM.

Back to top #8 phantom   Members    10959 Like 2Likes Like Posted 21 November 2016 - 02:16 AM Yep, that's a good default position to take - compute of course depends on your workloads even with AMD but it's a good target to have as it means the spare ALU can be used even when the command processor has no more 'work slots' to hand out. (General feel is that AMD have less 'work slots' than NV on their graphics command processor, which is partly why NV have better performance with a single queue as you leave less ALU on the table by default, kind of a AMD can launch 5, NV can launch 10 thing.. I've just made those numbers up however, but you get the idea ;) ) I should probably ask someone (either at work or just from AMD) how command queues map to hardware with Vulkan for compute; if it runs on the same ACE then more then you hit the 'work slot' limit with two compute workloads in flight at once, but if it is mapped across them then you could have up to 14 independent things going at once. Would be nice to know the balance. However, as a rule, 1-1-1 AMD, 1-1 NV and potentially only gfx for Intel due to shared memory. And being able to configure your app via data to start up in any of those modes is also a good idea for sanity reasons; ie do everything on the gfx queue to make sure things are sane with synchronisation before trying to introduce a compute queue. (Same reason you'll want a Fence All The Things! mode for debug/sanity reasons) Back to top #9 JoeJ   Members    1828 Like 0Likes Like Posted 21 November 2016 - 09:03 AM Some relevant things covered here: http://gpuopen.com/vulkan-and-doom/   I should probably ask someone (either at work or just from AMD) how command queues map to hardware with Vulkan for compute; if it runs on the same ACE then more then you hit the 'work slot' limit with two compute workloads in flight at once, but if it is mapped across them then you could have up to 14 independent things going at once.

Judging just by numbers, it looks that way. According to the latest edition of the Top500 list released this week at Salt Lake City, China currently not only hosts the top two fastest supercomputers in the world, but also ties with the United States for first place in the total number of installed systems. The machine sitting on top of the rankings, called Sunway TaihuLight, is especially remarkable in that it's almost exclusively based on technology developed in China, including processors. What's more, it delivers almost the same performance as the next five most powerful systems on the semiannual list combined. However, many experts, especially those from China, have different views. While China is rapidly on the rise on the global supercomputing stage, the country still has a long way to go to become a peer competitor to the United States, they believe. RAPID DEVELOPMENT "I was quite impressed with the engineering quality of TaihuLight, different from previous Chinese machines," Professor Satoshi Matsuoka from the Tokyo Institute of Technology tweeted after a close look at the system himself at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China, in early November. In particular, Satoshi, a renowned supercomputing expert, mentioned of the machine's "excellent" physical design, "aggressive" designs, "impressive" software and application efforts, as well as "no expensive parts." As a result, he concluded that China "now truly rivals U.S., Japan" in the field of high performance computing (HPC). How things have changed! Back in 2001, none of the systems on the Top500 list were installed in China. "It's clear that there has been a lot of investments in this technology if you look at, maybe, a 15-year timeframe from about 2000 on, China is (now) on a very, very competitive stage," Top500 co-author Horst Simon said in an interview with Xinhua. When asked when China will be a "serious challenger" to the United States in supercomputing, Simon, Deputy Director of the U.S. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, answered with confidence: "Oh, already now." The rise of China in the HPC field will have positive implications for the country's national security, especially after last year's surprising move by the U.S government that, citing security concerns, blocked the supply of Intel chips to four Chinese supercomputing research centers, said Zizhong Chen, a supercomputing expert at the University of California, Riverside. "The fact that Chinese have built the fastest supercomputer using their own CPUs and interconnection networks implies China will not have to worry about any U.S. supercomputer chip ban any more," said Chen. OVERSEAS EXPANSION It's also worth mentioning that China now has four companies among the top 10 vendors of the list: Lenovo, Sugon, Inspur and Huawei. These companies sold 173 systems in total, accounting for one third of the list. In June 2015, there were only 10 such systems from Chinese vendors. "Chinese manufactures like Lenovo and Huawei are doing well globally," said Jack Dongarra, professor of the University of Tennessee and coauthor of the Top500."The others not really, just in China which is a big market." Both Sugon and Inspur, however, told Xinhua at the 2016 supercomputing conference at Salt Lake City, that they're now shifting their expansion focus to overseas markets. "To be honest, our international expansion is still in early stages," Cao Zhennan, general manager of the HPC Department at Sugon. "But it's our next step." PROGRESS IN HPC APPLICATIONS Of course, the numbers aren't everything. While China has demonstrated its strength in hardware, the country does have its shortcomings, such as software. "Supercomputing is a whole ecosystem, it consists of hardware, software, applications, the education, infrastructure, (efforts) to build next generation of scientists, and also I think a certain readiness in universities, research institutes, companies to engage in this," said Simon of Berkeley Lab. "It's very difficult to do these many different things at one time ... so I think it will take a bit longer (to become a supercomputing power), and in that sense, China still has a number of things to accomplish." However, China's progress in HPC applications did impress the highly respected U.S. expert deeply, who recalled a lack of applications for China's Tianhe-1A in 2010 when the machine became the first Chinese system to take over the top spot of the Top500 list. "When the Taihulight system was announced (this June), there were several application presentations and these are very good application presentations, they (Chinese) told me that a lot of Chinese scientists have now learned much faster how to use in the architecture," Simon said. "So I think things have significantly progressed, and there may be still some other things missing, but it's clear, given that the hardware is there, the applications are there, and the infrastructure is there and getting a lot of support, China has made huge progress towards using supercomputers," he said. On Thursday, one of the applications, named "10M-Core Scalable Fully-Implicit Solver for Nonhydrostatic Atmospheric Dynamics," was awarded the 2016 ACM Gordon Bell Prize, a top honor in supercomputing, at the 2016 supercomputing conference. It is the first time a Chinese application has won the award. STRONG SENSE OF CRISIS The most noticeable weakness in China's HPC industry was its heavy dependence on U.S. processors. "China imports a lot of semiconductors. If you look at today, semiconductor is everywhere, in any type of industrial products," Simon said. "So if China has ambitions to grow all the manufacturing of high-end goods, China obviously needs to invest much in semiconductors to have a bigger domestic production of semiconductors. I think that is a big issue." "Without mastering the processor technology, we will never be a supercomputing power," Cao of Sugon said. Liu Jun, Inspur's HPC general manager, stressed he has "a strong sense of crisis" after studying the latest Top500 list. "Most of the U.S. supercomputers are deployed in national laboratories, universities and research institutes, and they have invested a lot in this area and have updated their systems very quickly," said Liu. "But many of our supercomputers are just Internet data centers. In the U.S., they are not considered supercomputers. Universities and research institutes in China need this infrastructure, but our investments for them are small, so much more work needs to be done." "If we are blindly optimistic for these good numbers, the gap between us and the United States will be widened, rather than narrowed, Liu warned.

At UC Berkeley, professors aren’t tested, but campus police officers are. The network company Cisco Systems doesn’t test; the construction company Cisco does.

Credit: ARM More like this Rick Perry, climate change skeptic, soon to oversee U.S. supercomputing Will Trump let China beat the U.S. in supercomputing? The march toward exascale computers Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles The U.S believes it will be ready to seek vendor proposals to build two exascale supercomputers -- costing roughly $200 million to $300 million each -- by 2019. The two systems will be built at the same time and will be ready for use by 2023, although it's possible one of the systems could be ready a year earlier, according to U.S. Department of Energy officials. But the scientists and vendors developing exascale systems do not yet know whether President-Elect Donald Trump's administration will change directions. The incoming administration is a wild card. Supercomputing wasn't a topic during the campaign, and Trump's dismissal of climate change as a hoax, in particular, has researchers nervous that science funding may suffer. At the annual supercomputing conference SC16 last week in Salt Lake City, a panel of government scientists outlined the exascale strategy developed by President Barack Obama's administration. When the session was opened to questions, the first two were about Trump. One attendee quipped that "pointed-head geeks are not going to be well appreciated." Another person in the audience, John Sopka, a high-performance computing software consultant, asked how the science community will defend itself from claims that "you are taking the money from the people and spending it on dreams," referring to exascale systems. Paul Messina, a computer scientist and distinguished fellow at Argonne National Labs who heads the Exascale Computing Project, appeared sanguine. "We believe that an important goal of the exascale computing project is to help economic competitiveness and economic security," said Messina. "I could imagine that the administration would think that those are important things." Politically, there ought to be a lot in HPC's favor. A broad array of industries rely on government supercomputers to conduct scientific research, improve products, attack disease, create new energy systems and understand climate, among many other fields. Defense and intelligence agencies also rely on large systems. The ongoing exascale research funding (the U.S. budget is $150 million this year) will help with advances in software, memory, processors and other technologies that ultimately filter out to the broader commercial market. This is very much a global race, which is something the Trump administration will have to be mindful of. China, Europe and Japan are all developing exascale systems. China plans to have an exascale system ready by 2020. These nations see exascale -- and the computing advances required to achieve it -- as a pathway to challenging America's tech dominance. "I'm not losing sleep over it yet," said Messina, of the possibility that the incoming Trump administration may have different supercomputing priorities. "Maybe I will in January." The U.S. will award the exascale contracts to vendors with two different architectures. This is not a new approach and is intended to help keep competition at the highest end of the market. Recent supercomputer procurements include systems built on the IBM Power architecture, Nvidia's Volta GPU and Cray-built systems using Intel chips. The timing of these exascale systems -- ready for 2023 -- is also designed to take advantage of the upgrade cycles at the national labs. The large systems that will be installed in the next several years will be ready for replacement by the time exascale systems arrive. The last big performance milestone in supercomputing occurred in 2008 with the development of a petaflop system. An exaflop is a 1,000-petaflop system and building it is challenging because of the limits of Moore's Law, a 1960s-era observation that noted the number of transistors on a chip doubles about every two years. "Now we're at the point where Moore's Law is just about to end," said Messina in an interview. That means the key to building something faster "is by having much more parallelism, and many more pieces. That's how you get the extra speed." An exascale system will solve a problem 50 times faster than the 20-petaflop systems in use in government labs today. Development work has begun on the systems and applications that can utilize hundreds of millions of simultaneous parallel events. "How do you manage it -- how do you get it all to work smoothly?" said Messina. Another major problem is energy consumption. An exascale machine can be built today using current technology, but such a system would likely need its own power plant. The U.S. wants an exascale system that can operate on 20 megawatts and certainly no more than 30 megawatts. Scientists will have to come up with a way "to vastly reduce the amount of energy it takes to do a calculation," said Messina. The applications and software development are critical because most of the energy is used to move data. And new algorithms will be needed. About 500 people are working at universities and national labs on the DOE's coordinated effort to develop the software and other technologies exascale will need. Aside from the cost of building the systems, the U.S. will spend millions funding the preliminary work. Vendors want to maintain the intellectual property of what they develop. If it cost, for instance, $50 million to develop a certain aspect of a system, the U.S. may ask the vendor to pay 40% of that cost if they want to keep the intellectual property. A key goal of the U.S. research funding is to avoid creation of one-off technologies that can only be used in these particular exascale systems. "We have to be careful," Terri Quinn, a deputy associate director for HPC at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said at the SC16 panel session. "We don't want them (vendors) to give us capabilities that are not sustainable in a business market." The work under way will help ensure that the technology research is far enough along to enable the vendors to respond to the 2019 request for proposals. Supercomputers can deliver advances in modeling and simulation. Instead of building physical prototypes of something, a supercomputer can allow modeling virtually. This can speed the time it takes something to get to market, whether a new drug or car engine. Increasingly, HPC is used in big data and is helping improve cybersecurity through rapid analysis; artificial intelligence and robotics are other fields with strong HPC demand. China will likely beat the U.S. in developing an exascale system, but the real test will be their usefulness. Messina said the U.S. approach is to develop an exascale eco-system involving vendors, universities and the government. The hope is that the exascale systems will not only a have a wide range of applications ready for them, but applications that are relatively easy to program. Messina wants to see these systems quickly put to immediate and broad use. "Economic competitiveness does matter to a lot of people," said Messina.

Industrial monitoring and control is a significant application for the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), one with a clear potential for a significant return on investment. But retrofitting legacy industrial systems with networked monitoring and control devices can be a significant design challenge for factory owners and OEM providers alike. A new development platform from Maxim Integrated looks like it can provide a lot of help. Maxim's Pocket IO PLC development platform simplifies and speeds Industrial IoT design by providing a powerful, compact, low-power, networkable monitoring and control unit with which factories can experiment using the IoT and developers can prototype their designs. As a stand-alone product, it offers 30 analog and digital IO ports in various flavors for making measurements, attaching sensors, and driving industrial systems—including motors and other inductive loads—in a daughterboard attached to an Intel Edison processor module. USB and Wi-Fi are both communications options, as are several fieldbus options, providing a range of connectivity options. For power, the Pocket IO can operate from onboard AA batteries or external DC through 42 V. It is also compact, measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 0.8 in., and environmentally rugged, using parts rated for –40°C to 125°C. Together, these attributes make it easy for experimenters to connect the device to existing systems to explore the industrial IoT's potential in actual factory conditions. To further simplify such explorations, the device is programmable using Arduino sketches and can be configured and controlled using a smartphone app. The smartphone also serves as a graphical interface to the design. Thus, experimenters can quickly develop and try a variety of configurations to see what will work best for them. The platform also supports prototyping for a more robust development effort following the experimental stage. In addition to allowing Arduino Sketch development, the platform has the support of Intel's Edison Eclipse IDE tool chain under Windows, Linux, or MacOS. All of the key semiconductor elements used in the daughterboard design, such as the high-side drivers, digital isolators, and power converters, come from Maxim, so developers working with the board only need to interact with a single source of vendor support. This is not a complete IIoT system solution, however. While the platform has Wi-Fi connectivity, there is no cloud connectivity. The platform interface for experimentation and prototyping is a local smartphone. Developers seeking internet connectivity will need to include software for networking, security, and cloud services on their own. Still, the platform provides a vital leg up in the development of the edge node of their IIoT system. This kind of platform may be just what companies interested in the IIoT need to get their projects started. More than 80% of large companies have indicated that they believe the IIoT will be essential to their future success, but only 24% have a clear IoT strategy, according to a Genpact research study. The rest are blocked by concerns about such things as handling legacy equipment, an inability to do fast experiments, and lack of appropriate skills in their IT staff, among other things. An out-of-the-box development platform like this helps to bypass such concerns. It could prove to be the key that unlocks the IIoT for industrial applications that currently remain uncommitted. —Rich Quinnell covers industrial control for EE Times.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Qualcomm claims it will lead the mobile industry with Snapdragon 835, 10nm manufacturing Qualcomm claims it will lead the mobile industry with Snapdragon 835, 10nm manufacturing By Joel Hruska on November 21, 2016 at 3:15 pm Comment Qualcomm wants to take a leadership position on 10nm manufacturing technology, and plans to have the Snapdragon 835 in devices by the first half of 2017. This quick 10nm ramp will happen in partnership with Samsung, which also led the industry on early 14nm technology. It also suggests Apple may have shifted the majority of its orders over to TSMC, since in the past it’s been Apple that locked up early capacity and volume shipments at foundry manufacturers. “We are excited to continue working together with Samsung in developing products that lead the mobile industry,” said Keith Kressin, senior vice president, product management, Qualcomm Technologies. Inc. “Using the new 10nm process node is expected to allow our premium tier Snapdragon 835 processor to deliver greater power efficiency and increase performance while also allowing us to add a number of new capabilities that can improve the user experience of tomorrow’s mobile devices.” Right now, Qualcomm is still keeping its cards close to its vest, as far as Snapdragon 835’s CPU or GPU cores. We only know that the platform will contain a USB-C compatible version of Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4 technology. Presumably we’ll see some modest tweaks to both CPU and GPU architectures rather than brand-new core designs (though a new GPU cores isn’t outside the realm of possibility). Fudzilla has some interesting information on how mobile technology is now driving the push towards new foundry nodes that’s worth mentioning: There are several reasons for this. First, the advent of smartphones means there’s a tremendous amount of revenue flowing into these product segments that didn’t previously exist. In the past, it was GPUs and other high-end hardware that drove new node investments. But the combined profits of AMD and Nvidia in the GPU market (even if you throw in consoles) pale in comparison to what TSMC and Samsung make off mobile. Second, the sheer costs of building newer nodes have made those early costs less attractive to companies like AMD and Nvidia as well. This had its own knock-on effect, where the foundries now pursue secondary nodes that are less attractive to high-power manufacturers in the first place. We’re already hearing rumors that 10nm, like 20nm, may be a short-lived node for some companies, and it wouldn’t surprise us if AMD and Nvidia opt for second-generation 14nm hardware and skip 10nm altogether. This could be somewhat complicated if one foundry focuses on 10nm and one does not (Samsung and TSMC appear to be pursuing somewhat different strategies here, while GlobalFoundries is skipping 10nm altogether and heading straight for 7nm). But whichever nodes shake out as the long-lived nodes at TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries, it now makes more sense for many customers to follow the adoption curve rather than trying to lead it. For the foundries, the opposite is true — whichever company can offer a node first tends to capture a significant amount of revenue from that node. As always, keep in mind that the foundry nodes are also different between Intel and the pure-play foundries — what Samsung and TSMC call 10nm isn’t going to correspond to what Intel refers to as 10nm. If Qualcomm can hit 10nm before its rivals, it should give the company an early lead, but Apple remains the mobile company to beat as far as CPU performance and efficiency are concerned. Even the Snapdragon 821 doesn’t compare well against Apple’s A10 Fusion single-threaded performance. And while Android devices tend to win multi-core performance comparisons on sheer core count, Apple builds an extremely competitive device overall, with best-in-class GPU performance.

(EPA/Tannen Maury) Share Written by Eshe Nelson & Jason Karaian November 21, 2016 Since Donald Trump won the US presidential election, stocks have been soaring on the assumption that his administration will boost spending, cut taxes, and reduce regulation. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq indexes are on track to set simultaneous record highs today, which doesn’t happen very often. The Dow and S&P have been trading above their previous cyclical peaks, set in late 2007, for some time now (both in nominal and inflation-adjusted terms). The tech-heavy Nasdaq, however, only recently settled above the levels last seen in March 2000, during the height of the dot-com boom: In inflation-adjusted terms, though, the Nasdaq remains far below its previous peak: Now that was a bubble. The Nasdaq today bears little resemblance to the one back in 2000; in inflation-adjusted terms even the mighty Apple looks modest by comparison. It will be some time before we see valuations like those again, regardless of Trump’s plans to make America’s markets great again.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Integrated GPUs look like they’ll be good enough for Windows 10’s VR Not only will the headsets be cheaper, so too will the PC needed to run them. by Peter Bright - Nov 21, 2016 8:20 pm UTC Login to bookmark 68 The hardware checks don't verify the presence of HDMI. Perhaps they take it for granted. The hardware checks don't verify the presence of HDMI. Perhaps they take it for granted. The little animation tells you to clear some space. My office isn't that big. I wish I was a little bit taller. Here we reach an impasse, as without hardware, there is no tracking. With next year's Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft is integrating 3D capabilities for virtual reality and augmented reality headsets into the standard Windows operating system. Along with this, companies including Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, and Acer will be shipping a range of VR headsets starting at just $299. This will bring down the price of PC-based VR, but the headset isn't the only expense: both the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive have relatively steep hardware requirements. In particular, they need relatively fast, discrete GPUs, with the Nvidia GTX 960 (Oculus) or 970 (Vive) being listed as minimum requirements. If Valve's hardware survey of Steam users is anything to judge by, even many PC gamers will need to upgrade in order to meet the minimum VR requirements. Microsoft hasn't published the full Windows Holographic hardware requirements yet, but an application shipping in the latest preview builds, the Windows Holographic First Run app, gives some hints as to what they are. The app is similar to apps that Oculus and Valve have produced for their respective platforms: it checks your system specs to determine if it's going to be ready for VR systems. Microsoft's app is a little vague, but it seems to be aiming quite low: it requires a four-thread processor (either quad core or two core/four thread), 4GB RAM (lower than Oculus' 8GB requirement), USB 3, and some amount of disk space. The most striking difference is in the GPU requirement. The Microsoft tool demands only DirectX 12 graphics. Notably, this isn't a requirement for a discrete GPU: the integrated GPU in Intel processors appears to pass the test (verified with Skylake), and in principle, everything from Haswell onward should make the grade. AMD's integrated graphics on 6000-series processors or better should also be good enough. The First Run tool also tells you to clear an area of a few square feet to run VR apps, and it tries to establish positional tracking (though this step naturally fails due to the lack of hardware to test with). Interestingly, the app says to make sure that the device is visible to (presumably external) sensors. The hardware Microsoft is promising shouldn't need external sensors for positional tracking; it's claimed to have inside-out, six degree of freedom motion sensing, meaning that it can detect rotations and translations along all three axes without needing external references. HoloLens can achieve this by using its Kinect-style 3D mapping of the room, but neither the Oculus Rift nor the HTC Vive can achieve the same feat. They both need wall-mounted sensors to track translations. The implication here is that Windows Holographic will support both styles of headset depending on what users have available. Still unknown is precisely what kind of user experience Microsoft is offering. Clearly these specs aren't going to hit the same performance as those of the first-generation headsets, but they may be competitive with VR experiences such as the GearVR. For introducing people to VR, that may well be good enough. Listing image by Microsoft Expand full story Reader comments 68 You must login or create an account to comment.

Share on Twitter Click me! Copy Link For a moment, it seemed as if another U.S. presidential election was going to blow up another international climate deal. After American voters delivered Donald Trump a surprising Electoral College victory, many feared that the Paris Agreement that went into force just days earlier would suffer the same fate as the Kyoto Protocol. That first landmark global climate treaty notoriously lost its way when President George W. Bush pulled out of the deal shortly after taking office. As the election results came in during the first week of the U.N. climate talks in Marrakech, Morocco, it became clear that the next leader of the world’s second largest greenhouse gas emitter would be a guy who once called climate change a hoax created by the Chinese and said on the campaign trail that he’d tear up the Paris Agreement. But rather than implode, the talks took on a surprising sense of resolve. Immediately after Trump’s victory, high-level foreign ministers from China to Russia to Saudi Arabia to the European Union all recommitted to the global pact. “We must honor commitments and consolidate mutual trust," said China's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua. Speaking more directly to Trump, French President Francois Hollande said, "The United States, the largest economic power in the world, the second largest greenhouse gas emitter, must respect the commitments it has undertaken.” Delegate after delegate, leader after leader, declared the transition to a low carbon economy “irreversible,” a phrase that became something of a rallying cry for the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP22).  Indeed, there was a palpable sense in Marrakech that if Trump were to isolate on climate, then Americans would be the big losers. “The Paris Agreement cannot be stopped as the global energy transition cannot be stopped,” said Miguel Arias Cañete, the Spanish head of the European Commission. “The world is forging ahead, and the smart money is on clean energy. Who would be against this unstoppable global trend? Who would like to be left behind?” Keeping a positive attitude might have been victory enough, considering the circumstances, but this year’s summit had been hyped as a “COP of action.” So what did they actually get done? The Official Business Last year in Paris, nations had a hard deadline to deliver on a unanimous, global deal. This year, there was no such pressure. Still, most years the country that hosts the COP likes to make sure that there’s some official text with a city’s name on it. It’s a branding thing. For instance, the phrase “Marrakech Accords” might already sit somewhere in the recesses of your mind, maybe with a vague sense of goodwill attached to them. Those were adopted and signed back at COP7 in 2001. This year we got the Marrakech Action Proclamation; the tight, one-page document “affirms commitments to the full implementation” of the Paris Agreement—a slightly more than symbolic gesture in post-Trump diplomacy—and also outlines how the aggregate pledges made by countries under the deal would not deliver on the agreed target to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). “We call for urgently raising ambition and strengthening cooperation amongst ourselves to close the gap between current emissions trajectories and the pathway needed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.” In other words, nations recognize that their promises need to actually add up to the goals they’ve set. Poor Nations Lead The Way The Marrakech meetings also produced a couple of meaningful announcements from some influential players in the talks. Some agreements and decisions—like the Marrakech Action Proclamation—occur within the official framework of the U.N. climate talks. Others happen under the umbrella of the U.N. body, but aren’t formal consensus decisions. Last week, 22 countries—including the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Germany—together released long term plans for how to deeply cut their greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury. Such deep decarbonization plans are encouraged under the Paris Agreement, but not mandated. With the release of these midcentury strategies, nations, and even states and cities, encourage others to develop and publish respective plans. “The 2050 pathways have a critical role to play in the transition, because while having a good plan is never a sufficient condition for success, not having one is always a recipe for failure,” said Laurence Tubiana, French ambassador for climate negotiation. Canada’s Environment Minister Catherine McKenna paraphrased hockey legend Wayne Gretzky in describing the goal of the 2050 pathways: “You skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where the puck has been.” The sturdy 111-page U.S. plan calls for a three-prong approach to achieve an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050: to transform energy systems to low-carbon sources; to sequester more carbon through reforestation and soils and other land use patterns; and to reduce non-carbon dioxide GHG emissions, such as methane. It’s a comprehensive, relatively ambitious plan with a lot of good ideas. It was also put to shame by the announcement made a day after it’s release by a number of the world’s poorest countries. On Friday, a group of 47 nations most imperiled by rising seas and soaring temperatures agreed unanimously to transition to 100 percent renewable energy “no later than 2030-2050.” The Marrakech Communique and Vision texts released by the group known as the Climate Vulnerable Forum also included extensive plans for how to report on progress. Of the CVF’s pledges, Edgar Gutiérrez, Costa Rica’s environment minister, said, “We don’t know what countries are still waiting for to move towards net carbon neutrality and 100 percent renewable energy. All parties should start the transition, otherwise we will all suffer.” Gemedo Dalle, environment minister of Ethiopia, said, “Without stronger climate action, we might not survive, and this is not an option.” The Market Has Spoken President-elect Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to do right by American businesses. Well, American businesses spoke up during COP22 and made the strong case for sticking to the Paris Agreement and aggressively pursuing a low-carbon future. Last Wednesday, a group of more than 360 companies, including a dozen Fortune 500 companies and 72 with annual revenues exceeding $100 million, sent an open letter to the president-elect, calling on “elected U.S. leaders to strongly support … continued U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement.” Some high profile companies like DuPont, General Mills, HP, Hilton, Intel, Kellogg, Nike, Staples, and Tiffany (which might get Melania’s attention), signed the letter that stated directly, “We want the U.S. economy to be energy-efficient and powered by low-carbon energy. … Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.” Kevin Rabinovitch, the global sustainability director at Mars, said in Marrakech that Trump’s election would not at all impact his company’s internal emissions-reduction plans. Of Mars, which is ranked by Forbes as the sixth largest privately held company in the United States, Rabinovitch said: “We are a food business, we have supply chains all over the world. At the base of every supply chain is a farm. Those farms are exposed to the climate. The raw materials we buy are affected by climate change… If we’re the only ones that take action, that doesn’t address the risks we face, so we need other companies and other governments too… The Paris Agreement, for America, is good business.” On top of these 360 companies, another 200 signed a separate pledge last week to set “science based” targets for the internal emissions reductions. Walmart, Coca-Cola, Dell, General Mills, Kellogg, NRG Energy, and Proctor & Gamble were among those to establish operational emissions targets consistent with the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping temperatures well below the 2 degree Celsius warming threshold. Until recently, it was thought that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was a business liability—that it created a competitive disadvantage—and that’s clearly the thinking that guide’s Trump’s public comments about the Paris Agreement and U.S. emissions pledges. However, some data released last week by the Global Carbon Project showed that global greenhouse gas emissions stayed flat for a third straight year, while the world economy kept growing. This signals a monumental and historic shift: economic growth has effectively decoupled from greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States alone, this decoupling is clearly evident: This new economic and business reality has been anticipated by the most forward-looking businesses, which are positioned to thrive in a carbon-constrained world. Countries who recognize this reality will, likewise, prosper, and those who don’t will be left behind. “Ultimately, clean energy is expected to be a multi-trillion dollar market—the largest market the world has ever known,” said Secretary of State John Kerry in his final address to the U.N. climate community as America’s top diplomat. “And no nation will do well if it sits on the sidelines, handicapping it’s own businesses.” Photo: A “family photo” outside the COP22 venue, emphasizing that parties are committed to the Paris Agreement.

Members of Indiranagar Runners, a club that was formed three years ago by Ankita Gaur, say there’s no excitement in running alone and it is always better to get the community together. The club consists of people of all age groups. Some of the members have graduated from being regular early morning walkers to serious runners. Even women make concerted efforts to complete their household chores early to join the group every morning. Ankita, who spearheaded the formation of the club, says the idea dawned on her when running alone became a boring proposition. “I was looking for company and running alone sometimes becomes boring. A group of friends keep you motivated and you get to learn a lot from them. Cubbon Park is good option for runners but we have nothing in our neighbourhood. Hence, I decided to form a small group just to run and have fun,” explains Ankita. She points out that the group has runners from 17 to 25 years. “There is no restriction on the age limit. I have met some interesting people through this group. From great runners to beautiful human beings who have taught me a lot of things. It has helped me evolve as a long-distance runner,” she adds. Some of the members of the group say that they usually hit the road for an early morning jog but only after they joined the group did they start to run in a more disciplined manner. Vishal Namboori, an IT professional, who joined the group almost a year ago, says, “You meet all kinds of people and this indirectly helps you network better. I started to run a disciplined way only after I joined the group and mingling with the others has changed my perspective towards the culture of running.” It is the diversity of the group that motivated Abishek Rao, an employee with Nokia Network, to join it. “Running is a great way to de-stress and a wonderful hobby because it keeps your mind active and helps widen your social circuit. The trend of running has caught up with a lot of youngsters in the city,” he observes. There’s no compulsion to run and the group does well to celebrate fitness, feels Ratan Prasad, an employee of Intel and one of the founders of the group. He points out the group has about 500 followers on Facebook and the numbers in the city have been growing by the day. “Running as a group instills a discipline and dispels a lot of myths about what comprises a balanced diet. The talks by experts help people understand why running is an important activity that needs to be practised religiously,” explains Ratan. Akshay Takkar, another member of the group, says that it’s only after he started running on a regular basis that he realised that it not only boosts one’s mental and physical strength but also leaves one feeling active throughout the day. “Running with the group has helped me develop stamina and also given me an insight into the different techniques involved in running. The group easily motivates one to making running an indispensable part of one’s routine,” he concludes.

The ROG GX800 taps its liquid-cooled Hydro Overclocking System add-on dock for extreme overclocking across the board: the laptop's onboard Intel i7 6820HK can hit 4.2GHz and its dual NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080s to hit 1961MHz and VRAM overclocked to 5200MHz with the liquid-cooling add-on, and RAM can be OC'ed to 2800MHz.     The ROG GX800 rocks a 60Hz 18.4-inch 16:9 LED 4K IPS G-Sync display with 100% Adobe RGB, with its internal components clocking in with an Intel Core i7 6820HK Processor, up to 64GB of 2800Mhz DDR4 RAM, dual NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 SLI with 16GB of GDDR5X VRAM, and a 512GB PCIe SSD with support for up to three M.2 PCIe-based SSDs in RAID 0. The performance notebook also features a full ROG Aura RGB mechanical keyboard.   ASUS has yet to reveal pricing or launch info, but the GX700 cost about $4,700, so this new model will likely put a serious dent in your savings account.     "With the Hydro Overclocking System, ROG GX800's Intel® K-SKU CPU can be overclocked to 4.2GHz so you get mind-blowing levels of performance.

(MONICA ALMEIDA/NYT) As a former member of the Microsoft board, Maria Klawe knows the deep challenge tech companies face in diversifying their workforce. As president of Harvey Mudd College, she’s helped the science and engineering school attract an enrollment that’s majority women. Share story By Matt Day Seattle Times technology reporter The typical computer-science graduating class at an American university is less than 20 percent female. At Harvey Mudd College, in Claremont, Calif., women make up 54 percent of the class of 2016. The experience of the private, 829-student school may not provide a complete road map for the rest of academia, but Maria Klawe, Harvey Mudd’s president for the past 10 years, says it carries lessons for other organizations. Maria Klawe Age: 65 Birthplace: Toronto Education: University of Alberta (B.S., Ph.D, mathematics), University of Toronto (graduate studies, computer science) Experience: Researcher, IBM; professor and department head, University of British Columbia; dean of engineering, Princeton; president, Harvey Mudd College Board service: Microsoft (former), Broadcom, Math for America, Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology (former) Klawe, 65, is no stranger to the Northwest. She taught for 14 years at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and sat for seven years on Microsoft’s board, stepping down last year.

Here's why that's a good thingUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. It’s in that role that she shares a trivia-question link to Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella. At the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in 2014, Klawe had an onstage conversation with Nadella in which the CEO made a widely derided commentthat women need not ask for raises, but could trust the system would reward them fairly in time. Nadella afterward quickly said his answer was incorrect, and Klawe thinks Nadella showed leadership in owning the mistake and taking new steps to encourage diversity among Microsoft’s ranks. The results have been mixed so far, with the company disclosing last week that cuts to ex-Nokia units led to a second consecutive annual decline in the proportion of women Microsoft employs. “I really like Satya a lot,” Klawe said in an interview. “He brings a lot of humility to what he does. He doesn’t need to win arguments, he’s eager to listen, eager to ask questions.” An edited version of an interview with Klawe follows: Q: What has worked in promoting diverse classes at Harvey Mudd? A: One of the things we learned about recruiting is you really need to understand your population, and, once they get here, you need to create an environment that is supportive for them. I know just from my own personal experience that people who are a member of an underrepresented group (are) less willing to ask for help, because you don’t want to reinforce somebody’s impression that women aren’t as good at math or whatever. We have to be much more focused on getting all of our students to think about getting help. Q: Can academia’s progress be replicated in corporate world? A: I gave a talk to a group of chief human-resources officers about what we had done at Mudd, and how I thought it would translate to companies that wanted to improve gender diversity in their tech workforce. Ellyn Shook, chief of human resources of Accenture, came up afterward and said, “You’re giving me some really good ideas. We’re hiring 17,000 software engineers a year, and we’re coming in at 30 percent [female], and I think we could do better.” I saw her four months later, she said, “We’re coming in at 42 percent. And all I did was change the way the job descriptions were written, change the interview process, and we recruited at women’s colleges as well as coed ones.” It didn’t cost her more money. Do I think it can be done? Absolutely. Do I think it’s easy? No. Not because it’s expensive, it’s because it requires you to question your culture and be able to make some shifts. Q: How do you evaluate Microsoft’s work on that front? A: It’s interesting to me, because the two companies that have hired the largest number of our students in the last five years are Microsoft and Google. I would say for the most part, our grads who are working at those companies are very happy. My sense of what happens at Microsoft is that, for many women who are hired, they’re in very supportive environments, and they’re happy for maybe their first 10 years, 15 years. Move up to the higher management levels? It tends to be a more adversarial, competitive culture, and that’s less good for them. Q: That dynamic seems to have played out. Microsoft’s senior leaders are primarily white men. What’s their responsibility? A: Diversity should not be a woman’s task. It should be everyone’s task. If you really want to have a diverse, inclusive environment, it’s got to be something that your white males care about just as much as other people. The sooner that we get away from feeling that every woman has to be passionate about diversity, that’s just as crazy as saying that every single person has to be the champion of their own background. Everyone should be champions for diverse perspectives, broadly speaking. Q: Intel made headlines by setting a public target for the diversity of its workforce. What do you think about such targets? A: I was sort of skeptical until I met a number of people leading [Intel’s] diversity efforts. And then when they reported that they’d come in 40 percent [women and underrepresented minorities], I said wow, that’s awesome. They were just told to make it happen, and to try to figure out how to make it happen. There are pluses and minuses to setting a number. The minuses are sometimes, when you do that, your employees will interpret that you’d just hire anyone to get that number. You didn’t use the usual standards. And that’s bad. Q: There’s been a lot of media focus of the tech industry’s diversity struggles. Is something new happening here or are people just paying more attention? A: I think we are at an inflection point. My cynical self says it’s partly because there’s a great demand for software engineers, and so there’s a realization that if we could get more women and people of color to be successful in these areas, we’d address that shortage. But I do think there’s just more of a discussion about it. And I feel really good about that. Information in this article, originally published November 21, 2016, was corrected November 21, 2016. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the percentage of female software engineeres hired recently by Accenture. Matt Day: 206-464-2420 or mday@seattletimes.com.

Industrial 4.0 changes the manufacturing industry, but also changes the industrial automation product design concept. With a variety of actuation / drive devices, controllers and sensing units become more intelligent, and even in the field to automatically determine the situation, the traditional industrial control systems play a role in the industrial single board computer in addition to the System to find a new location, the product design concept began to change. Such as industrial computers will become more energy efficient, more compact, and easier to mount or integrate with other devices. Under the influence of the industrial wave of 4.0, it is foreseeable that every kind of equipment in the future production line will have some kind of data acquisition or induction of the surrounding environment, and thus derived from the autonomy to judge the situation, to respond to a variety of Intelligent industrial equipment. In the distributed intelligent architecture trends established, the existing industrial single board computer equipment will therefore face the transition pressure. For example, in order to command the entire industrial automation system in the past, industrial computers must have a strong computing performance, it must make a compromise on the size of the device. However, as industrial devices become smarter and know how to handle a variety of conditions, industrial PCs, if they continue to pursue computing power, are likely to face the dilemma of heroic uselessness. To some of the industrial computer will face the pressure of transformation, must be more light and thin, more power-saving direction, rather than the blind pursuit of high performance. There is a possibility that the industrial computer will be relegated to the second line, the information transmitted to the background IT system, the intermediary station, it may be in different devices, systems play the role of arbitration and coordination. For this type of application scenario, industrial PCs must have flexible and extensive I / O support capability to interface with a variety of systems, preferably in a small footprint, easily mountable on a variety of devices, Stacking to support different applications. For example, Advantech released a new single-board computer with a palm-sized interface that supports USB, Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces, and can be stacked to support more I / O, or Hanging in the back of the display to achieve digital signage applications. The design concept, this product is actually somewhat similar to the Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi), its application space is quite broad, but because of its CPU with Intel (Intel) Atom, it can support Linux and Windows operating systems, and various Commercial and industrial applications have excellent compatibility. , This miniaturized industrial computer, will be the destructive innovation of industrial computer industry. Industrial automation systems in the terminal device more and more intelligent case, the industrial computer must follow the adaptation system changes.

MSI’s VR One backpack PCs rely on the company’s expertise in mobile computing and high-end notebooks. The VR One systems are based on the Intel Core i7-6820HK (4C/8T, 2.7/3.6 GHz, 8 MB LLC, 45 W) processor with an unlocked multiplier as well as NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB (VR One 6RD) or GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB (VR One 6RE) GPUs. The key components of the backpack are cooled down using an MSI proprietary cooling system featuring nine heatpipes and two blowers that ensure that the CPU and GPU never overheat even if overclocked (the HM170 chipset supports CPU overclocking). In fact, MSI even supplies its special Shift application that allows the user to boost both the compute and the cooling performance with just a few clicks. The system comes equipped with a 256 or a 512 GB M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4/NVMe SSD with up to 2.2 GB/s read performance and have another M.2/SATA slot for an additional drive to install more gaming titles. No spinning HDD is equipped by default for obvious reasons.

The VR One features all the ports needed to connect a VR headset like the HTC Vive with the ports right on top. To simplify connection of the Vive, MSI even supplies a special 3-in-1 cable with HDMI, USB 3.0 and power wires. Moreover, the system packs the Rivet Networks Killer 1535 Wi-Fi 802.11 ac + Bluetooth controller as well as Intel’s Alpine Ridge controller to enable one USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 port. The whole design of VR One’s motherboard resembles the design of MSI's gaming laptops, which helps to make the PC relatively thin (54 mm) and relatively light (3.6 kilograms). Meanwhile, two hot-swappable batteries enable MSI’s VR One to work completely autonomously for about 1.5 hours each. In fact, the whole outside design of the MSI VR One is optimized primarily for backpack, not desktop operation (unlike ZOTAC’s VR Go). While the VR One can be put on a desk, it will have to lie down, making its ports less accessible. So, the VR One is a system made primarily for virtual reality gaming, not for general-purpose computing. Right now MSI offers the VR One 6RD with the GeForce GTX 1060 and a 256 GB SSD for $1999 in the U.S. The more advanced VR One 6RE with the GeForce GTX 1070 and a 512 GB SSD will be available a little later for $2299.

Reply JeffFlanagan - Monday, November 21, 2016 - link These are only useful for VR Arcades. For home use, a wireless adapter for the Vive is now available in China, and will be available world-wide. Reply RaichuPls - Monday, November 21, 2016 - link Wireless adapters introduce latency, and you still need a way to power the Vive... Reply jkostans - Monday, November 21, 2016 - link There is a battery built in (2-5 hours), 2ms of latency. No measurements yet to confirm however. Reply inighthawki - Monday, November 21, 2016 - link Agreed on latency, but powering such a device is hardly an issue. The battery pack needed to power it for even just a few hours would be pretty compact and could likely attach to the device with ease. It would be no more convenient than whatever wireless dongle you'd be attaching in the first place. Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, November 21, 2016 - link It seems like a laptop with its screen removed and a couple of padded shoulder straps. Given there's less hardware than a comparable laptop, I'm guessing the price premium is due to MSI's expectation that they're not going to sell large numbers of these things. Reply negusp - Monday, November 21, 2016 - link They should manufacture pads and straps that you can mount on your laptop (maybe throw in a fan or two) for less than $100 and hold down the screen. So much more worth than this contraption. Newer gaming laptops have impressive battery packs too. Reply BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, November 22, 2016 - link Basically, a cooling fan pad that had a set of adjustable clamps would do that kind of job pretty well. I expect it'd be less expensive and the arrangement would be more flexible since it'd be a simple matter to remove the laptop and put it to use in a more conventional manner. Dedicated systems like these, aside from offering hot swap batteries, wouldn't have much of an advantage that would justify their costs if such things existed. Reply AnimalStyleFries - Wednesday, November 30, 2016 - link laptop batteries aren't made to run at the full power as it would being plugged into the outlet Reply Morawka - Monday, November 21, 2016 - link i'd be suprised if they sold any at all to consumers. a few arcades might take 2-3 each. hardly enough to pay for the expensive tooling those plastic injections machines use.

(MONICA ALMEIDA/NYT) As a former member of the Microsoft board, Maria Klawe knows the deep challenge tech companies face in diversifying their workforce. As president of Harvey Mudd College, she’s helped the science and engineering school attract an enrollment that’s majority women. Share story By Matt Day Seattle Times technology reporter The typical computer-science graduating class at an American university is less than 20 percent female. At Harvey Mudd College, in Claremont, Calif., women make up 54 percent of the class of 2016. The experience of the private, 829-student school may not provide a complete road map for the rest of academia, but Maria Klawe, Harvey Mudd’s president for the past 10 years, says it carries lessons for other organizations. Maria Klawe Age: 65 Birthplace: Toronto Education: University of Alberta (B.S., Ph.D, mathematics), University of Toronto (graduate studies, computer science) Experience: Researcher, IBM; professor and department head, University of British Columbia; dean of engineering, Princeton; president, Harvey Mudd College Board service: Microsoft (former), Broadcom, Math for America, Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology (former) Klawe, 65, is no stranger to the Northwest. She taught for 14 years at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and sat for seven years on Microsoft’s board, stepping down last year.

Here's why that's a good thingUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. It’s in that role that she shares a trivia-question link to Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella. At the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in 2014, Klawe had an onstage conversation with Nadella in which the CEO made a widely derided commentthat women need not ask for raises, but could trust the system would reward them fairly in time. Nadella afterward quickly said his answer was incorrect, and Klawe thinks Nadella showed leadership in owning the mistake and taking new steps to encourage diversity among Microsoft’s ranks. The results have been mixed so far, with the company disclosing last week that cuts to ex-Nokia units led to a second consecutive annual decline in the proportion of women Microsoft employs. “I really like Satya a lot,” Klawe said in an interview. “He brings a lot of humility to what he does. He doesn’t need to win arguments, he’s eager to listen, eager to ask questions.” An edited version of an interview with Klawe follows: Q: What has worked in promoting diverse classes at Harvey Mudd? A: One of the things we learned about recruiting is you really need to understand your population, and, once they get here, you need to create an environment that is supportive for them. I know just from my own personal experience that people who are a member of an underrepresented group (are) less willing to ask for help, because you don’t want to reinforce somebody’s impression that women aren’t as good at math or whatever. We have to be much more focused on getting all of our students to think about getting help. Q: Can academia’s progress be replicated in corporate world? A: I gave a talk to a group of chief human-resources officers about what we had done at Mudd, and how I thought it would translate to companies that wanted to improve gender diversity in their tech workforce. Ellyn Shook, chief of human resources of Accenture, came up afterward and said, “You’re giving me some really good ideas. We’re hiring 17,000 software engineers a year, and we’re coming in at 30 percent [female], and I think we could do better.” I saw her four months later, she said, “We’re coming in at 42 percent. And all I did was change the way the job descriptions were written, change the interview process, and we recruited at women’s colleges as well as coed ones.” It didn’t cost her more money. Do I think it can be done? Absolutely. Do I think it’s easy? No. Not because it’s expensive, it’s because it requires you to question your culture and be able to make some shifts. Q: How do you evaluate Microsoft’s work on that front? A: It’s interesting to me, because the two companies that have hired the largest number of our students in the last five years are Microsoft and Google. I would say for the most part, our grads who are working at those companies are very happy. My sense of what happens at Microsoft is that, for many women who are hired, they’re in very supportive environments, and they’re happy for maybe their first 10 years, 15 years. Move up to the higher management levels? It tends to be a more adversarial, competitive culture, and that’s less good for them. Q: That dynamic seems to have played out. Microsoft’s senior leaders are primarily white men. What’s their responsibility? A: Diversity should not be a woman’s task. It should be everyone’s task. If you really want to have a diverse, inclusive environment, it’s got to be something that your white males care about just as much as other people. The sooner that we get away from feeling that every woman has to be passionate about diversity, that’s just as crazy as saying that every single person has to be the champion of their own background. Everyone should be champions for diverse perspectives, broadly speaking. Q: Intel made headlines by setting a public target for the diversity of its workforce. What do you think about such targets? A: I was sort of skeptical until I met a number of people leading [Intel’s] diversity efforts. And then when they reported that they’d come in 40 percent [women and underrepresented minorities], I said wow, that’s awesome. They were just told to make it happen, and to try to figure out how to make it happen. There are pluses and minuses to setting a number. The minuses are sometimes, when you do that, your employees will interpret that you’d just hire anyone to get that number. You didn’t use the usual standards. And that’s bad. Q: There’s been a lot of media focus of the tech industry’s diversity struggles. Is something new happening here or are people just paying more attention? A: I think we are at an inflection point. My cynical self says it’s partly because there’s a great demand for software engineers, and so there’s a realization that if we could get more women and people of color to be successful in these areas, we’d address that shortage. But I do think there’s just more of a discussion about it. And I feel really good about that. Information in this article, originally published November 21, 2016, was corrected November 21, 2016. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the percentage of female software engineeres hired recently by Accenture. Matt Day: 206-464-2420 or mday@seattletimes.com.

(Supplied photo) The public cloud will offer a portfolio of services to address the increasing demand for affordable and secure cloud computing Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, launched its new data centre in Dubai that will be operated by Yvolv, a joint venture between Alibaba Cloud and Meraas Holdings. The first full-fledged public cloud in the region, which is hosted at a local data centre, will offer a portfolio of services to address the increasing demand for affordable and secure cloud computing in the Middle East. The launch further consolidates the trade relations between UAE and China. The UAE is home to more than 300,000 Chinese nationals working and living in the emirates, while over 4,200 Chinese companies, 356 trade agencies and more than 2,500 Chinese trade labels are registered with the UAE Ministry of Economy. "We are excited that our global footprint has now expanded to the Middle East which is also a major area covered by China's 'One Belt, One Road' initiative. With the Dubai data centre, our global cloud network will be able to meet enterprises which are going global," said Simon Hu, president of Alibaba Cloud. "As a global leader in cloud computing and big data, we recognise the shift in the region's demand from clunky IT equipment and servers to streamlined cloud computing solutions," said Sicheng Yu, vice-president, Alibaba Group and general manager of Alibaba Cloud Global. By enabling the digital transformation of businesses, Yvolv will complement Alibaba Cloud's offering to serve customers as they migrate their day-to-day IT operations to the cloud. Industry reactions Yasser Zeineldin, CEO of eHosting DataFort, said: "Alibaba's entry in the UAE is to expand its global foot print but currently there are already 10 to 12 commercial players who are more active in the private than in the public cloud realm. With public uptake very limited, there is huge potential on the private side. There is a preference for community as well as private cloud, which are more opted for by enterprises and SMEs." Alibaba Cloud's portfolio at the new data centre will include IaaS (infrastructure as a service) cloud services, including elastic computing, storage and databases which cater to all types of customers. Jereon Schlosser, managing director, Equinix Mena, said: "Alibaba's UAE foray makes it obvious that the UAE is geared up to match rising demand in the region as the data centre market is only starting to grow. There is room for everyone." Some of the existing regional and global customers of Alibaba Cloud are OneMT, MenaMobile, VSun, Dahua and JollyChic. Intel, who has collaborated with Alibaba Group globally in the areas of cloud, big data and artificial intelligence, has joined the event to highlight how cloud usage is driving transformative change across all industries. "As a long-term strategic partner of Alibaba Cloud, we are proud to see Alibaba Cloud's footprint expand into the MEA region. We are excited to have the latest Intel cloud technology running in the Dubai data centre to provide superior performance to users in the region," said Kit Ho Chee, vice-president and general manager of cloud service provider sales at Intel. Alibaba Cloud recently signed a number of partnerships in the region. The most recent deals are with Detecon, a Saudi data centre services provider, and Chinese Business Hub, which is designed to facilitate the move of Chinese SMEs to the UAE. "Alibaba Cloud has established a strong reputation as a leading cloud services provider in China. At Yvolv, we are certain that this success can be replicated in the region. We remain steadfast in our commitment to articulating the objectives outlined in the Dubai Smart City Initiative and the UAE Vision 2021, and the opening of this data centre is a step in the right direction," said Fahad Al Hajeri, CEO of Yvolv. - sandhya@khaleejtimes.com Sandhya D'Mello Journalist.

Fedora 25 Turned Out Great, Definitely My Most Favorite Fedora Release Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 21 November 2016. Page 1 of 1. 29 Comments While I generally wait until a few days/weeks past a Fedora release to upgrade, this past weekend I already switched my main production system over to Fedora 25 ahead of tomorrow's release. That's the first time I've been so ambitious with a Fedora release, but in testing it over the past few weeks (and months) on a multitude of test systems, the quality has been excellent and by far is most favorite release going back to the Fedora Core days -- and there's Wayland by default too, as just the icing on the cake. Earlier this month I wrote how Fedora 25 is quite possibly by most favorite release yet and now after carrying out tests of the last release candidate and already switching my most main production system over to it, I can say with confidence it does feel to me as the best release yet. All of the improvements found in upstream GNOME 3.22 offer a very polished Linux desktop experience, it's shipping with the Linux 4.8 kernel, and all-around is just a very quality release. As far as the Wayland experience goes, it's rock-solid with all of my Intel and Radeon tests so far. Even on my main production system I had to double-check to verify I was actually using the GNOME-based Wayland session as it's so close to parity with the X.Org Server support that it just feels like a drop-in replacement. I had allotted most of the weekend for the clean install and migration on my main production system to Fedora 25, but in reality, it was just an hour or two and no headaches encountered. The install went well, installed the few additional packages needed, and I was off to the races. Super happy with how Fedora 25 turned out. About my only complaint is that Mesa 13.0 didn't make the cut for the day-one release but will come down later as a stable release update (and for old times’ sake and not having other technical complaints about F25: bring back the codenames! ;)). Fedora 25 will be formally announced tomorrow, 22 November.

Photo by Windover Way Photography / Shutterstock 21 Nov 2016 at 10:02, Wireless Watch Comment As in every sector of US life, the telecoms industry is trying to work out what the shock election of maverick candidate Donald Trump to the presidency will mean for its operators and suppliers. There are few clues, of course – telecoms, even broadband, were not major campaign issues; Trump obviously has no track record of voting on these matters. But some of his stated intentions, if he follows through in policy, would deeply affect this industry, including trade barriers with China or Mexico. And like any new president, he will have a direct impact when a new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is appointed. One issue on which Trump did speak out during the election campaign was the proposed AT&T/Time Warner merger, which he said he would derail. And he made some vague comments about net neutrality, such as: "Obama’s attack on the internet is another top down power grab.” These certainly did not amount to policy, but telcos may take them as a sign of hope that he will favor a change to the recently agreed rules, to make their lives easier. Although the FCC’s amended neutrality code was upheld by a Washington DC appeals court, the telecoms industry is taking their appeal to the Supreme Court (which has not yet agreed to hear it). If Trump appoints a conservative judge to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy, and a pro-telco FCC chief, the rules could be overturned. Once a new Republican president takes office in January, current FCC chairman Tom Wheeler is likely to step down (although his term doesn’t actually expire until 2018). His successor will be chosen by Trump and the new FCC would include three Republican and two Democrat Commissioners. Already, the president-elect has pulled back on his famous pledge to “drain the swamp” of Washington lobbyists, special advisers and career politicians, by appointing Jeffrey Eisenach – a long time lobbyist for Verizon and advocate of light-touch regulation – as an aide, advising on telecoms policy including the FCC and neutrality. While these issues will have a deep effect on the telecoms industry at home, Trump’s stance on trade barriers, especially with China, would affect many US vendors on a global basis if it turns into policy. He suggested, during the campaign, that he would impose 45 per cent tariffs on imports from China, an idea which provoked this response from Chinese news-paper The Global Times: “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then … US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted.” And 35 per cent tariffs were also suggested for other trading partners such as the European Union, Korea, India and Japan. If even a more diluted version of the proposed trade wars transpired, it would hit companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Intel and Cisco, all in the top 20 list of US exporters. Electronic equipment represented $163.1bn of outgoing international trade last year, up 36.9 per cent since 2011. Many of these more outlandish campaigning soundbites will, of course, not turn into real actions, but the general uncertainty before a transition of power is undoubtedly greater than usual this time, because of Trump’s outspoken style and because he is, politically, an unknown quantity. That will affect telecoms like other sectors. Aneil Rakity, managing director at consultancy Ovum, wrote in a column: “In the short term, there will be a general slowdown of major decisions in capital and investment by US and international firms as they wait to get a better understanding of the new administration's trade, tax, immigration, and foreign policy … The uncertainty will last for at least the next six months, and it won't be until mid-2017 that Trump starts to share more about these topics and proposed changes to policy.” And CM Research wrote: “The biggest benefit to the US tech sector will come from lower tax rates. The biggest risk is trade wars that result in higher tariffs and retaliation against the US tech companies. The wild card is regulation: net neutrality rules – if relaxed – could shift the balance of power from Internet companies to telcos.” Copyright © 2016, Wireless Watch Wireless Watch is published by Rethink Research, a London-based IT publishing and consulting firm.

A team, and its leader, will also benefit if it chooses the right tools. These will help manage the workflow, encourage collaboration, and take care of the business side of things.  A a result, everyone will to focus on design. How To Hire & Build An Awesome Team How To Hire & Build An Awesome Team At some point in your design career, you'll likely be placed in charge of other people. These might…Read more Even if the best tools are on hand, such as those listed here, a team leader needs to pay attention to the following overlooked guidelines.  That’s if everyone is to keep focused on working toward a common objective: Team member roles need to be constantly clarified to prevent task oversight or duplication of efforts. Team member responsibilities must be stated clearly and explicitly. Responsibilities assigned to small groups, or the entire team, have a tendency not to be carried out. Identify groups or individuals who are responsible for making specific decisions. If groups are involved, the method by which decisions are to be reached also needs to be made clear. Continually review team and project goals. If this is not done, individuals and/or teams tend to lose focus. Use specific tools to carry out specific functions. Productivity suffers when the wrong tool is being used for a specific task. The following tools offer solutions for a range of project management, workflow support, idea sharing, and team collaboration issues. Wake If sharing your work becomes a source of anxiety and disruption, Wake has the answer. This design collaboration platform allows you to easily share screenshots, sketches, or other important work without having to exit from your Sketch, Photoshop, or Illustrator design sessions.

The iPhone app also allows you to keep informed of feedback and communicate with others while on the go. The ability to share your work and thoughts without having to worry about workflow interruptions makes the entire design process more transparent, which allows your team to work more closely. Sign up for a 30-day free trial, and find out how you can simplify sharing and create better design work as a team.

Gen Michael Flynn, centre, arrives at Trump Tower last week. Photo / AP US president-elect Donald Trump's recently-appointed national security adviser was investigated for inappropriately sharing highly-classified intelligence with Australian forces. Retired US three-star lieutenant general Michael Flynn, a maverick who spent more than 33 years in US Army intelligence, worked alongside Australian forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. An outspoken believer in assisting allies on the battleground despite red tape preventing the flow of information, Lt Gen Flynn said the sharing of intelligence with Australian and British forces that left him in hot water was done "with the right permissions". "I'm proud of that one," Lt Gen Flynn told the Washington Post. "Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies, please." His unconventional style and strong resume - he was tapped by US commander in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal to be his top intelligence officer and promoted by President Barack Obama as Defence Intelligence Agency director - was obviously attractive to fellow maverick Trump.

Price $2299 AUD > Pricing info Specs 13.3-inch IPS 1080p panel • 8GB DDR4 memory • 256GB PCIe SSD • Intel Core i5-6200U CPU Tweet Email this Print this Feedback As Ultra as Ultrabooks get. The race is on to deliver the best Ultrabook in the world, and it’s a tight battle. Dell’s XPS 13, Razer’s Blade, the Asus Zenbook and Apple’s Macbook are all brilliant products in their own right, and now HP has released its entry into the premium Ultrabook market, the Spectre. This 13.3-inch laptop might be a little larger overall than some of the Ultrabooks, but when it comes to width it’s a word-beater. HP claims this is the world’s thinnest Ultrabook, at just 10.4mm in width. It does indeed feel incredibly slim when in use, yet the backlit keys still have a nice level of travel, rather than the shallow depression required by other Ultrabooks. It’s quite the looker, with a beautiful copper finish to the hinge. Tucked within this are special pistons that keep the screen nice and rigid no matter the position. It’s so thin that there’s no room for standard USB Type-A connections, so instead includes three USB 3.0 Type C connections. HP is nice enough to include a single Type-C to Type-A adaptor for your legacy devices, but you’ll probably want to pick up a Type-C to Type-A hub to attach more than one Type-A device without having to buy multiple adaptors.  The chassis is built from CNC machined aluminium, giving it an extremely high quality feel while retaining a very low weight of just 1.11kg. The base is built from carbon fibre for extra rigidity, while the edge-to-edge 13.3-inch IPS display uses Corning Gorilla glass to ensure it won’t crack under pressure. It’s an IPS display, meaning it’s got a nice wide 178 degree field of view, but doesn’t seem to have quite the same level of punch as the likes of Razer’s new Ultrabook. It’s a full 1080p screen though, so pixel structure is impossible to notice. The gloss finish looks nice, but will prove to be an issue in brightly lit areas – we wish more manufacturers would focus on screen readability than aesthetics. The glass touchpad does an able job, if not perfect, though loses a little accuracy when approaching the edges of the pad, and there aren’t any separate left/right buttons. Twin Bang & Olufsen speakers are included, but given how thin this laptop is, we can forgive the very average sound quality that they pump out – they’re fine for presentations, but aren’t the kind of speakers you’ll want to listen to music through all day.  Our sample came packing Intel’s Core i5-6200U CPU, a dual core, Hyper Threaded chip that has a max Turbo Frequency of 2.8GHz. An i7 version is available if you need even more oomph. 8GB of DDR4 RAM feeds high speed data to the CPU, while a 256GB PCIe SSD delivers storage for most of your data. This hardware combination resulted in a PCMark 8 Home Accelerated speed of 3194, which is rather impressive given it’s only a twin core machine. This low powered CPU helped the Spectre reach a respectable 199 minutes in the demanding PCMark 8 Home Accelerated battery benchmark, which should equate to about eight or nine hours of real world performance. That’s a rather hefty CPU for such a thin chassis, and it brings a little problem along with it – fan noise. HP explained that this laptop uses “Hyperbaric” cooling, that draws air over the CPU, instead of just blowing out hot air. However, after a few minutes of use the fan noise was very noticeable, measuring 46dB on our sound meter. There’s no denying that this is one sexy piece of hardware, but the price puts it slightly out of whack when compared to other premium Ultrabooks. For example, Razer’s new Blade is just $1849 for the version with a quad-core CPU with higher Turbo speed, along with a better screen; it’s just a little bit fatter than the Spectre.  The question then comes down to aesthetics. Are you willing to pay $500 more to shave a couple of millimetres off the depth of your laptop, while also making a few sacrifices in the hardware department? We’d be inclined to say no, but here in the PCTA labs we’re slightly more pragmatic than attention-seeking.  Related Reviews Review: MSI GT73VR 6RF Titan Pro Review: Metabox Prime-X P870DM2-G Review: Asus ZenBook Flip UX360CA Review: Lenovo Ideapad Miix 700 Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

The two faces of the LA Auto Show by Tamara Warren@tamaratam Nov 20, 2016, 3:03pm EST share tweet Linkedin Photo by David McNew/Getty Images When people say Americans won’t give up their cars, Los Angeles is a case study on automotive saturation. Car fever took off during the post-World War II era economic boom, and the sprawling city’s far reaching tentacle of freeways make the automobile essential. Culver City speed shops and custom car culture elevated the LA’s romance with the automobile to another level. But a new reality has set in, and so far, no one is exactly sure how to stop it. Los Angeles may be a car town, but there’s nothing more brutal than an LA traffic jam and its massive environmental footprint. The state of California has embraced some of the cleanest emissions standards in the country, and is most identifiable as the home of the new electric car business, thanks to Tesla and Google. But when it comes to automotive innovation, LA proper has some catching up to do with what’s happening north in Silicon Valley. The biggest issue at the LA Auto Show seems to be one of timing This central theme of recalibration resonates at the LA Auto Show this year, which runs through November 27th. The show has gradually evolved as the place to introduce carefree convertibles into an event to think ahead about mobility, an idea that’s much bigger than the state of California. Last year, organizers introduced a Connected Car Expo prior to the show. This year it merged automation and autos into a full week of preview days in an effort to keep up with both the upcoming Consumer Electronic Show and the North American International Auto Show in January. There are plenty of cars to see — including 50 vehicles debuts. Still, as the public visits the show this week, the biggest issue at the LA Auto Show seems to be one of timing. During the previews, conversations inevitably touched on the uncertain policies of a President-elect Trump administration, and how it could alter plans to introduce cars with cleaner emissions. Tamara Warren But the show has to go on. Automobility was staged under tents in front of the convention center in the downtown district. Picture a baby Consumer Electronics Show, as startups, software companies, and panelists turned their eyes toward the future of the car. Intel declared its intention to launch a $250 million autonomous car program. Argus Cyber Security highlighted its software to prevent hacking. Automakers joined in as well. BMW said it would expand its car-sharing service ReachNow to Brooklyn and Ford CEO Mark Fields spoke on Ford’s automated future. Hyundai announced its partnership with Amazon Echo. A series of panels covered big-picture topics. Inventor Dezsö Molnár described the the flying car race he is planning for next year in Nevada. Some of California’s newest luxury electric car companies had a presence. The NextEV CEO broke down her vision that cars should tackle both software and hardware and Lucid Motors showed off its electric sports car prototype. Several of the traditional car companies unveiled cars with more progressive electrified developments. Jaguar unveiled its fierce electric crossover offering — the iType — and Hyundai showed the Ionic, its self-driving car concept. Volkswagen unveiled a refreshed e-Gulf, as it attempts to mend its image after its shameful diesel scandal. Chrysler showed the plug-in hybrid Pacifica, a strong play for eco-friendly families. The ballooning crossover category added several new or modified entries. Ford showed its EcoSport at a preview (promoted by DJ Khaled on the decks.) Fiat Chrysler has expanded its menu in its svelte Alfa Romeo lineup in the chic Stelvio. Mazda showed a new version of the practical CX-5 crossover. But LA is still a town that caters to celebrity culture, and places a high value on status and speed. Mercedes-Benz revealed the stately Maybach convertible at a preview event. Aston Martin showed a more vivacious Vanquish S. Racing was on full view at the Porsche stand, where the 911RS debuted and Mazda racecar drivers posed with the RT24-P racecar. Honda revealed a more peppy Civic Si. The local dealer Galpin showed several choice customs and featured the Spyker C8 Preliator, first unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show. Despite all the hype and enthusiasm show organizers pumped up, the mood was anxious and subdued throughout the week of previews. There was never a moment that was truly exciting, or a car that totally dominated the conversation. The trepidation had more to do with the surrounding world than the bubble of cars on display in a convention center. In a car town, a visit to the Los Angeles Auto Show is an opportunity to see an industry caught in a crossroads.

(Source: AFP) US president-elect Donald Trump's recently-appointed national security adviser was investigated for inappropriately sharing highly-classified intelligence with Australian forces. Retired US three-star lieutenant general Michael Flynn, a maverick who spent more than 33 years in US Army intelligence, worked alongside Australian forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. An outspoken believer in assisting allies on the battleground despite red tape preventing the flow of information, Lt Gen Flynn said the sharing of intelligence with Australian and British forces that left him in hot water was done "with the right permissions". "I'm proud of that one," Lt Gen Flynn told The Washington Post. "Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies, please." Michael Flynn believes the US should be forthcoming with its military intelligence when it comes to dealing with allies. (Source: AFP) His unconventional style and strong resume - he was tapped by US commander in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal to be his top intelligence officer and promoted by President Barack Obama as Defence Intelligence Agency director - was obviously attractive to fellow maverick Mr Trump. Lt Gen Flynn was pushed out of the DIA job after two years in the role and has labelled Mr Obama a "liar". His views on the Middle-East are aligned with Mr Trump and both men are prolific users of Twitter. During the recent presidential campaign Lt Gen Flynn, a registered Democrat, called Mr Trump's chief opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, "the enemy camp" and joined the call to "lock her up" in jail. Donald Trump recently appointed Michael Flynn at national security adviser. (Source: AFP) He also raised eyebrows when he sat alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a lavish party in Moscow last year. Offering insight into his more open, untraditional philosophy of sharing information, in 2010 he co-wrote the report Fixing Intel: A Blueprint for Making Intelligence Relevant in Afghanistan. It concluded the US intelligence community "must open their doors to anyone who is willing to exchange information, including Afghans and NGOs (non-governmental organisations) as well as the US military and its allies". Lt Gen Flynn has confidently defended the incident that involved passing sensitive information to Australia and Britain. "The investigation on me was for sharing intelligence with the Brits and Australians in combat, and I'm proud of that one," Lt Gen Flynn said. "That was substantiated because actually I did it. "But I did it with the right permissions when you dig into the investigation." Lt Gen Flynn said he met with Mr Trump mid-2015 and described the real estate billionaire as a "very serious guy", "good listener" and possessing similar views. "I found him to be in line with what I believed," he told the Washington Post. © AAP 2017 USA Politics TRENDING VIDEO Dogs accompany owner to emergency room Two dogs have shown true loyalty while accompanying their owner to an emergency room in Peru.

As one of the founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, in 1957, and later, as the co-founder of one of the first venture capital investment firms, Kleiner truly was one of the people who turned America’s prune capital, Santa Clara County, into Silicon Valley.  Eugene Kleiner was born in Vienna, Austria, on May 12, 1923. His father, Leon Kleiner, was a shoe manufacturer, and his mother, the former Anna Wallach, ran a retail shoe business. Eugene was the youngest of their three children.   Within days of the Anschluss, the German occupation of Austria in March 1938, Jewish children were told to stop coming to school. Soon after that, Leon had his factories expropriated by the new Nazi government. Finally, in November 1938, soldiers appeared at the Kleiner home, confiscated the family’s valuables and arrested Leon. Flight to Belgium After his release from jail, Leon, who had for some time been sending money out of the country for a time it might be needed, realized that that time had come. The Kleiners left for Belgium, beginning an exodus that ended three years later in New York, in May 1941. During a stay of more than a year in Brussels, the son Eugene studied tool-and-die making at a vocational school set up by the Jewish community there. This served him in good stead once he was in the U.S., where he took work making parts for airplane landing gears before enlisting himself in the army, where his German-language skills were to put use in guarding German POWs. Post-war, Eugene studied engineering at what is now the Polytechnic University of New York, where an astute dean admitted him, even though Kleiner had never finished high school. Later, armed with both bachelor’s and master’s degrees, Kleiner went to work for Western Electric, where he built telephone relay equipment. In 1947, he married Rose Wassertheil, a social worker who also was a refugee from the Holocaust.   When, in 1956, Kleiner was approached by William Shockley to join a small team he was organizing to mass-produce the semiconductors he had helped invent, he accepted with alacrity and moved the family to Palo Alto, California. Working for Shockley, though, was a disaster, and it didn’t matter that the boss was joint winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics that same year. (Decades later, the same Shockley became notorious for his racialized views on human intelligence, and his embrace of eugenics.) Within a year, Kleiner and Shockley’s seven other initial engineering hires decided as a collective to leave his employ and set up their own shop. The historic marker at the Fairchild building at which the first commercially practical integrated circuit was invented.WikiCommons Enter the Space Race Fairchild Semiconductor, based on an initial investment of $1.5 million from entrepreneur Sherman Fairchild and another $3,500 scraped together by Kleiner and his colleagues, opened in October 1957, the same month that the USSR launched its Sputnik satellite, and the space race started in earnest. Overnight, there was a market for transistors, and it was Kleiner who developed the protocols and built the equipment for producing them. Within a year, Fairchild Semiconductor was in the black, with clients like IBM and the Pentagon. After three years Sherman Fairchild exercised an option to buy the firm in full for $3 million. When Kleiner and his partners each inevitably went out on their own, they went on to found companies like Intel, National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices. As Kleiner came to realize that he loved setting up new companies in new fields, he moved into venture capital work. A 1972 breakfast meeting led to a partnership with Hewlett Packard veteran Tom Perkins, and within a decade, Kleiner Perkins (today Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers) had turned an initial pool of $8 million into holdings worth $400 million, and included part-ownership of companies like Genentech and Tandem. For the frugal Kleiner, it wasn’t about the money. He continued to scour newspaper ads to learn when local drugstores would be selling Crest toothpaste at a discount. Rather, he loved the challenge of starting new businesses, particularly in fields, such as biotech, where the entrepreneurs were doing work never before attempted. David B.
