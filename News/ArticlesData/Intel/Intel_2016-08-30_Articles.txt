The Yoga 910 is a continuation of Lenovo's high-end ultraportable line, packing a 7th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU into a 14.3mm slim body. Like the Yoga 900 that came before it, the Yoga 910 features Lenovo's signature watchband hinge that allows the 13.9-inch display to rotate a full 360-degrees, transforming the laptop into an oversized tablet. You'll find other high-end hardware in the Yoga 910. The display tops out at 4K, although there's also a 1080p option for those who'd prefer longer battery life (15.5 versus 10.5 hours). Buyers will get up to 16 GB of memory, up to 1 TB of PCIe SSD storage, a fingerprint reader, and two USB Type-C ports: one is USB 3.0, and the other USB 2.0 with charging support. The Yoga 910 will be available in October starting at $1,299. The Yoga Tab 3 Plus is Lenovo's inexpensive 10-inch Android tablet, featuring a 2560 x 1600 display and a unique stand that props up the tablet for media consumption. On the front of the IP52-rated splash-proof device are four "theater-caliber" JBL speakers, and internally there's a massive 9,300 mAh battery for up to 18 hours of use. Other hardware in this $299 tablet, which will go on sale in October, includes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 SoC, 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of storage with a microSD card slot, USB Type-C, LTE connectivity, and a 13-megapixel rear camera. The other tablet Lenovo has announced is the Miix 510, a 12.2-inch 1080p Windows 10 device that docks into an included keyboard. The Miix 510 is surprisingly powerful, packing up to a 6th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU, though we're not seeing Kaby Lake inside. There's up to 8 GB of memory available, along with up to 1TB of SSD storage, and the 39 Wh internal battery is rated for 7.5 hours of use. Also available in October, the Miix 510 will cost at least $599, which gets you both the tablet and the keyboard dock.

We wish everyone the best of holidays and a prosperous 2017! Intel's Kaby Lake Chip Promises Deeper Internet Immersion By David Jones Aug 31, 2016 11:30 AM PT Facing a shrinking market for personal computers and a stalled market for tablets, Intel on Tuesday unveiled its 7th-generation processors, code-named "Kaby Lake," which deliver more speed and power than its 6th-generation chipsets, while improving battery efficiency. Intel has positioned the new Kaby Lake chipsets as ideal for the immersive Internet. Their 14 nm+ technology delivers 12 percent increases in productivity and 19 percent faster Web performance, compared to year-ago processors. The new processors will allow customers to create their own premium 4K UHD video and 360-degree content, said Navin Shenoy, general manager of Intel's Client Computing Group, and they'll be able to share it at a rate 15 times faster than is possible with typical 5-year-old personal computers. Graphics capabilities will be three-times more powerful than on those older PCs, Shenoy said, and the new Thunderbolt 3 technology will enable a single connection for an external graphics dock and 4K UHD monitors. More than 100 different 2-in-1 mobile computing devices and laptops using the new chipsets are expected in September, he said. Desktops and enterprise PCs with the new processors are coming in early 2017. Intel and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on Tuesday announced that ULTRA will be available on computers powered by the new 7th generation processors in the first quarter 2017. ULTRA, SPHE's 4K movie streaming service, earlier this year launched on Sony 4K televisions. In connection with the availability of Kaby Lake chipsets on computing devices, SPHE will offer new features like 10-minute previews and 48-hour rentals. Baby Steps Kaby Lake is just an incremental improvement over Intel's earlier Skylake processors, according to Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research. The company often compares Kaby Lake's performance capabilities with those of 5-year-old PCs to rationalize the upgrade to the latest CPU, he told TechNewsWorld. "Intel may get a bump from Apple and other PC vendors that choose to skip Skylake if they choose to use [Kaby Lake]" said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. However, the introduction of the 7th Gen Intel Core processors "does not change the competitive landscape," he told TechNewsWorld, "especially in segments outside the PC where Intel still faces challenges from other incumbent solutions." Hardware vendors will be cautious about developing new devices with the Kaby Lake refresh, predicted Jitesh Ubrani, a senior research analyst for WW mobile device trackers at IDC. The Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 were among the first devices to launch with the Skylake processors, he noted. "At launch, those devices were plagued with firmware issues resulting from the Skylake processors," Ubrani told TechNewsWorld. "I would imagine the vendors would exercise a bit more caution this time around." Microsoft is collaborating with Intel on Windows Holographic, according to Michael Fortin, corporate vice president, Windows and Devices Group Core Quality, who touted the 7th generation Intel processors, the newest OEM devices and Windows 10 as producing the best user experiences. Same Game In terms of the impact on gaming, it's questionable how big a driver the new Intel processors will be. "We love to see advances in processor technology but do not think this is a big leap for gamers," said Ted Pollak, senior gaming analyst at Jon Peddie Research. Intel has claimed that the flagship Kaby Lake i7-7700K processor will speed up 4K video and video editing, compared to the Skylake i7-6700K. However, the 7700K actually has a slower nominal clock speed at @3.6ghz versus 4.00ghz, but the same boost frequency at 4.2ghz as the 6700K, Pollak pointed out. Games that respond to higher clock speeds tend to be heavy in artificial intelligence and physics, he noted, so simulation titles like ARMA 3 and Elite Dangerous, and open world titles with heavy physics, like Battlefield, may not see a big processing advantage. For mainstream titles and other AAA games, including e-sports, CPUs are becoming less important than GPUs for game quality. David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

But it was not without rivals for that title.     Transistors, the electronic amplifiers and switches found at the heart of everything from pocket radios to warehouse-size supercomputers, were invented in 1947. Early devices were of a type called bipolar transistors, which are still in use. By the 1960s, engineers had figured out how to combine multiple bipolar transistors into single integrated circuits. But because of the complex structure of these transistors, an integrated circuit could contain only a small number of them. So although a minicomputer built from bipolar integrated circuits was much smaller than earlier computers, it still required multiple boards with hundreds of chips. In 1960, a new type of transistor was demonstrated: the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistor. At first this technology wasn’t all that promising. These transistors were slower, less reliable, and more expensive than their bipolar counterparts. But by 1964, integrated circuits based on MOS transistors boasted higher densities and lower manufacturing costs than those of the bipolar competition. Integrated circuits continued to increase in complexity, as described by Moore’s Law, but now MOS technology took the lead. By the end of the 1960s, a single MOS integrated circuit could contain 100 or more logic gates, each containing multiple transistors, making the technology particularly attractive for building computers. These chips with their many components were given the label LSI, for large-scale integration. Engineers recognized that the increasing density of MOS transistors would eventually allow a complete computer processor to be put on a single chip. But because MOS transistors were slower than bipolar ones, a computer based on MOS chips made sense only when relatively low performance was required or when the apparatus had to be small and lightweight—such as for data terminals, calculators, or avionics. So those were the kinds of computing applications that ushered in the microprocessor revolution. Most engineers today are under the impression that the start of that revolution began in 1971 with Intel’s 4-bit 4004 and was immediately and logically followed by the company’s 8-bit 8008 chip. In fact, the story of the birth of the microprocessor is far richer and more surprising. In particular, some newly uncovered documents illuminate how a long-forgotten chip—Texas Instruments’ TMX 1795—beat the Intel 8008 to become the first 8-bit microprocessor, only to slip into obscurity. What opened the door for the first microprocessors, then, was the application of MOS integrated circuits to computing. The first computer to be fashioned out of MOS-LSI chips was something called the D200, created in 1967 by Autonetics, a division of North American Aviation, located in Anaheim, Calif. Photo: Paul Sakuma/AP Photos Three Proud Parents: Posing during induction ceremonies for the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1996, Federico Faggin, Marcian “Ted” Hoff Jr., and Stanley Mazor [from left] show off the pioneering microprocessor they created in the early 1970s, the Intel 4004. This compact, 24-bit general-purpose computer was designed for aviation and navigation. Its central processing unit was built from 24 MOS chips and benefitted from a design technique called four-phase logic, which used four separate clock signals, each with a different on-off pattern, or phase, to drive changes in the states of the transistors, allowing the circuitry to be substantially simplified. Weighing only a few kilograms, the computer was used for guidance on the Poseidon submarine-launched ballistic missile and for fuel management on the B-1 bomber. It was even considered for the space shuttle. The D200 was followed shortly by another avionics computer that contained three CPUs and used in total 28 chips: the Central Air Data Computer, built by Garrett AiResearch (now part of Honeywell). The computer, a flight-control system designed for the F-14 fighter, used the MP944 MOS-LSI chipset, which Garrett AiResearch developed between 1968 and 1970. The 20-bit computer processed information from sensors and generated outputs for instrumentation and aircraft control. Some Assembly Required This online simulator lets you explore the workings of a simple microprocessor The architecture of the F-14 computer was unusual. It had three functional units operating in parallel: one for multiplication, one for division, and one for special logic functions (which included clamping a value between upper and lower limits). Each functional unit was composed of several different kinds of MOS chips, such as a read-only memory (ROM) chip, which contained the data that determined how the unit would operate; a data-steering chip; various arithmetic chips; and a RAM chip for temporary storage. Because the F-14 computer was classified, few people ever knew about the MP944 chipset. But Autonetics widely publicized its D200, which then inspired an even more compact MOS-based computer: the System IV. That computer was the brainchild of Lee Boysel, who left Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968 to cofound Four-Phase Systems, naming his new company after Autonetics’ four-phase logic. The CPU of the 24-bit System IV was constructed from as few as nine MOS chips: three arithmetic-logic-unit (ALU) chips of a design dubbed the AL1 (which performed arithmetic operations like adding and subtracting, along with logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT), three ROM chips, and three random-logic chips. Everything’s Bigger in Texas Although Texas Instruments’ TMX 1795 and Intel’s 8008 had a similar number of transistors, the former required a much larger silicon die.  Indeed, the TMX 1795 was larger than the Intel 8008 and 4004 combined. Intel’s engineers believed that its large size made the TI chip impractical to produce in commercial quantities, but TI’s very successful TMS 0100 calculator chip, introduced at about the same time, had an even larger die. So the connection between die size and commercial viability must not have been straightforward. (The relative sizes of the dies are shown below.) TMX 1795 3,078 transistors 4004 2,300 transistors Images: Computer History Museum 8008 3,098 transistors Almost simultaneously, a Massachusetts-based startup called Viatron Computer Systems got into the game. Just a year after its launch in November 1967, the company announced its System 21, a 16-bit minicomputer with various accessories, all built from custom MOS chips. We can thank someone at Viatron for coining the word “microprocessor.” The company first used it in an October 1968 announcement of a product it called the 2101. But this microprocessor wasn’t a chip. In Viatron’s lexicon, the word referred to part of a smart terminal, one that came complete with keyboard and tape drives and connected to a separate minicomputer. Viatron’s “microprocessor” controlled the terminal and consisted of 18 custom MOS chips on three separate boards. Amid these goings-on at the end of the 1960s, the Japanese calculator maker Business Computer Corp. (better known as Busicom) contracted with Intel for custom chips for a multiple-chip calculator. The final product was simplified to a single-chip CPU, the now-famous Intel 4004, along with companion chips for storage and input/output (I/O). The 4-bit 4004 (meaning that it manipulated data words that were only 4 bits wide) is often considered the first microprocessor. The calculator containing the 4004 first came together at the start of 1971. By this time, it had plenty of competition. A semiconductor company called Mostek had produced the first calculator-on-a chip, the MK6010. And Pico Electronics and General Instrument also had their G250 calculator-on-a-chip working. Within six months, the Texas Instruments TMS 1802 calculator-on-a-chip was also operational, it being the first chip in TI’s hugely successful 0100 line. While these circuits worked fine as calculators, they couldn’t do anything else, whereas the 4004 operated by carrying out instructions stored in external ROM. Thus it could serve in a general-purpose computer. This was a fast-moving time for the electronic-calculator business, and after running into financial difficulties, Busicom gave up its exclusive rights to the 4004 chip. In November 1971 Intel began marketing it and its associated support chips as a stand-alone product intended for general computing applications. Within a few months, the 4004 was eclipsed by more powerful microprocessors, however, so it found few commercial applications. They included a couple of pinball machines, a word processor, and a system for tallying votes. Photo: History-computer.com CPU Flip-flops: Makers of the Datapoint 2200 terminal sought a single-chip CPU for it from both Intel and Texas Instruments. Neither TI nor Intel’s CPU chips saw use in the Datapoint 2200, but they led a wave of 8-bit microprocessors that powered the microcomputer revolution. In this sense, it was an electronic calculator that begot the first microprocessor, Intel’s 4-bit 4004. But the 8-bit microprocessors that quickly succeeded it had a very different genesis. That story starts in 1969 with the development of the Datapoint 2200 “programmable terminal,” by a company called Computer Terminal Corp. (CTC), based in San Antonio, Texas. The Datapoint 2200 was really a general-purpose computer, not just a terminal. Its 8-bit processor was initially built out of about 100 bipolar chips. Its designers were looking for ways to have the processor consume less power and generate less heat. So in early 1970, CTC arranged for Intel to build a single MOS chip to replace the Datapoint processor board, although it’s unclear whether the idea of using a single chip came from Intel or CTC. Photo: Computer History Museum Guy From TI: Gary Boone led the development of the TMX1795, along with other important digital chips. By June 1970, Intel had developed a functional specification for a chip based on the architecture of the Datapoint 2200 and then put the project on hold for six months. This is the design that would become the Intel 8008. So whether you consider the calculator-inspired 4004 or the terminal-inspired 8008 to be the first truly useful single-chip, general-purpose microprocessor, you’d have to credit its creation to Intel, right? Not really. You see, in 1970, when Intel began working on the 8008, it was a startup with about 100 employees. After learning of Intel’s processor project, Texas Instruments, or TI—a behemoth of a company, with 45,000 employees—asked CTC whether it, too, could build a processor for the Datapoint 2200. CTC gave engineers at TI the computer’s specifications and told them to go ahead. When they returned with a three-chip design, CTC pointedly asked whether TI could build it on one chip, as Intel was doing. TI then started working on a single-chip CPU for CTC around April 1970. That design, completed the next year, was first called the TMX 1795 (X for “experimental”), a name that morphed into TMC 1795 when it was time for the chip to shed its prototype status. In June 1971, TI launched a media campaign for the TMC 1795 describing how this “central processor on a chip” would make the new Datapoint 2200 “a powerful computer with features the original one couldn’t offer.” That didn’t happen, though: After testing the TMC 1795, CTC rejected it, opting to continue building its processor using a board of bipolar chips. Intel’s chip wouldn’t be ready until the end of that year. Many historians of technology believe that the TMC 1795 died then and there. But newly surfaced documents from the late Gary Boone, the chip’s lead developer, show that after CTC’s rejection, TI tried to sell the chip (which after some minor improvements became known as the TMC 1795A) to various companies. Ford Motor Co. showed interest in using the chip as an engine controller in 1971, causing Boone to write, “I think we have walked into the mass market our ‘CPU-on-a-chip’ desperately needs.” Alas, these efforts failed, and TI ceased marketing the TMC 1795, focusing on its more profitable calculator chips instead. Nevertheless, if you want to assign credit for the first 8-bit microprocessor, you should give that honor to TI, never mind that it fumbled the opportunity.     Images: Steve Golson Engines of Change: These memos reveal that Ford Motor Co. considered using TI's pioneering microprocessor as an engine controller. By the time Intel had the 8008 working, at the end of 1971, CTC had lost interest in single-chip CPUs and gave up its exclusive rights to the design. Intel went on to commercialize the 8008, announcing it in April 1972 and ultimately producing hundreds of thousands of them. Two years later, the 8008 spawned Intel’s 8080 microprocessor, which heavily influenced the 8086, which in turn opened the floodgates for Intel’s current line of x86 chips. So if you’re sitting at a PC with an x86 processor right now, you’re using a computer based on a design that dates all the way back to Datapoint’s 2200 programmable terminal of 1969. As this history makes clear, the evolution of the microprocessor followed anything but a straight line. Much was the result of chance and the outcome of various business decisions that might easily have gone otherwise. Consider how the 8-bit processor architecture that CTC designed for the Datapoint 2200 was implemented in four distinct ways. CTC did it twice using a board stuffed with bipolar chips, first in an arrangement that communicated data serially and later using a parallel design that was much faster. Both TI and Intel met CTC’s requirements with single chips having almost identical instruction sets, but the packaging, control signals, instruction timing, and internal circuitry of the two chips were entirely different. Intel used more advanced technology than did TI, most notably self-aligned gates made of polysilicon, which made the transistors faster and improved yields. This approach also allowed the transistors to be packed more densely. As a result, the 4004 and 8008, even combined, were smaller than the TMC 1795. Indeed, Intel engineers considered the TI chip too big to be practical, but that really wasn’t the case: TI’s highly successful TMS 0100 calculator chip, introduced soon afterward, was even larger than the TMC 1795. Given all this, whom should we credit with the invention of the microprocessor? One answer is that the microprocessor wasn’t really an invention but rather something that everyone knew would happen. It was just a matter of waiting for the technology and market to line up. I find this perspective the most compelling. Another way to look at things is that “microprocessor” is basically a marketing term driven by the need of Intel, TI, and other chip companies to brand their new products. Boone, despite being the developer of the TMC 1795, later credited Intel for its commitment to turning the microprocessor into a viable product. In an undated letter, apparently part of a legal discussion over who should get credit for the microprocessor, he wrote: “The dominant theme in the development of the microprocessor is the corporate commitment made by Intel in the 1972–75 period…. Their innovations in design, software and marketing made possible this industry, or at least hurried it along.”   Photos, left: Intel; right: Computer History Museum The First Microprocessor: Credit normally goes to the Intel 4004, a 4-bit chip designed to serve in a calculator [left]. But there are other possible firsts, depending on your definitions. One was the AL1 arithmetic-logic-unit chip from Four-Phase Systems [right], which predates the 4004 and was used to demonstrate a working computer in a dispute over an early patent for the microprocessor. Honors for creating the first microprocessor also depend on how you define the word. Some define a microprocessor as a CPU on a chip. Others say all that’s required is an arithmetic logic unit on a chip. Still others would allow these functions to be packaged in a few chips, which would collectively make up the microprocessor. In my view, the key features of a microprocessor are that it provides a CPU on a single chip (including ALU, control functions, and registers such as a program counter) and that it is programmable. But a microprocessor isn’t a complete computer: Additional chips are typically needed for memory, I/O, and other support functions. Using such a definition, most people consider the Intel 4004 to be the first microprocessor because it contains all the components of the central processing unit on a single chip. Both Boone and Federico Faggin (of Intel’s 4004 team) agree that the 4004 beat the earliest TMX 1795 prototypes by a month or two. The latter would then represent the first 8-bit microprocessor, and the Intel 8008 the first commercially successful 8-bit microprocessor. But if you adopt a less-restrictive definition of “microprocessor,” many systems could be considered the first. Those who consider an ALU-on-a-chip to be a microprocessor credit Boysel for making the first one at Fairchild in 1968, shortly before he left to cofound Four-Phase Systems. The AL1 from Four-Phase Systems is also a candidate because it combined registers and ALU on a single chip, while having the control circuitry external. If you allow that a microprocessor can consist of multiple LSI chips, the Autonetics D200 would qualify as first. Patents provide a different angle on the invention of the microprocessor. TI was quick to realize the profitability of patents. It obtained multiple patents on the TMX 1795 and TMS 0100 and made heavy use of these patents in litigation and licensing agreements. Based on its patents, TI could be considered the inventor of both the microprocessor and the microcontroller, a single-chip packaging of CPU, memory, and various support functions. Or maybe not. That’s because Gilbert Hyatt obtained a patent for the single-chip processor in 1990, based on a 16-bit serial computer he built in 1969 from boards of bipolar chips. This led to claims that Hyatt was the inventor of the microprocessor, until TI defeated Hyatt’s patent in 1996 after a complex legal battle. Another possible inventor to credit would be Boysel. In 1995, during a legal proceeding that Gordon Bell later mockingly called “TI versus Everybody [PDF],” Boysel countered TI’s single-chip processor patents by using a single AL1 ALU chip from 1969 to demonstrate a working computer to the court. His move effectively torpedoed TI’s case, although I don’t see his demo as particularly convincing, because he used some technical tricks to pull it off. Regardless of what you consider the first microprocessor, you have to agree that there was no lack of contenders for this title. It’s a shame, really, that most people seek to recognize just one winner in the race and that many fascinating runners-up are now almost entirely forgotten. But for those of us with an interest in the earliest days of microcomputing, this rich history will live on.

The brand is looking to tackle power-intensive content like 4K and 360-degree videos with its fresh offerings, focusing on what it calls the ‘immersive internet.’ The new-and-improved 7th Gen Intel Core SoCs continue to utilize the company’s 14nm process technology which it now calls 14nm+. The product apparently supplies up to 12% faster productivity performance and 19% faster capabilities when it comes to the web compared to its predecessor. Intel also claims that users will now be able to watch 4K UHD content on platforms like YouTube for a longer period of time with the chipsets. They’ll additionally have the ability to create, edit and share their own 4K and 360-degree videos up to 15 times faster than a 5-year-old computer. The manufacturer asserts that it’s made this possible thanks to enhancements to its media engine. Also Read: Intel’s Project Alloy is a wireless VR headset for merged reality experiences Intel further said that new PCs running Kaby Lake CPUs will have access to premium 4K content streaming courtesy partners like Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and FandangoNOW. The brand is also looking to target gamers by promising a threefold improvement in graphics so they can play games smoothly. Intel expects more than 100 different 2-in-1s and laptops running on its 7th Gen Core processor to be launched starting in September. It plans to announce more details about its SoCs for desktops and enterprise PCs early next year.

We wish everyone the best of holidays and a prosperous 2017! Zen's Place in the Computing World By Richard Adhikari Aug 31, 2016 5:00 AM PT AMD, which has been clawing its way out of the doldrums, recently showcased its octacore, 16-thread Summit Ridge desktop processor featuring its Zen core in a performance match-up against Intel's octacore Broadwell-E Core i7-6900K CPU. The two similarly configured processors were locked at 3 GHz for the test, in which they ran the multithreaded Blender rendering application, in a demo presented earlier this month in San Francisco. AMD's Summit Ridge outperformed the Intel processor. "They showed a benchmark where, under the conditions they set, they came up neck and neck with Broadwell, which is Intel's highest-performing chip," acknowledged Martin Reynolds, a Gartner distinguished analyst. However, "that doesn't guarantee you great performance," he told TechNewsWorld. Souped-Up Pinto On the other hand, AMD "fixed all of the things that were obviously wrong with the previous generation," Reynolds pointed out, adding full dual-thread capability and dramatically improving cache bandwidth. "This is like taking your Ford Pinto and giving it eight cylinders, making sure it has a really good fuel and air injection system, and giving it proper controls," he observed. Zen is based on a clean-sheet design. It has a new cache hierarchy, improved branch prediction, and simultaneous multithreading. It will scale to meet a broad range of use cases, from fanless 2-in-1s to embedded systems, high-performance computing and data centers, AMD noted. AMD hasn't begun to focus, suggested Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. However, "it's likely this part will do better than Intel on some loads and not as well on others -- that has yet to be determined," he told TechNewsWorld. Picking Up Steam AMD underclocked the Intel Broadwell to match Summit Ridge in the demo -- the Broadwell is clocked at 3.6 GHz, noted Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst at Tirias Research. "We expect AMD will be able to match or exceed the Intel clock speeds when [Summit Ridge] ships in early 2017," he told TechNewsWorld. AMD also demoed the 32-core, 64-thread Zen-based Naples server processor, in a dual-processor server running Windows Server, at the San Francisco event. Both processors demoed are CPU-only, which is unusual for AMD. "AMD wanted to ... give a further glimpse of where we are in development of our next-gen product, and take the opportunity to demonstrate a variety of combinations," spokesperson Jay Marsden told TechNewsWorld. The company "has been strong on having graphics and the chipset together, but this is not an APU -- it doesn't have the graphics on the chip," Gartner's Reynolds noted. That makes it easier to debug the processor and "tells us they're designing the processor to go after high-performance segments -- server sockets and high-end gaming," he suggested. AMD will ship the Naples server in Q2 2017, and an APU processor with integrated graphics for the mobile and small form factor in 2H 2017. Processors for the embedded market will include both CPU-only items and APUs. Zen Processor Caveats "The Zen core achieved a 40 percent generational improvement in instructions per cycle, but IPC is not a good measure," Reynolds said. The speed at which a processor works is determined by how much time it spends waiting for instructions, so "even a really good processor might spend 40 percent of its time sitting around," he pointed out, "and if you make it twice as fast, that means it's waiting around twice as long." Further, Blender is "heavy on floating point," Reynolds noted, "We didn't get any kind of spread benchmark. The waiting around needs to be dealt with, and we need to see multiple benchmarks." The Zen core has dedicated PCIe lanes for cutting-edge USB, graphics, data, and other I/O, so it won't take lanes from other devices and components, AMD said. "Without dedicated lanes, devices can compete for resources, lowering performance," Enderle explained. Until the processors are independently tested, "this is more of a showcase of what the product may do, and not yet what it will do," he cautioned, but OEMS "are unusually excited about [the Zen core], which tends to suggest there is fire under all this smoke." Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to. Will implanted RFID chips in humans be the Mark of the Beast?

The first curved laptop screen! Notice how there are no photos with the lid closed. Here's hoping it can actually be closed flush... Behold! The first curved laptop screen! Notice how there are no photos with the lid closed. Here's hoping it can actually be closed flush... I count... five fans? Acer has unveiled some new laptops at IFA in Germany, including the utterly monstrous curved-display 21-inch Predator 21X. Acer says it's the world's first laptop with a curved screen. The new Predator 21X laptop sits at the very top of Acer's gaming laptop range. The curved screen, which has a resolution of 2560×1080, is powered by two of Nvidia's latest mobile GTX 1080 graphics cards. The screen is G-Sync enabled, too. CPU-wise, the laptop has a new 7th-gen Kaby Lake Intel Core processor, but we don't know exactly which model. Given the laptop's desktop-replacement aspirations we are probably looking at some kind of quad-core 45W TDP chip, rather than one of the dual-core low-power parts unveiled by Intel this week. Intel isn't planning to release its quad-core Kaby Lake parts until the first quarter of 2017—which incidentally is when the Predator 21X is meant to go on sale. The Predator 21X also has Tobii eye-tracking hardware, 4.2 audio (what's the only thing better than one subwoofer?), and a full-size illuminated Cherry MX mechanical keyboard. The numpad (which isn't mechanical) can apparently be flipped over to become a touchpad. Really, the whole thing is a bit of a beast. Update: Acer told Ars that the Predator 21X will weigh 8kg (17.6lbs)—just under half the weight of Elvis, the world's heaviest domestic cat. Acer hasn't provided even a rough ballpark for pricing on the Predator 21X, but considering top-end Predator 17 laptops cost £2,000 or more, the Predator 21X could cost upwards of £3000 ($4000+). Enlarge / The Acer Swift 7, free falling. Swift and Spin Elsewhere at IFA 2016, Acer unveiled two other laptops: a rather fetching MacBookalike called the Swift, and a hybrid 360-degree-hinge laptop called the Spin. The top-end Swift 7, which has two USB Type-C ports, a 13.3-inch screen, a 7th-gen Core i5 chip, and a 256GB SSD, is the thinnest laptop in the world according to Acer (9.9mm). Pricing starts at $1000/€1300 (~£1100) for the Swift 7, scaling down to $750/€750 for the Swift 5, $500/€500 for the Swift 3, and just $250/€350 for the low-end Swift 1 model (all of which are thicker, heavier, and slower than the Swift 7). Judging by the weird dollar/euro pricing, the European Swift 7 model might be higher-spec than in the US. Enlarge / The Acer Spin 7. The Spin follows a fairly similar model lineup: there's a Spin 7, 5, 3, and 1, with pricing ranging from $260/€300 up to $1200/€1300 (~£1100). The Spin 7 is pretty svelte at 10.9mm thick, and comes with a 7th-gen Core i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. The Spin 5, though thicker than the 7, can be specced out with up to 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It sounds like the Spin 5 will also have access to some kind of stylus attachment. The first Spin and Swift laptops will go on sale in October, though some models won't arrive until November and December. The story has been updated with eurozone pricing, which will probably be very close to the UK pricing (the euro pricing includes VAT; the dollar price doesn't).

SUSE Aligns with Intel® for High Performance Computing Stack 2016-08-31 Print Tweet   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for High Performance Computing is included and supported as an option by new Intel® HPC Orchestrator FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Dubai, United Arab Emirates  August 31, 2016  SUSE® has announced that Intel will distribute SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for High Performance Computing as an option for the recently introduced Intel HPC Orchestrator, an Intel-supported HPC system software stack. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is the first commercially supported Linux to be included as an operating system option with Intel HPC Orchestrator system software stack, and the companies will offer joint support for the combined solution. As a result, enterprise customers can accelerate innovation with faster access to relevant, business-changing data. Intel HPC Orchestrator, powered by SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for HPC, reduces the burden of integrating and validating an HPC software stack. It greatly simplifies ongoing maintenance and support by aligning new components and optimizations driven by the OpenHPC community. HPC is no longer just for specialized scientific projects, said Michael Miller, president of strategy, alliances and marketing for SUSE. Today HPC is converging with big data analytics, IoT, machine learning and robotics to open up a whole new era of computing potential. The SUSE and Intel collaboration on Intel HPC Orchestrator and OpenHPC puts this power within reach of a whole new range of industries and enterprises that need data-driven insights to compete and advance. This is an industry-changing approach that will rapidly accelerate HPC innovation and advance the state of the art in a way that creates real-world benefits for our customers and partners. Charles Wuischpard, vice president, Data Center Group, general manager, High Performance Computing Platform Group, at Intel, said, Intel HPC Orchestrator was developed to help organizations simplify the deployment, maintenance and support of their HPC systems. Enterprises which adopt the Intel HPC Orchestrator with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server can benefit from open source innovation while having the peace of mind of an integrated and validated stack of HPC software with Intel and SUSE support. The Intel HPC Orchestrator with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for HPC allows customers to run a fully supported stack for HPC workloads. Along with providing joint support to give enterprises a one-stop support experience, SUSE and Intel will collaborate to optimize SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for Intel HPC system software. In addition, Intel uses the open source Open Build Service to build and release the Intel HPC Orchestrator system software. The Open Build Service  which is also used to generate SUSE Linux Enterprise products  is an openSUSE project that provides a comprehensive distribution development platform. Steve Conway, IDC research vice president, high performance computing, said, The collaboration of Intel and SUSE  two key providers of high performance computing technology  aims to bring important benefits to enterprise users by simplifying and speeding HPC deployments for faster results. Intel HPC Orchestrator with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is designed as a complete, supported HPC stack from a Linux-for-HPC powerhouse and the HPC markets leading processor manufacturer. Intel HPC Orchestrator with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server will be available from Intel in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Acer Swift 7, the first notebook based on Intel’s seventh generation Core processor is just 9.98mm thick, making it thinner the HP Spectre notebook. Acer Swift 7’s scant 9.98mm profile is made possible by the latest Intel 7th gen processor. The new processor with its 14mm fabrication process allows for thinner and 4K ready notebooks. The Acer Swift 7 comes with Intel Core i5 processor, which should be quite powerful for most basic needs and offers tweo USB-C 3.1 ports and a headphone jack. Acer is promising up to 9 hours of battery life with Swift 7. Acer Swift 7 comes with a 13.3-inch Full HD IPS display and aluminium unibody chassis. The laptop features a fanless design thanks to the Kaby lake chipset and weighs just 1.1 Kg. Acer Swift 7 offers 8GB RAM and 256GB storage. Since Acer Swift 7 is considerably thin, the keyboard is likely to be shallower than the existing offerings in the lapop space. Acer Swift 7 is not a convertible or a 2-in-1, its a traditional notebook with extremely thin aluminium chassis. Acer Swift 7 is not just the first notebook to feature 7th Intel processor, it is also the first to use fanless design with passive cooling mechanism. Acer Swift 7, priced at 6,999 Yuan, will launch in China in September. The world’s thinnest notebook will then reach Europe and US markets.

This Windows 10 machine, powered by Intel’s brand new 7th-generation Core i5 processor, measures a scant 9.98mm, making it the first to limbo under the 1cm bar (0.39 inches). Despite beating Apple’s MacBook and HP’s Spectre 13 for the braggadocious title of being the world’s thinnest laptop, the Swift 7 doesn’t sacrifice much in the way of either ports or battery. It offers two USB-C 3.1 ports and a headphone jack, plus Acer promises a 9-hour endurance thanks to Intel’s newly updated and more efficient Y series of chips. The display up front is a 13.3-inch Full HD IPS panel with nothing to truly distinguish it. It’s not going to be the Swift’s big selling point, but neither is it any sort of deal breaker. On the inside, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage sit alongside the Intel Kaby Lake chip, which is passively cooled — the whole system is fanless. Acer outfits the Swift 7 in an aluminum unibody chassis, which is dark on the outside and a quite classy gold on the interior. Weighing in at 1.1kg (2.48 pounds), the Swift 7 is effortless to tote around in one hand. The keyboard is nice and comfortable to type on, even if it does have predictably shallow key travel. The only thing I didn’t like about it was that it had some flex in the middle — though the overall laptop feels rigid and solid enough to survive daily use in spite of its paper-thin construction. One other peculiar thing about this notebook is its touchpad, which might be the widest on any laptop yet; are we standing on the precipice of a new era of widescreen touchpads? Grid View Acer Swift 7 gallery I don’t usually want a touchscreen or a rotating display on my laptops, but the Swift 7 is so light that it encourages more unconventional use, which in turn makes those features feel like something of an omission. Cognizant of that, Acer is today also launching a Spin 7 model, which is similar in most respects, but adds a better Core i7 processor, larger 14-inch display, touch, and a 360-degree hinge. All that improvement for the low price of just an extra millimeter over the Swift 7. Read next: Ultra-thin laptops aren't what we need, but we want them anyway Many people will question why Acer would go to the trouble of creating the Swift 7 if the Spin 7 is so much more capable as a computer. And they’d be right, up to a point. The odd thing is that if Acer had just launched the Spin 7 by itself, it would have been seen as a nice but incremental step forward. The Swift 7 is the ostentatious hype bringer that a company like Acer needs to attraction attention and adulation. And, unlike Taiwanese compatriot Asus, Acer isn’t just talking about its MacBook killer, it’s shipping it. The Swift 7 launches in China in September for ¥6,999, followed by Europe and the United States in October, at prices of €1,299 and $999, respectively. This pricing isn’t actually too bad for those who prioritize style and flair over everyday practicality.

With a naming convention that seems to defy logic, the new Spin notebooks have something to offer for every member of the family and for every computing use case, from the sleek and premium-looking Spin 7, down to the more portable Spin 1 fit for students. At least the “Spin” name isn’t just for show, as all notebooks transform from laptop to tablet in no time flat. Truth be told, it’s a bit difficult to correlate the Acer Spin’s model numbers to their features, as one model might have a special feature that a higher model doesn’t have. Acer does, however, want you to see these notebooks in a tiered system, with the Spin 7 at the very top as its flagship configuration and the Spin 1 below as the entry-level model. But perhaps it’s also easier to match their names with the Intel processors they support. The Acer Spin 7 gets the best of the best CPU, with a 7th gen Intel Core i7. Yes, the new Kaby Lake processors that were just unveiled. Complementing this is a capacity for up to 8 GB of DDR4 RAM and 256 GB SSD storage. The 14-inch Full HD display comes with 10-point touch support. and Gorilla Glass 4. A mixed bag of specs, the Spin 7 boasts of the most premium build quality among the four, all metal and with a thin 10.98 mm profile. The Acer Spin 5, as you might have guessed, sports an Intel Core i5 but can also go with a Core i3. While the screen is smaller at 13.3 inches, it still has the same 10-point touch Full HD features. And although it’s theoretically a lower model, it gets a bit of a boost when it comes to memory, up 16 GB of DDR4 RAM and 512 GB SSD storage. Things actually get even messier with the Acer Spin 3, which actually gets the Core i3 plus the i5, the i7, and Pentium as well as Celeron processors. The choices don’t end there either. Buyers can choose between a Full HD or just an HD 10-point touch screen, both 15.6 inches on the diagonal. It supports up to 12 GB of RAM and a dual storage system of up to 256 GB SSD and 1 TB HDD. The Spin 3 gets this many configurations because Acer is trying to market the device as something that can be used for both work and play, depending on the user’s needs. And finally, the Acer Spin 1 gets an Intel Celeron processor (as there isn’t a Core i1) and up to 8 GB of DDR3L, not DDR4, RAM. It also has a dual storage system but one where you get an eMMC class internal storage up to 64 GB and HDD up to 1 TB. While you do get the same choice of FHD or HD displays, the 11.6-inch screen curiously doesn’t mention any touch capacity. Availability of the Acer Spin notebook series is as follows: • Acer Spin 7 – October (North America) for $1,199, October (EMEA) for 1,299 EUR • Acer Spin 5 – October (North America) for $599, September (EMEA) for 599 EUR • Acer Spin 3 – October (North America) for $499, September (EMEA) for 599 EUR • Acer Spin 1 – December (North America) for $249, November (EMEA) for 299 EUR Tags AcerComputingIFA 2016LaptopnotebookWindows 10 Must Read Bits & Bytes It’s time this car safety tech was standard Tesla Autopilot update makes 2016 deadline; Price increase pushed back iPhone manufacturer Foxconn reveals plans to fully automate factories The Google Pixel shipping nightmare (and Verizon’s XL role) Nintendo Switch needs retro games to succeed Latest Headlines Galaxy S8 leaked to get Continuum-like experience Jan 2, 2017 NASA wraps up the year with a catchy tune and 2016 highlights Jan 2, 2017 Bitcoin is back over $1,000 as value climbs Jan 2, 2017 Topps, maker of sports cards, discloses data breach Jan 2, 2017 Tango capable ZenFone AR leaked ahead of CES reveal in Qualcomm slip up Jan 2, 2017 Latest Reviews The McLaren 570S is my favorite car of 2016 Dec 30, 2016 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Review: Affordable SUV more than matches its 7 passenger peers Dec 28, 2016 2016 BMW 330e Review: The secret plug-in hybrid Dec 26, 2016 2017 Infiniti Q60 Red Sport 400 Review Dec 26, 2016 Lenovo Phab 2 Pro review: Google Tango has landed Dec 21, 2016 Search © 2005-2016 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.

Andrew Williams and Mike Lowe2 January 2017Laptops Pocket-lint 4.0 stars £949 For Firm-feeling build, good screen contrast, a large trackpad and a lower price than some Against Limited connections, processor prioritises efficiency over performance, no backlight keyboard Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Ask the average person about the themes of 2016 and you'll hear about celebrity deaths and far-right politics spreading across the western world quicker than a cute puppy video. Tech trends were, thankfully, less depressing: we saw a lot of super-super thin laptops arrive to see in 2017. The Acer Swift 7 is not just one of the thinnest, it's also one of the more affordable. At £950-1000 (depending on how hard you shop) it's not exactly cheap, but is £100 less than the Dell XPS 13 and is knocking on Apple's design door too. Acer Swift 7 review: Design Just 9.98mm thin Gold and black colour Laptops like the Acer Swift 7 and HP Spectre are a real mix of old and new. They set new standards for super-skinniness and light weight, but are also pure laptops. That means no touchscreen, no hybrid design and no Microsoft Surface-a-like stylus features. Pocket-lint Super-powered portability is the main draw. Well, that and a fancy look. The Acer Swift 7 is all-aluminium and has a two-tone design. It is gold on the inside and black on the outside, and you'd better like that look because there are no silvery safety net options on offer. The Swift 7's gold is also a little bolder than the more champagne-y shades we tend to see on phones and laptops. Embrace the bling or get out of here. What really sells the Swift 7, though, is its slender dimensions. It's just 10mm thick, which is even thinner than the HP Spectre. Having used most of these new ultra-skinny elite laptops, the Acer Swift 7 actually batters you over the head with its slim-ness less than most. Its footprint is still as large as an old-style 13-inch MacBook Pro and, at 1.16kg, it's not so light that you wonder whether they forgot to put the battery in. The Asus ZenBook 3 is 200g lighter, for example. Pocket-lint The Acer Swift 7 also lacks the final magic design touch that makes a laptop feel like its designers were trying to make a museum piece: you can't lift the lid without the keyboard base part lifting off the table. It's one of those little show-off bits only MacBooks and a few Windows laptops have. More important, though, Acer does seem to have nailed the build quality basics. Despite being dead thin, the keyboard doesn't flex even if you press down on it pretty hard, and you can also tilt the screen back more than on the HP Spectre. Acer Swift 7 review: Connections 2x USB-C and 1x 3.5mm jack only The main questionable part of this new wave of slim laptop design is the kind of connectivity you get. Well, more the lack of it. The Swift 7 has two USB Type-C ports and a headphone jack. And that's it. One of those C-ports is taken up by the power lead when it's plugged in too. Pocket-lint We bet virtually everything you own that you'd want to plug into the Swift 7 still uses full-fat USB, and you'll also need to get hold of an adapter to use an SD card. It's one of those MacBook-esque issues. The positive side of USB-C is that these ports can juggle loads of data. This means you can attach a bunch of things to the one port, as long as you have the right adapter, anyway. And they're not included in the box. Acer Swift 7 review: Keyboard and trackpad Shallow press keys No backlight Oversize trackpad One other eyebrow-raiser of these new laptops is that many, including the Swift 7, have ultra-shallow keyboards. It's a classic MacBook-apeing move, but Acer's slim keyboards are better than some. It'll take some getting used to if you currently have a chunky laptop, but Acer's engineers have managed to inject some satisfying resistance into these keys even though they only depress a little. Pocket-lint It has a meatier feel than a 12in MacBook. The keyboard is also extremely quiet, making our everyday (old style) MacBook Pro sound like a noisy clacker. There's a major omission here, though. Despite costing almost £1000, the Acer Swift 7 does not have a keyboard backlight. Almost every laptop this pricey has one, and a backlight comes in handy if you need to work in a dim or dark room on occasion. Leaving it out doesn't make a lot of sense, even if it was necessary to get to 9.98mm thin. In a lot of areas it's easy to label this as Acer's attempt to copy Apple, but the Swift 7's trackpad is much more like one of HP's Envy 'pads. It's very, very wide, giving you loads of space to flick around. It's great in-use too, with a super-smooth textured glass top and an easy but well-defined clicker. We saw none of the weird behaviour you sometimes see in Windows 10 device trackpads either. If you'll appreciate the extra swiping area, it's hard to beat. Acer Swift 7 review: Screen 13.3-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS LCD panel (16:9 ratio) The Acer Swift 7 display is a little more ordinary, but still good enough to justify the price. It's not as good as that of the new 13-inch MacBook but a lot better than the dated display of the MacBook Air. Pocket-lint Similarly, colour is good but not quite as punchy as the new MacBook Pro's tones or those of something like the super-saturated Razer Blade Stealth. However, contrast is strong and max brightness gives you the option to work outdoors on a sunny-ish day even though the Acer Swift 7 has a glossy screen. It's topped with Gorilla Glass 5 too, to shouldn't be too easy to scratch even if you treat it like dirt. If you're a real screen perfectionist you might be left wishing for a few more pixels. 1080p across a 13.3-inch screen lets you see slight pixellation, with small fonts looking less than totally smooth. It all depends on how much you've already been spoilt by super-high density laptops, tablets and phones really. Acer Swift 7 review: Performance Intel Core i5-7Y54 (1.2GHz) 8 GB LPDDR3 RAM 256GB SSD There's also a little semi-hidden sacrifice Acer has used to get the Swift 7 thinner than the competition. Look at its spec list and you'll see it has a Core i5 CPU. However, it's actually less powerful than the processors of most alternatives because it's the new-gen equivalent of one of Intel's fanless Core M CPUs. Intel just changed how they're named. Sneaky. Pocket-lint It's an Intel i5-7Y54, a latest-generation Kaby Lake processor. Where the Core i5-6200U used in many ultraportables has a clock speed of 2.3GHz, the i5-7Y54 is clocked at 1.2GHz. It's less powerful, uses a lot less battery and is so efficient it doesn't need a fan. However, with most light laptop tasks like browsing, Microsoft Office work and light photo editing, you won't really notice much difference. It's much better than an Intel Atom laptop. Miles better. We wouldn't have noticed the shortfall if we hadn't also tried some games on the Swift 7. A "proper" Intel Core laptop is no gaming powerhouse, but you can play some older console-style titles if you turn down the visuals a bit. The i5-7Y54's Intel HD 615 GPU only has about 70 per cent of the power of the last-gen Core i5's HD 520 graphics chipset, further limiting the kind of games you can play without them turning into a slideshow. Pocket-lint This sort of sacrifice is, at the moment, still necessary to get the Swift 7's CPU down to the level where it only creates a third the heat of a normal Core i5 laptop. Even though it doesn't have a fan it stays cool most of the time, although if you do play games for a while you'll feel the part above the keyboard getting hot. This is where the main heatsinks live. Acer Swift 7 review: Battery life 2,770mAh battery The low-demand CPU also helps keep battery life pretty decent, if not radically better than some alternatives, when you're doing something simple like watching a video or doing some browsing. At 40 per cent brightness, the Swift 7 lasts for eight and a half hours when playing a movie on loop. We saw similar "all-day" results when using this laptop as our everyday work laptop. Pocket-lint That's better than the HP Spectre, but the Dell XPS 13 lasts even longer thanks to a combo of clever power management and a much bigger battery. Laptop batteries are normally described as having so many watt-hours (Wh), but Acer uses the much more phone-like milliampere hours in its spec sheet. And the Swift 7 has 2,770mAh, which is pretty low for a high-end laptop. The Dell XPS 13's works out at well over 6,000mAh, but that's partly because the Dell operates at a higher voltage. The Swift 7's i5-7Y54 needs less juice. It makes us wonder how long the Swift 7 might last if it was 2mm thicker and the extra space was packed with lithium-ion goodness, but then the laptop wouldn't have the all-important 9.98mm thickness to brag about. Still: real-world battery life is very good if you keep your activities light. Acer Swift 7 review: Sound The Acer Swift 7 also has fairly good speakers for a very slim laptop, although last year saw the bar for audio in pricey models rise substantially. Two drivers sit on the underside, firing outwards to make the sound wider than the laptop itself. Pocket-lint As they're so close to whatever table the laptops sits on, the sound varies a lot depending whether it's on your knees or a surface. But there is an extra ounce or two of bulk to the sound and decent top volume. It's enough to make watching a film on the Swift 7 while on holiday enjoyable rather than a complete compromise. A MacBook gets you better bass and less brittle-sounding treble, though. Verdict The Acer Swift 7 is one of the thinnest laptops in the world, and it costs a bit less than some in this class. Add a good trackpad, a decent screen and a solid-if-shallow keyboard and you have a great ultra-portable machine for work and the sorts of time-wasting most of us do on our laptops. Look a bit closer and you realise Acer's super-slim claims are a bit, well, thinner than they initially seem. The Swift 7 has a less powerful processor than most of its rivals, as well as a larger footprint, so while very slim it's not necessarily more portable than the rest. There's no keyboard backlight either. This shouldn't all necessarily put you off, but it's worth looking a bit deeper if you've been lured-in by the 10mm-thick design. For most, the big question is whether the restrictive connections will get on your nerves (despite it rapidly becoming the norm for high-end laptops). Otherwise Acer has made a generally decent MacBook competitor. Acer Swift 7: The alternatives to consider Pocket-lint HP Spectre 13 £1,299 It's pricier, it's just as bling, but it's also more powerful than Acer's offering (even if it's not quite as slim). Pocket-lint Dell XPS 13 from £1,049 With its quirky edge-to-edge display and more power to boot, the Dell XPS might not look as bling, but it's more of a workhorse for not much more cash. Plus it has full-size USB ports. Pocket-lint Apple MacBook 2016 from £1,099 Ok, so there's no Windows to be seen here, and Apple has the same limitation with connectivity as the Acer. As small, portable laptops go, however, it's a hard one to beat. Especially if you like rose gold.

Intel's Kaby Lake chip is a must-have for 4K video fiends Expect a modest bump in performance and some amazing video optimizations. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 30 August, 2016 23:00 0 - - - - print email Intel’s Kaby Lake, the company's third 7th-generation Core microprocessor, was never meant to be. Broadwell, then Skylake: Intel’s tick-tock model was supposed to move on from there to the 10-nm Cannon Lake microprocessor next on Intel’s roadmap. Struggles with 10-nm development forced Intel into its new Kaby Lake processor, however, which officially launched Tuesday. Intel The “7th Gen” designation is now part of Intel’s official branding. Maybe it’s no surprise, then, that its benefits are somewhat milder than in generations past. There’s a mere 12- to 19-percent bump in integer performance, helped by a more responsive “turbo boost” capability. A dedicated, advanced video engine promises some real gains—a whopping 2.6X increase in overall battery life when playing back 4K video using specific codecs. Otherwise, what makes Kaby Lake attractive is its familiarity: Manufacturing it should go smoothly and reliably, analysts say, and over a hundred PC designs are lined up for launch. At its recent Intel Developer Forum, Intel said it had begun shipping Kaby Lake. The first 2-in-1 PCs and ultrathin laptops will appear this fall, company executives said at a recent briefing. For now, Intel has made a small selection of Kaby Lake chips public: the Y-series (4.5-watt parts) for the lowest-power devices, and the more powerful 15-watt U-series chip. All include two processor cores and four threads. Gordon Mah Ung Intel's 7th-gen Kaby Lake is built on a 14-nm process similar to that of Skylake CPUs, but manufacturing tweaks give it a performance boost, the company says. Why this matters: Intel’s new processors typically usher in a new generation of PCs, as their makers pray consumers will rush out to buy new hardware. Kaby Lake, seems optimized for what consumers are actually doing, rather than trying to create a new market (VR, anyone?). But there’s another factor to consider: AMD’s Zen, a rival processor architecture that has promised to rival Intel’s performance. Perhaps by next summer, consumers will have some true choice in their next PC. Kaby Lake’s modest boost in performance For years, Intel has operated on a “tick-tock” strategy, first migrating an existing design to a finer, more efficient manufacturing process (tick), then rearchitecting the chip with new features and optimizations (tock). Kaby Lake interrupts the process, acting as a second tock after Skylake. Intel was challenged to give Kaby Lake room to improve upon its predecessor. Gordon Mah Ung Intel demonstrated an XPS 13 outfitted with the 7th-gen Kaby Lake CPU, running the game Overwatch at 720p resolution and medium settings. We saw frame rates in the 30-fps range. The answer was a tweaked manufacturing process. What Intel calls its “14-nm+” architecture includes the same instructions-per-clock pipeline as the Skylake generation, according to Intel executives. Still, the improvements in the manufacturing process—taller “fins” in Intel’s FinFET process and a wider gate pitch, among others—boosted performance 12 percent at the transistor level and pushed up clock speeds about 400MHz overall, Intel executives said. As a result, the battery life of a Kaby Lake notebook should be up to 9.5 hours while continuously looping video. Intel A feature summary of some of the new Intel Kaby Lake U-series chips. Within the Y-series chips, core clock speeds will span 1.0GHz to 1.3GHz, using Intel’s “turbo boost” to overclock from 2.6GHz to 3.6GHz when needed. For example, a Core i7-7Y75 Kaby Lake part will include 2 cores/4 threads, with a base frequency of 1.3GHz and a “turbo boost” frequency of a whopping 3.6GHz. The more powerful U series, meanwhile, will run at core clock speeds from 2.4GHz to 2.7GHz, with “turbo boost” speeds of 3.1GHz to 3.5GHz. Though you’ll probably never buy either chip yourself, Intel’s public pricing on both series is identical, ranging from $281 to $393. Gordon Mah Ung Intel’s 7th gen Kaby Lake is built on the same 14nm process but improvements in manufacturing and under the hood tweaks have lead to not insignificant performance boosts depending on the task. Be aware, however, of the important branding difference between the two processor families launched. A generation ago, the Y-series was known as Core m. Now, however, Intel has largely done away with that specific brand, dubbing it just another Core i7 instead. Only the m3-7Y30 will be officially known as a Core m3. One of the elements that helped Kaby Lake’s performance is an improved “Speed Shift” technology. Intel’s “Turbo Boost” technology kicks a single processor core into an overclocked state. But Speed Shift governs how quickly that happens—and Kaby Lake accomplishes that task faster than Skylake does. That makes Kaby Lake more responsive: about 19 percent quicker on browsing with Edge—a “feels faster” improvement, Intel executives said. Intel didn’t say anything about Kaby Lake’s graphics performance, though we'd guess (as indicated above) that it can at least play Overwatch, a popular online shooter, at decent settings. Otherwise, Intel executives encouraged reporters to compare Kaby Lake to a five-year-old PC: Kaby Lake can convert an hour-long 4K video in 12 minutes, 6.8 times faster than an ancient Core i5-2467M Sandy Bridge chip. According to Intel, it’s "three times better" in Overwatch as well. INTEL With Kaby Lake, the processor jumps up into an overclocked state faster than Skylake. Otherwise, the differences lie mainly in the platform capabilities. Intel says convertible PCs and clamshells can now be manufactured thinner than 10mm, and more than 120 Kaby Lake PCs will include a Thunderbolt connection, which the chip supports. Intel defines premium and baseline Kaby Lake configurations. The baseline spec supports up to eight USB 2.0 ports, up to four USB 3.0 ports, and up to 10 lanes of older Gen-2 PCI Express. Intel’s premium ultrabook spec supports up to six USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports, plus up to 10 Gen-3 lanes of PCI Express. The premium configuration also supports Smart Response Technology; the baseline does not. Kaby Lake’s new video block makes real-world sense The other important aspect of Kaby Lake is Intel’s transition to a new video engine. According to Chris Walker, the general manager for mobile client platforms at Intel, the web’s content platforms are moving to HEVC and VP9 for video encoding and decoding—and at higher resolutions. Skylake accelerated 1080p HEVC encoding and decoding natively in hardware, but it lacked dedicated support for 4K HEVC encoding/decoding at 10-bit depths, or VP9 decoding—two things that Kaby Lake does natively in hardware. These advances are important for the same reason that Netflix and Google have led the way toward using both codecs: They provide equivalent video quality at a fraction of the bandwidth, especially as 4K video becomes more widespread. On Monday, for example, Netflix performed an in-depth technical examination of three of the most popular video codecs. Netflix found that HEVC delivers all of the video quality of the older AVC codec that Skylake supported, but at 50 percent of the bandwidth. That means the amount of data your bandwidth cap chews up on account of video streaming could be half of what it is now, without a noticeable change in quality—but it would require significantly more computational horsepower from your PC. What Kaby Lake promises is that the new dedicated video block won’t actually impede your PC’s performance. That translates into two advantages, according to Intel: first, a tangible improvement in video decoding and encoding. Naturally, a Kaby Lake system will be able to decode 4K video at 60 frames per second—or up to eight 4K streams at 30 fps.But even the ultra-low-power Y-series will be able to encode 4K video at 30 frames per second, Intel said. Intel This graphic compares the amount of power used by Skylake’s CPU and graphics engine to render 4K/10-bit HEVC video, versus Kaby Lake. Kaby Lake requires 0.5 watts on average, while Skylake required 10.2 watts—an enormous difference. Otherwise, simply playing back video will consume far less power than before. Intel claims that the power consumed by the CPU and GPU combined will be up to 20 times less than in Skylake, resulting in a whopping 2.6 times more battery life when playing back HEVC 10-bit video on a notebook with a 4K panel. Streaming VP9 video on YouTube will see smaller, but still-impressive gains: a 1.75X improvement in battery life. It was a smart decision for Intel, analyst Dean McCarron of Mercury Research said. “We’ve got a lot of transistors to spend on processor cores,” he said. “You can squeeze more transistors into more cores or higher clock rates, or you can choose specialization, as Intel did here. Video is a really common task, with common algorithms, and it’s a good way to spend those transistors.” Gordon Mah Ung This is Intel’s new 7th-gen Kaby Lake CPU, which will initially come in a dual-core variant. In January, expect to see additional products for enthusiast notebooks and desktops, as well as workstations and servers for the enterprise, Intel executives said. They’ll include new “Extreme Edition” chips, 65-watt S-series chips, and quad-core H-series chips. For now, though, Intel and the PC industry merely hope you’ll find Kaby Lake worth buying. For years, Intel has tried to direct the PC industry—you might recall its fixation with ultrabooks and two-in-one tablets. Now, it’s more responsive to what customers are actually doing with its products. Intel’s stance might have been different had it developed a potent mobile processor that it could turn to as PC sales fell. Until it can make its embedded future a reality, though, Intel still needs your business. Additional reporting by Gordon Mah Ung.

Microsoft made 'em do it: The latest Kaby Lake, Zen chips will support only Windows 10 No one knows what would happen if you tried to run an older OS on one of the new chips. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 30 August, 2016 23:00 0 - - - - print email Microsoft is slamming the door on PC builders and upgraders who might have hoped to use the new Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Zen chips for Windows 7 or Windows 8 PCs. Sorry: Both chips are officially supported only by Microsoft’s Windows 10. Microsoft's mandate is discreet rather than secret. In January, the company tried to shorten its support lifecycle for Intel Skylake PCs running Windows 7 and 8, a policy the company subsequently abandoned after much outcry. But Microsoft’s statements have also consistently included a critical caveat: The latest generations of silicon—specifically Intel’s Kaby Lake chip, Qualcomm’s 8996, and AMD’s Bristol Ridge silicon—will all require Windows 10. “As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support,” a Microsoft spokeswoman replied, when asked to confirm that that position was still in place. The goal appears to be to move forward with new features, even if it means leaving some users behind. “This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon, while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon.” Why this matters: Microsoft's push forward, however rational from a technology standpoint, robs PC enthusiasts of their choice of operating systems—a freedom this particular sector of the community has loudly defended in the past. This could have broader implications for the PC market, too: It could be the deciding factor that finally brings about the abandonment of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. (Linux is an option, too.) Gordon Mah Ung Intel’s 7th gen Kaby Lake is built on a similar 14nm process as the previous Skylake CPUs. But a change in Microsoft’s support policy means that it will be only be officially supported by Windows 10. What the mandate means for PC users AMD and Intel, for their part, appear to have had little choice in Microsoft’s decision essentially to limit the customers they can sell to. “We are committed to working with Microsoft and our ecosystem partners to help ensure a smooth transition given these changes to Microsoft’s Windows support policy,” an Intel spokesman said. An AMD representative was equally neutral. “AMD’s processor roadmap is fully aligned with Microsoft’s software strategy,” AMD chief technical officer Mark Papermaster said, via a company spokeswoman. AMD’s Bristol Ridge chip, the first to be tied to Windows 10, launched in June as its seventh-generation APU. AMD’s first member of its new Zen microprocessor family, dubbed Summit Ridge, will appear in high-end desktop PCs early next year. Neither will be officially supported by the older operating systems. Here's the obvious question: What would happen if a naïve or not-so-naïve user attempted to run Windows 7 or Windows 8 on a Kaby Lake or Zen system? Without actual chips to test, the answer is unknown. One source privately guessed that the processor would boot, though without driver support and security updates the experience would be “a bit glitchy.” Without specific support for a chip’s features—such as the dedicated video processing logic within Kaby Lake, for example—certain apps, if not the OS itself, might crash, another said. Gordon Mah Ung AMD’s Summit Ridge SoC (left), running at 3GHz, can run a Blender render just as fast as a Core i7-6900K (right) also running at 3GHz. But only the Core i7 can run Windows 7. However, processor analyst Dean McCarron of Mercury Research didn’t think running Kaby Lake would necessarily generate many problems, as there’s a long history of instruction set compatibility. “My expectation is ...that all the older code will run on it fine,” he said. “Likely...there’d be third party [driver] support that would allow older OSes to run, .inf files, for example. And Intel’s going to make those.” It’s also conceivable that enthusiasts could craft “black box” or modified drivers to help the latest chips run on the older operating systems. But in reality, the scope of the task would require detailed documentation as well as sophisticated testing resources, both of which seem infeasible. What might be an acceptable risk for a consumer, however, might not fly for a business where uptime and total cost of ownership are managed carefully. It’s here, McCarron said, that the transition to Windows 10 will have the most impact. “It’ll turn into [a situation where] ‘if it breaks, it’s not our problem,'’’ he said. “Which is why it’s going to be such a problem for large, multi-thousand-seat deployments” who depend on external support contracts, he said. What’s more likely, McCarron suggested, is that PC makers and customers will commit to buying and stockpiling Skylake components and systems as a hedge against Microsoft’s support gambit. In this way, end customers will know their devices will be supported, he said. Mark Hachman The dialog box that Microsoft presented to users during the upgrade to Windows 10, before its Anniversary Update. Microsoft’s history of pushing users to Windows 10 Microsoft has laid out its rationale for encouraging users to adopt Windows 10: In short, it’s a more manageable, secure operating system with better collaboration across users and devices, the company claims. Nevertheless, a substantial chunk of users can’t see past Microsoft’s attempts to force Windows 10 upon them. Of late, the carrots Microsoft has used to entice Windows 10 adoption—the Insider program, free upgrades from older operating systems, and synergy with Windows phones, the Xbox One, and even iOS and Android phones—have been largely ignored. Instead, Microsoft has come under fire for its ongoing program of forced upgrades, locking down Cortanato exclusively use Bing,and what some users see as a concerted attempt to mine personal data for advertising purposes. We don't know whether terminating support for older operating systems on Kaby Lake and Zen actually means they won’t work. What seems more certain is that Microsoft’s latest strategy will be seen as just another “stick” wielded to force customers to upgrade to Windows 10.

PC chip maker Intel has unveiled the 7th generation processors for computing devices. Codenamed Kaby Lake, the new generation of chips will be available as the Intel Core m3 processors designed specifically for thin and light convertible computing devices, as well as the Intel Core i3, Intel Core i5 and Intel Core i7 processor variants for PCs and laptops. Intel suggests that PC manufacturers should start shipping devices running these new Kaby Lake series chips, by the end of September. But, it certainly hasn’t been a smooth ride for Intel with this particular generation of chips. What we were supposed to witness this year were the 10-nanometer architecture chips, but there were some delays which meant the chipmaker could not meet the deadlines for the annual chip line-up refresh. Which is why, Kaby Lake is essentially a mid-generation refresh of the existing Skylake series of chips, with the 14nm architecture. All this, with performance as well as power improvements which one would expect from a new line of processors. This means the 10nm Cannonlake chips can be expected around the same time next year. However, the silver lining to the otherwise dark cloud for Intel would be the fact that this delay will not really hurt them as badly as one would expect. PC sales have dropped every year since 2011, and according to recent numbers by research firm IDC, they are expected to decline another 7% in 2016. This means, consumers are holding on to their PCs much longer than ever before, and the demographic rushing to upgrade has shrunk considerably. With the Kaby Lake chips, Intel is focusing more on the user experience improvements, rather than just the core specifications. Important to note that Intel tends to follow the tick-tock strategy when it comes to refreshing the chip line-up annually. Tick being the major refresh with the architecture changes, while tock represents an incremental improvement compared to the previous generation. In this case, it is the second tock in the cycle for Intel, and Kaby Lake will have a tough time trying to come across as a genuine upgrade over the Skylake chips. But here is what, everything will now be marginally better. These 7th generation processors can handle multiple 4K Ultra High Definition video streams, augmented reality software and 360-degree videos, batch edit as many as 1400 images in a minute and improved battery life as well. Overall, the new chips are about 12% faster than the predecessors, and Intel claims you will be able to get 3 more hours of battery life while streaming 4K videos on YouTube (7 hours now, compared to 4 hours earlier)—the battery improvements, in particular, can only be verified when we test the new range of laptops and hybrids when they release over the next few months, and these numbers will also depend on a lot of other factors. The question is—should you defer your PC purchase and buy one with the 7th generation processors, or ignore this and splurge now itself? The answer lies in how urgently you need the new PC. In the long run, there is absolutely no harm in buying a PC with the very latest processors, and the performance as well as battery improvements they bring. You will get the choice of the following processors, depending on the device you are buying, and the budget—one set of variants includes the Intel Core i7-7500U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.7GHz base, 3.5GHz turbo), Intel Core i5-7200U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.5GHz base, 3.1GHz turbo), Intel Core i3-7100U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.4GHz, no turbo), followed by the lower power consumption Intel Core i7-7Y75 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.3GHz base, 3.6GHz turbo) and Intel Core i5-7Y54 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.2GHz base, 3.2GHz turbo) and finally, the Intel Core m3-7Y30 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.0GHz base, 2.6GHz turbo) chip designed for ultra-thin computing devices which usually also do not have a cooling fan.

By Martin Brinkmann on August 31, 2016 in Windows - Last Update:August 31, 2016 55 Whose idea was it to limit support for future generations of Intel and AMD chips to Windows 10? We don't know the answer to that, but the finger seems to point to Microsoft. Microsoft revealed in January of this year that the next generation of silicon chips would only by supported by Windows 10, the company's new operating system. The only exception to the rule was Intel's Skylake chip, which the company planned to support for a selection of (mostly business) devices. Microsoft changed its course on Skylake support on Windows 7 and Windows 8 later on, but remained firm in regards to next gen processor support. The change affects consumers and businesses alike. Consumers are limited by it, as they no longer have the choice to build a Windows PC running Windows 7 or 8.1 using one of the newer chips. Businesses are even more affected by it than consumers, as most would not want to run unsupported hardware on previous versions of Windows. Actually, it is unclear right now what would happen if one would try to run a Windows 7 or 8.1 computer with one of the new chips. The reason for this is simple: availability. The chips are not available yet which means that no one tried to install previous versions of Windows on a computer running these new chips. Microsoft failed to reveal what would happen if users would try to run new unsupported chips on old versions of Windows. Guesses range from "it would work" to "it would likely crash" or "not even install". Third-party drivers could be created to fill the gap, but that would take time and it would only benefit home users but not businesses, as they are unlikely to run third-party drivers that are not official and not supported. We will know more once AMD and Intel release their first Zen and Kaby Lake chips, but before then, it is unknown territory. Did Microsoft push the chip manufacturers into a corner? We don't know that either. What we know is that AMD and Intel are supporting Microsoft's strategy. It makes little sense from a business perspective for chip manufacturers to limit their customer base artificially though. Additionally, both Intel and AMD would have to come up with the idea on their own, and approach Microsoft about it independently, which seems unlikely as well. Microsoft's strategy could drive some users and even businesses towards Linux, especially if they have no intention of installing Windows 10 any time soon or at all on their devices.

W10 is pure malware, with spyware built into the core of the operating system to capture everything you do and phone it home. Microsoft's core business will soon be Big Data and their business practices resemble a mafia syndicate in order to get everyine using their new data capture and mining tool. If you care even remotely about your privacy you will do as I've done and jump ship to Linux, as those using W10 now effectively owns all your personal data and the rights to capture all your activity if you are using W10.

Reply Tom Hawack August 31, 2016 at 11:39 am # I entirely agree, buck. I'm on my way to Linux after having known but Microsoft ever since Windows 3.x The company has become an insanity, and I weigh my words. Reply infojunkie August 31, 2016 at 8:18 am # This is one of the main reasons driving me to start the processes of slowly converting over to Linux for everything. This move is one of the most childish uncalled for things I have ever seen them do. Windows 8.1 is still in main steam support until January 9, 2018 By that time both Zen and Kabby Lake will both be common main steam CPUs. As a business it's pretty hard not to feel completely betrayed that you can't keep up-to-date hardware on an OS until the end of it's mainstream support. Yes MS want's everyone to use windows 10 but they also sold us already on using windows 8.1 until January 9, 2018 for all things mainstream. At this point the fact of the matter is MS is failing hardcore to live up to their own past and current promises and because of that windows 10 is looking more and more like an unacceptable high risk. Reply Yuliya August 31, 2016 at 8:36 am # Idk, I think it's just micro$oft desperately trying to convince users into using Windows10. Why would it not work? Unpatched 7 works perfectly with Ivy Bridge, and that's a three years gap. Even Vista works fine.. Reply T J August 31, 2016 at 12:49 pm # Microsoft has already back tracked on dropping support for Skylake. It is possible (probable ?) that they will do the same with Zen and Kaby Lake. Anyway, why do so many people think that it will be the end of their computing world if they are not able to use PCs with the new chips installed if they don't install Win 10 ? Why, except for Gamers, do people think that they are missing out because they can not use the "latest and greatest" chip sets. Windows users are becoming more and more like the Apple Lemmings. "If I don't have the newest, shiniest Iphone, my friends will shun me because they have" Does your PC/Laptop REALLY need HD graphics and be able to display a spread sheet a nano second faster than your current machine ? The majority of users probably could not care less as long as their machines boot and they can access browsers, Facebook, etc. Reply Tom Hawack August 31, 2016 at 1:11 pm # I agree on the idea of asking ourselves what we need, what we wish independently of a planetary marketing brain-washing aiming at disrupting our objectivity when answering the above questions. Remains the fact that one can disagree with a trend, a policy even if one doesn't feel concerned after having answered to the above questions in terms which mechanically remove oneself from the problematic. Being pragmatic may sometimes correspond, IMO, to an egocentric positioning, which is also an hidden aim of marketing policies. I don't know if this is what should be called political engagements, if so in the wide sens of the word, but I do believe that nowadays more than ever idealism is essential to balance an excessive pragmatism, excessive to the point that it may lead to an "after me, what the heck?". Idealism, not demagogy, realism rather than cynicism in fact. Realism is not to state that life is a jungle, realism is to consider that a human being is far more than a predator. Yuliya August 31, 2016 at 3:13 pm # I kind of agree. While performance is not going to be an issue any time soon, there's this thing - what if it breaks and I need to replace it? I'm going to have to buy something from the latest family of CPUs. I don't think I will find a new 3770k, it was released in 2012 or so. Again, I'm not too concerned of me not being able to run Win7 on whatever Intel comes up next with, because I know I will be able to do so. I think this is pure marketing b/s and scare tactics which micro$oft has been using for the past year in order to convince users to switch to their latest OS. Velocity.Wave September 2, 2016 at 6:51 am # I don't have to justify or explain to people like you TJ, why I want fast hardware/processors, multiple cores, and lots of RAM for my computing experience. I work hard for my money (a lot of hours), and I choose to spend it on faster hardware, which is valuable to me (but obviously not for you). Why it's so important for you to annoyingly preach and ridicule those who value progress in the IT sector is beyond me... but I suspect with your personality, you would have done well under an anti-progress governmental system like the old soviet-russia. Jorge August 31, 2016 at 8:36 am # 2 new computers in my place are already in Kubuntu and Mint. Installed different linux to check which one is usable and better. My laptop is Windows but it's because the Windows was included as freebie(the Single Language version). If I buy new laptop years later and if there's no more freebie, I would 100% likely to switch to linux. My only concern is my gaming computer.. games in linux is pretty much non existent.. Reply Al August 31, 2016 at 3:59 pm # I am on Manjaro Linux, which is a rolling release OS based on Arch. Any game I have so far tried without a native Linux option I have been able to get to work using PlayonLinux. But I don't play competitively and I don't go for first-person shooters, where milleseconds count. There is definitely a gap between when a new game shows up and when it is playable on linux. So hard-core gamers may have some issues. But I wouldn't say gaming is non-existent. Gaming is probably 30 percent of what I do on my linux. Reply mikef90000 September 1, 2016 at 4:30 am # Linux with an Xfce desktop should be very comfortable for most Windows immigrants. I keep XP and 2000 around for those few apps I haven't yet found a good equivalent for. My Edgerouter X and wireless access point even run versions of Linux. Not a gamer, but for games on Linux check out the Steam catalog. IIRC there was something like ~1500 available titles and rising. Reply Nebulus August 31, 2016 at 8:39 am # I believe that this is pure BS. In order for this to happen, those processors would have to miss something that would render the installation of older Microsoft OS impossible. And I don't see exactly what that "something" might be... On the other hand, I'm sure MS will only support them on Win10, but that means nothing for the end user; however, if you are a business and you WANT MS support, then you will have no choice but to install Win10. Reply Corky August 31, 2016 at 10:52 am # That something would, or could be graphics drivers, I've not looked into if the IGPU is changing much with Zen and Kaby lake but it seems a strong possibility, obviously we won't know until the chips hit the market if the GPU drivers will work with older OS's Reply Rob September 1, 2016 at 4:41 pm # As an IT professional that's worked at both front-end support all the way up to running the show and doing project and program management for around 15 years, not to mention dealt with Windows since its inception, I've only used MS support for re-activating Windows less than 5 times and that's all I've ever used MS support for. I realize I'm not everyone else, but the reason I don't use it is because its never useful in the first place. All it takes is looking at a handful of the many error messages you get as a user to see its not helpful in the least. You don't need their support. As I said in this thread, chip makers can try going down this path and already hurting sales will get much worse, faster.

Reply Corky August 31, 2016 at 9:38 am # Personally i blame the chip makers more than Microsoft, it is after all the chip maker who've made the decision not to develop drivers for their latest chips. Reply Tom Hawack August 31, 2016 at 11:32 am # My take on this is very simple. I do not, have never and will never accept to be forced. A partnership between a chip manufacturer and an OS developer appears to me as highly problematic. But in no way will I move to Win10 by obligation. It seems all winds are uniting to push me, us, many towards Linux. The lands of freedom are imprisoned whenever an agreement between two requirements aims to force either or both. The Scorpio syndrome as I call it, that is that when no escape is possible auto-destruction is considered a valid option, would be mine in that I'd rather abandon totally my computing environment than be obliged to choose Windows10 because a chip manufacturer. Fortunately Linux appears as the new promised land, the land of freedom. Microsoft, the story of an announced decline.

Reply The Flash September 1, 2016 at 1:41 pm # I don't think it's fair to compre Intel and AMD together. Intel is the one who sneaks all this NSA-backdoor shit, and AMD doesn't do that. AMD respects its customers more than Intel ever would. Reply olavmaltine August 31, 2016 at 3:35 pm # MS should start selling cars. They have the right people and the right attitude. Still, to be frank, I am completely baffled how MS ist getting away with their BS. It does not say too much about their customers. Seems the majority of them is swallowing everything MS throws at them. So, as painful as it is, I have to accept MS will succeed. What can I do about it ? Best is to take my time, there is no need for me to have the latest drivers, etc. Even right now I am only using a very small fraction of my computers capabilities. I don't need and don't want to talk to cortana, I have no desire to receive nightly phone calls from my refrigerator or washing machine and I truly give a big fat pups about synchronizing and the cloud. I am human and would like to stay that way. Reply Jeff August 31, 2016 at 6:15 pm # I'd wager "unsupported" means any new processor instruction extensions which the new CPUs use but which Windows 7 and 8 don't have pre-existing support for, won't be getting used on those OSes. Any software that takes advantage of these extensions will default to using x86_64 (or whatever other accelerated extensions are supported/appropriate). Zen/Kaby Lake are still going to be x86_64 CPUs. And Zen isn't going to be a non-traditional design requiring special software support for optimal performance like Bulldozer. Short of a giant-screw-you patch that explicitly and arbitrarily blocks Windows 7/8 from running on these specific CPUs, Windows 7/8 will run on these CPUs just fine, albeit without the absolute latest handful of acceleration extensions in use. And I wouldn't be surprised if at least AMD provided a driver for 7/8 filling in any gaps that Microsoft isn't willing to fill in themselves. Reply CJT August 31, 2016 at 7:16 pm # Considering how much time and money go into supporting legacy OSs, this will hopefully result in lower CPU/hardware prices in the future. Reply Martin Brinkmann August 31, 2016 at 7:26 pm # Probably unrelated, but Sony announced today that it will offer its new 4K streaming service for 7th Gen Intel Core processors exclusively starting in 2017: http://www.wirelessinsider.co/topics/sony-pictures-to-bring-premium-4k-movies-to-pcs-using-intel-7th-gen-processors/ Reply A different Martin August 31, 2016 at 10:06 pm # Well, according to a report recently released by IT consulting firm Softchoice, only 0.75% of Windows machines in the US and Canadian businesses they surveyed were running Windows 10 at the end of the year-long "free upgrade" period. Windows 7 was at 91% (an increase of 18% during 2015), XP was at 5%, and 8 was at 4%. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" was a big factor in the low adoption rate, but concerns about privacy, bugs, and actual upgrade costs (retraining, support, etc.) were mentioned as well. I don't know whether Softchoice ran into this in their survey sample, but some businesses also have specialized software that simply doesn't run on Windows 10. (I have a relative who works at a large medical research institution and they run important software that doesn't work on Win10. It's beginning to complicate purchases of replacement computers for the people who work there, with Skylake, and when Kaby Lake comes out and becomes mainstream, I expect it will get more complicated still.) When a consumer or business invests in an operating system environment -- the OS itself, the set-up, the applications, the utilities, the learning/training, etc. -- I think there is arguably a reasonable expectation that the OS manufacturer will endeavor to ensure that the OS will continue to be supported on mainstream hardware through the OS's stated end of life. In Windows 7's case, that's mid-January 2020, and for Windows 8.1, it's mid-January 2023 -- not in late 2015 when Skylake started hitting the shelves, or in late fall 2016 when Kaby Lake is expected to come out. It's up to courts and enforcement agencies to determine whether refusing to support Windows 7 and 8.1 on new hardware is a breach of contract, or an unfair or deceptive practice in trade, or a violation of antitrust law, but it does strike me as a unilateral changing of the previous understanding with customers mid-way through its term, by three vendors acting in concert. It's disturbing to me as an individual user, and if I were an enterprise customer, I would be furious and alarmed, and would question whether I should continue to put my eggs in Microsoft's basket in the future. Certainly, any business large enough to have an IT or computer support department, or even just a "computer guy" or two, should be considering a possible move to Linux. When it became clear that Microsoft was transitioning from selling software to selling subscriptions and user data, I realized that Windows 7 would be my last Microsoft OS and that I would switch to Linux. Being old, lazy, and set in my ways, I had hoped to defer the switch as long as possible, maybe even to January 2020. But if my computer dies and its replacement won't run 7, or if Microsoft slips adware, nagware, "spyware" (telemetry), or bugs into the aggregate security rollups it starts issuing in October, it's going to come sooner than I hoped. So, once again, I've started playing around with various Linux distros in VirtualBox, and I have to tell you, as an old, lazy, set-in-my-ways kind of guy, it's been a little frustrating. I know how to do pretty much everything I need to do in Windows 7, without thinking. I have to re-learn all that, and with each distro and desktop environment, the way of doing it is a little different. For example, in Linux Mint, I wanted to install some of my special Windows fonts. The easiest way of doing that is to browse the Windows Fonts folder from Linux and double-click on a font. "Font Viewer" is supposed to pop up and if you see that it is indeed the font you wanted, you click on the Install button. Except that in Linux Mint 18, Font Viewer is broken. There's a workaround, where you comment out a line in Font Viewer's configuration file. To do that, you need root (~Administrator) access, and I couldn't for the life of me find a way in the GUI to edit the configuration file as root or to launch the text editor as root. So I decided to log out and log back in as root. Except that by default, root was not offered as a logon at the Welcome screen. So I had to log back in under my username, change the Welcome screen options, log back out, log back in as root, edit Font Viewer's configuration file, log out and in again, and that was that. Easy peasy, right? I'm guessing I might face similar frustrations with Windows 10, but probably to a significantly lesser degree. [Sidebar: I avoided looking into command line options for a couple of reasons. First, I'm trying out Linux distros not just for myself but also for a friend who is an ordinary, non-computer-geek civilian. Second, my eyesight is going to hell and I'm working on a 15" laptop. The command line can be dangerous when you have trouble reading what you've typed. Some day, when I've vetted distros for genuine, all-GUI user-friendliness, and I have a humongous external monitor where I can scale up the display to my eyesight's content, I'll get into the CLI.] Also, working in a virtual environment creates its own set of hassles -- difficulty getting the right virtual machine "guest additions" installed in some distros (*COUGH* PCLinuxOS *COUGH* KaOS *COUGH*), very slow access to shared Windows folders containing a lot of files, general performance overhead, and the like. (That being said, I did manage to install and run IrfanView x64 and its plugins in Wine in Linux Mint 18 Cinnamon in VirtualBox on Windows 7! It was slow, but it worked!) Anyway, I'm committed enough that I just ordered a new drive to do some physical installs on so I can test my short-listed distros with all of my CPU cores, all of my RAM, and no virtual machine snags or slowdowns. (I'll be interested in seeing how IrfanView runs in Wine on that.) I'm probably going to continue grumbling for many months to come about having to re-learn how to do the dumbest, simplest things, and I'm probably going to miss some Windows-only utilities until I find decent Linux replacements for them and get used to them. But being able to choose what information gets sucked out of my machine and by whom, being able to choose what software I use and how I configure it -- I'm referring here to Windows 10 imperiously uninstalling, re-installing, or re-configuring certain apps and settings -- being able to choose exactly which individual updates I might want and whether and when to install them, being able to move my system to a different machine without reinstalling from scratch, etc., etc., etc. ... well, that's pretty appealing. (Come to think of it, except for being able to move the whole system to a different machine without reinstalling, it's kind of like Windows 7 used to be before telemetry and all-in-one rollups! It was a nice run, while it lasted...)

There are tons of them out there, most are high quality, dependable and really affordable. Reply A different Martin September 1, 2016 at 2:32 am # I'm typing this on a corporate-discard ThinkPad T510 right now! (I think it might be one of the last few ThinkPad series to have a keyboard that's designed for actual usability rather than for Mac-like esthetics, as the current ones are.) The thing is, I have a lot of data (on a 2TB internal drive), and I'm drooling at the prospect of USB 3.1 or Thunderbolt 3 transfer speeds to an external backup drive. (I have a USB 3.0 ExpressCard adapter, but it's limited to half the top USB 3.0 speed because of some bus limitation or other, and sometimes it "unmounts" -- not physically, but software-wise -- all on its own.) I'm not going to get USB 3.1 or Thunderbolt 3 support with Windows 7. I would get it with Windows 10, but that's a non-starter for me, so that's one more reason to switch to Linux (with a recent kernel) on Kaby Lake, or Skylake with extra hardware on board. But yes, for users who must remain with 7 or 8.1, refurbished and new-old-stock Haswell and Broadwell gear will be the answer if Microsoft, Intel, and AMD stick with their scheme not to support 7 and 8.1 on most new and future hardware. Jeez, you'd think Intel and AMD would have learned something from the drop in desktop and laptop sales when Microsoft introduced Windows 8. I guess we know who wears the pants in that business relationship...

Reply A different Martin September 1, 2016 at 7:41 am # Caveat: I'm not experienced or especially knowledgeable in this area, and I'm just giving a preliminary response until someone more expert chimes in. I know that recent versions of the Linux kernel explicitly support Skylake, and I assume the kernel developers are working on Kaby Lake support as we speak. However, from what I've read, "Secure Boot" on UEFI-based systems -- which is pretty much all of them now, right? -- at least used to be an obstacle to installing distros that didn't pay Microsoft to use a signed shim boatloader. I think I read that Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE, and Red Hat ponied up and can be installed and booted on Secure Boot systems without hassle, but don't quote me on it. Now, Microsoft used to mandate that its volume Windows 8 licensees (computer OEMs and VARs, or whatever) make it possible for users to disable Secure Boot in their UEFIs. In other words, it was possible for users to go into the UEFI and change a setting so that Secure Boot was disabled, making it possible to install any Linux distro (I think) that supported UEFIs. With Windows 10, Microsoft changed the volume licensing terms to make that optional -- i.e., they left it up to computer OEMs licensed to pre-install Windows 10 to decide whether to allow their customers/users to opt out of Secure Boot. I don''t know whether any OEMs went ahead and made Secure Boot mandatory, or whether it's been possible to flash any restrictive mainboards with a non-Secure-Boot UEFI. (I also don't know whether Microsoft offered any inducements to OEMs to lock out competing OSes by making Secure Boot mandatory. How unfairly cynical of me...) Anyway, I recently read that Secure Boot was discovered to be universally hackable, so if the hack is durable and isn't beyond the abilities of mere mortals, maybe Secure Boot is no longer an obstacle. (In my recent experiments, I think I ran into at least one distro that said it couldn't yet be installed on a GPT-format drive in a UEFI environment, but that sounds like it might be an entirely different issue. My computer has a BIOS and MBR drives, so I didn't follow it up.) At any rate, it would be great if someone who really knows this stuff would post an authoritative answer. In the meantime, if you're buying a new computer and want to be able to install any OS you want on it, make sure you can disable Secure Boot in its UEFI. (I think!) Reply Anonymous September 1, 2016 at 10:46 am # UEFI > another nonsense A different Martin September 2, 2016 at 9:01 am # @ Anonymous, re UEFI = nonsense: Well, GPT-format drives seem to be a big improvement over MBR drives. With GPT, you can have drives that are bigger than 2TB and that have more than just four primary partitions. I gather they offer much better corruption-recovery, too. GPT-format drives are better, and if you want to run GPT drives on a BIOS, especially under Windows, you're looking at a number of impossibilities, limitations, and potential complications and hassles. Practically speaking, if you want to partition, format, boot from, and run GPT drives, you're going to want a UEFI system. So, I don't think UEFI itself is necessarily nonsense, but if you read the "Criticism" section in Wikipedia's article "Unified Extensible Firmware Interface," it's pretty alarming for potential Linux users ... and most of that alarm stems from the Secure Boot feature. The computer's owner should be able to decide whether to require signed bootloaders and modules, not OEMs or Microsoft. If US antitrust and consumer protection law hadn't been consigned to the "quaint and antiquated" bin along with the Geneva Conventions against torture, the Federal Trade Commission and DOJ Antitrust Division should have been investigating Microsoft and co-operating OEMs for "exclusive dealing" in violation of the Clayton Act several years ago. I guess we'll have to leave enforcement to European antitrust authorities ... if they haven't been neutered, cowed, or corrupted, too. Anonymous September 2, 2016 at 2:48 pm # I understand your point about UEFI, mine is something claiming to be secure helping criminals using ransonware to f*** you is a nonsense. When the European Commission will be too corrupted, when lobbies and states (like USA with the TAFTA) will try by all means to impose on European States what they don't want such as OGM, hormone treated beef or chlorinated chickens, the abolition of all AOC, etc etc, it will be the explosion of the Europe. The General and Final Brexit. Anonymous September 2, 2016 at 3:19 pm # Poor Europe attacked by its "Best Friend"... unfortunately as already in past, if USA continue in that way, many wars in perspective in Europe at the end. It seems hawks and cowboys trying to continue to impose their "NEW WORLD ORDER" initiated by Reagan & Thatcher had learned nothing from the Moyen-Orient. Poor USA too. Tom Hawack September 2, 2016 at 4:10 pm # @Anonymous, There are always disagreements. I'm not sure focusing on the States is the right approach. I'd rather consider a country's foreign policy relatively to its power. If you think about it, given the super-power of the USA, their hegemony could be expressed more wildly than it actually is. We can wonder on what would be the behavior of our respective countries if they were in the position of the economical and military leader on the planet. I thought bashing the USA was over, not because the country is faultless but because, when you know the culture, the values of America you get to understand that liberty associated to justice is not, there as anywhere, obvious. Moreover the nation, the people and the establishment are, there as everywhere, two different entities and happen to diverge. But freedom of speech prevails, freedom to disagree and freedom to strive to change the country are a fact and are active. The USA are and remain Europe's friend, I believe it truly. There is no conspiracy, occult powers, there is only a country where freedom is lived totally, for the best and for the worst. Politics, establishment aside, I love American people. I'm not saying you don't, I'm only saying that we are now in a new era where, I believe, another approach than discrimination is making its way to understand before criticizing, and when critics remain and they often do, to consider that duality with time, good will and intellectual and moral honesty inevitably leads to evolution and progress. Minds are changing.

Tom Hawack September 2, 2016 at 6:39 pm # @Anonymous, may I ask you in what, if applicable, the matters you describe impact you personally? We know what you mention, this is the lot of freedom and what is done of it by many of us, though when one's position and responsibilities are high anything considered valuable or bad becomes the flag of many to legitimate convictions built around demagogy. I'm not saying you are a demagogue, only that whatever speech that emphasizes on negative critics without pondering them with good ones may quickly be perceived as demagogy, when not as built-in hatred. I've already had this debate with a Frenchman here, yapadkoi if I remember correctly. This leads nowhere and is moreover off-topic. Perhaps I shouldn't have interfered but I just cannot remain silent when I hear certain things, arguments (or their lack) rather than ideas. Long live ideas, pluralism, diversity (the pot of America) but they must be served, IMO, with built arguments and a certain style in their presentation. Anonymous September 2, 2016 at 7:28 pm # @Tom Hawack "Demagogy"... "and a certain style in their presentation".

Anonymous September 2, 2016 at 10:41 pm # @Tom Hawack "the matters you describe impact you personally?" To be frank, to answer to your interrogation and to close this off-topic discussion, among other arrogant big brothers' enterprises more for philosophical reasons, my resentment is old, very old. It is adressed principally to the Petroleum US Consortium due to the Torrey Canyon's Disaster, and also later the Amoco Cadiz's oil spill. This disaster for a large part ruined our lives. Not even a word of apology, i prefer not to give my opinion on the americans judges who treated us like dogs during years and years discussing on our pittance. We'll never forget.

Why not mention instead "arrogant enterprises"? It's not a matter of "Big Brother", it is when applicable the fact of certain companies (by the way often so-called multinationals). That in itself is a debate. Do you think other companies than American are saints, perfect, committed to ethics and the bad ones would be bad because and only when American? Are all French talkative and slip off the topic because this is my characteristic? If I get punched by a Chinese will I say Chinese are violent? If I get chatted up ("dragué" in French) by a native of Monaco will I return to Nice declaring that Monaco males are gay? Generalizing is, IMO, a psychological temptation or a soul's deliberate intention to use demagogy in order to spread theories. I understand your experience, the drama you've described, but I am and will always be bothered with explanations which go beyond a responsibility to stick them with hierarchical groups which most often are not related in terms of causality. This is why I consider the person in front of me rather than his/her context, this is why I deeply dislike social and political theories based, built upon what remains a personal responsibility. Anonymous September 3, 2016 at 5:14 pm # @Tom Hawack Me > "to close this off-topic discussion": You: "To FINISH closing this off-topic debate". Then: "Why not (...)?, then "Do you think (...)?" etc. My "personal responsibility" is to tell you "To (really) finish closing this off-topic debate" you must be in agreement with your affirmations and not erect your contradictions as a perpetual what you call "debate".

I expect to "own" the PC I bought but Micro$oft, Nvidia and AMD think differently. So, please, could any ARM Developer create a league with some minor taiwanese/indonesian microprocessors builder and give us all FREEDOM? It all comes down to Five Eyes, often abbreviated as FVEY, and the mass monitoring of the gullible customers. BIOS, GPU, CPU, Browsers... All is tailored to make you a customer, a buyer, a wallet to be stolen. Wake up! Reply Graham September 4, 2016 at 12:39 am # It means it's only supported on Windows 10. ;) Reply Jason September 13, 2016 at 12:42 am # Just to be clear, SecureBoot currently can be disabled. Also, a lot of Linux distros offer UEFI support out of the box. These technologies so far have not proven to be impediments to installing Linux. However, SecureBoot itself may become an impediment in the future if OEMs stop allowing the user to disable it. But in that scenario, we can expect (a) not all OEMs will go down that path, (b) there will be non-volume hardware sales that do not have SecureBoot, and (c) the Linux community will hack the **** out of SecureBoot.

Intel, one of the world’s largest computer chip manufacturers, has just unveiled its seventh generation of Intel Core CPUs. Last year’s Skylake chips represented a huge leap in performance for Intel’s chips, bringing new microarchitecture to Intel’s 14nm process. Kaby Lake won’t be quite the same stratospheric leap, offering up performance improvements and optimisations over Skylake’s year-old architecture. Feeling a little lost? Don’t worry, CPU chat is always a little bit too dry and flaccid. Instead of boring you with new clock speeds, power improvements and snazzy buzzwords, you really just want to know if it’s worth finally taking the plunge on a new Intel-powered device after years of waiting to upgrade to “something better”. 5 things Intel’s Kaby Lake Intel Core CPU can do for your PC 1. It’s faster and more power-efficient than ever Not only does Intel claim Kaby Lake is 70% faster than five-year-old Intel Core M architecture, it’s also going to bring about a whole new range of ultra-powerful, ultra-thin devices. This means you’ll find traditional laptops and convertibles thinner than 10mm, and detachable 2-in-1s coming in at less than 7mm thick – that’s thinner than an iPad Air. 2. 4K laptops finally make sense There’s nothing worse than sitting down to watch a film on your laptop only to find out it’s going to run out of juice well before the end. What’s the point of a portable device if you have to plug it in to use it the way you want to? With Kaby Lake, Intel says it’s done away with battery-life woes. Put it this way, a current 4K laptop, such as the HP EliteBook Folio G1 will finally be useful when equipped with a Kaby Lake processor. Intel’s benchmarks show that you’ll get seven hours of 4K playback time compared to the four hours a Skylake chip in the same laptop would offer. That’s 1.75 times more efficient than before. This also means that 1080p playback will see significant improvements in terms of power usage and, any notebook combined with the power of Nvidia’s new laptop-ready GTX chips, will see better battery life when playing games in 1080p. 3. It’s better for creatives YouTubers and professional home-movie makers can rejoice as Kaby Lake is better for those who love to get their creative juices flowing. While drawing comparisons to a five-year-old PC is a little unfair when it comes to 4K image processing (because who did that five years ago?) Kaby Lake is capable of quick 4K encoding and editing and can apparently “beautify 1,400 photos in one minute”. You’ll also be able to stream and save multiple pieces of video content with ease, and access 4K 360-degree video streams. Kaby Lake is also capable of decoding HEVC 10-bit content, meaning it’s completely 4K-ready so your Ultra HD Netflix account and 4K YouTube videos will look as beautiful as they should. It’ll also support the full-colour palette for 4K, meaning... 4. Games will look and run better than ever Playing games on a laptop that relies upon Intel’s integrated graphics for power is far from ideal, but with Kaby Lake, Intel's improvements to its Skylake Gen9 architecture means 3D games run smoother than ever before. Intel claims its chips are capable of playing Overwatch in HD (presumably 1080p, but who knows) while on the go. Kaby Lake’s “Turbo Boost 2 Technology” should also mean you get increased graphical performance when you need it, as the processor drives power to where it’s needed most.

If you use Skylake, don’t worry about upgrading just yet Despite Kaby Lake offering up “12% increased productivity”, “19% increased web performance” and a slew of new features versus Skylake, those of you who went out and bought Intel’s new chip – or a laptop equipped with one – probably don’t need to worry about upgrading. Not only are the stated improvements based on five-year-old PC hardware, but Kaby Lake is only an overhaul of existing technologies. Next year’s Cannonlake is where we’ll see an improvement to chipset power, and this should really be the next chip update serious PC users should consider moving to. Granted, these are only the mobile chips, so when it comes to Kaby Lake’s fuller-power desktop CPUs, we’ll have to wait and see if the performance boosts are really worth the extra cost.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Intel officially launched its long-promised 7th Gen Intel Core processor (aka Kaby Lake) on Tuesday. The new chip is set to power over 100 new laptops and hybrid devices this year, potentially including new Apple MacBook laptops and Microsoft Surface products. The Kaby Lake uses the same 14nm processor as last year’s 6th Gen Intel Core, but squeezes in even more power. The company says it should offer 19 percent faster web performance, 14 percent faster productivity performance, and three times better battery life while watching 4K video. The new design will also allow for slimmer laptop designs moving forward. Hopefully, this means Apple can finally upgrade its MacBook Pro and MacBook Air lineups now that Intel’s new chip is official. The company is expected to announce a new laptop design this fall, though it apparently won’t be at the upcoming iPhone-focused event on September 7. Microsoft could also use Kaby Lake to power a new generation of Surface products, including the rumored Surface Book 2 and Surface Pro 5. Intel says the Kaby Lake chip will expand to desktop PCs early next year. As for the Cannonlake, which is expected to be a pretty significant upgrade using a new 10nm process, we’re still expecting it to arrive sometime in 2017.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 30, 2016 at 5:22PM Image source: Intel.  Over the last five to six years, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) talked quite a lot about its efforts to become a major player in the market for processors and related components targeted at smartphones and tablets. Followers of the company's mobile strategy know that it was a spectacular failure. Intel couldn't deliver competitive products at the breakneck pace required to succeed in the market. As a result, as part of restructuring actions announced earlier this year, Intel cancelled all of the mobile processors that it had previously told investors to expect to come to market. At this point, it looked as though the company had effectively exited the market for smartphone processors altogether, opting instead to focus on building stand-alone modems with the aim of winning business at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, at a recent investor conference, an Intel executive indicated that Intel would eventually be back in the smartphone processor game. In this column, I would like to outline what I believe would be a winning strategy for the company in the mobile market. A three-pronged approach Intel's ultimate goal in mobile is to generate the heftiest return possible for its shareholders; this means keeping spending down and revenues (and gross profit margins) high. To that end, the company can go after this market in the following three key ways: contract chip manufacturing, sales of stand-alone modems, and sales of integrated applications processor and modem products. Let's take a look at what Intel's strategy could be in each of these segments. Contract chip manufacturing, but not for everybody I don't think Intel is particularly well set up to become a truly general purpose contract chip manufacturer. Where I think Intel can add value is for customers that are potentially willing to pay more in order to get better performance/power consumption than they otherwise could have from one of Intel's competitors (assuming that Intel's technology can remain superior to what the competition offers). Intel already announced that it will build chips for LG, and there are rumblings that Intel may be trying to win at least some of Apple's A-series chip business at some point down the line. I don't think Intel should (or, frankly, could) build chips for all of the mobile chip companies. However, if Intel is serious about this business, and if its technology is really ahead of the competition's, then going after high end mobile chip customers -- particularly ones that don't compete with Intel's own product lines -- could be a nice way for Intel to profit from mobile. The stand-alone modem opportunity When the tear-downs for Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 come in, many expect that Intel will supply modems for some of the models. As far as smartphones go, Apple is really the only company that still relies on stand-alone modems rather than on modems integrated into the same piece of silicon as the applications processor. As long as Apple continues to use such stand-alone modems, and as long as Intel builds competitive modems for this market, the iPhone could represent a nice opportunity for the chipmaker to try to profit from the mobile market. That said, this is the most "fragile" of the mobile opportunities in front of Intel. If Apple ever builds up a competent modem team and decides to integrate the modem into its applications processors, then Intel's iPhone-related revenue will go to zero within a couple of product generations. Integrated applications processors and modems As Intel's modems gain credibility in the marketplace, there may be an opportunity for the chip-maker to take those modems and integrate them into applications processors targeted at low-end and mid-range smartphones. In fact, I would imagine such applications processors would be fairly generic, packing ARM Cortex A-series processor cores, graphics and media engines from either ARM or Imagination, and a few in-house technologies (such as the image signal processor, memory controller, and modem). If these chips can meet the performance/power/feature requirements of low-end and mid-range smartphones, Intel could probably bring in a reasonable amount of revenue for a relatively small incremental investment. Intel shouldn't bother trying to build in-house chips for the high-end of the smartphone market. These chips tend to be more difficult/complex to produce and the market for them is quite small and increasingly dominated by in-house processor designs. Going after this segment via foundry is the smarter approach. Why this strategy could succeed Intel's prior strategy was to try to build products targeted at every segment of the smartphone market while relying on in-house technology. The strategy, for a number of reasons, clearly failed. What I have outlined above would have a much better chance of succeeding simply because it plays to Intel's strengths. Intel is a world-class chip manufacturer and it is becoming increasingly good at building modems. Attacking the high-end of the market by building other people's chip designs for them solves several problems that Intel faced previously: One problem that Intel faced is that it simply couldn't read the market properly and as such didn't wind up designing chips that were competitive in that segment. By letting mobile experts worry about defining the chip's features, Intel no longer has to deal with trying to predict future market trends. Another problem that Intel would have faced at the high end of the smartphone market, had it actually built competitive products, is that much of this market is held captive by Apple's own A-series processors, as well as in-house efforts from Samsung, Huawei, and others. Intel isn't going to win over Samsung (Samsung is a direct chip manufacturing competitor to Intel), but it could conceivably win over other customers. For the low-end of the market, Intel could leverage a lot of third party technologies in order to bring chips to market fairly quickly. Intel's main points of differentiation here would be the modem as well as the performance/power characteristics of its manufacturing technology. In this case, Intel would again have the benefit of not having to try to predict the future as it would presumably work with ARM and other third-party technology providers to do much of the heavy lifting. Intel's job would be to essentially bundle these technologies with its modems and manufacture them. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Called internally as 'Kaby Lake', the new processors are based on Intel's 14nm (or 14nm+) architecture and are a refined version of last year's 'Skylake' series. The buzzword this year for Intel is 4K, with the company having geared the processors for 4K media consumption and creation. If you're a desktop user and are wondering what's the big deal about 4K encode/decoding then it's worth noting that these new chipsets are primarily aimed at notebook and all-in-one computers, that often come without dedicated GPU and can get all the help they can need for high resolution media processing. According to Intel, the 7th generation processors are more than 70% faster CPU performance and 3.5x faster 3D graphics performance than a 5-year old PC. Compared to the previous generation Skylake, Kaby Lake provides 12% faster productivity performance and 19% faster web performance. Inclusion of HEVC 10-bit and VP9 decode help improve 4K UHD content playback. Intel claims 1500% faster times for creating and editing 4K UHD files. The new processors also come with support native for Thunderbolt 3 over USB Type-C, with 40Gbps bandwidth, dual 4K 60Hz monitor support, 100W power output, external graphics, and Thunderbolt networking support, all over a single cable. You also get support for Gen 3 PCIe support, supporting higher data transfer rates of 8 GT/s versus 5 GT/s with PCIe Gen 2. Intel is also claiming improved battery life, with 3x battery life improvement claimed over local 4K UHD video playback. The chips also run cooler, enabling more fanless designs. With today's announcement, Intel has announced the first six processors from the new series. Three of the parts (Kaby Lake-Y) have a 4.5W TDP and are meant primarily for tablets and 2-in-1 devices with dual core CPU and HD 615 GPU, and the remaining three (Kaby Lake-U) parts have a TDP of 15W and are meant for notebooks with dual core CPUs and HD 620 GPU. The Y series parts include an i7, i5, and m3 processor each, and the U series parts include an i7, i5, and i3. We will be seeing manufactures coming out with new products based on these new processors, possibly even Apple, in the coming months.

Like some of Intel's past CPU launches, low-power SKUs in the 4.5W to 15W range are coming to the market first, with Intel expecting the release of more than 100 designs in Q4 2016. More powerful Kaby Lake variants, including SKUs for desktops and high-performance notebooks, will be unveiled in January 2017. As expected, Kaby Lake is Intel's third processor line manufactured using a 14nm process. However, Intel has made some tweaks to their 14nm process to improve the performance of their CPUs, including improved fin profile and transistor channel strain. These factors help deliver a 12 percent process performance improvement, which brings superior performance and energy efficiency to Kaby Lake when combined with architectural gains. So what sort of performance gains are we looking at? Intel likes to obfuscate performance data in their press material, but it seems Kaby Lake brings around 25 percent better performance per watt than Skylake. Intel is also reporting double digit gains when comparing the new Core i7-7500U to the Core i7-6500U – 12% better "productivity" and 19% better web performance – although part of these gains can be attributed to Kaby Lake's higher clock speeds rather than pure IPC improvements. We'll have to wait until we can get some hands-on time with new Kaby Lake notebooks to see how real-world performance stacks up to last-generation products. One of the major upgrades that Intel has made in Kaby Lake is an improved media engine built upon the company's Gen9 graphics architecture. The Multi-Format Codec (MFX) has been upgraded to support the latest media standards, including 4K 10-bit HEVC decode/encode, 10-bit VP9 decode, and 8-bit VP9 encode. The Video Quality Engine (VQE) also sees improvements, bringing HDR tone mapping and Wide Color Gamut (Rec.2020) support. Intel has targeted power efficiency while designing the new media engine, which allows Y-series parts to support 4Kp30 HEVC encodes in real time. Power usage data shows significant decreases during 4K 10-bit HEVC and 4K VP9 YouTube playback on the Core i7-7500U compared to the i7-6500U, which will lead to increased battery life. Speed Shift technology has been improved in Kaby Lake as well, which allows 7th-generation parts to reach their maximum frequency in just 15 miliseconds. Reaching maximum clock speeds in a shorter amount of time translates into better performance and faster task completion. So far, Intel has announced six Kaby Lake SKUs: three 4.5W Y-series parts, and three 15W U-series parts. What we know about these CPUs is listed in the table below: Model Cores / Threads Base Frequency (GHz) Single-Core Turbo Frequency (GHz) Memory TDP Core i7-7Y75 2/4 1.3 3.6 Dual Channel DDR3L 1600 MHz LPDDR3 1866 MHz 4.5W Core i5-7Y54 1.2 3.2 Core m3-7Y30 1.0 2.6 Core i7-7500U 2.7 3.5 Dual Channel DDR3L 1600 MHz LPDDR3 1866 MHz DDR4 2133 MHz 15W Core i5-7200U 2.5 3.1 Core i3-7100U 2.4 N/A We should be hearing more about new Kaby Lake notebooks and convertibles over the coming days, with availability slated for Q4 2016.

Lifkin Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 1:28 pm | כ"ו אב תשע"ו Intel in Israel employs around 10,000 workers in its Kiryat Gat production center and in four development centers, in Haifa, Yakum, Yerushalayim and Petach Tikvah. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - Israeli high tech basked in the limelight of innovation on Tuesday as Intel unveiled its 7th generation core processor chip, largely a product of the company’s R&D center in Haifa. “The Israeli team did it again,” proclaimed Intel Israel’s head of R&D Ran Senderovit. “I think this is one of the great points of pride for Israeli technology,” he added. “This product will be sold to millions of users around the world.” The high-tech sector has been eulogized in recent months as a has-been of the startup nation, and the news will give it a much-needed boost. The new chip boasts a 12 percent rise in computer performance, longer battery life and better security. The Intel Core enhanced 14-nanometer-plus processor, called Kaby Lake, is its “strongest and fastest ever,” Intel said in a statement. It was built on the foundation of the Skylake processors, which the company launched last year and were also led from Israel. The Kaby Lake processors are more than 70 percent faster than a 5-year-old PC and 3.5 times better in 3D graphics performance, the company said. Kaby Lake will have a longer-lasting battery — 9.5 hours of 4K video playback — and better security, and will enable more natural and intuitive interactions of users with their PCs, Intel said. The chips are set for inclusion in products starting in September, and in 100 million devices on sale through 2016. They will be specially marked with labels identifying them as 7th generation chips.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Intel reportedly wooing Apple as a customer for its ARM foundry business Intel reportedly wooing Apple as a customer for its ARM foundry business By Joel Hruska on August 30, 2016 at 11:30 am Comment Well, that didn’t take long. Less than two weeks after Intel announced it would fab chips for LG as part of a new deal to build ARM products directly at Intel, there are rumors that Intel and Apple have sat down to talk about a similar deal between Cupertino and Santa Clara. Reports indicate that new chips could come as early as 2018, though we’d take that with a grain of salt — even when companies eventually shift suppliers, as Apple did by moving to Samsung from TSMC, it can take years just to iron out the contracts. The Nikkei Asian Review reports that Apple is already trying to nick Apple from TSMC, for all the obvious reasons. Pulling in Apple’s business would give Intel’s custom foundry division instant credibility and establish it as a force to be reckoned with. “TSMC could face tough competition as soon as 2018 or 2019 as Intel is likely to gain orders from Apple by then,” Samuel Wang, a veteran semiconductor analyst at research company Gartner, told the Nikkei Asian Review. “Intel has begun to engage with Apple and it aims to grab one or two top-tier customers from TSMC.” Intel, TSMC, and Samsung feature sizes at 14nm. Intel leads the market, but can it translate that leadership to advantages for its customers? Whether or not Intel can grab those customers successfully will depend on whether or not it can adapt its foundry technology and practices to service a very different set of clients. As we covered when Intel canceled its smartphone and tablet chips, Intel already took a serious go at this. Intel’s cost structures weren’t designed to serve the same markets where TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries find their customers, and the company had difficulty finding a business model for Atom that actually earned it enough money to make competing in the segment profitable. As for why Apple would want to forge a relationship with Intel, Chipzilla’s foundry knowledge may be to valuable to resist. While TSMC and Samsung have continued to push their own roadmaps, their upcoming 10nm products will apparently be hybridized designs — we’ve heard rumors of 10/20nm, though other sources have stuck to 10/14nm. Either way, Intel is likely to maintain a lead in terms of absolute foundry technology — they’ve still got the only full 14nm die shrink, and they’ll have the only 10nm shrink as well. The big question is, can Intel turn its foundry prowess into income for itself and its various customers? Apple is undoubtedly interested in Santa Clara’s foundry technology, it’d be a fool not to explore the possibility — but Intel will have to demonstrate that it can deliver the goods that Apple wants. Right now, 10nm chips from Santa Clara are expected in mid-2017, with 7nm not anticipated until 2019 or 2020. 2018 is probably the earliest we’d see chips from an Intel / Apple deal and it wouldn’t surprise us to see that date slip.

Looks like history's repeating itself this time around. Credit: Apple More like this When will Apple put Intel’s Kaby Lake chips inside new Macs? Thoughts on Apple’s MacBook Pro touchscreen plan 13 reasonable iPad Pro 2 rumors Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Reports of the death of the platform have, it seems, been exaggerated and Apple is about to answer the prayers of millions of Mac users with a rash of significant hardware improvements, announcing some of these this year. Mac attack It can’t come soon enough. Mac users have become anxious concerning Apple’s commitment to its PC platform. They feel that the company hasn’t been focusing on innovation and improvement for its machines. With no significant improvement made since 2013, how else should the company’s Mac Pro users feel? There has also been lots of speculation concerning any Apple plans to deploy Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, with some reports going so far as to claim the chip may not appear in Macs at all.   With no significant upgrades across most Mac models, there is no surprise that Mac sales have dropped in response. Apple has left Mac users wilting on the vine. Time for change Time is money for Apple’s pro users, particularly those of us whose tax liability exceeds the estimated 0.005 percent the world’s most profitable company thinks it ethical to pay. Performance and productivity demands mean Mac pros have wanted their Macs to be pro, and some have begun migrating elsewhere on strength of the company’s perceived lack of innovation in recent years. Things are about to change. Apple is preparing to introduce a range of new Macs this year, with major improvements across its iPad range planned for 2017. “The refreshed Mac hardware line includes new versions of the iMac desktop, MacBook Air laptop, and a 5K standalone monitor in collaboration with LG Electronics Inc., in addition to a thinner MacBook Pro laptop,” Bloomberg reports. This is also where we can expect to see the new MacBook Pro with a touchstripe controller. Late 2016 “The Macs are expected as soon as late 2016,” Bloomberg explains. That’s great news for Mac users, as it means we can get a little reassurance as to the value of the Mac platform to Apple and its future strategy. And we may even see these machines ship with more memory than before. That Apple plans to introduce these products before year’s end opens up an interesting possibility in light of recent claims concerning the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Speaking at the Intel Developer Forum, Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich promised the first systems containing these new chips would ship this fall. However, it has previously been claimed Kaby Lake chips suitable for use in iMacs, Mac minis and portable Macs won’t appear until next year. This may still be true – Apple may simply announce new models of these machines promising to ship them in the new tax year. It may also be true that Kaby Lake chips suitable for use in Mac Pro systems will be available. A new Mac Pro seems possible So, will Apple introduce a new Mac Pro this year? It seems possible, given Bloomberg’s claim that Apple is developing a 5K monitor with LG. Why wouldn’t you want an amazing monitor with your new and amazing pro Mac? You already have a 5K monitor in your iMac. Hopefully Apple will use this event as an opportunity to put the latest and greatest processors inside of Macs. The company hasn’t really kept pace in this. “The only Apple laptop computer with the sixth generation Skylake processor is the 2016 12-inch MacBook. The Mid 2015 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro uses the fourth generation Haswell processor. The late 2015 iMac has Skylake desktop-class processors,” says AppleInsider. Apple’s macOS illustrates its continued commitment to the OS, but putting the most powerful processors inside its most expensive Mac seems a no brainer. Just make sure you don’t spend all your money on new iOS kit this September. Google+?

[x] Countdown to 2017 with HEXUS and ARM [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU Laptop News 13 Intel launches 'Kaby Lake' 7th generation Core CPUs for laptops by Mark Tyson on 30 August 2016, 16:00 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qac6a3 Add to My Vault: Intel today launched the first chips in its highly anticipated 'Kaby Lake' 7th generation Core processor family. This initial selection of Y-Series and U-Series chips is destined for laptops and other compact form factor devices. In the headline improvements Intel promises "more responsive performance than ever before," efficient 4K entertainment viewing/streaming, gaming on the go, the thinnest and lightest devices ever and improved I/O support. In an email to HEXUS, Intel supplied some broad performance improvements stats for the new processors. To add numbers to its 'faster and more responsive' claims, Intel says that a 14nm+ 7th Gen Intel Core processor delivers up to 12 per cent faster productivity performance, and up to 19 per cent faster web performance, over the previous generation Skylake chips. 4K video Perhaps an even greater improvement comes for those who like to, or wish to, consume 4K content. Intel's 7th generation Core processors facilitate the creation, editing and sharing of 4K UHD and 360-degree clips up to 15 times faster than a 5 year old PC, thanks to the new media engine (Intel Core i5-7200U vs. Intel Core i5-2467M). Efficiency is perhaps more impressive with Kaby Lake portables capable of watching over 9 hours of 4K content on a single charge. The new Core i7-7500U has a CPU utilisation rate of around 5 per cent and power usage of 0.5 watts when playing local 4K video, for example. The new chips manage this feat with hardware encoding and decoding for 10-bit HEVC 4K video and 8 to 10-bit VP9 video. Furthermore Kaby Lake supports the Dolby Vision and HDR10 HDR standards for a greater colour gamut. Gaming Beyond the impact from the double digit general computing performance hike, those who rely upon integrated graphics could see significant gains with Kaby Lake. Again compared to a five year old PC, the new Kaby Lake chips can provide a threefold increase in frame rates in modern games titles. Intel provides an example of playing Overwatch smoothly "anytime and anywhere on a thin, light laptop". If you need 'moar powah' Intel reckons that there will be many more devices provided with Thunderbolt 3 which can facilitate external GPUs. I/O options Both Y- and U-Series chips support Gen 3 PCIe for faster compact fixed storage options. The aforementioned Thunderbolt 3 connector will become more prevalent and it can do much more than external gaming graphics, providing multi-screen connections, mouse, keyboard, even up to 100W AC power supply, plus USB speed of up to 40Gbps. If you are interested in specific processors in the Y- and U-Series, Intel details three of each in its fact sheet PDF, all of which are configured as 2C/4T designs (listed on page 10 and 11). Designs featuring the new mobile 7th gen Intel processors will start to become available in September. Intel says that it has over 100 design wins for 2-in-1s and laptop products scheduled for release before Xmas. For desktop Intel Kaby Lake chips, which many HEXUS readers will be most interested in, we will have to wait until January for official details and a launch.

Credit: Intel More like this Kaby Lake starts strong as Intel retools PC strategy Intel's Kaby Lake chips will include integrated 4K graphics processors Intel ships Kaby Lake chips, pointing to PC availability in a few months Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles New chips can be a reason to upgrade PCs. But does Intel's latest 7th Generation Core chip, code-named Kaby Lake, have enough bite to trigger replacements of old PCs? Intel hopes so. The company is framing Kaby Lake PCs as go-to devices for productivity, virtual reality, and 4K gaming and video. So far, Kaby Lake is off to a good start. About 100 laptops, 2-in-1s, and tablets with Kaby Lake installed will be available from PC makers by the end of this year. On paper, Kaby Lake's launch comes at an inopportune time. PC shipments are slumping, the replacement cycle has slowed to six years, and consumers are instead using smartphones and phablets for computing. Many older PCs are powerful enough to run Windows 10. Intel can't escape the overall decline in PC shipments, so it is focusing on the growing segments of 2-in-1s, gaming PCs, and virtual reality. It's also betting that Kaby Lake will aid in the revival of the PC, with the sudden emergence of VR. Kaby Lake is faster and more power-efficient than its predecessor, called Skylake. It is also the first Intel PC chip with native 4K graphics support, and that feature is especially important to the company's fast-emerging virtual reality and mixed reality plans. Intel may also have some surprises up its sleeve with Kaby Lake. There's a good chance that the Core processors make their way into an odd VR headset or two that need 4K graphics. For potential buyers, it may be worth upgrading to a sleek hybrid laptop-tablet PC with Kaby Lake if your current laptop feels slow. The Kaby Lake CPUs are 12 to 19 percent faster than Skylake. Applications will run better, and battery life of laptops will improve. Kaby Lake's graphics features stand out, with laptops able to play 4K video without the need for a discrete graphics card. Laptops will run continuously for 9.25 hours when running 4K video, said Chris Walker, vice president of Intel's Client Computing Group and general manager of Mobility Client Platforms. You'll be able to stream 4K video from the internet, and casual 4K games will run smoothly. The 4K support will be included on chips from the lowest-powered 2-in-1 Core chips drawing 4.5 watts to the 15-watt chips for mainstream PCs. The first batch of Kaby Lake chips will be targeted at Windows 10 PCs. There will be no Windows 7 PCs with Kaby Lake, Walker said. For Windows 10 laptops, Intel is hyping the "Windows Hello" features, in which biometric authentication techniques can be used to log into PCs.  In January, Intel will release a new batch of heavy-hitting Kaby Lake PC chips that will service VR headsets like Oculus Rift, which are attached to high-end PCs. Those chips will also be targeted at gaming PCs. Around that time, gamers should be able to get their hands on super-fast Intel SSDs called Optane, based on a groundbreaking 3D Xpoint technology. Over time, Kaby Lake will be installed in Intel's thumb-sized Compute Sticks and mini-desktops called NUCs. The chip will support Chrome OS, Walker said, meaning Kaby Lake will also be available for Chromebooks. Intel's PC future also includes VR and augmented reality headsets, though details on the chip strategy for those devices are grainy. The company doesn't make chips specifically for headsets, but some use PC-based, low-power Atom and Core chips.  At the recent Intel Developer Forum, Intel stunned the audience with its Project Alloy mixed reality headset. It included a Core chip code-named Skylake, and the device gave a subtle hint on the direction of Intel's PC chips. To be certain, the Project Alloy headset was a prototype, and its specifications aren't finalized. But it raises a question: Will VR and AR headsets have Kaby Lake chips someday? Intel made no promises, but it's a possibility. "Many of the power-performance attributes that 7th Generation [chips] have could be used in the future," Walker said. Specifications for Alloy will be released later. Alloy will use Windows Holographic, and possibly other platforms, to run AR applications. Intel's low-end Core Y processors, which consume 4.5 watts of power, could be used in headsets. They can handle 4K graphics, critical for VR headsets. The headsets won't match the experience of an Oculus Rift, but the performance should be good enough to stream movies from the internet. Beyond content consumption, Kaby Lake PCs could be powerful content creation tools for VR and AR by using hardware-based 4K graphics encoding and decoding. Kaby Lake is the third Intel PC chip made using the 14-nanometer process after Broadwell and Skylake. It broke the tradition of Intel making two PC chips per manufacturing process. Manufacturing problems forced Intel to add Kaby Lake to 14-nm and slow down its advance to the next-generation 10-nm manufacturing process. Manufacturing issues or not, Intel plans to deliver a new PC chip each year. The successor to Kaby Lake will be the 10-nm chip code-named Cannonlake, slated for release in 2017.

In today's announcement -- focused on the speed and 4K UHD support the new CPUs provide -- Intel officially unveiled its first Y-Series and U-Series processors, which could be included in future Retina MacBook and MacBook Air updates, respectively. The new Kaby Lake processors (prepared as a mid-generation update ahead of Intel's Cannonlake processors) offer a moderate upgrade on earlier Skylake chips, with Intel focusing on the user benefits of its 7th Generation Core processors. These advantages namely include: 4K ultra-HD video streaming, 360-videos, and more intensive graphical performance for video games on smaller computers. In addition to gaining access to 4K content from services like YouTube and Netflix, Kaby Lake will grant users the power to create and edit their own 4K content with speeds up to 8x faster than a five-year-old PC. Kaby Lake was manufactured using an upgraded version of Intel's 14-nanometer process, referred to as 14nm+, which the company claims has produced a processor with 12 percent faster productivity performance and up to 19 percent faster web performance over previous generations. Everyday users will see these manifested in smooth app switching, even within performance-heavy apps like 4K video editing software, and basic battery life improvements. In this department, Kaby Lake will bring up to 9.5 hours of playback on 4K videos in any computer it's found in this fall. The release of Kaby Lake will mark Intel's first processor released after the company abandoned its tick-tock release cycle, where "ticks" represented shrinking chip fabrication processes and "tocks" introduced new architectures. Kaby Lake "Y-Series" chips appropriate for MacBook The three Kaby Lake Y-Series processors announced today are suitable upgrades for the MacBook, which was just updated to Skylake chips in April and thus is not expected to see another upgrade in the near future. The three U-Series chips could potentially make their way into future MacBook Air models, assuming graphics performance is sufficient for Apple's needs. The new U-Series chips include Intel HD "GT2" graphics, while Apple has historically preferred to use chips with relatively higher-performance "GT3" graphics in the MacBook Air. Kaby Lake "U-Series" chips possibly appropriate for MacBook Air Apple is rumored to be launching updated MacBook Air models as soon as October, but it is unclear whether the machines will use Skylake or these new Kaby Lake chips, as the current models continue to run on earlier Broadwell chips. More powerful mobile Kaby Lake chips with Iris graphics and desktop chips such as those appropriate for the MacBook Pro and iMac are expected to begin debuting in January, but Intel did not release a specific timeline or specs for those families.

Anything coming out in the next two months has been locked for a while. Now lets all stop pretending they might sneak in Kaby Lake because it's only going to lead to some very sad faces around here in a couple of weeks if we all keep hoping with our fingers crossed regardless.

"There is no new Mac! Help us god! Apple sucks! Can't innovate anymore! HP, Dell, MS etc. are sooo much faster... and cheaper... " Blah blah blah... The noticeable CPU speed improvements over the last five years are almost unnoticeable during the daily work. What are 10% CPU speed improvements? Loading a text document 0.1 second faster? Convert a video file a minute sooner? Scroll social media snappier? C'mon! People here behave like they are running nuclear fusion simulations on their tiny laptops and crave for every extra instruction cycle ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle') boost. That's hilarious! The only sad but true argument about Apple is that; they don't lower prices on (CPU)outdated Macs. But whether you have the newest Kaby Lake or Hasswell architecture inside, you won't notice the difference while you work. Your perception is poisoned with sophisticated marketing BS and we're mostly just sheep. Rating: 5 Votes AllergyDoc 18 weeks ago Gonna be some happy people around here.

Reader MojoKid writes: Intel is readying a new family of processors, based on its next-gen Kaby Lake microarchitecture, that will be the foundation of the company's upcoming 7th Generation Core processors. Although Kaby Lake marks a departure from Intel's "tick-tock" release cadence, there have been some tweaks made to its 14nm manufacturing process (called 14nm+) that have resulted in significant gains in performance, based on clock speed boosts and other optimizations. In addition, Intel has incorporated a new multimedia engine into Kaby Lake that adds hardware acceleration for 4K HEVC 10-bit transcoding and VP9 decoding. Skylake could handle 1080p HEVC transcoding, but it didn't accelerate 4K HEVC 10-bit transcoding or VP9 decode and had to assist with CPU resources. The new multimedia engine gives Kaby Lake the ability to handle up to eight 4Kp30 streams and it can decode HEVC 4Kp60 real-time content at up to 120Mbps. The engine can also now offload 4Kp30 real-time encoding in a dedicated fixed-function engine. Finally, Intel has made some improvements to their Speed Shift technology, which now takes the processor out of low power states to maximum frequency in 15 milliseconds. Clock speed boosts across Core i and Core m 7th gen series processors of 400-500 MHz, in combination with Speed Shift optimizations, result in what Intel claims are 12-9 percent performance gains in the same power envelope as its previous generation Skylake series, and even more power efficient video processing performance. hardware intel amd ← Related Links → Grumpy Cat Wants $600K From 'Pirating' Coffee Maker Submission: Intel Unveils Full Details Of Kaby Lake 7th Gen Core Series Processors New Intel and AMD Chips Will Only Support Windows 10 Intel Confuses, Rebrands Some Core M Processors As Core I Why Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Zen Will Only Be Optimized On Windows 10 Apple Ordered To Pay Up To $14.5 Billion in EU Tax Crackdown, Cook Refutes EU's Conclusion This discussion has been archived.

It was delayed so long that most manufacturers (and Intel for some of their product lines) skipped it entirely and moved straight from Haswell to Skylake which came out 2015Q3.

Sashimi or salumi from a celebrity chef? Veggies cultivated in a hydroponic hotel garden? All this and more could be yours this fall, when Boston enjoys an especially busy season of restaurant debuts from national names and hometown notables. Read on for a rundown of Boston’s autumn openings. The fine print: Restaurant debuts are always subject to change, so dates are tentative. Area Four Boston Advertisement When: Early October Where: 262 E. Berkeley St., Boston Get The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Who: A4 founder Michael Krupp and executive chef-partner Jeff Pond Intel: Head to the Troy Boston building, near the Ink Block in the South End, for meals cooked over an open flame, including roasted meats, fish, vegetables, and the signature pizzas that earned fans in Cambridge. As for digs? The team calls the new space a cross between “vintage kitsch and high design.” The Automatic When: November Advertisement Where: 50 Hampshire St., Cambridge Who: East Coast Grill guru Chris Schlesinger and bartender extraordinaire Dave Cagle Intel: “Fun, fast, and flavorful but not fussy” is how Cagle describes his venture with Schlesinger. “Think ‘Cheers’ (the one on TV, not the tourist destination) with tattooed servers and punk rock music. Maybe a mix between the B-Side Lounge and East Coast Grill?” If this combo doesn’t entice you, chef Ian Andreotta’s menu surely will — an eclectic assemblage ranging from chili dogs to red curry mussels to the aforementioned Cool Ranch plantains. There’s a patio, too. Benedetto When: Late October Where: The Charles Hotel, 1 Bennett St., Cambridge Who: Giulia chef-owner Michael Pagliarini Intel: Pagliarini calls this 200-seat hotel restaurant a higher-end version of his Porter Square trattoria, Giulia, complete with a swanky private dining room and truffles served tableside, as well as a pasta table. Pastry chef Renae Connolly comes from Cambridge’s Café ArtScience. “She’s an absolute star,” Pagliarini says. The Burro Bar When: November Where: 1665 Beacon St., Brookline Who: Joe Cassinelli, chef-owner of Alpine Restaurant Group (The Painted Burro, Posto, Rosebud). Intel: Expect a smaller-scale version of the Davis Square Burro within the old Ribelle space, serving tacos, tortas, nachos, and hopefully their signature hot dog topped with chipotle ketchup and agave mustard. Buttermilk and Bourbon When: November Where: Back Bay, Boston Who: Maverick chef Jason Santos Intel: The aqua-maned Santos helms this 150-seat, Bayou-inflected enclave, which he describes as having “the energy of Toro and the food of Hungry Mother — Southern ingredients prepared properly.” Santos, ever creative, says he’ll cast aside gumbos and jambalaya in favor of biscuit buckets, house-fried chicken with Nashville hot sauce, and Scorpion bowls. At the entrance? A small bar with champagne on tap to set the mood. Catalyst Café When: November Where: 75 Binney St., Cambridge Who: Catalyst chef-owner William Kovel Intel: Kovel takes his fine-dining restaurant, Catalyst, down a notch with a casual cafe outside of Kendall Square, where he’ll serve breakfast and lunch. “We’ve been having a lot of fun with breakfast sandwiches and doughnuts,” he reveals. “Plus hot chocolate. My kids love hot chocolate.” Certified Meatball Company When: November Where: 429 West Broadway, South Boston Who: Boston Nightlife Ventures, the team behind Southern Kin and Wink & Nod Intel: BNV chief culinary officer Bill Brodsky wonders, “Who doesn’t love a good meatball?” Who indeed! He’ll serve six types of balls with sauce pairings, plus unusual combos like turducken balls, cashew-curried vegetable balls, and bao balls atop steamed bao buns. Cultivar When: Late fall Where: The Ames Hotel, 1 Court St., Boston Who: Mary Dumont, lately seen at Cambridge’s Harvest Intel: Savor foraged food, sustainable seafood, and dry-aged meats inside Boston’s first skyscraper, with many ingredients coming from the restaurant’s hydroponic and hanging gardens. “This is modern American food with a huge emphasis on the modern garden concept,” Dumont says. Cunard Tavern When: November Where: 25 Orleans St., East Boston Who:Ducali and Lucia owner Phil Frattaroli Intel: Frattaroli oversees this waterfront gastropub on the site of his grandfather’s former woodshop. But times have changed. “Now there’s tons of Italian, Mexican, and Central American food here, so I wanted to do traditional pub food,” he says. There are 65 seats, a 35-seat roof deck, and what Frattaroli describes as a “really good burger on an English muffin.” Brunch, too. East Coast Grill When: Early November Where: 1271 Cambridge St., Cambridge Who: Highland Kitchen’s Mark Romano and wife Marci Joy Intel: Romano and Joy hope to revive the Inman Square institution with a bigger drink menu, plus many of the spicy barbecue dishes fans knew and loved for 30 years. The original restaurant closed in January, much to the neighborhood’s dismay. Jemal Countess/Getty Images/file 2010 Chef Mario Batali. Eataly When: November Where: The Prudential Center, 800 Boylston St., Boston Who: Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich, and Lidia Bastianich, others Intel: Eataly Boston will have “the best seafood ever — and different than in other Eataly cities,” promises a rep for the Italian dining and shopping emporium. The 45,000-square-foot gastroplex at the Pru will also have a La Pizza & La Pasta restaurant (serving the obvious), plus a seafood restaurant, Il Pesce, and a hands-on cooking school. En Boca When: September Where: 8 Holyoke St., Cambridge Who: Ben Lacy (Ten Tables Cambridge), Devin Broo (Bar Boulud), and Classic Restaurant Concepts (forces behind The Asgard and The Kinsale pubs). Intel: The old Sandrine’s space morphs into a small plates restaurant with 132 seats and a menu divvied into “farm,” “land,” “sea,” and “garden,” plus a 17-seat bar with wines on tap. Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff/file Joanne Chang, owner of Flour Bakery and Cafe. Flour Harvard Square When: October Where: 114 Mt. Auburn St., Cambridge Who: Joanne Chang Intel: This is the first of several new Flours for Chang, including upcoming outposts in Kendall Square and the Back Bay. It is, however, the only one with the distinction of being housed in a former Chili’s. Gre.Co When: Late October Where: 225 Newbury St., Boston Who: Demetri Tsolakis from the Seaport’s Committee Intel: Committee is a nightlife destination; here, it’s all about Greek food on the go, with meats from Savenor’s Market; produce from Eva’s Garden on the South Shore; and loukoumades (Greek doughnuts) topped with honey, sesame seeds, pistachios, and other treats. La Casa de Pedro When: September Where: 505 Congress St., Boston Who: Pedro Alarcón, chef-owner at Watertown’s 20-year-old flagship. Intel: A patio! An outdoor bar! Live music! A ceviche bar, and even a takeout cafe! La Casa de Pedro brings a splash of Latin excitement to the Seaport, with dishes from Venezuela and beyond. The Watertown original is routinely jammed with couples, families, and boisterous groups swilling mojitos — expect the same here. Moona When: October Where: 243 Hampshire St., Cambridge Who: Mohamad El Zein, former operations director for Masa, and Rod Ouassaidi, owner of South End Pita. Intel: Moona translates to “pantry” in Arabic. As such, expect a focus on preserved ingredients like olives, pickles, cheeses, spices, and jams, used in Arabic and Eastern Mediterranean dishes designed to share. PABU When: Fall Where: Millennium Tower, 1 Franklin St., Boston Who: Acclaimed San Francisco chef Michael Mina and sushi master Ken Tominaga Intel: Boston gets its own two-story version of San Francisco’s lauded sushi bar and izakaya, tended by Benjamin Steigers from the California original. Mina’s excited for Boston’s seafood scene — “my very first restaurant [Aqua] was all fish,” he says — and an extensive charcoal-cooked meat program. Also look for multi-course sushi menus with ingredients from Tokyo’s Tsukiji fish market and Japanese whiskey aplenty. RFK Kitchen When: Early October Where: 948 Great Plain Ave., Needham Who: Chef-owner Rachel Klein, recently seen at Liquid Art House Intel: A family-friendly yet sophisticated suburban boite with 100 seats, an open kitchen with a 25-seat dining counter, and a lounge. “We have an American menu with global influences. It’s a place you could go every day and have a burger or do a chef’s tasting menu,” says Klein, eager to bring a refined restaurant to the ’burbs (she’s also a resident). “I want a place I can go with my friends. Needham’s a great town with worldly people who enjoy food and eat out all the time,” she says. RUKA When: November Where: The Godfrey Hotel, 505 Washington St., Boston Who: The team behind Downtown Crossing’s Yvonne’s Intel: RUKA will grace the Godfrey’s lobby with a style of Peruvian-Japanese fusion known as Nikkei. Executive chef Preston Miller worked with chef April Bloomfield at New York City’s Michelin-starred The Breslin. Waypoint When: Now open Where: 1030 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge Who: Alden & Harlow’s Michael Scelfo and Seth Freidus Intel: Enjoy caviar service, roasts, a bakery program, pizza (the chopped clam version, above), and plenty of regional seafood from the Alden & Harlow team, with local help: Dine on plates designed by Boston ceramicist Jeremy Ogusky amid neon signage from collector Dave Waller. This is merely the beginning, of course.

How Rogue One's Imperial stormtroopers SAVED Star Wars and restored order More like this Intel x86 Core Personal Tech Intel's makeshift Kaby Lake Cores hope to lure punters from tired PCs Seventh-generation processors with DRM-friendly UHD engine will appear from next month 30 Aug 2016 at 13:00, Chris Williams Intel's stop-gap Kaby Lake processors – aka the seventh-generation Core family – will ship in laptops starting from September, we're told. According to Chipzilla, the first wave of the new Cores will appear in 10mm-thick notebooks and two-in-one convertible tablets aimed at small businesses and normal folk. The CPUs will consume 4.5W to 15W, depending on the model, and go on sale in more than 100 laptop designs by the end-of-year shopping rush. They'll include Intel's usual integrated HD Graphics chipset. Come January, enterprise PCs, workstations and beefier notebooks and desktop systems will ship with the chips, some with Intel's Iris graphics chipset. Presumably that's when you'll be able to get your hands on individual processors to build you own rigs by hand. The processors are powered by the 14nm Kaby Lake microarchitecture. This is the Skylake microarchitecture – as used in 2015's 14nm sixth-generation Core family – with some tweaks and optimizations. Intel inserted Kaby Lake into its lineup after its tick-tock product cycle missed a beat. Usually, Intel shrinks a microarchitecture to a new process size and ships it (that's the tick), and later rolls out a new microarchitecture using that process size (that's the tock). There's a 12 to 18-month gap between the ticks and tocks. The latest tock was the introduction of Skylake on 14nm. The next tick was going to be Cannonlake, aka Skylake on 10nm, but that was delayed to 2017 because Intel couldn't perfect the shrink in time. So in the meantime, we've been lumped with Kaby Lake, an optimized Skylake redux on 14nm. (Intel has now given up on the tick-tock approach, for what it's worth.) What do we mean by optimized? Well, for one thing, better physical manufacturing techniques. Intel says it has improved the fin design and the channel strain in its FinFETs. The shape of the fin has a massive effect on the operation of the transistor, potentially reducing the leakage current significantly. Increasing the strain in the channel increases performance and lowers power consumption by cutting the atomic forces that interfere with electron flow. Intel's seventh-generation dual-core die with builtin GPU ... Click to enlarge any pics According to Intel, these fabrication improvements from Skylake to Kaby Lake, plus some CPU enhancements, give seventh-generation Cores up to a 12 per cent performance boost over the sixth-generation – well, when running the SYSmark benchmark on a seventh-gen 15W 3.5GHz Core i7 7500U versus a sixth-gen 15W 3.1GHz Core i7 6500U. When running the WebXPRT benchmark on the same chips, the performance boost from Skylake to Kaby Lake can reach up to 19 per cent, we're told. Generation debate ... How 2015 and 2016's Cores compare (Source: Intel) So in other words, changing up from a 2015 Core i7 to the equivalent 2016 part can speed up web browsing by up to a fifth, in theory. Chipzilla also says its seventh-generation Cores are more power friendly when streaming vids: the new Core i7 7500U can play 4K VP9 video for seven hours on a 66Whr battery that a sixth-gen Core i7 6500U chomps through in just four hours when streaming the same material. That's generation on generation, though. These figures are only of use to snarks like us who want to see what Intel engineers have achieved in the past year, and for geeks who upgrade their machines every 12 months. Intel really hopes Kaby Lake prizes punters off their 2011-era PCs; anyone tempted to replace their computer will be blown away by the improvements in the past five years and crack out their credit card. At least, that's the dream. "Most people who are going to buy a new PC are not buying to replace last year's – well, maybe we wish they were but they are not, they are replacing devices that are five or more years old," said Intel spokeswoman Karen Regis. "There are 400 million users who are using PCs that are five or more years old." Intel reckons today's seventh-gen Core i5 7200U is 70 per cent faster than its five-year-old Core i5 2467M equivalent in SYSmark benchmarks, can convert a 4K video to 1080p H.264 6.8 times faster, and score three times better in the 3Dmark gaming benchmark. More information on the individual chips, and their speeds and feeds, will appear, as always, on Intel's ARK closer to launch. Finally, there's an addition to Kaby Lake: a new media-processing engine. This performs VP9 and 10-bit HEVC/H.265 decoding in hardware, as well as the usual 1080p HEVC, to reduce power usage even when viewing high-res video – meaning more internet streaming before your battery runs out. Intel calls this "All Day 4K" where "all day" means "nine and a half hours." Highly technical ... Basic outline of the new media engine Kaby Lake chips are able to decode up to eight 4Kp30 AVC and HEVC streams at a time – useful for signs and surveillance gear – and decode 4Kp60 HEVC at up to 120Mbps, which is handy for watching high-quality films and TV on the internet. This video engine also enforces anti-piracy DRM protections as required by the major studios. Hollywood bosses didn't want to stream 4K ultra high-def content from online clouds without mechanisms in place to thwart casual rippers, and so Intel gave the entertainment giants what they wanted. "There are hardware-based protection mechanisms to make the studios comfortable with sharing high-quality content to PCs for the first time," said Regis. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 48 Comments More from The Register Not two, not four, but 10 cores in Intel's new PC powerhouse Perfect for the gamer with money to burn 27 Comments Intel keeps droning on, as PC sales continue to tumble Plans later, but for now here’s $60m, Yuneec 13 Comments Fujitsu seeks PC exit, finds willing buyer in Lenovo But can they fund the deal? 13 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

By Charlie Osborne for Between the Lines | August 30, 2016 -- 13:00 GMT (06:00 PDT) | Topic: Processors Intel says that the modern-day consumer is now demanding an "immersive" experience from the internet and has unveiled the 7th generation Intel Core processor family to support this concept through 4K UHD, 360-degree video, and high-resolution video streaming. On Tuesday, the tech giant said the new range of processors has been designed for a concept Intel calls the "immersive internet," the idea surrounding the web becoming richer in content. According to Karen Regis, director of mobile platform marketing at Intel, consumers are demanding more immersive experiences such as 4K UHD, virtual reality, and e-sports -- alongside high-quality video -- and so the PC must transform to suit these trends. The PC is the "ideal device for the immersive internet," the executive says, but there must be enough processing power to follow suit. The 7th generation processors, developed under the codename "Kaby Lake," are built on the Skylake architecture. The 14nm processors are supported by a new media engine which is equipped with new HEVC 10-bit decode capabilities for better playback of media content up to 4K UHD and new VP9 decode features for improved 4K UHD,4K 360-degree playback while multitasking. Intel's new media engine In addition, the processor family -- including Intel Core m3, Intel Core i5, and i7 processors -- come with Intel HD Graphics, Turbo Boost, and Speed Shift capabilities, alongside improved photo and video editing, multiple video streams, and high-resolution video chat. The firm says there is a "significant" improvement in performance in comparison to previous generation hardware due to the new codecs and a new "media block" framework which speeds up hardware acceleration for both codecs and color depths. Intel also claims that on average, the new processors will allow consumers to watch up to 9.5 hours of 4K video playback without a problem. The 7th generation processors will also support Gen 3 PCIe usage, increasing data transfer rates. In addition, while Intel's first-generation processors used 18 watts of power as a design point, the company notes that the 7th generation uses only 4.5 watts, a vast increase in efficiency achieved over several decades. Intel expects devices equipped with the new processor range to begin shipping by September, and over 100 products have been developed using the new hardware at different price points for the first wave. Roughly 350 new designs expected to hit the market by January 2017.

At the time, ‘Kaby Lake’ as the name for Intel’s third crack at their 14nm process was well known, but users wondered if it was just another Devil’s Canyon (better overclocking) or a full on CPU launch. Well the answer is the latter, and the launch is staggered between today and January. Roll on Kaby Lake. Is that Kah-bee Lake, or Kay-bee Lake? Tick-Tock to Process-Architecture-Optimization (PAO) Intel’s two year processor cadence of Tick-Tock allowed the company to alternate reducing the lithography node (a tick) with an upgraded microarchitecture (a tock) with modest gains of performance. Each stage of the Tick-Tock would take 12-15 months, with new lithography nodes taking longer and longer to reach maturity. Eventually it has gotten to a point where 14nm took too long to become pervasive in Intel’s product stack. For a manufacturing company and a CPU company, slowly rolling out Broadwell notebook and low power parts and then gutting the mid-range desktop was the result of the troubles of bringing 14nm to the prime time. Now in 2016 we have the launch of full-sized Broadwell-EP server parts running up to 22 cores in a 145W envelope, but the low power parts are a couple of microarchitectures ahead. We have this strange situation of a stretched landscape, partially driven by markets but also for manufacturing. The move from Intel’s 14nm process to 10nm is a long, slow burn, taking much longer to develop than any process previous. We first saw 14nm in Broadwell mobile CPUs in Q3 of 2014, almost two years ago, and 10nm still isn’t on any public roadmap for early 2017. With the tick-tock strategy, and the launch of Skylake in mid-2015, this would leave Intel without a new CPU launch for almost two years, which is unheard of from Intel. Also, Intel’s partners rely on product cycles to announce and launch new products to generate revenue. To fill the gap, plus with a few other techniques, Intel moved to Process-Architecture-Optimization, or PAO for short. This means three bites of the cherry for 14nm before we see 10nm in prime time. First it was Broadwell, then Skylake, and today Intel is announcing Kaby Lake. As part of the release, Intel has mentioned that a number of key benefits for Kaby Lake will be based on an optimized 14nm process, called 14PLUS (or 14nm+, 14FF+). This process as a quick summary has a higher fin height and larger pitch, essentially giving a less-dense set of transistors that have more room to breathe. Normally a larger pitch means more voltage required, but this is offset by the fin height and Intel says is good for another few hundred MHz for performance. The less-dense design, in theory, may also help in overclocking, however we will have to wait until January to see those results. Today’s Announcement The reveal today covers several aspects of Kaby Lake. First is the actual SKUs that will be launched, which consist of three Kaby Lake-Y parts around 4.5W aimed at high-end tablets and 2-in-1 devices and three Kaby Lake-U parts at 15W for notebooks. Both sets of KBL-Y and KBL-U CPUs will feature in mini-PCs as well, so we expect to see the usual array of Zotac and ECS announcements in due course. We have details on all six CPUs to give you, including the new Core M branding regime for the 4.5W family of parts. The pre-briefings we have had go into some detail regarding changes in the processor, particularly regarding the new enhanced media blocks inside the GPU to support new encode/decode features. The graphics power, in terms of EUs or the microarchitecture, hasn’t changed but the fixed function hardware has some nice upgrades for an updated version of Gen 9 graphics aimed at the upcoming era of 4K support. Ganesh has gone into detail for us over what that means, especially where power and battery life is concerned for anyone creating/consuming 4K content. Kaby Lake also has an updated Speed Shift package, to accelerate the work already done with Skylake in boosting the performance of the CPU quicker to save power. Intel call it a refinement in the mechanism of handing frequency control back from the OS to the CPU, however ‘Speed Shift v2’ is an adequate moniker to show the upgraded difference. Intel hasn’t gone into much detail regarding the new 14nm+ process itself in terms of specifics, but has listed a number of performance gains that come out of the new CPU. The fundamental microarchitecture between Skylake and the new Kaby Lake parts is practically unchanged (DMI 3.0 now allows PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe drives from the integrated PCH), but the updated fin profile and reduced ‘strain’ by the larger fin pitch is being quoted as giving a 12% performance increase due to process alone, typically through additional frequency for the same power. The main benefits to KBL will be in that frequency due to the 14nm+ process as well as the new media capabilities. As always, Intel consistently emphasizes the difference between a new notebook/2-in-1 based on a 15W Kaby Lake processor compared to a 5-year old device, such one based on a mobile Sandy Bridge ULV part. Intel continually sees its market revolving around new experiences created by new form factors, and to generate revenue requires people to upgrade and decide how these new experiences can influence an upgrade. Intel expects to have over 100 Kaby Lake system designs in the consumer channel by Q4, including 120+ using Thunderbolt 3, 100+ using Windows Hello (either via a Real Sense camera or a fingerprint sensor), 50+ designs with 4K UHD as a primary feature and 25+ designs with contact enabled pens. Kaby Lake should be pin compatible with Skylake based designs, meaning that for a number of cases we will simply see a drop in, but others will have new design IDs on show.

I remember that on my old SB chip, the GPU just was turned off because I use discrete. How have things changed, if at all? Reply Ryan Smith - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Typically you'll be using the dGPU for video decoding since it's closer to the display pipeline. However you can totally use QuickSync for video encoding, even with a dGPU. Reply hansmuff - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Ah yes, QuickSync in particular was a question for me. While NVENC certainly does do a fine job, if I have a hardware encoder laying dormant in the CPU, it might as well do stream encoding for me :) Reply npz - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link It's trickier if you wanted to do real time streaming/encoding with it. You need software or a set of software actually to capture the raw video and pass it to the QS encoder. Reply fabarati - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link I just messed about with NVENC, QSVEncC and x265 when ripping som DVDs. X265 still gives the best quality and size. With a i5-6500, the encoding speed wasn't all that, at around 65 fps. Of course, QSVEncC was closer to 200 fps and NVENC (GTX 1070) clocked in at 1300-2000 FPS. Quality and size of the file are of course the opposite, with x265 looking the best and being the smallest, then QSVEncC and finally NVENC. Reply Guspaz - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Can you? Last I looked, that required enabling both the dGPU and iGPU simultaneously (and simply not plugging a monitor into the iGPU). Attempts to enable the iGPU while having a dGPU plugged in on my Ivy Bridge resulted in Windows not booting. Reply nathanddrews - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link I can't speak for your system, but my Z77 motherboard features Virtu multi-GPU support that allows me to use Quick Sync while having my monitor plugged into my dGPU. You have to activate both IGP and dGPU in BIOS, then load both drivers. It worked for me under W7 and W10. Reply Guspaz - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Errm, you've got dedicated hardware specifically for the purpose of supporting multiple GPUs (the Lucid Virtu), so that's not really a typical example. Reply extide - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Lucid Virtu is all software Reply Gigaplex - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Last I checked, it requires motherboard support. You can't just install some software and expect it to work. That's what they meant by dedicated hardware.

In short, Kaby Lake is a revamp of the 14nm Skylake with a few efficiency and power improvements thrown in. It’s the chip that bridges the gap until the 10nm Cannonlake, which Intel has penciled in for 2017. Kaby Lake also opens the door for Apple to finally upgrade its MacBook Pro (and maybe even Air) computers, after the Cupertino company opted to skip the Skylake architecture altogether with those models. Microsoft's Surface Book suffered from a number of power management problems relating to Skylake, and other PC manufacturers also had to issue an aberrantly high number of firmware and driver updates for their Skylake machines. Apple's abstinence from those chips could well have been motivated by those very same challenges, which Intel will surely have prioritized to fix with its new generation. With Kaby Lake, Intel is emphasizing experiences rather than hard specs. Being a second "tock" in Intel’s tick-tock strategy, Kaby Lake isn’t really going to differentiate itself from its predecessor with pure power or stamina improvements, so Intel’s focus is on the kinds of things its new CPUs would let people do. At the top of the list is video: multiple streams of 4K content, 360-degree videos, and virtual and augmented reality applications. Intel wants to be part of delivering all of those to more people, along with functionality like Windows Hello, the facial identification login, which is supported across more laptop models now. There are still a couple of measurable advantages to Kaby Lake, though, and those start with efficiency. Intel claims its 7th-gen Core chips are 10 times more efficient — in terms of performance per watt — than the first generation, whereas the 6th-gen family were only 8 times better. Also improved is web performance, by 19 percent in Intel’s benchmarks, along with productivity apps, which clock in at 12 percent faster. These are all best-case scenarios for Intel, and in the real world the Kaby Lake difference is unlikely to be quite so tangible. There'll be a sub-10mm-thick laptop this year, according to Intel Intel’s new processor announcements are always a good chance to look ahead to unannounced products, and one of the promises the chipmaker offers is of clamshells (aka laptops) "thinner than 10mm." That’s even less than the scarcely believable HP Spectre 13. With more than 100 new designs from all the various PC manufacturers already in the pipeline for this year, Intel’s Kaby Lake will find itself in many, if not most, of the computers sold this holiday season. It starts off with dual-core mobile chips in the Core M3, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processor families. Intel says OEMs should start shipping Kaby Lake-powered systems from the start of September and quickly ramp up from there.

By: Steven Bassiri | Intel CPUs in CPUs, Chipsets & SoCs | Posted: Aug 30, 2016 1:00 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Intel 7th Generation Core Processors] Page 1 [Intel 7th Generation Core Processors] Page 2 [Integrated Graphics Improvements] Page 3 [Benchmarks and Comparisons] Page 4 [Preliminary Lineup and Final Thoughts] Intel's Kaby Lake 7th Gen CPUs     With Intel's shift away from tick-tock and towards process-architecture-optimization, we finally have the first of many third installments of the same node. Intel introduced its 14nm process on Broadwell, it introduced a new microarchitecture on 14nm with Skylake, and it is delivering an optimization of their 14nm process with Kaby Lake. By definition, Kaby Lake is the final installment of Intel's 14nm node, they have dubbed it 14nm+ (plus).     Kaby Lake is Skylake's successor and brings more to the table regarding integrated graphics improvements than it does new CPU features. That isn't to say Intel has stayed stagnant on the CPU side; the 14nm+ process employees faster transistors and brings in 15-20% higher frequencies on the mobile side. Intel will keep their normal naming scheme for the Core family, but they have done away with Core M5 and M7 names, but not M3.     Intel's timeline is also worth a look. Kaby Lake won't launch all at once; Intel is waiting for after the holidays to release desktop and higher-end models. In the next few months, we will see Y and U series CPUs ranging from 4.5W-15W designed for mobile devices. Enterprise, workstation, Iris graphics, and H (high-end mobile) and S (desktop) series CPUs will come early next year. Intel's improvements to their 14nm node should bring noticeable frequency gains, which are always welcomed. The improved process will also allow for all cores to Turbo to maximum frequency at the same time instead of just one. While an i7-6500U was maximum 3.1GHz, the i7-7500U will run at a maximum of 3.5GHz.     So why is Intel focusing on its integrated graphics? The answer is simple - 4K video isn't a walk in the park. At an NDA briefing at IDF 2016 in San Francisco, Intel showed off some future notebooks using their 7th generation processors as well as a growing number of 4K capture devices. Most people know that the very popular GoPro cameras capture in 4K, but now with improvements to Intel's integrated graphics, working with them on-the-go should be much easier.   While 4K capture was very niche in the past, it has become more mainstream as everything from your phone to your drone can capture in this ultra-high resolution format. I have an Ivy Bridge laptop and a Panasonic camera that records 4K at 100 Mbps, and I can't even play back the video without the laptop screaming, and even then the video lags. Skylake brought a lot of improvements in regards to 4K, but Kaby Lake promises even more. Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.

Nick Knupffer Laptops by Sean Hollister October 27, 2016 6:03 PM PDT @starfire2258 Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Intel turns to Overwatch to show off seventh-generation core Intel's CEO put his company's new core processor to the test on stage by playing Overwatch. 0:57 Close Drag Apple's new MacBook Pro is an eye-catching new computer. So are Microsoft's new Surface Studio and upgraded Surface Book. But none of them use Intel's latest processors. Is that a big deal? Not as much as you'd think. Here's our explainer from August on what "Kaby Lake" really means for your next PC. Original story published August 17: The clock has stopped. The chips are down. Intel's seventh-gen Core processors, codename Kaby Lake, are now official -- but they aren't as big an upgrade as you'd expect from Intel. Sure, they're a little bit faster and a little bit more power-efficient. But the best thing about Intel new CPUs might actually be this: the deals you'll find on PCs with last year's chips. Here's why Kaby Lake isn't such a big deal. What's a Kaby Lake? Intel's seventh-generation Core processors, the latest and greatest CPUs the company has to offer. They're the successor to Intel's sixth-gen "Skylake" processors from 2015. But Kaby Lake isn't a true successor to Skylake. It's more like Skylake+. Usually, Intel creates a powerful new processor architecture, then the following year shrinks down the circuits for better efficiency. (Intel, much like Ke$ha, is industry-famous for that "Tick-Tock" product cycle.) Enlarge Image Kaby Lake isn't huge. It's about twice the size of California's Lake Tahoe -- a popular vacation spot for Silicon Valley residents. Photo by Google Maps But Kaby Lake doesn't do either of those things. The circuits are the same 14 nanometer size as Intel's earlier Skylake and Broadwell chips, and it's not a new architecture either. Intel had been trying to shrink down to 10nm with a processor called Cannonlake, but those chips were delayed. So for now, we're stuck at Tock. No, really, what's a Kaby Lake? Is "Kaby" a kind of fish? Oh. No, it appears to be an actual lake in Canada. Maybe the CEO enjoys hunting moose in his spare time? Is Kaby Lake any better than my existing computer processor? Intel thinks so! The company says its thin laptop chips are 12 percent faster than Skylake in raw performance, and far more efficient at decoding 4K video. In fact, Intel claims you could get 3 more hours of battery life while streaming YouTube 4K videos (7 vs. 4 hours) compared to last year's chips. And for gamers, the company even showed an incredibly thin laptop playing fast-paced shooter Overwatch reasonably well. That sounds great, no? Sure -- until you take a hard look at how Intel generated those numbers. It's not too surprising that Intel's Kaby Lake CPU ran 12 percent faster than the comparable Skylake -- because the new chip is clocked 12 percent faster anyhow! Which could be a problem, because faster clock speeds tend to generate more heat and consume more battery as well. Enlarge Image Intel shows performance gains of 12 percent. Perhaps it's because the chip is working 12 percent harder? Photo by Intel And while Intel's battery life numbers for 4K video are hard to ignore, Intel tells me that battery life should be "similar" -- not necessarily better than Skylake -- across other kinds of workloads. We could easily be in a situation like Intel's Broadwell vs. Haswell, where the company claimed better performance with the same battery life, but devices actually consumed a bit more battery in real-world use. I'm optimistic, though, and we'll need to test for sure. What about the gaming performance? I wouldn't get too excited just yet. We took a closer look at Overwatch on a Dell XPS 13 with the new Intel chip, and it ran pretty smooth...but with a few caveats. Judge for yourself: Also note that Intel may still have some more powerful graphics in the near future: we haven't yet seen how far the company's souped-up Intel Iris graphics have come. Are there any sleek new laptops or tablets coming with Kaby Lake, at least? Sure! Feast your eyes on the new Acer Swift 7: 9 An early look at the ultra-thin Acer Swift 7 laptop We also saw a sleek HP Spectre with a new OLED panel, a refreshed Dell XPS 13, and a 6.9mm-thick Asus detachable tablet -- the Asus T305 -- with a fingerprint reader built right into the power button. Intel says there'll be over 100 different slim computers with Kaby Lake chips by the end of the year. When will Kaby Lake start showing up in new PCs? Enlarge Image Intel CVP Navin Shenoy holds up a Kaby Lake chip. Photo by Sean Hollister/CNET Well, that's the other thing...we'll see the first Kaby Lake computers in September and October, but only the types of chips that go into thin laptops and tablets. Quad-core laptop chips (like you'd find in a MacBook Pro), laptop chips with Iris graphics, business-class laptop chips with vPro and desktop chips won't appear until early next year. On the plus side, rumor has it you won't need a new motherboard for Kaby Lake desktop chips. They'll allegedly use the same LGA1151 socket as their Skylake predecessors. Will they appear in the new MacBook Pro? Depends on Apple (and Intel), but there's a decent chance they won't. Apple typically uses the most powerful Intel laptop processors available -- the 28-watt ones with better Intel graphics -- and again, Intel says they won't be ready until early next year. That's not nearly enough time to get them ready for Apple's September 7 event. However, Bloomberg reports that Apple won't refresh the Macs until later this year, and it wouldn't be the first time Intel has given chips to Apple ahead of schedule. And if Apple decides to refresh the MacBook Air -- another Bloomberg rumor -- those thinner Intel laptop chips are now ready. Update, October 27: Apple isn't using them. Everything you need to know about the major MacBook Pro upgrade After 4 plus years we'll finally see an all new MacBook Pro laptop. We could see the Apple Watch 2 and an updated first-gen Apple Watch this year. New iPhone 7 details, plus Apple TV is now looking to be a TV Guide. Yikes. by Brian Tong 5:59 Close Drag Should I wait to buy a new PC or Mac until Kaby Lake is available? It definitely couldn't hurt. It's usually better to get the latest and greatest if you can afford it -- and Kaby Lake definitely sounds better if you watch 4K video. But as I've outlined above, most PCs probably won't get a big boost to performance or battery life with Kaby Lake silicon. The real reason to wait: you'll almost certainly find some excellent discounts on Skylake computers once Kaby Lake hits the market. What about AMD's Zen? The Intel rival's new built-from-the-ground-up chips sound promising, but you won't be able to drop one into a desktop till 2017. AMD's new laptop chips will take even longer -- expect them in the second half of next year. How will I tell Kaby Lake apart from previous processors when I'm computer shopping? In one important way, Intel's making it easier than ever before: it'll say "7th gen" right on the familiar Intel sticker you'll find on the palmrest of a new laptop. It's a change we've been asking for. Enlarge Image The new "7th-gen" Intel Core branding scheme. Photo by Intel Unfortunately, Intel also made another change that could prove even more confusing. Ever heard of Core M, Intel's line of ultra-low-power 4.5-watt processors for incredibly thin, fanless PCs? As of now, the company's Core m5 and Core m7 processors are part of the Core i5 and Core i7 family, respectively. That means if you purchase a laptop with a "Core i7" label, it may not offer nearly the same sustained performance as a Core i7 machine from last year. Of course, a thin laptop's Core i7 chip already wasn't as powerful as a thick laptop's Core i7 chip, and neither were as powerful as a Core i7 desktop chip, so perhaps we're just continuing that trend. These days, it's really the size of your PC that indicates its potential performance. Besides, you can still tell the M chips apart if you look at the full model number. If you see a Y (e.g. Core i7-7Y75), it's one of the lower-performance processors. I like specs and codenames. Which processors are actually being announced today? Only six: Intel Core i7-7500U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.7GHz base, 3.5GHz turbo) Intel Core i5-7200U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.5GHz base, 3.1GHz turbo) Intel Core i3-7100U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.4GHz, no turbo) Intel Core i7-7Y75 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.3GHz base, 3.6GHz turbo) Intel Core i5-7Y54 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.2GHz base, 3.2GHz turbo) Intel Core m3-7Y30 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.0GHz base, 2.6GHz turbo) Is Moore's Law dead?

The new PCs coming to market now are the most innovative ever with not only touch interfaces, but IR cameras, pens, bio-metric inputs and so on. The PC is still on the leading edge for the immersive industry and the new Intel 7th Generation Core processors will help keep it that way. Today marks the official unveiling of the 7th Generation Intel Core Processors and we are happy to inform you that the processors are in mass production this very second and that the first mobile devices (2 in 1s and ultrathing notebooks) will be available to purchase in September. Intel says that their partners plan on having over 100 devices available for purchase in Q4 2016. In January 2017 the Kaby Lake desktop processors will be released along with the vPro skus for the enterprise market and more targeted mobile processors for the high-end gaming and VR markets. Intel thinks that another 350 designs to come to market from the channel and OEM partners. To get the most of the immersive internet you need the right processor and for that Intel believes the 7th Gen Intel Core Processors are the best choice. The 7th Generation Intel Core Processors are based on the Sky Lake architecture, but with more improvements. Intel 7th Generation processors are built using what Intel is calling the 14nm+ manufacturing process. Intel moved to the 14nm manufacturing processor with their 6th Generation of Sky Lake processors and have found a number of areas that could be improved upon since doing so at this node. The 14nm+ process features transistor improvements thanks to taller fin profiles and wider gate pitch. Intel also improved the interconnect speed through both pitch and the aspect ratio. Intel is seeing 12% performance increase at the transistor level thanks on the 7th Gen processors versus the 6th Gen processors due to these process improvements. Intel 7th Gen ‘Kaby Lake’ processors are 2x more efficient with regards to relative performance per Watt when compared to Intel 6th Gen ‘Sky Lake’ processors. Both series have 4.5W TDP processors, so that means the performance is that much better. Intel is using the overall performance score in SYSMark 2014 to come up with this number. If you go back to the first Intel Core series processor in 2010 the lowest powered mobile processor had an 18W TDP. Intel has gotten a 10x in efficiency as performance has gone up more than 2.5x while power has been reduced to 4.5W from 18W. The upcoming Intel Core i7-7500U ‘Kaby Lake’ processor is significantly faster than the Intel Core i7-6500U processor at the same CPU TDP (15W). The slide above shows that the Intel Core i7-7500U is 12% faster in SYSMark 2014 and 19% faster in WebXPRT 2015. Thanks to the aforementioned 14nm+ silicon level improvements, Intel has been able to increase the boost clock frequencies. Note that Intel was able to get a 400MHz boost clock increase year over year! For those that haven’t updated their computer in years the performance gains are even more impressive. For example, if you were updating a 5 year old PC and doing standard day-to-day work productivity tasks (converting Microsoft Word Docs to PDFs, sorting Power Point slidesrunning Excel Macros) you’d see 1.7x speedup.  If you are trying to create 4K video or 360-degree video content you see an 8.6x improvement with a 7th Generation Core processor versus a 5-year old PC. When it comes to Intel HD Graphics Processor you’ll see a 3x improvement for gaming on-the-go. Intel showed us a gaming demo where they played Overwatch on a gaming laptop with a Full HD display with medium image quality settings and was getting above 30 FPS without a discrete graphics solution! When it comes to 4K UHD content the PC is still the better device for consuming, creating and working with that media.  This is because PC’s have large screens, powerful processors, large fast storage locally, great software and the best input devices around. Intel now has updated their dedicated media engine (video decode) on the 7th Gen Kaby Lake processor that will make it easier than ever to create and share 4K content. Intel moved from VP8 to VP9 (decode) and HEVC 10-bit decode/encode capability in 7th Gen processors. This is because 25 Billion hours of video content has been watched on Youtube thanks to the VP9 codec and all of that was in HD. This means Intel had to move to a more efficient codec as the 6th Gen Skylake processors only supported AVC and VP8 on video content up to 108oP on hardware. Anything over 1080P was done with software on Skylake. On the new 7th Gen Kaby Lake processors this can now be done in hardware with the new updated media block. Intel showed a demo where an employee shot multiple short 4K movies on a personal vacation that he wanted to edit with MAGIX Fastcut video editing software. His seven video clips totaled 55 minutes in length and were 23.6GB of data. Using an Intel laptop powered by an Intel 7th Gen processors he was able to create a 30 second preview of the single video he created almost real time. The preview was uncompressed video that was dynamically pulled together from the video, so he can edit in basically real-time until he was happy with the brightness of the clips. On a 5-year old PC this would take minutes if not hours to apply the changes and then be able to watch the clip. What changes did Intel do to make processor graphics better? All of the 7th Gen Intel Core processors have at least GT2 graphics (Gen9 Graphics with 24 EU’s) that debuted on Skylake, but with additional improvements. Typically you have a bunch of fixed function units outside the the rendering compute engine and those are called unslice. Intel has placed more media engines (functions) on the slice. In the slide above the two purple boxes that have been highlighted by the green box shows that Intel has improved the Multi-Format Codex (MFX) and the Video Quality Engine (VQE). Here are more details on the updated areas highlighted by the green box in the previous slide. The Multi-Format Codec (MFX) ‘box’ has the traditional decoder and multi-format legacy support. Intel still sees the AVC codec still being used for the next 3-5 years and sees no value to remove it from onslice. HEVC 8-bit decode was first added with 6th Gen processors, so the key new feature added was 10-bit HEVC encode/decode as well as VP9 encode to the MFX block. Why is Intel not supporting VP9 10-bit encode? Google has not finalized the VP9 10-bit encode spec, so Intel is waiting on that. The Video Quality Engine (VQE) that was first introduced on 4th Gen processors now has wide color gamut (Rec.2020) support and High Dynamic Range (HDR) to Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) Tone Mapping Supporting. This is the engine that normally handles image processing features are done (deinterlacing, noise reduction, color enhancement, color corrections and so on). Intel has also power optimized this engine and it only used 40-50 mW of power. By supporting HDR and and wide color gamut it should ensure the best experience on 4K HDR panels. This slide shows the capability of what 7th Gen processors. The high-throughut decoder has always supporting multi-stream, but now you have support for up to eight 4Kp30 multi-stream AVC & HEVC decode support. Intel is ready for premium 4Kp60 content at 120Mbps as well on both the 4.5W Y-series and 15W U-series 7th Gen processors. Ready for a real world example about how these improvements matter? One of the largest end user benefits from all this is power consumption. On the 6th Gen Intel Core processors, Intel is using a hybrid decode that uses both the GPU and CPU to run a 4K HEVC 10-bit local video. You’d be using about 50% of the processor to run the clip and the average power draw on the CPU/GPU you are looking at 10.2W on a system using the Intel Core i7-6500U processor. On the new 7th Gen Intel Core Processor you are using basically none of the processor since the decode is all being down in the media block and the CPU/GPU power draw is just 0.5W on an Intel Core i7-7500U processor. (Intel was using Tears of Steel in 4K to get these performance numbers.) This is a 20x improvement in CPU/GPU power and best of all you are looking at up to 2.6x longer battery life when doing local 4K video playback! What about 4K content that isn’t local? If you go to Youtube today and are using the Chrome browser you’ll be feed a 4K video stream with VP9. The benefits of VP9 would be high quality at over half the bit rate of h.264. An Intel Core i7-6500U used 5.8W of power on the CPU/GPU versus 0.8W of power on the Intel Core i7-7500U. This means you can do 4K UHD video streaming and have ‘All Day 4K’ battery life. You also have enough performance  to run multiple 4K 360 content streams, so you have multiple UHD video stream friendly mobile devices right around the corner! One other benefits of the 14nm+ technology is that Intel was able to get 400-500MHz higher boost clocks thanks to all the small changes they made while the power envelope remains the same. Before an Intel Core i7-6500U would boost up to 3,100 MHz with Intel Speed Shift Technology. The new Intel Core i7-7500U stabilizes out at 3,500 MHz and gets to that speed sooner, so system responsiveness should be better than ever. 7th Gen processors reach maximum clock frequencies in just 15 millseconds! How does this impact real life usages? Intel likes using WebXPRT for responsiveness as does image manipulation and stuff that really happens in real life. They are seeing up to 19% performance gains and most of that is coming from the higher clock speeds (3.1GHz on the 6500U and 3.5GHz on the 7500U). When it comes to a productivity benchmark Intel went with SYSMark 2014 and showed up to a 12% performance improvement due to mainly the higher clock speeds. Intel is also updating the badges that they place on systems, so rather than just showing Core i3/i5/i7 on the sticker it will now also include the generation of the processor. Kaby Lake Die Shot So, to wrap this up… 7th Generation Intel Core processors built on the 14nm+ process technology are Intel’s most scalable yet and were designed for the immersive internet. Intel is seeing up to 15x performance gains to create and share 4K content and up to 70% faster productivity. With 7th Gen Processors you’ll be able to take premium Hollywood content on the road with you and the ability to enjoy content on the web in new ways with multi-streaming and 360 degree video. The higher boost clock speeds are exciting to see and we can’t wait to see the new 7th Generation Intel Core U and Y series processors come out in September. We are also excited to see the new desktop processors when they debut in 2017! Intel appears to be ready for the immersive web with gobs of 4K content, so hopefully we’ll see more mobile devices with 4K UHD displays on them when the new devices come to market. Intel put a ton of emphasis on 4K content as they put significant time and effort into the media block improvements on their 7th Gen Kaby Lake processors. We are fully aware that 4K content is becoming more popular, but not many people have 4K displays right now. The clock frequency improvements are great to see as getting 400-500 MHz higher boost clocks without raising the power envelope is impressive for both mobile and desktop users (The Intel Core i7-7700K is rumored to have a base clock of 4.2GHz and a boost clock of 4.5GHz). If you have a Broadwell or Skylake system that you’ve bought in the past couple of years you might not have the upgrade itch, but if you haven’t updated your PC in 3+ years, the number of reasons to upgrade are most certainly adding up. Greg Zeng Good to see than some technologists believe that we can stop global warming by using new technologies. In the Linux world, I have so many enemies who claim that it is better to restore old technology with Linux, instead of using energy-efficient technologies. turnipweed Well,,, if you’re a few generations behind, such a small boost in speed and graphics technology is useful. If you’re an early adopter, this may be a little disappointing. Jason Kane TLDNR. Short version…3 to 5 % performance boost over Skylake. Move along, nothing of interest here.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Intel unveils Kaby Lake, its first post-“tick-tock” CPU architecture New 7th-generation Core CPUs have a lot in common with the 6th generation. by Andrew Cunningham - Aug 30, 2016 1:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 145 Intel Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs are starting to come out now. Intel Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs are starting to come out now. Intel A labeled Kaby Lake die shot. Intel The Y-series CPU package is the same as Skylake—the CPU/GPU die is on the left, and the chipset die is on the right. Intel The larger U-series package. Chipset on the left, CPU/GPU die on the right. Both chips can be dropped into existing Skylake designs. Intel Low-voltage mobile parts are coming out now, and more powerful CPUs will follow in January. Intel Increases in clock speed and some other tweaks will deliver Intel's standard 10-15 percent year-over-year performance gains in most cases. Intel Intel says Kaby Lake chips can ramp their clock speed up slightly faster than Skylake could. Intel The 14nm process has been optimized somewhat, though it's still not as big a deal as the move to 10nm would be. Intel The GPU is only changing a little, and those changes are confined mostly to 4K-related media encoding and decoding. Intel Kaby will encode and decode 10-bit HEVC video, and it can decode 8-bit VP9 video. Intel Doing so dramatically reduces the amount of CPU power needed to play this video, which some of the lower-end Skylake chips couldn't play at all. Intel More media playback details. Intel Details on the specific kinds of 4K streams Kaby Lake can handle. Intel’s tick-tock model may be dead, but the PC industry still demands new hardware every year. Many PC models are refreshed once a year or so, and that means that the PC makers need new stuff to put into those computers whether or not the laws of physics want to comply. Enter “Kaby Lake,” the first of Intel’s post-tick-tock processor architectures. Kaby (rhymes with baby, named for a lake in Canada) first appeared on Intel’s public roadmaps in mid-2015 when the company realized that Cannonlake and its attendant 10nm manufacturing process wouldn’t be ready in time. No major architecture has changed, and Intel is still using a tweaked version of its 14nm manufacturing process, so most changes are relatively minor and built to serve a particular market niche.

Today, we’re getting dual-core low-voltage processors, the kind you’d find in thin-and-light consumer laptops. The first Kaby systems are slated to ship in September, and you’ll see lots of new laptops at IFA next week. Desktop CPUs and other higher-performance chips, including those with Intel Iris GPUs, will be announced in January around CES. A tiny tiny “tick” In 2014, when Intel’s 14nm process delays were holding up the Broadwell architecture, the company released a lineup of “Haswell refresh” processors that used small clock speed increases to outrun 2013’s original Haswell chips. Kaby Lake, despite a handful of changes and improvements, is only a slightly bigger deal. First off, none of these mobile CPUs will include new chipsets, which means you’ll get the same connectivity options as before. The 100-series chipsets should still be more than adequate for most people, but they’re missing things like 10Gbps USB 3.1 gen 2, to say nothing of Thunderbolt. On the plus side, the lack of huge changes means that Kaby Lake chips can easily be dropped into existing Skylake designs, something that will help PC makers get Kaby Lake systems on the shelves in a hurry. Kaby’s biggest advertised feature is improved support for 4K. All Kaby Lake integrated GPUs will support hardware-accelerated decoding and encoding of 10-bit HEVC/H.265 video streams and decoding of 8-bit VP9 streams. If you don’t already know, supporting hardware acceleration for certain codecs means that the GPU (usually via a dedicated media block) handles all the processing instead of the CPU. Not only does this use a fraction of the power that a CPU uses to accomplish the same task, but it frees the CPU cores up to do other things. HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 are also supported, which (respectively) enable 4K output at 60Hz over an HDMI cable and provide the DRM required to carry an encrypted 4K signal from the thing that’s playing it to the screen that will show it. The maximum supported DisplayPort version remains 1.2, however, dashing the hopes of anyone who wants to drive a 5K display at 60Hz over a single cable using DisplayPort 1.3. The biggest improvement from an architectural/manufacturing standpoint is something Intel is calling “14nm+,” an optimized version of the same process node used for both Broadwell and Skylake. The company isn’t sharing many details—Intel says that 14nm+ has an “improved fin profile” and “improved transistor channel strain,” for what that’s worth. But the changes are said to improve the performance of the transistors by about 12 percent. As Intel’s manufacturing processes stick around for longer, it makes sense that the company would spend more time optimizing them rather than just moving on to the next process as it has historically done. Foundries have been known to use multiple versions of a given process, so it’s not entirely unheard of. CPU and GPU speed improvements come mostly from clock speed increases rather than architectural improvements, as they did in the Haswell refresh. Intel promises 12- to 19-percent better CPU performance over Skylake chips sold at the same price, which is commensurate with the speeds and prices laid out below. Intel claims “double-digit” GPU performance improvements in the Y-series parts and 8- to 10-percent improvements in the U-series parts. Small launch, simple lineup (for now) Today’s launch includes just six chips, three each from the Y- and U-series. As Intel adds vPro and Iris CPUs and other faster and slower options, its lineup will inevitably become more complicated. That’s what always happens. But right now Intel’s CPU lineup is refreshingly simple to explain, so let’s enjoy it while it lasts! Intel The three Y-series chips. Intel The three Y-series chips. Intel The three U-series chips. Intel The chipsets come with both Y- and U-series chips. They're still solid, but they're also identical to the Skylake chipsets. For the third time in as many years, Intel is changing how it refers to its 4.5W Y-series chips. Broadwell changed the name from Core i3, i5, and i7 to simply “Core M.” Skylake split the Core M lineup into Core m3, m5, and m7 families. And Kaby Lake keeps m3 but changes m5 back to i5 and m7 back to i7. Regardless of branding changes, Y-series Kaby processors are all easily identified by their model number and their 4.5W TDP (configurable up to 7W for systems with the heat dissipation to handle it and down to 3.5W for smaller, thinner devices with less headroom). The kinds of devices where you find Core M chips today—fanless laptops, convertible tablets, and Compute Sticks—won’t change. The U-series are still run-of-the-mill mainstream dual-core parts and will likely remain the most widely used parts in mainstream $500-and-up laptops and boutique Ultrabooks like Dell’s XPS 13 or HP’s Spectre 13. The U-series chips are still i3, i5, and i7, and Intel’s processor badges for both Y- and U-series CPUs will all pick up a “7th gen” label to distinguish them from models with older parts. All the CPUs have model numbers in the 7000 series, compared to 6000 for Skylake, 5000 for Broadwell, and so on. The GPUs for the Y- and U-series are now called the Intel HD 615 and 620, respectively. With the model numbers and CPU speeds in hand, we can compare the new Kaby Lake parts to their Skylake counterparts to see what kind of clock speed increases we can expect. Year-over-year improvements Skylake m3-6Y30 (900MHz, 2.2GHz Turbo) m5-6Y54 (1.1GHz, 2.7GHz Turbo) m7-6Y75 (1.2GHz, 3.1GHz Turbo) i3-6100U (2.3GHz) i5-6200U (2.3GHz, 2.8GHz Turbo) i7-6500U (2.5GHz, 3.1GHz Turbo) Kaby Lake m3-7Y30 (1.0GHz, 2.6GHz Turbo) i5-7Y74 (1.2GHz, 3.2GHz Turbo) i7-7Y75 (1.3GHz, 3.6GHz Turbo) i3-7100U (2.4GHz) i5-7200U (2.5GHz, 3.1GHz Turbo) i7-7500U (2.7GHz, 3.5GHz Turbo) Base increase 100MHz (11%) 100MHz (9%) 100MHz (8.33%) 100MHz (4.33%) 200MHz (8.7%) 200MHz (8%) Turbo increase 400MHz (18%) 500MHz (18.5%) 500MHz (16%) N/A 300MHz (10.7%) 400MHz (13%) Given that nearly all of Kaby Lake's improvements are going to come from clock speed boosts, these numbers actually look pretty good. Even when Intel changes architectures and processes these days you normally only get 10 to 15 percent more CPU performance year-over-year, and Kaby Lake delivers that most of the time. That said, the biggest increases are reserved for the Turbo Boost speeds, and those can be hard to rely on in the real world. Intel's CPUs are only designed to operate in Turbo Boost mode for short bursts of time, falling back to slower speeds when the PC they're in can no longer dissipate enough heat. Especially in thin-and-light Y-series laptops with no fans, processors will probably not maintain their top speeds for long. In short, Kaby Lake CPUs may still be significantly faster than equivalent Skylake chips, but how fast depends more heavily than usual on your workload and the design of the laptop. Once we begin testing actual Kaby Lake systems, we should get a better idea of how things play out in practice. Coming soon(ish): High performance and newer chipsets The Kaby Lake lineup will be made whole in early 2017 when quad-core desktop and mobile parts hit the market. Those processors will include new chipsets, though socketed Kaby processors should be able to fit into existing 100-series motherboards after a BIOS update. As Intel’s first “optimization” release in its new product development cycle, Kaby Lake is a bit underwhelming. Chip design takes time—Intel tells us that some of Skylake’s features were in development for five years—and Kaby Lake is obviously something Intel had to come up with on short notice once the company knew just how long the 14nm and 10nm transitions were going to take. In future “optimization” years—when we get chips that have the same amount of lead time as the “process” and “architecture” designs—I expect the improvements to be more significant. If you’re thinking of buying a new PC soon but don’t need one today, Kaby Lake includes enough improvements that you might as well wait for it to roll out. But if you just bought a Skylake system or need a new PC today and you don’t have very specific 4K-related needs, you don’t have much to gain by going with Kaby Lake.

Kaby Lake processors explained, 4K media focus Mike Lowe30 August 2016Laptops Intel Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Year on year Intel is committed to updating its Intel Core processors, with the latest seventh-generation chip even bearing a "7th Gen" badge its visual marketing and on-shelf positioning. Perhaps that's no surprise when you hear people talking about the product's Kaby Lake codename - preceding was Skylake in 2015, Broadwell in 2014 - and wondering "what the heck?". So what's Intel Core 7th Gen Kaby Lake all about, which processor arrangement is right for you, and is it that much better than last year's Skylake chipset? Intel Core 7th Gen: Speed gains The goal of new processors is, typically, to go one faster than the previous generation. Kaby Lake is built on the same 14-nanometre (nm) architecture as Skylake, so the performance gains are only marginal this time around: with a 300-400mHz gain anticipated by the company increasing the range of several frequencies. It won't be until the next push in architecture, with the 10nm Cannonlake, that we'll see additional performance increases. Intel Core 7th Gen: 4K media handling What is really new about Kaby Lake is the addition of a dedicated media engine. This is a new aspect to the processor, designed for power-efficiency and additional performance, is targeted particularly at better experiences with 4K content. Intel says it will deliver "improved media experiences with HEVC 10-bit and VP9" - both of which are the codecs that handle 4K content. Intel Core 7th Gen: Battery life Intel cites "adaptive performance" as a key function of 7th Gen, the ability to take read inputs from simple factors - say, ambient temperature, or orientation to acknowledge when a device is in a docked position - to determine how long it can sustain Turbo Boost (faster speed), to improve overall performance. That's not a brand new feature, but it's a wider implementation, says Intel. Battery life for 7th Gen is said to be "similar" to 6th Gen, but should show considerable improvements for 4K consumption: stream YouTube 4K for 7-hours rather than 4-hours, for a 1.75x improvement, is Intel's claim. Intel Core 7th Gen: What of Core M? Intel's fanless (and thus silent) Intel Core M is designed for low-power mobile use. Until now it's been available in M3, M5 and M7 configurations - the higher the number the greater the performance - but the top-end M7 is getting axed for 2016's 7th Gen run. Instead we'll see a fanless 4.5W Core i7 Y in its place. Intel Core 7th Gen: Which processor is right for you? Key to 7th Gen is that it's a "scalable and adaptable" architecture. There are multiple aspects to consider here: clock speed performance, which increases up the range of i3, i5 and i7 processors; cores, with single-core, dual-core, quad-core (and potentially more paired for higher-performance arrangements - but Intel is saying nothing more just yet); and the letter-based market segmentation - Y, U, H, S and X - which defines a product's positioning and form factor (often a balance of performance to heat output to power consumption, as suited). Y targets 2-in-1s, tablets for mobile-based use (low-consumption 4.5W), with 7th Gen available from September 2016; U targets ultra-slim laptops and portables; H is a more powerful step-up again, typically with additional cores; S, is designed for desktop iterations (hence its 65W draw); and Extreme Edition (X), which is the premium, gaming-targeted super-processor, available from 2017. Intel Core 7th Gen: Wrap-up In summary, then, Intel Core 7th Gen processors are Intel's bid for 4K media consumption. As Kaby Lake architecture is the same 14nm as the previous-gen Skylake, however, don't expect huge speed improvements this time around. Instead it's a focus on media and gains in efficiency. Hopefully it'll be the end of choppy, stuttery 4K playback, making a better world for all. And come 2017 we'll get to see the gains made in top-end setups too.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Meet Intel 7th Gen Core, the 4K, VR-ready “Kaby Lake” processors Chris Davies - Aug 30, 2016 4 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If we’re post-PC, nobody told Intel: the chip company has higher hopes than ever for the computer – albeit in a range of form-factors – running its new 7th Gen “Kaby Lake” Core processors, officially announced today. With headline 7th Gen vs 6th Gen improvements including swifter, less power-intensive media playback and processing, the ability to do serious gaming on the move, and broader support for next-generation interconnects like Thunderbolt and USB-C plus security features like Windows Hello, Intel sees Kaby Lake as more than just a speed bump. “At its core the PC is the consummate Darwinian machine,” Navin Shenoy, general manager of the client computing group at Intel, argues. “It’s constantly adapting to the changes around us.” Just as we’re not entirely sure about the path of animal evolution, mind, neither is the future of the PC quite clear. Intel is betting on its vision of a 4K-obsessed, frequently gaming-on-the-go future, and as with previous chip launches it’s the mobile version of that which is getting fresh silicon first. Mobile processors spanning the 4.5W to 15W range and targeting 2-in-1s and ultrathin notebooks for both consumers and businesses will arrive first; in fact, the chips are in mass production now, Intel says, and will be made available to manufacturing partners in September. There are already “hundreds” of designs based on Kaby Lake expected to launch in Q4 2016, according to Chris Walker, general manage row mobile client platforms at Intel. Come January 2017, meanwhile, there’ll be performance gaming and VR mobile chips, in addition to desktop processors for both consumer and enterprise use, including models supporting vPro. That should open the door for another 350 expected designs to come to market, Intel predicts, across multiple form factors. On paper, you might question exactly what has changed. Like the 6th Gen chips they’re built on 14nm processes, and indeed the 7th Generation uses the same Skylake architecture, albeit “with enhancements,” Intel says. It’s those enhancements which will make the difference. There’ll only be a roughly 300-400 MHz clock speed increase, and battery life for mobile products based on the 7th Gen processors will be roughly the same, but Intel claims the overall system is far more efficient. In fact, there’s a double-digit performance gain in mobile compared to last year, going by Intel’s benchmarks. Year on year, comparing the 6th Gen i7-6500U to the 7th Gen i7-7500U, the company’s tests show a 12-percent improvement in productivity apps and 19-percent in everyday tasks such as browsing, photo editing, and email. That’s down to things like improved interconnect performance, and a claimed 12-percent improvement in efficiency at the transistor level. Year on year upgraders aren’t where Intel sees the greatest number of customers coming from, however. As before, it’s pulling out research suggesting that most people who’ll be considering a 7th Gen based machine will in fact be upgrading from a five year old PC There, unsurprisingly, the gains are even more significant. Compared to that five year old PC, a new model with a comparable tier chip should be 1.7x faster at those work tasks, and an incredible 8.6x faster at creating, editing, and sharing 4K UHD and 360 videos. Looking at a new Core i5-7200U based laptop versus a Core i5-2467M from half a decade ago, the 7th Gen model is 15x faster at creating 4K video highlights. In fact, Intel says, the new chips can do it in nearly real time – figure on around 37 seconds for a 30 second clip, software depending – while converting an hour-long 4K video takes approximately twelve minutes in contrast to 85+ minutes on the old system. It’s partly down to the new media engine, which Intel built on the Gen9 graphics architecture. There’s a dedicated media engine for video decoding, designed both for power efficiency and supporting parallel engines for greater performance throughput. Everyday users should see the impact in 10-bit HEVC and VP9 video, not to mention power consumption during playback; indeed, Intel predicts around 75-percent better battery life when playing VP9 footage compared to the old chips. Even how turbo state use is managed will get smarter. Intel will use a broader range of sensor input – including from the accelerometer and thermometers – to figure out the ambient thermal temperature; if you still have headroom for comfortable, safe use, you’ll be able to stay in the turbo state for longer. There’ll be branding changes, too. For a start, Intel will be labeling the chip badges with “7th Gen”, and there’ll no longer be Core m7 or m5 models: instead, they’ll just be known as Core i5 or Core i7, because Intel argues they don’t sacrifice performance. Initially, the range will include Core m3, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 chips. NOW READ: Intel bets on cordless VR with Project Alloy headset Meanwhile, Intel expects to see twice the number of designs as before offering Thunderbolt connectivity – 120+ at initial count – and 100+ with Windows Hello support. 50+ of the systems on the roadmap will have 4K UHD displays, and 25+ will support pen input. Figure on less of a hit in your bag, too, with convertibles as thin as 10mm and clamshells under 10mm. Intel even teased fanless detachables under 7mm thick, and we’ll start to see the first models using Kaby Lake from September and ramping up toward the 2016 holidays.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs revealed The first fruits of a new product cycle by Jeff Kampman  8:01 AM on August 30, 2016 Moore's Law may not be dead, but it is changing. In March of this year, Intel revealed that it would be adding a third stage to its traditional tick-tock model of technical advancement. That new model, "process-architecture-optimize," began its latest swing back in August 2014 with the Broadwell architecture, Intel's first time out with its 14-nm tri-gate process. A little over a year ago, we got our first taste of the Skylake "tock,"  which ditched the fully-integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) of Haswell and Broadwell chips and introduced Intel's Gen9 integrated graphics to the world, among other refinements. The Kaby Lake die, helpfully labeled. Source: Intel Now it's time for the "optimize" part of the 14-nm show. Today, Intel is raising the curtain on its Kaby Lake (or "seventh-generation Core") CPUs. We got a clearer picture of just what this third step in the new Intel architecture life cycle means at IDF a couple weeks back, so let's dive in. Getting the most out of the 14-nm process To improve Kaby Lake's performance, Intel says it's optimized its 14-nm tri-gate process so that it can lay down taller fins with a wider gate pitch. Intel calls this improved process "14-nm plus." Those improvements result in faster-switching transistors that are good for what Intel describes as "four or five speed bins" of extra clock speed, or about 400 to 500 MHz higher Turbo frequencies at the top end of a CPU's range. Kaby Lake CPUs will also be able to hit those peak speeds faster than before, thanks to an improved version of the SpeedShift technology that first appeared in Skylake. Where a Skylake Core i7-6500U might have needed over 20 ms to hit its peak Turbo speeds, a Kaby Lake Core i7-7500U might hit its Turbo peak in under 20 ms. When Intel talks about the "responsiveness gains" of Kaby, they're referring to these SpeedShift improvements. More efficient cat-video handling Along with the process improvements, the biggest change in Kaby Lake is to the integrated GPU's media encoding block. 4K video streaming, wider color gamuts, and HDR content are all in the pipe, and Intel wants to make sure its chips are ready to handle those demands efficiently. The company notes that for a lot of younger people, the 15" screen on their notebooks is the big screen they have ready access to, and it wants to offer mobile users the opportunity to watch 4K content without draining their batteries unduly. In addition to the 1080p HEVC (also known as H.265) encode and decode capabilities of Skylake, Kaby gets 4K HEVC 10-bit encode and decode support, as well as hardware decode support for YouTube's competing VP9 format. The Multi-Format Codec block in Kaby offers better support for wireless displays and an improved quality feature for the QuickSync Video Fixed-Function mode. In practice, these improved video functions let Kaby Lake CPUs play back 4K HEVC video much more efficiently than they would be able to if they had to rely on CPU power alone, as demonstrated by the local playback graph above. The Kaby CPU only needs to consume 0.5W to do its thing, compared to the 10.2W of the Core i7-6500U. For YouTube playback with VP9, the hardware decode capability in Kaby delivers similar improvements. The seventh-gen Core CPU only needs to consume 0.8W, compared to 5.8W with the CPU alone. What isn't changing We would normally perform a deep-dive on what else has changed under the hood of these Kaby Lake CPUs here, but aside from the enhanced video decode block and the benefits of the 14-nm "Plus" process, Intel was surprisingly frank about how little generation-to-generation differences there are between the sixth-gen and seventh-gen Core processors. Kaby Lake will use the same basic execution pipeline as Skylake before it, and the guts of its Gen9 integrated graphics processor are also basically identical to what arrived with Skylake. In conversations with Intel, I confirmed we're not getting any kind of FreeSync or VESA Adaptive-Sync support with this generation of chips, either. At least from a gamer's perspective, it's hard not to be disappointed by that fact. FreeSync monitors are becoming more and more widely available, and Intel is clearly thinking about the low-end gaming market to some degree. The company devoted a considerable portion of its demo time to showing off how well a thin-and-light Kaby Lake machine could play Overwatch, and I'd be willing to bet the gameplay experience would be even better with a variable-refresh display hooked up. Sadly, that's not to be with Kaby. We'll just have to wait another year to see whether Adaptive-Sync will land in Intel CPUs, it seems. The first Kaby Lake products Intel is revealing six Kaby Lake products today: three 4.5W "Y" CPUs and three 15W "U" CPUs. Instead of trying to explain the dizzying array of features inside each of these chips, I'm just going to post Intel's full accounting of what's inside. First off, let's look at the 4.5W family of seventh-gen Core products. These are all dual-core parts with Hyper-Threading enabled. As we might expect from Intel's description of its process improvements, the highest-end 4.5W Core i7-7Y75—seriously, take the naming responsibilities for these things away from the engineers, folks—can Turbo up to 3.6GHz, compared to 3.1GHz for the Skylake Core m7-6Y75. That's an impressive improvement, especially if Intel's Adaptive Performance environmental-monitoring tech lets the chip hang out at those higher clock speeds longer. You'll also note that Intel is using the Core i5 and Core i7 designators on its higher-end 4.5W CPUs now, instead of the Core m5 and Core m7 branding. Intel says it'll be reserving the Core m brand for low-end CPUs in the Kaby family, but it otherwise seems like we'll be seeing Core i branding from top to bottom in Intel's product range. My sense is that this move might make it harder to figure out which systems have which CPUs in the already arcane notebook market, but we'll just have to pay close attention from here on out.  The 15W seventh-generation Core parts all tell a similar story. The highest-end Core i7-7500U runs 200MHz faster than the Core i7-6500U at its base speed and 400MHz faster under Turbo-friendly workloads. The Core i5-7200U gets a 200-MHz base clock boost and a 300-MHz Turbo bump over the Core i5-6200U, and the Core i3-7100U makes do with a paltry 100-MHz bump over the Core i3-6100U. This cheapest 15W Kaby part doesn't do Turbo Boost. All told, these are nice improvements across the board for these meat-and-potatoes CPUs in Intel's lineup. Along with the improved media encode and decode features in Kaby, the bumped clock speeds should give Ultrabook-class mobile PCs a little more all-around muscle for the things that regular folks do with their PCs. Expect to see Kaby-equipped notebooks roll out beginning next month. What's next The six Kaby parts we're seeing today should cover a broad swath of mainstream PC needs, but there's more in store. Intel says to expect mobile CPUs with its higher-end Iris graphics and vPro management support to arrive in January 2017. We'll also need to wait until the New Year to see desktop parts benefiting from the move to Intel's 14-nm "Plus" process, as well. Intel remained mum about the chipsets and CPUs we can expect for the desktop at IDF, although we've seen hints of the 200-series chipsets as far back as Computex. It'll be interesting to see how Intel's 14-nm process improvements translate to the higher TDPs where enthusiast processors roam. If we can peer into our crystal balls for a moment, today's Kaby news might be most disappointing for Apple fans. The company's highest-end MacBook Pros rely on dual- and quad-core CPUs with eDRAM and Iris graphics on board, and those products are nowhere to be found in this first round of Kaby releases. Some MacBook Pros already feature Broadwell parts, but the highest-end quad-core MBPs still rely on Haswell Crystal Well CPUs. Unless Apple is intending to take the MacBook Pro in a more mainstream direction, we wouldn't expect to see updated versions of the company's highest-end laptop until next year, at the earliest. If that's the case, we'll have an exciting January to look forward to. 159 comments Email the author(s): Jeff Kampman Sign up to receive notices when we publish new articles Or go back to TR's front page Related Articles AMD crests Summit Ridge with Ryzen CPUs 365 AMD unwraps its seventh-generation desktop APUs and AM4 platform 81 AMD gives us our first real moment of Zen 411 Intel boosts the high-end desktop with its Broadwell-E CPUs 221 Intel's Core i7-6700K 'Skylake' processor reviewed 489 AMD's Carrizo brings power savings to mainstream laptops 83 Intel's Broadwell goes broad with new desktop, mobile, server variants 167 The TR Podcast bonus video: AMD, Zen, Fiji, and more 54 Tags: CPUs 159 comments View full site Copyright ©1999-2017 The Tech Report.

This latest platform is built via an improved 14nm manufacturing; it’s also the third architecture based on this 14nm process. What is Kaby Lake? Meet Intel’s new baby, Kaby Lake. Note the size of the GPU section Kaby Lake is a third generation chip made on the 14nm manufacturing process and probably the last. It’s also the seventh generation chip in Intel’s Core i series of CPUs. Intel has been following a tick-tock upgrade cycle for a while now, but with the 14nm process, they shifted to a PAO (Process Architecture Optimisation) system. Tick-tock essentially introduced a new manufacturing process in the tick, then optimised it by the tock. The second, fourth and sixth generation Intel CPUs comprise the ‘tock’. With PAO, Intel adds another step, where they further optimise and enhance the results of a ‘tock’ cycle. A representation of the Intel U series Kaby Lake chip While Intel didn’t reveal a whole lot about their entire line-up, it did share a great deal about its Y and U series mobile platform. Intel sums it up best when they say that the focus of Kaby Lake is the “immersive web.” All you performance junkies and overclockers can stop reading right now though. Intel made no mention of their K series SKUs and Kaby Lake’s desktop variants. The only thing you really need to know is that the CPUs are socket compatible with the previous generation. Details of an Intel i7 7700K were leaked some time ago, but performance figures are lacking. The immersive web Source: Intel Intel’s entire pitch for Kaby Lake revolves around the fact that the future’s the internet and the future of the internet is video. They expect to see an increasing amount of 4K content and even 4K 360-degree video. If everyone’s going to be watching video, one might as well optimise for video. Source: Intel While Skylake, the previous generation architecture, was perfectly comfortable dealing with FHD video content, its power consumption for 4K decoding is very high. Kaby Lake incorporates dedicated hardware channels for HEVC 10-bit and VP9 video codecs, making for extremely efficient 4K rendering and editing. Source: Intel Intel claims that Kaby Lake will be capable of rendering multiple 4K video streams while still allowing you to work or browse the web. They also add that the impact to battery life will be minimal. In fact, they claim up to 2.6 times the battery life when playing back 4K video, as compared to Skylake. If the data they provided is correct, we’ve no reason to doubt them, Kaby Lake uses barely 0.5W on average to decode a 4K video, while Skylake would require 10W of power. Performance boost Source: Intel Compared to Skylake, Intel claims that Kaby Lake will offer a 12 percent bump in productivity and a 19 percent bump in web browsing tasks. Source: Intel The boost in web browsing is notable because Intel says that Kabe Lake uses an improved version of Speed Shift, which is more efficient at boosting performance for very short periods, a performance burst if you will, which is extremely useful in web browsing scenarios. Source: Intel Intel states that part of this bump is down to the higher clock-speeds that they’re able to extract from the new manufacturing process. The rest can be attributed to overall platform improvements (such as HEVC and VP9 support). Most of these comparisons were between an Intel i5 6500U and an Intel 7500U. When compared to Sandy Bridge, a 5-year old architecture, Intel claims a performance bump of 70 percent and a 3.5x improvement in graphics performance. Features Along with the usual Intel bells and whistles, Kaby Lake will support PCIe Gen 3.0, which offers higher bandwidth when compared to the previous iteration (8GT/s vs 5GT/s). PCIe-based SSDs should benefit the most from this. All Intel Core m series, Y series and U series chipsets will be dual-core CPUs with support for 4 threads via hyperthreading. The rest of the architecture remains very similar to Skylake. Source: Intel Judging by what Intel has told us so far, it’s clear that Kaby Lake will greatly benefit mobile devices (laptops, 2-in-1s, etc.). Since 4K content is still sparse, the average user will probably not notice much of an improvement in performance, especially if they’re on Broadwell or Skylake. For the high-end desktop user though, the performance rewards will also be less tangible, especially since battery life is not an issue. Obviously, if you’re still on an older generation platform like Sandy-Bridge, it’s high time you upgraded.

The App Manager in the Device Portal, managing Windows 10 IoT Core on Raspberry Pi 30 Aug 2016 at 09:33, Tim Anderson Hands on Microsoft has released Windows 10 Anniversary for IoT Core, a version of Windows which runs on Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, Dragonboard or Minnowboard. The company has also announced support for Intel Joule, an Internet of Things (IoT) compute module launched at the August 2016 Intel Developer Forum, though Windows software for this is not yet publicly available. As I type, I am watching Windows 10 IoT Core apply a system update on a Raspberry Pi 3. It is taking ages, whereas when I have done Linux updates on a Pi it is generally quicker and does not require a reboot. I also experienced a number of annoyances in a brief hands-on, with failure dialogue boxes from the browser-based dashboard and oddities such as a refusal to set the keyboard layout to other than “English (United States)”; I selected a different keyboard, the screen went grey, then came back without changing it. Oddly, this worked fine when done later in a remote session. This is Windows, then, but there are some attractions. In particular, you can build applications in Visual Studio using C#, C++ or a variety of other languages; you can enrol IoT Core devices for management with System Center Configuration Manager; and you can easily connect IoT Core with Azure services for processing data. The way Microsoft presents IoT Core is puzzling. It seems to have two goals in mind; one is to support the hobbyist “Maker” community in order to attract developers to its platform, and the other is to provide large businesses with an end-to-end IoT solution. It is the latter which has most business potential, but go to Microsoft’s Windows 10 IoT Core developer site and you see sample applications with a hobbyist feel, such as an Air Hockey Robot and a connected clock radio. In essence, Windows 10 IoT Core is a cut-down version of Windows designed either to run headless with long-running applications that talk to sensors or other devices and send the data for processing, or to run a Windows UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application with a graphical interface. Only one UWP application can be in the foreground. On IoT Core, it is also possible to run a special kind of UMP “Background app”, without a GUI, for long-running tasks. You can configure an app to run at startup, and in fact the home screen is itself a UWP App, called IoT Core Default App, for which you can download the code from GitHub and perhaps fix the keyboard configuration bug I ran into. Microsoft has evolved the platform considerably since I last looked at it, over a year ago. There is now an IoT Dashboard application which is meant to simplify getting started. Provided you have an SD card reader, the application will download the operating system and write it to the card, configuring it with your choice of device name and administrator password. You can also automatically provision an Azure connection using the IoT Hub, for managing and communicating with multiple devices. Remote Desktop to a Pi running Windows 10 IoT Core Another new piece is the Windows IoT Remote Client, which runs on any Windows 10 PC, tablet or phone. As the name implies, this is a remote desktop to your device. In practice, a remote PowerShell session is generally more useful, unless you write an application with a graphical user interface. I had a few hassles with both PowerShell and the Remote Client. In order to get PowerShell remoting working, you have to follow a few steps to start the WinRM service and add the Pi to TrustedHosts, before you can run the magic Enter-PsSession command. You will probably need to do this if you want to try the Remote Client, because the Remote Client requires the Remote Server to be running on the Pi. Although you should be able to enable this via the browser-based dashboard (called the Device Portal), it gave me an error when I tried, and this seems to be common. The solution is to add a scheduled task to run the NanoRDP task on boot, using PowerShell. I did this but it does not quite work, and I have to manually run the task in PowerShell before the Remote Client will connect, and even then it does not always work. There is also now a command prompt built into the default app, though to enable this you need to type some PowerShell to add a registry key, otherwise it comes up with “Access Denied” when you try to run cmd.exe. Once done, this makes an interactive logon considerably more useful than before. Microsoft has also added Store integration, though it is not what you are used to on desktop Windows 10. Installing an application from the Store is a multi-step process involving the Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer, creating a package, and then copying it to a special folder on the device before rebooting. You can also pre-install compatible Store apps when creating the initial OS image. The real advantage is that Store apps get automatic updates, simplifying maintenance once deployed. Microsoft describes another new feature as “multiple foreground app support”. This means you can write launcher applications, such as a Start screen. There is also now support for an IoTivity AllJoyn Device System Bridge. Both AllJoyn and IoTivity are frameworks for connecting and controlling devices. Windows supports AllJoyn, but the bridge enables interaction with IoTivity devices. Windows IoT Core running on a Raspberry Pi is a neat platform and it is easy to see its potential, especially for businesses with .NET development skills and Azure accounts. It is not an alternative to Linux if you want a full-features OS on a Pi, but could be used for all sorts of home automation, robotics or multimedia projects. Considering the importance of stability and low maintenance overhead for an IoT platform, it is a shame I ran into so many annoyances in the initial setup, leading to an impression that it is not yet ready for business. That said, it may be fine once you have got your application working and deployed. Visual Studio integration works well. One last thought: with Microsoft’s efforts to get .NET Core working on Linux, it is reasonable to wonder whether that alternative route to bringing IoT on devices, such as the Pi, into the Windows and .NET ecosystem may, in the end, be more productive. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 88 Comments More from The Register Dyn Dyn Dyn – we have a buyer: Oracle gobbles Internet of Things DDoS victim Scoops up Twitter with A-list DNS customer list 19 Comments Microsoft drops OMI for Linux to GitHub Management for Penguin-powered things, phones, and other skinny stuff 4 Comments Bluetooth 5.0 emerges, ready to chew on the internet of things Gentlemen, we can rebuild it.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak Kaby Lake based Xeon E3 1200 v6 Processor Lineup Leaked – Features Clock Speed Upgrades and Power Efficiency Improvements By Usman Pirzada Posted Aug 30, 2016 86Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel’s Kaby Lake is the third step in Intel’s PAO (Process, Architecture, and Optimization) philosophy and the Xeon E3 1200 counterparts of the same have been leaked out. Featuring the v6 designation the Xeon E3-1200 v6 lineup boasts the Kaby Lake architecture and improved clock rates over their former Skylake based counterparts – they will remain however, for the time being, quad core processors. Xeon E3 1200 v6 Kaby Lake SKU lineup leaked – landing soon The Xeon E3-1200 v6 series lineup is being led by the Xeon E3-1280 v6 which boasts a clock speed of up to 3.9 Ghz – this is an increase of almost 200 Mhz over its predecessor, which when coupled with the architectural gains involved here (which should be less than 5%) will mean significant speedups in enterprise scenarios. The TDP is set at 74W and a cache of 8MB is shared between the 4 cores. It is also worth noting here that we do not know for sure what chipset the processors will support. Usually, with every release of a E3 1200 iteration, support for the previous chipset is discontinued. It remains to be seen whether this is the case here as well. Then come the Xeon E3-1270 v6, Xeon E3-1240 v6 and Xeon E3-1230 v6. The clock speeds of these processors are 3.8 Ghz, 3.7 Ghz and 3.5 Ghz respectively. Just like the 1280 v6 this is a significant speed up from their predecessors with clock upgrades of 200 Mhz, 200 Mhz and 100 Mhz respectively. The cache for the entire lineup remains at 8 MB shared and the TDP remains fixed at 74W. It is worth adding here that the TDP itself is also an architectural upgrade over Skylake – which featured a fixed TDP of 80W. Advertisement And while this may not seem like much to the laymen you are actually looking at a performance/watt increase of 13-15% which can make a huge difference in enterprise scenarios. Lastly, we have the Xeon E3-1220  v6 processor which does not have hyper threading enabled so you are looking at 4 cores and 4 threads. The clock speed remains 3.0 Ghz just like its predecessor while the TDP has gone down to 74W. Lastly we have the special edition Xeon chips which end in the “5” digit – including the Xeon E3-1275 v6, Xeon E3-1245 v6 and Xeon E3This indicates that the chip has an integrated iGPU and in the case of Skylake this was the Intel HD graphics P530. With Kabylake this is probably going to rock the updated configuration with Gen9 architecture. Because of the increased TDP requirements of having a GPU onboard these processors have a TDP of 78W.  The clock speeds remain more or less the same only the Xeon E3-1225 v6 processor features an upgraded clock speed of 3.3 Ghz. SKU Name Core/Threads Base Clock Cache Graphics TDP Xeon E3-1280 v6 4/8 3.9 Ghz 8MB GT0 74W Xeon E3-1270 v6 4/8 3.8 Ghz 8MB GT0 74W Xeon E3-1240 v6 4/8 3.7 Ghz 8MB GT0 74W Xeon E3-1230 v6 4/8 3.5 Ghz 8MB GT0 74W Xeon E3-1220 v6 4/4 3.0 Ghz 8MB GT0 74W Xeon E3-1275 v6 4/8 3.8 Ghz 8MB GT2 78W Xeon E3-1245 v6 4/8 3.7 Ghz 8MB GT2 78W Xeon E3-1225 v6 4/4 3.3 Ghz 8MB GT2 78W Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Here's what you need to know. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Aug 29, 2016 at 9:23PM Image source: Getty Images. In many ways, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) are natural rivals. ARM collects royalties on billions of mobile device sales, since its technologies are at the heart of nearly every smartphone and tablet. Intel chips power the big-iron systems inside every data center. Both sides have tried to make inroads into the other's core markets, but not with much success. It's the type of epic rivalry that fuels impassioned investor inquests. Which business model is the better long-term investment, and which stock should you buy today? However, these questions have boiled down to a very simple answer recently. You should sell your ARM Holdings holdings and invest in Intel. It's really that simple. Game over, man. Game over! You see, ARM is not really an option anymore. In mid-July, the company accepted a buyout offer from Japanese wireless network operator SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF), which effectively took ARM shares off the market. Intel, on the other hand, remains a viable stand-alone business and a solid investment for the long term. So there's the quick and easy answer -- sell whatever ARM shares you might own in order to collect your profits, and take another look at the very investable Intel stock instead. More nuance, please Okay, so there are still a few special situations to consider. SoftBank doesn't own ARM quite yet. ARM shareholders must still approve of the merger, and the deal has to pass the usual battery of regulatory tests in the U.K. and Japan. If you expect any of these speed bumps to derail the merger process, you might want to sell ARM shares short. Anything less than a simple completion of this acquisition would undoubtedly crush ARM's share prices. However, there's little reason to make that negative bet. SoftBank does not compete with ARM in any way, shape, or form. Adding a chip technology business to a mobile network operator should raise very few antitrust concerns, paving the way toward a smooth closing. As for shareholder approval, ARM went out on a high note. The ARM buyout bid lifted ARM shares to a fresh all-time high, soaring more than 40% overnight. It's hard to ask for a better exit deal than this, and I'd be shocked if ARM shareholders gave the deal a thumbs-down. So, ARM shares are dead in the water. The only reasonable bet to make here is a negative one, and even that option looks weak. What about Intel? Of course, Intel is a better option only if you believe that the chip giant will create value on its own. Otherwise, you might as well just park your cash in the nearly immovable ARM stock (or a simple savings account) while you watch Intel shares plunge. As an Intel shareholder myself, I would disagree with that conclusion. The company has weathered some massive market storms in recent years, coming out even further ahead in the crucial data center market. Meanwhile, Intel shares are trading at very reasonable valuations such as 14.7 times trailing free cash flow and 15.4 times adjusted earnings. There's no such thing as a guaranteed winner, but Intel's risk-reward balance is positive enough to keep its place in my own real-world portfolio. If you'd still prefer to take ARM's side in this debate, you would have to consider the pros and cons of SoftBank's wireless business and global ambitions. That's a worthy line of investigation, but beyond the scope of this article. And if you don't want to pick sides at all, consider that Intel recently became an ARM partner with hopes of manufacturing ARM-based chips for other companies. From that point of view, an Intel investment is a bet on both of these tickers. Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

With Microsoft and Google among US companies tied to Ireland, industry advocate raises concern over implications of European commission’s decision Microsoft is among US tech companies with a presence in Ireland. Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Geof Wheelwright Wednesday 31 August 2016 15.07 EDT Last modified on Thursday 22 September 2016 14.01 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 4 months old America’s biggest technology companies have been taking stock of the European commission’s decision on Tuesday to order what it called “recovery of illegal state aid” for alleged unpaid taxes in Ireland from Apple of up to €13bn($14.6bn, £11bn), plus interest. Apple’s surprise, retroactive tax bill – which is believed to be the largest in history – has raised both condemnation and alarm in the technology industry, particularly for companies with a long history of operations in Ireland. According to Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council – a Washington DC-based technology industry advocacy group that counts significant multinational Irish technology players Amazon, Apple, Dell, EMC, Facebook, Google, HP, Intel and Microsoft as members – the key issue for them lies in the confusing and retroactive nature of yesterday’s decision, which applies to tax arrangements from 2003 to 2014. After Apple, the other tax deals in the European commission's sights Read more “The commission’s decision calls into question whether following the laws in an EU member state is a guarantee that you are playing by the rules in Europe,” he said. “We are deeply concerned by the commission’s departure from established channels of multilateral cooperation on tax policy in favor of a unilateral approach that, by imposing unforeseeable and retroactive penalties, risks chilling transatlantic commerce and investment and growth in the EU at the expense of US taxpayers.” Garfield cited a white paper last week from the US treasury department which expressed concern about the European commission’s approach to the issue. Even before yesterday’s final number for the retroactive tax sought against Apple, the treasury department expressed concern about the European commission’s general approach. “The Commission is seeking to recover amounts related to tax years prior to the announcement of this new approach – in effect seeking retroactive recoveries,” it stated. “Because the Commission’s approach departs from prior practice, it should not be applied retroactively.” The computing firm Dell has been a part of the Irish technology sector since 1990. Yesterday’s move comes at an interesting time for the company, which just announced that it would be completing its much-anticipated merger with the storage maker EMC on 7 September following regulatory approval of the deal by China’s ministry of commerce. It was granted a similar clearance by the European commission in February this year. Both Dell and EMC have a significant presence in Ireland. Dell remained circumspect yesterday in its statement on the commission’s decision. “While we are not going to comment on Apple’s situation, I can confirm that Dell has a strong history of paying corporate and other taxes in Ireland and collecting taxes such as employment tax and VAT,” said the company in its statement. “We understand our responsibility to be compliant with the tax laws of all of the countries in which we operate. This applies to both the letter and the intent of the law.” Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment on the Apple case, although the company has recently worked closely with the Irish government in championing privacy rights as part of an effort to fight a US court-ordered warrant concerning data held in a Microsoft European data centre in Dublin – which the company won on appeal in July this year. Silicon Valley outraged by Apple tax bill: 'Europe is changing rules retroactively' Read more Intel also declined to comment directly on the Apple case, yet clearly has an interest in how American technology companies are treated by the European Union. Intel opened its Leixlip campus, located in County Kildare, in 1989 and also operates a communications facility in Shannon that works on developing “connected car” applications for the automotive industry and end-to-end solutions for the retail sector. Facebook has faced well-publicized questions – dating back a number of years – about its UK corporate tax position. More recently, Facebook has gained attention from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to the company’s operations in Ireland. It did not respond to requests for comment. In a petition filed last month, the IRS said it was conducting an examination of the federal income tax liability of Facebook for the tax period ending 31 December 2010 – and that details of its operations in Ireland were part of that examination. “Part of the IRS’s examination concerns matters arising under certain agreements between Facebook Inc and Facebook Ireland Holdings Limited (‘Facebook Ireland’) purporting to transfer rights associated with Facebook’s worldwide business to Facebook Ireland, with the exception of the United States and Canada,” the IRS stated in its petition on 6 July 2016. Google also declined to comment for this story, but the company is already receiving attention from the European commission on another front: concerns about possible antitrust violations. Last month, the European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager – who is cementing her reputation as one of the toughest politicians in Europe – talked about the commission’s preliminary conclusion “that Google has abused its dominant position by systematically favouring its comparison shopping service in its search result pages” as part of a statement of objection to the web search giant. “Google has come up with many innovative products that have made a difference to our lives. But that doesn’t give Google the right to deny other companies the chance to compete and innovate,” she said in the statement. “Today, we have further strengthened our case that Google has unduly favoured its own comparison shopping service in its general search result pages. It means consumers may not see the most relevant results to their search queries. We have also raised concerns that Google has hindered competition by limiting the ability of its competitors to place search adverts on third party websites, which stifles consumer choice and innovation.” In a statement, Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, said the commission’s claim “has no basis in fact or in law”. “We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals … We are confident that the Commission’s order will be reversed.” More news Topics Apple Tax and spending Corporate governance Dell Microsoft More… Facebook Intel European commission Margrethe Vestager Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Lenovo's new Yoga 910, the successor to last year's Yoga 900, includes a "near edgeless display" that's just 5mm of bezel. That's slightly less than the XPS 13, and it's designed to make the screen bleed into the bezels around the display. Just like Dell, Lenovo has had to reposition its webcam as a result, but the Yoga 910 has the camera positioned in the center so hopefully it won't be as awkward as the XPS 13's camera placement. Lenovo's new edge-to-edge display comes in two options: 4K or full HD. It's the real highlight of the Yoga 910, and Lenovo is claiming 10 percent more screen area along with 14 percent more pixel density on this year's display by shrinking the bezels. That brings the display up to 13.9 inches (up from 13.3 inches) and very close to being a 14-inch laptop inside the body of a 13-inch one. Grid View Lenovo Yoga 910 press photos Obviously, it's a new year so it's time for a new Intel processor, and Lenovo is using the latest 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Core i chips from Intel on the Yoga 910. The new chips are paired with up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD. Lenovo has also managed to make the Yoga 910 just 14.3mm thick, and is claiming that it's the "world's thinnest" Intel Core i convertible as a result. Kaby Lake is a mid-generation refresh that should provide power improvements, and Lenovo is promising up to 15.5 hours of battery life. That's an impressive claim, but we'll be testing it out fully to see if you can really watch an entire season of Game of Thrones on one battery charge. No Windows Hello facial recognition Lenovo's repositioned camera on the Yoga 910 doesn't include Windows Hello support to log into Windows 10 with just your face, but a fingerprint reader is present. Lenovo's fingerprint reader supports Windows Hello, so you'll be able to swipe your finger to login without a password. That's something you've been able to do on a lot of ThinkPad laptops over the years, so it's disappointing Lenovo didn't opt for the facial recognition part of Windows Hello instead. The camera placement might have had a bearing on that. Lenovo is planning to release the Yoga 910 in October priced from $1,299, and available in Champagne Gold, Platinum Silver, and Gunmetal colors.

Mesa Has Already Seen More Code Changes This Year Than All Of 2015 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 31 August 2016 at 10:29 AM EDT. 56 Comments With the work on the Intel Vulkan driver, OpenGL 4.x being close to finished off for the main graphics drivers, and AMD doubling down work on performance optimizations, there is already more code changes in Mesa Git this year than all of 2015. So far this year there have been 7,103 commits while last year saw 9,611 commits and 2014 saw 7,059. With still four full months left to the year, we should beat last year on a commit basis. However, we already beat last year in terms of actual code changes. As of yesterday in Mesa Git there were 439,819 new lines of code and 242,929 lines of deleted code... Compared to 411,987 new lines and 233,332 lines of deleted code for all of 2015. This also beats out 2014 and is close to the 2012~2013 code change levels. When the year is through, it should prove to be a very interesting year for Mesa and the entire open-source Linux graphics stack for that matter. May not be the year of the Linux desktop, but certainly looking like the year of the open-source GPU drivers, if not for next year's benefit when lots of the current goodies in Git will begin shipping in the stable distributions. Mesa Git has seen a total so far of more than 84.5k commits and currently is made up of 5,183 files amounting to 1,904,127 lines of code from around 700 developers. The most prolific Mesa contributors this year so far include Jason Ekstrand, Marek Olšák, Kenneth Graunke, Nicolai Hähnle, Ilia Mirkin, and Brian Paul.

The Predator 21 X features the world's first curved display on a laptop, with the panel clocking in at a 21-inch ultra-wide IPS display (2560 x 1080) with NVIDIA G-Sync support and Tobii eye tracking for good measure.   Under the hood the Acer Predator 21 X is outfitted with dual NVIDIA GTX 1080's in SLI for some serious gaming power. Remember that the mobile GTX 1080 GPUs feature 2560 CUDA cores and a 1733MHz boost clock with 8GB of GDDR5X at 10GHz. The enthusiasts laptop will also tap Intel's new 7th generation Kaby Lake processors for maximum CPU performance.   Acer's monster flagship notebook also has a nice array of cooling solutions with five total system fans--three of which are the ultra-thin AeroBlade metal fans--to ensure optimum heat dissipation during high-performance gaming sessions. This is a pretty big deal as we all know laptops get hot with normal operation, not to mention enthusiast-level gaming.   Last but certainly not least, the Acer Predator 21 X rocks a full-sized RGB mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches for that satisfying tactile feel. What's more is that the keyboard's numerical pad can transform into a makeshift touchpad.     As for pricing and availability for the new insane laptop, Acer tentatively mentioned a Q1 2017 target launch at the event. Pricing wasn't mentioned, but you can bet that it's going to be quite expensive thanks to all of those premium components. Still, though, it's amazing to see how much incredible tech you can slap into a notebook these days...wonder when and if we'll see this kind of hardware put into a console?   Recommended for You Samsung has two new Windows 10 tablets for CES 2017...

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology India, UK join hands to combat cyber attacks The MoU signed by India's CERT-In and CERT-UK aims to facilitate information exchange on cyber attacks, response to cyber security breach and solutions to cyber threats. August 31, 2016 19:36 IST 11 Shares 11 Shares Cyber securityReuters The government-run cyber security organisations of India and the United Kingdom have signed a cyber security pact to ensure closer cooperation in countering cyber attacks. "The Union Cabinet under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been apprised of the MoU signed on May 20, 2016, between Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) and Ministry of Cabinet Office, UK, as represented by CERT-UK, a unit of the Cabinet Office on Cyber Security," an official statement said on Wednesday. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) aims to facilitate information exchange on cyber attacks, response to cyber security breach and solutions to cyber threats. CERT-In had earlier signed MoUs with Korea, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and Uzbekistan. Ministry of External Affairs had also signed a MoU with Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. The MoU has been signed by the countries at a time when cyber crimes recorded in India under the Information Technology Act surged nearly 300 per cent between 2011 and 2014. It poses attacks of greater frequency and intensity to critical infrastructure like nuclear plants, railways or hospitals, according to a joint study by ASSOCHAM and PricewaterCoopers. Indians will be more prone to such attacks since the latest Intel survey showed that 31 per cent willingly shared sensitive information such as credit card details and login credentials, including passwords. The survey also revealed that 36 per cent voluntarily shared personal information despite knowing that it makes them more vulnerable to cyber attacks. Indian businesses too face increasing chances of encountering cyber attacks which can escalate their cost of restoring systems after such attacks. An IBM-Ponemon Institute study shows that cost of data breach has increased by nine per cent from Rs. 3,396 last year to Rs. 3,704 per attack in 2016. The total average cost incurred by compromised vital information stood at Rs. 97.3 million this year. The study also pointed out that cost relating to compromised data rose in three other categories: per capita cost of data breach (up 8.7 per cent), average size of compromised data (up 8.1 per cent) and abnormal churn or loss of existing customers (up 7.7 per cent).

Acer's Predator 21 X puts a curved screen and dual GTX 1080s in a laptop The Verge 31/08/2016 Vlad Savov © Provided by The Verge Acer’s new Predator 21 X is a monster. Not only have this machine’s designers put a curved 21-inch display on a laptop for the first time ever, they’ve also gone and given it two GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs as well. Add in five cooling fans, a 7th-generation Intel Core K-series processor, and space for as much as four terabytes of SSD storage, and you have a laptop that’s beyond obscene. Unveiling the 21 X at IFA in Berlin today, Acer acknowledges that this laptop is more of a proof of engineering acumen than any sort of "big seller" retail product. Each Predator 21 X will be made to order, starting in January of next year (which is how Acer can advertise today that it will have an Intel CPU that technically hasn't yet been announced). Among its other cool features and specs, there's also room for four DD4 slots that top out at 64GB of RAM, Tobii eye-tracking, a mechanical keyboard, a 4.2 sound system, a window to show off one of the big fans, and a numpad that flips over to turn into a touchpad. Oh, and it also has an SD card slot. How practical! Seeing the 21 X in person is a hilarious but also charming experience. We often say gaming laptops are ridiculous, but this one — with its gaping upside-down smile generated by the gap between the keyboard and the curved screen — is that extra bit more ludicrous. How do you even begin to judge or weigh the merits of such an outlandish creation? At 8kg, the 21 X weighs more than seven of Acer's newly introduced Swift 7 laptops, offering the direct opposite to the Taiwanese company's ultrathin portable. We didn't get to see the 21 X before us firing up and showing off the benefits of its matte curved screen, unfortunately, as it was only a demo unit. The real machine will have a 2560 x 1080 IPS display, LED illumination, and presumably the world's biggest power brick ever. Even so, Acer’s representatives told us that the weight, size, and appearance of the demo 21 X were spot-on, and we have to say that, in person, this computer looms. It looks like it was left alone in a PC store overnight and ate all the other laptops. All in all, though, the Predator 21 X is a statement in a way few computers are. It’s like the exuberant designs you see at fashion shows or from car manufacturers signaling their future intent: defined by pizzazz and excess rather than practicality and efficiency. We'll still have to wait to get our hands on the machine to see how it actually performs, but on specs alone the 21 X might be the most impressive thing we see at IFA this year.

View Latest Posts >>> NEO – US: While No One Was Looking… By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on August 31, 2016   … by Gordon Duff,  VT Sr. Editor    … and New Eastern Outlook, Moscow Private Joel Bluett Culpepper, 40th Alabama, CSA… my great-grandfather [ Editor’s Note: What you are about to read in Gordon’s new NEO piece is not pretty. In fact, it’s damned ugly. But it is what it is; and readers looking for sugarcoating sure as hell don’t come to VT. Today y’all (I’m half Southern) are about to get a good dose of Gordon’s “How the world really works”. We actually have countries that ask for these briefings by VT people, not a lot, but some. One of the reasons is that they do not have complete trust in the Intel product they are getting from their own institutions, due to the huge investment and effort being made in disinformation atmospherics. It is a huge industry, pays very well, and we could be living financially cozy lives by being a part of it, but we have chosen a different path. And that was not because we are perfect or on a supremacist kick. We leave that to the Zionists. But we will brag with no embarrassment at taking credit for learning from our mistakes. We have made them…plenty… but never the same ones twice. People who do not learn from their mistakes are walking poster child examples of security risks to everyone around them.  Fresh faces – that had no idea what awaited them Years ago, Gordon was filling me in on what I had missed in Vietnam with my low draft number, but where a college car wreck had reduced me to a 125-pound weakling with a medical deferment. He shared in vivid detail what it was like being one of the 7000 or so Marines patrolling the Danang perimeter to protect the 350,000 Americans inside, and it was all quite memorable. He said it took a “newbie” grunt about two weeks to figure out that he had pulled the biggest cannon-fodder posting of all time — a one-tour death rate of 40%, higher than any WWII Marines, because none were in combat almost constantly for a year. They knew that, other than their families and platoon comrades, nobody gave a crap about them. These platoons were the original Band of Brothers; and he can count on one hand the number of them from two tours who are still alive, where many became “delayed casualties” after they came home. So we do not shirk from speaking out, for we speak for not only those who have gone before us, but also the the cannon fodder waiting in the wings to have their turn, and who are clueless about what they are really getting into. And that canon fodder now includes the general public… Jim W. Dean ] ____________ – First published  … August 30,  2016 – DHS Tank America has built a total security state, not to enforce a political concept or to assure complacency during a period of national emergency but something far more insidious. Americans have been profiled, categorized and are now subject to that long threatened martial law takeover, not for the sake of national security but rather pure and simple economic slavery. What we are saying is this, a monstrosity beyond imagination is there already, waiting to be triggered, one beyond party politics, beyond the concerns of religion or ethnicity. During seven years of the Obama presidency, something happened that is not being discussed, not even by Obama’s political enemies. Bush era clamp downs on individual freedom after 9/11 have been not only carried forward, but have been pushed on to levels unimagined. America is much more than a police state and far more a “total surveillance state” than even the harshest critics imagine. That this was done under a liberal democratic president is unthinkable. Even more unthinkable, however is that Obama’s political enemies not only don’t think he went far enough, they are attacking Donald Trump as well for being, and this is the truth of it, “weak on tyranny and dictatorship.” Where Things Are Now Few are aware that every person who visits America, not just those to live there, carries a personal threat profile. This information, available to police during traffic stops and even to potential employers or educational institutions, even banks and credit bureaus, is an amalgamation of factors including: How you are written about on the internet and what is said about you in social media The phrases you use in email and on telephone calls including quality of language and tone of voice Your daily habits including where you walk and drive, tracked by your mobile phone Every page you view online, every click you make, every search you have ever done, every letter or number you have ever entered into a text box The history of your interactions with government agencies or making customer service complaints or even returning defective purchases All healthcare issues including when you don’t get your teeth cleaned or when, after personal stressors and tragedies, you FAIL to seek psychiatric advice. Few are aware, except those with the highest security clearances or “need to know” through over-compartmentalization, that buying explosives or guns, or even stocking up on canned goods isn’t considered suspicious. Threat profiles are based on algorithms processed at massive NSA datacenters that profile individuals based on their ability to fit in to acceptable behavior models applied to “enhanced circumstance” scenarios. This means, simply put, you can be on a list to be rounded up if you question overcharges on your phone bill as this makes you a “potential troublemaker” during those times when those who have managed to assume unwarranted authority feel that the public needs to be protected against themselves. The Occupy movement joined the Marines on the Danang perimeter Here’s another one. Let’s say you watch lots of conspiracy television shows, and there are nearly two dozen networks that show little else, aliens, ghosts, even plots by biblical characters not to mention angels, demons/jinns and everything in between. Rather than make you a danger, those attracted to conspiracy theories are rated as highly malleable and easily influenced and, even more importantly, useful in controlling others, either driving them to useful panic or even more useful feelings of hopelessness. Thus, charismatic critical thinkers have a higher threat profile than terrorist bomb makers. Here is a case in point; the perfect individual from a political standpoint is one that believes either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, the two presidential nominees for the 2016 election, either belong in prison or are murderous psychopaths, this being the basic tenor of campaign mudslinging. On the other hand, a dangerous individual, one likely to be rounded up quickly, is more likely to express; “Why are these two idiots running for office at all?” The “Blister” The Maginot Line Between World War I and II, the French built the Maginot Line to defend against another devastating German attack as in 1914. The line itself, a series of fortifications, mostly underground, covered much of the areas from the Swiss border in the South all the way to the lowlands of Flanders in the North. From time to time, blisters or “ouverages” with visible gun emplacements and fortifications could be seen. Without these open air security nightmares and their useless 75mm gun emplacements, no one would have known where the money went, the tradeoff between poor quality security and pure idiocy. In America, the industry bankrupting the nation, even more devastating than the billions shuttled to Israel or the theatrical military buildup to fight off even the more imaginary enemies, China, Iran and Russia, is what was at one time, the invisible surveillance state. They just couldn’t keep themselves under wraps for that day pretty much all Americans see coming. Let’s look at something that might well have been innocent, the Affordable Care Act. Originally, as outlined by then First Lady Hillary Clinton, America was going to extend full national paid healthcare to all citizens through the exiting Medicare/Medicaid. Essentially, America’s from a healthcare standpoint, would become “retirees” at birth. What was embarrassing about this is not the simplicity or how inoffensive the idea was, but rather that it would actually have been a huge economic boon to American industry by killing the bloated medical bureaucracy that had strangled America since the 1970s. When the average cost of an automobile went from $3000 to $22,000, three factors brought about 80% of that dramatic increase: Energy costs Healthcare costs Financial industry manipulation The percentage of the cost of a vehicle tied to wages alone dropped dramatically with major subassemblies coming from Mexico and other “slave labor” markets. West Point cadets got theirs for free – the kind you worked your ass off for Let’s look at tuition costs. In 1970, the typical cost of college tuition was around $15 per credit hour. Decades later, that cost is now close to $400 with classes, more often than not, taught by part time instructors, low paid teaching assistants or “online.” Again, we have the 1, 2, 3 of energy, healthcare and financial industry manipulation. The blister is what we feel, what we see, TSA searches at the airport, the chips in the credit card, the retailer loyalty cards and, though few realize why, the robocall. Let’s take a second here. Many years ago strong penalties were enacted against companies that called Americans without permission. Americans were encouraged to register their names on a national “do not call” list and those who called these individuals would face heavy fines or even imprisonment. Years later, most Americans use mobile phones as their primary communications medium yet, by some estimations, nearly 30% of all calls in America are unwanted nuisance calls. Many return to the “do not call” website and register over and over and leave complaints that are never acted on despite text promising otherwise. The calls themselves aren’t important, often surveys, too often minor financial scams or political idiocy. Were one to be conspiratorial, one might wonder if there is some hidden purpose here, and in fact there may well be one behind this phenomenon. One source in Army intelligence has confirmed that the huge increase of illegal robocalls Americans are plagued with are part of a psychological warfare program that covers many aspects of life, modifications of food, rumors of tainted water, controlled weather, electronic irritants, microwaves, sound or other methods, all “out there” to destroy social cohesion. Would a government alter traffic light timing or put up useless construction zones for the same reason? Remember the TSA? More TSA employees have been arrested than terrorists, by a factor of 100 to 1. Are diseases created to promote healthcare industry profitability? We have certainly seen laws enacted that allow financial fraud to victimize American consumers, steal their homes, destroy their lives. Our point is simple, none of this is by accident, not hardly.

The day is coming when we will have to fight these scum on every street corner and within their own system with everything we got and it will be a replay of the first American revolution in which we fought the same bloodline families mercenaries and dupes. The blood will flow coast to coast. But this is what the entities running this want destruction of both sides one against the other.

Log in to Reply JS  August 31, 2016 at 11:29 am The “Medicare for all” from birth until death, that should have been done in the US back in the 1960s when other countries did it, and could have been part of the War on Poverty. And yes, it could have been done in the Clinton years. Well, better late than never. Why can’t it be done now? The US could finally join the rest of the developed world in that regard. Log in to Reply JS  August 31, 2016 at 12:05 pm The biggest excuse over the years for NOT doing Medicare for all, was the supposed lack of privacy. But I don’t know why anyone would have bought the privacy line. The Medical Information Bureau (now MIB Group) always had access to everything you did that was covered by medical insurance of any kind. So since there’s no privacy anyway, bring on the Medicare! b12real  August 31, 2016 at 11:03 am “Obama was manufactured; an unknown, unvetted quantity.”; Obama is a CIA creation whose parents were both CIA, according to declassified CIA records used in voltairenetdotorg articles, and very possibly an MK-Ultra product, since U of Hawaii was an important MK-Ultra programming facility during his years in Hawaii. I watched this Ted Gunderson video recently, made during his presidential campaign, and was surprised to hear him state that current USG-NGO fascism is a policy set in a 1982 Illuminati meeting (@ 22:00); an acknowledgement of its control of the UN – interesting info on voting machine fraud, too: https://www.youtubedotcom/watch?v=ssTVtsk9L7I Log in to Reply Alex B  August 31, 2016 at 10:47 am Thank you guys! VT is one of a VERY FEW places where the sanity prevails over madness. “That cannon fodder now includes general public…” needs to be on every running string of advertising, instead of “Go Lakers”, “Go Broncos”, “Eat you chicken and shut up…”, etc. And “what was done under a liberal democratic president” is indeed unthinkable. You’re also absolutely right – they are not afraid of “conspiracy theorists” and try to utilize them, but only as long as those theorists do not “cross the line” and start touching some sensitive areas, especially those that can be easily proven beyond and doubts. Then the creeps get really nervous, and that’s only when the real scale and scope of things becomes visible. Log in to Reply joetv  August 31, 2016 at 8:49 am I read this yesterday at NEO. This is a great article, and caused me to say to myself…”welcome back Gordon”. Good info. I experienced something odd this morning. I feel this is related. while using my the micro phone option to record into the memo app, my notes on the “ownership timeline of CBS”. I said, “Viacom splits itself and reforms as CBS”. When I looked at the screen I saw this. “Black ops glitches”. Weird, right? I followed the lead and discovered court actions between the gov’t and CBS (S. Redstone) from the ’80’s related to tracking and surveillance of subscribers. The communication between phones, and cars, etc. All things unknown to us. There are so many adjoing doors.

It is true that I was not among those who would have easily fit into an acceptable pattern under enhanced circumstances. Now? I’d rather not go there. The iniquity of going after someone for their virtues, if that is indeed what happened, is something that I get triggered on every now and then, for example when reading an article such as this one. Log in to Reply captain obvious  August 31, 2016 at 8:06 am the surveillance is only one aspect, I’ve commented before about “supermarket loyalty cards” and shared information through relational databases going to insurers and HELLthcare providers, for nearly 2 decades now. sure I’m probably listed for being aware and not liking it one bit, that we are being farmed like cattle, complete with tazer cattle prods, thug criminals in uniforms and worse. Log in to Reply Edward Dodge  August 31, 2016 at 7:29 am “That this was done under a liberal democratic president is unthinkable.” Where is the evidence that Obama was liberal and democratic? I could cite the 2012 NDAA, TPP, TTIP, or the non prosecution of Wall St. banker crimes, the extrajudicial droning deaths of innocent people, etc. Let’s be honest: Obama was manufactured; an unknown, unvetted quantity. Anyone that feigns shock, bewilderment, and misgivings about his actions retroactively should consider recusing themselves from further political discourse. To not do so, flies in the face of Mr. Dean’s admission in the introduction to this article that VT never makes the same mistake twice. Log in to Reply paul becke  August 31, 2016 at 7:04 am Gordon, I couldn’t help frequently laughing out loud, as I read this article, since it typifies the ‘first principles’-“why-are-these-two-idiots running-for-office-at-all?” thinking that makes the surveillance state sit up and take names ! The butt-kicking is presumably for dessert. It’s what many of us come to VT for, isn’t it ? To see the surreal grasped in all its craziness in what is today the banal, the quotidian, which passes over our heads a lot of the time ; and those of many, all the time. Looking for more of the Salvador Dali articles, Gordon, Keep ’em coming, as long as they’re in the offing. I think Shakespeare might have got wrong, not quite right, anyway : the world isn’t so much a stage, as a gallery of surrealist art.

At 9.98mm, Acer Swift 7 sets a new benchmark for thin and ultralight notebooks. Acer Swift 7 is not just the world’s thinnest notebook but also the first to feature Intel’s 7th gen Core processor. Acer Swift 7 features fanless aluminium unibody design and weighs just 1.1Kg. Acer Swift 7 features 13.3-inch Full HD display with Gorilla Glass protection. It uses black-and-gold dual tone design with aluminium unibody chassis. Acer Swift 7 is powered by Intel Core i5 processor coupled with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD storage. The Swift 7 comes with two USB-C 3.1 port and a headphone jack. With Swift 7, Acer is promising up to 9 hours of battery life. Acer has also launched Swift 1, Swift 3 and Swift 5 laptops in the Swift series. While Swift 7 is aimed at lifestyle users, other Swift range are centered around lifestyle and productivity. Acer Swift 1: As the name itself implies, the Swift 1 is the entry level notebook in Acer’s Swift series. The laptop features a 14-inch HD display and can be configured with Intel’s Pentinum or Celeron processor. Acer Swift 1 comes with 4GB RAM and 32/64/128GB of eMMC storage. Acer Swift 1 starts at $249 in North America and will be available from November. Acer Swift 1 is aimed at school students looking at lightweight laptop with all day battery life. Acer Swift 3: The Swift 3 is every step better than Swift 1 thanks to the faster 7th gen Intel Core processor, up to 8GB memory and fast 512GB SSD storage option. The Acer Swift 3 features a 14-inch display with option of HD or Full HD panel and up to 12 hours of battery life. Acer Swift 3 combines productivity and mobility into a single device with its 17.95mm thick profile and 1.5Kg weight.

Acer's Predator 21 X was introduced at the IFA 2016 trade show in Berlin today. It is the company's new flagship gaming laptop and claims to be the most advanced notebook on the market. It appears to rightfully claim that title, since its specs far outweigh any previous gaming laptop. First and foremost is the physical size of the device. It has a curved 21-inch IPS display with a 2560x1080 resolution. The Predator 21 X is unlikely to see much use as a laptop, instead being installed as a permanent workstation in confined areas where a desktop wouldn't be practical. The huge chassis has allowed Acer to include a full-size mechanical keyboard, complete with Cherry MX switches and per-key RGB backlighting. You can customise a variety of lighting effects and animations to illuminate your gaming. Acer's Predator 21 X, a 21-inch curved gaming laptop with two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards Acer The laptop is powered by a seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake Core i7 processor. The Kaby Lake series is yet to launch and exact details on the chip being used remain unknown. The Predator 21 X won't be released until Intel finally gets Kaby Lake to market. Little else of the laptop's specs have currently been revealed, except for its extraordinary graphics card setup. Acer has installed dual NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards in SLI, enabling them to work together to boost frame rates. These are the most powerful mobile graphics cards available, offering performance on par with their desktop counterparts. It's safe to say the Predator 21 X will be capable of running the most demanding games ever created. Acer's Predator 21 X, a 21-inch curved gaming laptop with two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards Acer The components require a serious cooling setup consisting of five primary system fans. The result of the huge display, oversized keyboard tray and dual graphics cards is the strangest-looking laptop you've ever seen, including a basement area below the keyboard tray that stores all the components. Acer seems to have built the Predator 21 X more as a trophy piece than a serious laptop. As a final hero feature, the 21 X comes with Tobii eye-tracking hardware built into its display. This allows you to unlock the computer by simply looking at it. The eye-tracking can also be used in games, powering new interactions independent of your mouse or controller. You can aim, identify enemies and take cover in select titles by gazing at objects displayed on the screen. Acer's Predator 21 X, a 21-inch curved gaming laptop with two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards Acer The Predator 21 X will go on sale in January. Each machine will be made to order. Acer hasn't announced retail pricing but it should be expected to be eye-wateringly high. The company's current Predator 15 and 17 laptops sell for close to $3,000. It's possible the 21 X will retail at $4,000 or even more. Alongside the 21 X, Acer also unveiled a selection of other laptops at IFA 2016 today. It has updated the Predator 15 and 17 with improved NVIDIA GTX 1070 graphics cards. Acer also unveiled two new series of ultra-thin laptops, Swift and Spin. Swift is designed for everyday convenience while Spin offers a convertible design for greater portability. Both will go on sale later this year.

(Image: Intel) Kaby Lake, Intel's latest processor family, wasn't supposed to exist. Earlier this year Intel announced the end of its well-known tick-tock release schedule, whereby it trots out a new processor every September. The tick is the shrinking and improvements of the current microarchitecture, while the tock is a whole new architecture. Instead last year's "tock," Skylake, was going to hang around a while, with no new "tick" in sight. There is still no official tick expected for the foreseeable future, but Intel claims it made such strides in the 14nm architecture at the core of its Skylake family that it went ahead and released another "tock." (For those of you don't know, architecture refers to the microscopic physical structure of the computer processor.) So here we are now with Kaby Lake. It's the Skylake processor family tweaked for better 4K video handling and high-performance gaming. "It's more a 'tick-tock-tock release schedule," an Intel representative told me in a recent briefing. While last year's Skylake was a sea change of a processor which drastically improved battery performance in laptops, a lot of the improvements the Kaby Lake line introduces are relatively small. If you're just browsing the internet, playing solitaire and occasionally watching a grainy video on YouTube then you don't need to hold out on buying a new computer until the Kaby Lake processors start appearing later this fall. But if you do a lot of video work, watch a lot of movies, or play video games then get excited. Kaby Lake could be the answer to desires you didn't know you had. Watching Breaking Bad and more in 4K Currently, there aren't many places you can watch real movies in 4K. A smattering of TVs and a few set top boxes can handle the new video standard. Also, Sony's $700 media player will do it. Yet many people, especially college-aged people, don't watch movies on their couch, and they sure as heck don't want to pay $700 just for the privilege. The 6500U is a Skylake processor. The 7500U is Kaby Lake. Lower CPU utilization is better. The new Kaby Lake family is the the first line of PC processors to let you play popular movies and TV shows natively in 4K on you computer, provided the monitor you're using can actually display 4K. In technical terms this means it decodes HEVC 10-bit 4K video, the video format most movies you've heard of come encoded in. Previously, watching that kind of video on a PC required a dedicated graphics card. As of today, only Sony movies and shows (including Breaking Bad), and those appearing on Fandango's new 4K service, Fandango Now, will be available for playback at launch. That's not necessarily catastrophic. Sony's library of 4K content is the largest available, and much of it already appears on more popular streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. You can expect lots and lots more 4K content to be available over the life cycle of this chip. Which means come next year you could be watching Stranger Things and Marvel's Defenders in 4K on your laptop. Or whatever new show about insufferable people Amazon has in store for us. Lower CPU utilization is always better. And the Kaby Lake family natively decodes Google's 4K codec, VP9, too. So watching a 4K video on Youtube will be a lot less taxing to your device. The movies of yesterday, souped up to playback on the fancy screens of today aren't the only videos Kaby Lake is improving playback for. It should also give you a smoother playback of 360 video, and for multiple 4K streams at once. Edits 4K and 360 video, and loads webpages faster Most of the heavy lifting in video editing depends on a very good CPU, so it's a good thing that Kaby Lake's nifty handling of 360 and 4K video extends to the editing side too. When editing 4K 360-degree video, Intel claims the Kaby Lake family of processors is 8.6 times faster than a five year old Sandy Bridge processor. it can also convert a one hour 4K video from junk in an editing suite to fully rendered video ready for upload in just 12 minutes, which is 6.8 times faster than the Sandy Bridge processor. Intel didn't provide video editing benchmarks for Kaby Lake versus the more recent Skylake, but it did provide some other benchmarks. It should respond to mouse clicks about 15ms faster and load webpages nearly 20-percent faster than a Skylake processor. As those speeds improvements will be imperceptible to all but the most ardent bloggers. This alone doesn't make Kaby Lake a required upgrade for a lot of users, but serious videographers should take note. Hardcore gaming without a fancy graphics card Gamers should take note of Kaby Lake, too. At the Intel Developer's Conference earlier this month there were reports of a Kaby Lake computer smoothly playing Blizzard's Overwatch without a discrete graphics card. While a Kaby Lake family processor won't be playing Witcher 3 at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second , it should be able to handle Overwatch and other competitive e-sports games on Medium settings at 30fps. That's perfectly adequate for most gamers and three times faster than a Sandy Bridge processor. Embracing Overwatch and other e-sports titles, which are less graphically intensive was a conscious decision by Intel, which saw the exploding e-sports market and decided it was time to claim a piece of it. So that affordable thin laptop you'll eventually be issued at work will be able to tackle Overwatch or League of Legends. Gaming in staff meetings just got easier. Sure the pros will still use their crazy gaming rigs, but its nice that the rest of us will be able to use a standard PC to pay games. Improved battery life Better performance can often come as at the price of battery life, yet Intel claims the Kaby Lake family improves battery life across the board. Four hours of 4K Youtube streaming on Skylake is 7 hours on Kaby Lake. That's almost double the battery life! The power consumption improvements make sense because Kaby Lake is just the Skylake processor further refined. It draws the same power from the power supply as Skylake, but it uses that power much more efficiently. So processor intensive CPU functions like 4K video playback, video and photo editing, and gaming should all use considerably less juice. And because the processor is more efficient it also creates less heat, which means it can be crammed into smaller and thinner laptops than a Skylake processor. If you're hankering for the skinniest laptop on the market then wait until Kaby Lake-supplied laptops start hitting stores later this year. So how do I tell these processors apart? Understanding which processor is which is not easy. When you're in Best Buy and urgently trying to upgrade, you should remember at least one thing. Kaby Lake processors will start with the number 7. So the i5-7500U or m3-7Y30 is a 7th-generation Kaby Lake chip while the i7-6920HQ would be a 6th-generation Skylake chip. But, shockingly, every letter and number found in an Intel processor's name actually means something. i5 and i7 processors are the ones found in your work laptops. m3 processors are those slower and smaller ones found in tablets and super thin laptops like the Macbook. The rule of thumb is that if you can afford the i-series processor always choose it over the m3. Because nothing is ever simple, processor are further divided into families based on how large they are and how much power they draw. Intel is only releasing two types, the Y and U series, this year. The Y seen in something like the m3-7Y3 stands for extremely low power processors that will appear in very thin devices. U is for ultra low power processors. Despite the name they do not draw less power than the Y series. Instead they're more powerful, and generally found in larger laptops. Don't expect them all at once Currently only Y and U series Kaby Lake processors will be available. More powerful Kaby Lake processors, like the ones found in gaming laptops or big desktop computers, will be available starting in January. Alienware, Razer, MSI, and the other gaming laptop manufacturers aren't too worried about gamers waiting until January to get a souped up laptop though. The latest batch of mobile video cards launched two weeks ago. "Gaming is mainly about the video card," an Alienware rep said. But Intel's hoping Kaby Lake will change that.

Today they are announcing a new line of ultrathin notebooks, called Swift. There will be four models, the Swift 1, Swift 3, Swift 5 and Swift 7, with the higher number representing the more premium product. Gallery: Acer Swift 7 The Swift 7 is the flagship, designed to fit within a 1cm tall chassis (it comes at 9.98mm for good measure). In that z-height is a 1.1kg (2.48lbs) device sporting a 13.3-inch 1920x1080 IPS display, an all-aluminium unibody and a thin bezel.  Acer is reporting up to nine hours of battery life with the Core i5-7300U, a 256GB SSD, and up to 8GB of memory (no mention if it is LPDDR3 or DDR4). Connectivity comes from a 2T2R 802.11ac with MU-MIMO, and the clamshell comes with two USB 3.1 Type-C ports (we’re not sure if Acer uses USB 3.1 Gen1 or Gen2 from the announcement, and they don’t specify). The Swift 7 will be available in October starting at $999. Gallery: Acer Swift 5 The Swift 5 is more of an attack on the XPS 13, claiming to fit a 14-inch panel in a 13.3-inch frame with thin bezels. It comes in thicker than the Swift 7, at 14.58mm, but is proportionally less dense at 1.36 kg. With the extra size and weight, there’s a bigger battery and Acer is claiming up to 13 hours for this one. Similar to the Swift 7, the Swift 5 with have Kaby Lake, up to 8GB of memory, and a choice of 256GB or 512GB PCIe or SATA SSDs, depending on the region/vendor. The Swift 5 will also have a USB 3.1 Type-C, and options for a touch display and fingerprint reader. The Swift 5 will start at $749 from November. Gallery: Acer Swift 3 The Swift 3 goes up the stack again, at 17.95mm and 1.5kg, but in a full 14-inch form factor this time using 720p or 1080p IPS displays, Skylake/Kaby Lake processors, up to 512GB/8GB and 2T2R 802.11ac with MU-MIMO. The key feature of the Swift 3 according to Acer is the optional backlit keyboard paired with the larger touchpad. Pricing starts at $499 from October. Gallery: Acer Swift 1 Finally the Swift 1 is the budget offering, using a Pentium/Celeron with 32/64/128GB eMMC and a 14-inch 720p display. The design is premium-like, using a brushed-metal-like finish on the chassis but the idea is that a student can have 12 hours of battery life in a 1.6 kg device. The Swift 1 will start at $249 from November. Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

A super thin bezel at the sides and top, but a massive ACER logo on the bottom... I mean, hurry up and just use a 16:10 panel already! It defies logic. Reply kfleszar - Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - link This is so common among the PC (non-Apple) laptops. It is about saving a few % on cost at the expense of the user experience. Reply Drumsticks - Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - link That narrative sounds nice, but Apple isn't exactly providing ultra thin bezels on their units either. Reply vanilla_gorilla - Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - link Pssst ... he's talking about 16:10 panels not the bezels. Reply Drumsticks - Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - link Hmm I guess that could work. I interpreted it as complaining purely about the massive logo on the bottom; of course Apple has 16:10 going for them though. Reply Dahak - Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - link Well it could be worse, you could get the nase(nose) cam you get on the dell xps. Never personally used it but from what i heard Reply Dahak - Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - link nasal.... dang need edit button Reply Tams80 - Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - link I'd prefer 16:10 too. However, does having thin bezels have something to do with the thick bottom bezel perhaps? More LEDs required there, or something? Reply Manch - Wednesday, August 31, 2016 - link This is great now that Kaby lake is launching and all but I'm waiting on the Surface Book 2 announcement. The Skylake bugs in the current one makes me a bit squeamish about buying it, plus I need sc cams so a new laptop is taking a back seat for now.

The laptop is aimed at gamers without budget constraints and packs high-end gaming hardware, such as Intel’s 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors, two NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards in SLI and even a mechanical keyboard. The system can hardly be called a mobile computer because it is very large and heavy, but it still comes in clamshell form-factor and can be transported relatively easily. One of the key features is the display. The Acer Predator 21 X will be the company’s new flagship gaming notebook, which will feature a plethora of technologies that we have not seen in laptops so far. The machine will be based on Intel’s upcoming 7th generation Core processors codenamed Kaby Lake. Acer does not reveal exact CPU models or their specifications, but given the positioning of the notebook, expect the company to use chips designed for gaming PCs (45W+, one would imagine). For graphics, Acer plans to offer up to two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs, but other options will probably be available as well. The company does not specify storage capabilities of the Predator 21 X, but chassis designed to fit a 21” display panel can integrate a number of M.2 and 2.5” drives. To cool down the CPU as well as up to two GPUs, Acer uses a specially designed cooling system with five fans and multiple heat-pipes. Three out of five fans are ultra-thin and are made of metal (the manufacturer calls them AeroBlade). While the performance of the Predator 21 X promises to be high, the key feature of the notebook is its 21” curved IPS display panel with 2560 × 1080 resolution and NVIDIA’s G-Sync dynamic refresh rate technology. In addition to curvature, Acer also added Tobii infrared eye-tracking sensors to the display, which opens up different user experiences in games that support the appropriate tech. To further appeal to gamers, the DTR laptop comes with four integrated speakers and two built-in subwoofers (the audio sub-system carries the SoundPound 4.2+ brand name). For input, the Acer Predator 21 X uses a mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches (just like MSI’s GT80 Titan) with five programmable buttons. The numeric keypad does not feature mechanical switches, but a good news is that it can be flipped and turned into a touchpad (a device that some DTR gaming laptops lack). For connectivity, the Predator 21 X has one GbE port as well as a 2T2R 802.11ac + Bluetooth Wi-Fi module with two physical antennae on the rear side. In addition, the machine sports two USB Type-A ports, at least one USB Type-C receptacle, audio in/out as well as three display outputs (two DP, one HDMI). Since the Acer Predator 21 X seems to be based on Intel’s yet unannounced 45W+ 7th generation Core chips for gaming machines, it will not be available for purchase for at least several months from now. For this reason, Acer does not unwrap all of its specifications just yet because the spec is hardly final at this time. That said, it is impossible to even estimate an approximate price of the machine. Yet, it is safe to say that it will cost more than average gaming laptops not only because of two high-end graphics cards but also due to the unique display and form-factor.

Not only have this machine’s designers put a curved 21-inch display on a laptop for the first time ever, they’ve also gone and given it two GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs as well. Add in five cooling fans, a 7th-generation Intel Core K-series processor, and space for as much as four terabytes of SSD storage, and you have a laptop that’s beyond obscene. Unveiling the 21 X at IFA in Berlin today, Acer acknowledges that this laptop is more of a proof of engineering acumen than any sort of "big seller" retail product. Each Predator 21 X will be made to order, starting in January of next year (which is how Acer can advertise today that it will have an Intel CPU that technically hasn't yet been announced). Among its other cool features and specs, there's also room for four DD4 slots that top out at 64GB of RAM, Tobii eye-tracking, a mechanical keyboard, a 4.2 sound system, a window to show off one of the big fans, and a numpad that flips over to turn into a touchpad. Oh, and it also has an SD card slot. How practical! You call that a gaming laptop? This is a gaming laptop! Seeing the 21 X in person is a hilarious but also charming experience. We often say gaming laptops are ridiculous, but this one — with its gaping upside-down smile generated by the gap between the keyboard and the curved screen — is that extra bit more ludicrous. How do you even begin to judge or weigh the merits of such an outlandish creation? At 8kg, the 21 X weighs more than seven of Acer's newly introduced Swift 7 laptops, offering the direct opposite to the Taiwanese company's ultrathin portable. Grid View Acer Predator 21 X gallery We didn't get to see the 21 X before us firing up and showing off the benefits of its matte curved screen, unfortunately, as it was only a demo unit. The real machine will have a 2560 x 1080 IPS display, LED illumination, and presumably the world's biggest power brick ever. Even so, Acer’s representatives told us that the weight, size, and appearance of the demo 21 X were spot-on, and we have to say that, in person, this computer looms. It looks like it was left alone in a PC store overnight and ate all the other laptops. All in all, though, the Predator 21 X is a statement in a way few computers are. It’s like the exuberant designs you see at fashion shows or from car manufacturers signaling their future intent: defined by pizzazz and excess rather than practicality and efficiency. We'll still have to wait to get our hands on the machine to see how it actually performs, but on specs alone the 21 X might be the most impressive thing we see at IFA this year.

Gordon Mah Ung (PC World (US online)) on 30 August, 2016 23:00 0 - - - - print email 1. No, this is how you pronounce it. Intel’s 7th-gen CPU is pronounced “Kay-bee” Lake, not “Cabbie” Lake. But then again, we still can’t agree on how to pronounce DATA and SATA, so maybe we should just grit our teeth when someone says the name differently than us. Gordon Mah Ung Intel’s 7th-gen Kaby Lake is built on a similar 14nm process as the previous Skylake CPUs but tweaks to manufacturing give it a nice performance boost, Intel says. 2. It uses an improved process. Kaby Lake is built on the same 14nm process as Skylake, but Intel says there were enough improvements to the manufacturing process to consider it “14nm+.” The upshot is that Kaby Lake CPUs can run at higher clock speeds than the equivalent 6th-gen Skylake CPUs. For example, while a Skylake CPU might have topped out at a Turbo Boost speed of 3.1GHz, Intel says its Kaby Lake equivalent can hit 3.5GHz. Intel’s 7th-gen Kaby Lake can now decode and encode HEVC video at 4K resolution with 10-bit color in hardware. 3. Watch video much? You’ll want Kaby Lake. While the x86 side mostly gets its boost from the process improvements, the video, or media, block engine in Kaby Lake gets bigger upgrades, such as hardware support for encoding and decoding 10-bit 4K HEVC video codecs as well as 4K VP9. Not a codec nerd? Intel says the upshot is that playing a 4K 10-bit HEVC video will offer a 2.6x battery-life improvement and cut power consumption from 10.2 watts on Skylake to 0.5 watts on Kaby Lake. If you watch 4K video on YouTube using the Chrome browser, you can expect 1.75x more battery life over a comparable laptop, and power consumption will drop from 5.8 watts to 0.8 watts. TL;DR: Mo’ better battery life for video freaks! Intel’s 7th-gen Kaby Lake CPU features hardware acceleration for VP9 video codecs, for an optimized experience playing 4K videos on YouTube when using Chrome. 4. No, seriously, video freaks will want Kaby Lake. Like a Ginsu knife, there’s more. Intel says it built the media block of Kaby Lake for where we’re going with video, not where we’re at. Kaby Lake machines, for example, can stream up to eight 4K-resolution AVC and HEVC videos simultaneously. That means a single tiny NUC-style PC could power a massive video wall of 4K TVs. Intel officials say the engine can actually decode 4K-resolution video at 60fps with a bit-rate up to 120Mbps. Kaby Lake also includes support for Microsoft’s PlayReady 3.0 and HDCP 2.2 DRM, so, in theory, if Netflix and Amazon decide to stream 4K to a PC, the pieces are now all in place for that to happen. Gordon Mah Ung Intel demonstrated an XPS 13 outfitted with the new 7th-gen Kaby Lake CPU running the game Overwatch at 720p resolution and medium settings. We saw frame rates in the 30fps range. 5. It’s faster for games too, but... Intel says graphics are improved and Kaby Lake’s graphics are capable of running the game Overwatch at 1280x720 resolution on the game’s medium quality setting. In the demonstration I saw, frame rates were in the 30fps range, which ain’t bad. If you’re laughing because you have a GeForce GTX 1080 running Overwatch at a billion frames per second, just remember this was done on an Dell XPS 13 ultrabook, a dainty little laptop, so remember to put it all in perspective. Gordon Mah Ung Intel’s improvements to the 14nm process and under-the-hood tweaks show a significant boost in web browsing performance. 6. Aside from graphics, how much improvement can we expect? As I said, there aren’t any apparent big changes to the x86-side of the CPU. No cache buffs or pipeline changes. What’s amazing though, is that Intel is nonetheless claiming a healthy double-digit performance increase for CPU-related chores going from Skylake to Kaby Lake. In fact, Intel says that improvements made to its Speed Shift technology (which effects responsiveness to performance bursts) combined with the refined manufacturing techniques, will result in up to 12 percent better performance in office productivity and as much as 19 percent in mundane tasks like web browsing. That’s a pretty decent boost considering the lack of substantial alterations. Gordon Mah Ung Intel’s 7th-gen Kaby Lake will come packaged in a larger 15-watt package as well as the far more compact package typically used in 2-in-1 convertibles. 7. Core m7 and Core m5 are kinda dead. With the 7th-gen Kaby Lake, Intel is retiring the Core m7 and Core m5 chip nomenclature but will keep the model numbers. For example, today’s Skylake-based Core m7-6Y75 ran at 3.5 watts, 4.5 watts, or 7 watts. The Kaby Lake chip that replaces it will now be named the Core i7-7Y75 and will also run at 3.5 watts, 4.5 watts, or 7 watts. Intel’s official reason for the name change? Because it’s fast now, it deserves the Core i7 monkiker. I’m not totally sold on that explanation but Core m isn’t completely dead. Intel said it has plans to introduce a Core m3 version along with a Kaby Lake Core i3 to go with the four Core i5 and Core i7 chips. Gordon Mah Ung Laptops, such as this HP Spectre 13 with an OLED panel, will soon hit the streets with Intel’s new 7th-gen Kaby Lake CPU inside. 8. When can we expect the chips? Intel says to expect around 100 different makes and models of laptops using Kaby Lake this quarter. By next year, that will crank up to several hundred makes and models of laptops. Following that, we’ll get quad-core “H” laptop CPUs and then the actual desktop CPUs will launch. Intel says desktop users will also benefit from the manufacturing refinements and the video engine improvements. Intel says its 7th-gen Kaby Lake offers improved Speed Shift technology, which gets the CPU from a low-power state to full-speed and then back to low-power faster than ever before. 9. What we know about Kaby Lake desktop chips. While Intel declined to discuss details of the Kaby Lake desktop CPUs, we have talked to enough hardware partners to know that Kaby Lake, when released, should work in existing LGA1151 motherboards. Sometime next year we should also expect a 200-series chipset to replace the current 100-series chipset: The Z170 will make way for the Z270, which will add native USB 3.1 10Gbps support, more PCIe lanes, and the cryptic “Optane support.” Intel says it’s made enough improvements to the manufacturing process for Kaby Lake that it might as well be called “14nm+.” 10. What’s next? With Kaby Lake finally rolling out, Intel now moves on to the 8th-gen Cannonlake (yes, one word.) Cannonlake moves us from the 14nm manufacturing process that’s been used since the 5th-gen Broadwell to a 10nm process. Cannonlake was originally expected this year but all leaks point to it hitting at the end of 2017. The problem, it seems, is the size. Getting silicon working at 10nm isn’t easy; indeed, many believe we are nearing the end of Moore’s Law on silicon. Intel itself has publicly said that going from 10nm to 7nm will be difficult and that it expects to move away from silicon for that jump.

Why your home theater PC still can't stream 4K Ultra HD video Netflix and Amazon offer 4K UHD video streams, but a noxious stew of hardware, software, and DRM issues prevents them being available on PCs. Jared Newman (TechHive (US)) on 30 August, 2016 23:00 0 - - - - print email Let’s say you’ve connected both a high-end gaming PC and an inexpensive streaming video-streaming box to your 4K television. Which one do you think would be capable of streaming 4K video from sources like Netflix? If you guessed the PC, you’d be wrong. Although several online video services now support 4K Ultra HD playback, including Netflix, Amazon, and Vudu, they’ve yet to extend 4K streaming to the PC. That means home theater PC owners are stuck with inferior movie and TV show quality compared to much cheaper streaming boxes such as the Amazon Fire TV, Roku 4, and Nvidia Shield Android TV. The reasons why streaming services like Netflix and Amazon support 4K (and the emerging HDR format) on PC are complicated; but in large part, they trace back to copy protection and Hollywood’s desire to keep 4K locked down at all costs. And while premium 4K content is coming to the PC soon, you’ll probably need new hardware to see it. The burden of protection Hollywood studios have always worried about digital piracy, but they’re especially skittish about 4K. The fear is that pirates could simply hook up the playback source to a video capture device, and help themselves to DRM-free copies of high-resolution content. “If you were able to analog-capture the 4K content, you could very easily create very high quality HD streams, and now the Internet bandwidth is high enough is that you could abundantly stream that stuff,” says Avni Rambhia, an analyst with Frost and Sullivan. “What you don’t want is for 4K to become an easy source of leaked content.” Streaming services such as Netflix aren’t supporting 4K on PCs just yet. In an attempt to keep their 4K content locked down, the studios demand all sorts of security measures that didn’t apply to lower-resolution formats. To play 4K content on a TV or an external monitor, for instance, both the playback device and the display must support HDCP 2.2, a form of copy protection for HDMI video output. Compared to game consoles and other streaming boxes, general computing devices (such as Windows PCs) have even more stringent requirements, including hardware-based decryption for protected content. In essence, the hardware must create a secure environment for the entire video pipeline—from decryption to decoding to screen composition—to protect the content from software ripping. Here's another story you might want to read: 4K content protection will frustrate consumers more than pirates “General purpose computing devices can have all kinds of software running on them, and these other devices can’t run all kinds of software on them. And so the security expectations around those devices are naturally different,” says Gabe Frost, the executive director of Alliance for Open Media, a group that’s working on new royalty-free video formats. (His day job is principal engineering manager of the Media Platform for Microsoft’s Windows and Devices Group.) That’s not to say the PC is inherently less secure than other devices. But setting up a secure environment requires a lot of pieces to fall into place. Even with the right hardware support, the operating system must know how to manage those resources, and it must convey to the streaming service that the environment is secure. This is accomplished through a DRM license, which tends to be offered by the device or operating system. In Windows, for instance, Microsoft has a system called PlayReady 3.0 that meets all of the studios’ requirements for 4K UHD playback. This system looks at the hardware to make sure all the necessary measures are in place, and it then gives the thumbs-up to the streaming app. Streaming services like Netflix just won't bother sending down 4K content without that go-ahead, according to Rambhia. The service provider is ultimately responsible for upholding the studios’ security requirements when offering 4K playback; failure to do so can result in fines and other penalties. “If they [the service provider] can’t be sure that there’s a protected hardware path, or they can’t be sure that X-Y-Z will happen, typically they’re allowed to send SD content or 720p HD, but not 1080p HD, and certainly not 4K,” Rambhia says. Moving parts A lot of these moving parts are only now starting to come together. Microsoft, for instance, just enabled PlayReady 3.0 with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. Nvidia’s Pascal-series GPUs (video cards in Nvidia's GTX 10-series and its Titan X) support hardware decryption of protected 4K video along with HDCP 2.2 across the entire line. Intel already supports hardware decryption in its 6th-generation Core processors (Skylake), and is building on that support in its upcoming 7th-generation processors (Kaby Lake), which will support 10-bit HEVC, a leading 4K video codec. Brad Chacos Nvidia Pascal-based GPUs, such as the GeForce GTX 1070, support protected 4K content. “Over the next 12 months is when you’re going to start to see new PCs on the market that are capable of playing this content, because everything’s aligned—the software and the hardware” Frost says. Still, a handful of hurdles remain before 4K playback becomes commonplace. Intel, for instance, notes that some streaming providers are requiring support for 10-bit HEVC, which isn’t supported in 6th-generation processors. Also, Intel still isn’t supporting native HDCP 2.2 over HDMI, which means it’s up to PC builders to add this capability through other means. Intel is touting Ultra HD as a key feature in its 7th-generation Core processors. And even with the hardware and software in place, content is still lagging behind. Intel says 4K streaming from Sony and FandangoNow is on coming, but none of our sources would provide dates or even soft targets when this might happen. Netflix and Amazon, meanwhile, wouldn’t comment at all for this story. And this statement from Vudu’s head of marketing and merchandising, Amit Balan, isn’t exactly encouraging: "4K and HDR on PCs is not out of the question—it just depends on when streaming services, the studios, and the device manufacturers can work out all the kinks, from the technical to legal to the experiential. Also, the best experience for 4K and HDR (especially Dolby’s HDR, ‘Dolby Vision’) is with specialized TVs, and there is still a lot of work to be done on that front to expand access to more TVs and set-top boxes, not to mention getting more content available. In short, it’s quite early in the game and HTPCs are not the first devices that the parties are targeting." Even if these services do support 4K streaming on PC, there’s still the question of how. As of now, Microsoft’s PlayReady DRM is the only method by which PCs can meet Hollywood’s hardware encryption requirements on Windows 10. That likely means you’ll have to use Windows Store apps or Microsoft’s Edge browser to stream 4K video for the foreseeable future; don’t expect your Kodi add-on for Netflix to get a resolution boost. What’s an HTPC owner to do? The harsh reality for home theater PC owners is that if you want Ultra HD in your living room, you’re going to need new hardware. But at least it’s now possible to upgrade with confidence that your machine is future-proof. Here's another story you might want to read: Microsoft's secret plan to lock down 4K movies to your PC Nvidia GPUs, for instance, should support the full range of protected 4K and HDR content, whenever it arrives, including output to 4K televisions. Intel’s upcoming 7th Generation Core processors should also support all 4K streaming services, though you’ll have to be mindful that whatever device you get supports HDCP 2.2 over HDMI. (Intel’s Skull Canyon NUC mini-PC, which has a 6th Generation Core processor, supports HDCP 2.2, so there’s a decent chance that we’ll see it in future NUCs as well.) Alaina Yee Intel NUC mini-PCs would be great for 4K, provided they support HDCP 2.2. As for software, you’re going to need Windows 10, which means you can’t take Windows Media Center with you (not legitimately, at least). Frustrating as this may be, it’ll hardly be the first time that anti-piracy measures have left early adopters stranded. Those who bought the first wave of 4K televisions, for instance, are now feeling the pain as many of those devices don’t support HDCP 2.2, rendering them incompatible with 4K UHD playback from game consoles and set-top boxes. The industry has been aware of this potential pain point for a while, as Microsoft worked to fulfill studios’ wishes through new DRM schemes. It’s only now, with 4K and HDR content popping up for smart TVs and set-top boxes, that PC owners are realizing they’ve been left behind.

Quoting a “military source,” the IS news agency Amaq said “Sheikh Abu Mohamed al-Adnani, the spokesman of the Islamic State, was martyred while surveying operations to repel the military campaigns against Aleppo.” The agency said Adnani died after a “long voyage crowned by sacrifice” and vowed “revenge” at the hands of a “new generation born unto the Islamic State.” It did not provide any further details on when or how he died. A US defense official said a short time later that coalition forces conducted an air strike Tuesday in Syria targeting a “senior leader” from the Islamic State group. This undated image provided by SITE Intel Group shows Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the Islamic State number 2 who was ‘martyred’ in northern Syria, the jihadist group said on Aug. 30, 2016. (SITE Intel Group via AP) “Coalition forces conducted an air strike in Al-Bab, Syria, targeting a senior [IS] leader,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We are still assessing the results of the operation at this time.” Al-Bab is in Aleppo, a province that is the current focal point of the Syrian civil war, and where IS, Syrian Kurdish forces, Turkey-backed rebels and President Bashar Assad’s forces are vying for control. The province is frequently struck by US-led coalition airstrikes as well as Russian air raids. Born Taha Subhi Falaha in the northern province of Idlib in the late 1970s, Adnani was one of the first foreign fighters to battle against coalition forces in Iraq, according to the State Department. He crossed the border into Iraq and joined al-Qaeda, a precursor to IS, after the 2003 US-led invasion. In late June 2014, he formally declared the establishment of a caliphate, or Islamic state, stretching across parts of Syria and Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and demanded allegiance from Muslims worldwide. A powerful orator, he went on to become the voice of IS. He released numerous, lengthy audio files online in which he delivered fiery sermons urging followers to kill civilians in nations that supported the US-led coalition against the group. “If you can kill a disbelieving American or European — especially the spiteful and filthy French — or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that joined a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be,” Adnani said in 2014.

(AFP PHOTO/AMEER ALHALBI) In other speeches he referred to US President Barack Obama as “an idiot” and Secretary of State John Kerry as an “uncircumcised old geezer.” In May 2015, the US State Department announced a reward of up to $5 million for information that could lead to Adnani’s capture. Earlier this year, Adnani called for massive attacks during Ramadan — a call that translated into the bloodiest Muslim holy month in recent memory. Followers of IS carried out attacks on several continents, including the Orlando shooting, the Nice truck attack in France and a massive suicide bombing in downtown Baghdad. Adnani also disparaged Saudi Arabia and its influential clerics for failing to rally behind the rebels that the monarchy supports in Syria like they did decades ago in Afghanistan. Amaq vowed revenge against the “filthy cowards in the sect of disbelief.” It said a generation raised in IS-held territory would avenge Adnani’s death.

(AP Photo/Halit Onur Sandal) The Islamic State group has suffered a string of defeats in recent weeks, including in Aleppo province, where Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels drove IS out of the border town of Jarablus last week. In Iraq, the group has lost its strongholds in Fallujah and Ramadi, in the western Anbar province. It still controls Mosul, but Iraqi forces are gearing up for a long-awaited operation to retake the country’s second largest city. It has also lost some of its most senior commanders and founding members over the past year, including its “minister of war” Omar al-Shishani, feared Iraqi militant Shaker Wuhayeb, also known as Abu Wahib, as well as a top finance official known by several names, including Abu Ali Al-Anbari.

AP hide caption toggle caption AP Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, spokesman for the Islamic State, has been killed in northern Syria, according to the IS semi-official news agency Amaq. He's shown here in an undated image provided by SITE Intel Group. AP One of the Islamic State's top commanders and the man in charge of disseminating its propaganda was killed in Aleppo, Syria, the group's semi-official Amaq news service announced. Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the news service said, was "martyred while surveying the operations to repel the military campaigns against Aleppo." The report did not list a cause of death. The Islamic State has erroneously claimed its operatives are dead in the past, and the Pentagon has not confirmed his death. Law enforcement sources tell NPR's Dina Temple-Raston that they believe the announcement is genuine. Responding to questions about Adnani, a senior defense official told NPR's Tom Bowman that the U.S. targeted a senior ISIS leader with an airstrike today in al-Bab, Syria, which is about 27 miles outside Aleppo. "We are still assessing the results of the operation at this time," the defense official said. Adnani, whose real name was Taha Sobhi Falaha, was born in Syria, according to the U.S. State Department. He was one of the first foreign fighters to oppose the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and is responsible for publicizing — and voicing — the Islamic State's claim to forming a so-called Islamic Caliphate. Article continues after sponsorship The State Department was offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest. Earlier this month, The New York Times' Rukmini Callimachi told NPR that Adnani should be as well-known as Osama bin Laden. "He is the spokesman of the group. He's the head of their propaganda," Callimachi said. "But more importantly, he is the head of the Emni, which is the body that is responsible for exporting terror abroad." In other words, Callimachi said, Adnani has been directly linked to the attacks abroad, like the one in Paris.

With a new set of gaming chips just on the horizon, Intel stock seems to be in a good place right now. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr But as the PC market continues to shrink, friction between INTC and companies like International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is heating up fast — which is why some investors are concerned that Intel’s stranglehold on the computer space is loosening. Not unlike Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), INTC is the kind of company with investment logic that is geared less toward aggressive market disruption and more toward its ability to maintain its lofty position. That’s why it’s actually a dividend play now, generating a reliable income stream for its investors. For years, the bull case for Intel stock has been defensive: how well can Intel, as the dominant player, keep all of its rivals from evolving into serious competitive threats? So when INTC reaches down to pay $350 to $400 million for what amounts to a pre-revenue start-up, its goal isn’t to disrupt the status quo, but to harden it, locking the real disruptors out. 7 Rare Value Stocks in This Overpriced Market Intel already owns 90% of the market share when it comes to CPUs and is a factor in 91% of the top high-performance computing deployments worldwide. Basically, if it’s bigger than Microsoft Corporation‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox, INTC owns the space and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD and IBM are effectively tourists. The Primary Advantage of INTC Stock Unfortunately for INTC, its dominance stops at that point. It got crowded off the Xbox a decade ago and was never implemented into Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR) (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) or Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) consoles, where specialized AMD graphics rendering rules. It has also withdrawn from mobile CPUs. So its real competitive advantage remains in high-performance computing. That space is growing fastest at the top at 10% to 11% per year, but that isn’t enough to move the needle on its own for a giant like INTC. The strategic key for every company in this space is to supply a bigger piece of every high-end machine. While Intel is already in nine out of 10 of these supercomputers, it’s only capturing a fraction of the revenue because these computers tend to be hybrid best-of-breed designs. When you’re building a supercomputer, you typically start with an INTC processor, and then maybe add another IBM processor or an NVDA graphics accelerator for the truly demanding work. NVDA graphics cards are wildly popular and growing fast enough that it could eventually start nudging into Intel’s space. Still, Intel stock looks like it’s going to remain solid over the long-term. Its valuation is a bit rich right now, but given its 3% yield and 7% to 9% annual growth, it’s still a better play than Microsoft or Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), for example. We may even see its current strategy — doubling down on high-performance computers — unlock some real innovation again, in which case growth ramps up and INTC stock investors cheer.

Close Latest Administration John EllenbyGRiD Compass Laptop John Ellenby, developer of the world's first laptop computer, dies at 75 Jeff Spry Tue, Aug 30, 2016 1:31pm If you're passively tapping away on your Macbook Pro this afternoon, you should stop and take a moment to pay your respects to John Ellenby, the man who helped invented and market what evolved into the digital-age laptop. Ellenby passed away earlier this month at the age of 75. With partial funding from Intel back in 1979, Ellenby and his team developed what would become the world's first portable laptop computer in the early '80s, called the GRiD.  Clumsy and sturdy, this pioneering portable weighed in at a hefty 10 pounds and, from the looks of it, appears to be able to withstand a thermonuclear blast.  Marketed mainly to billionaire business executives, military special forces, NASA astronauts and oil tycoons, the GRiD laid the foundation for the future refinement of the indispensable electronic appliance we are so enamored of today. The grandfather of the modern laptop was employed at Xerox during the early '70s, where he was instrumental in the advancement of the Alto computer, widely considered the first "desktop" computer created from the ground up to support an operating system based on a matched graphical user interface (GUI). The legendary Xerox Alto was a major influence for Steve Jobs on the prototype Apple Lisa and Macintosh computers and the development of Microsoft Windows. After Xerox, Ellenby struck out on his own to found GRiD Systems, with the Mountain View, California company's lower case ‘i’ being a salute to Intel for assisting with the firm's formation (Translation = major cashola).  Working with a talented crew including industrial designer Bill Moggridge, Ellenby spawned the GRiD Compass 1101 in 1982, the first mass-marketed portable computer to use the familiar clamshell design with a fold-down lid collapsing onto the keyboard for convenient storage and transport.  The burly black die-cast case was made from a unique milled magnesium-alloy.  With a pricetag of $8,150, they were far beyond the reaches of most middle-class consumer households but perfect for elite designer Christmas gifts or unrestrained governmental procurement.   Rumor has it that special superspy models were installed with a "seek and destroy" red dot for snipers to target to save classified intelligence information in emergency situations.  Its notoriety as a nearly indestructible piece of technology was well-earned as one of Ellenby and Moggridge's GRiD laptops actually survived the Challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986.  Following the recovery efforts, the GRiD was found to still be fully operational!  The computer was rudimentary by today's standards of course and featured an Intel 8086 processor (8MHz) with 8087 math coprocessor, 256KB DRAM, a 6-inch 320×240-pixel electroluminescent monochrome display and a 384K internal magnetic bubble memory.  In 1988 Ellenby sold GRiD Systems to the Tandy Corporation (Radio Shack) and founded Agilis, a producer of hand-held tablet computers, and then started GeoVector with his son, Thomas, pioneering navigational and augmented-reality applications. Here's a great documentary from the Computer History Museum featuring the work of Ellenby and the evolution of the GRiD Compass portable computer: Video of Pioneering the Laptop: Engineering the GRiD compass (Via Gizmodo)   More from around the web Latest News Blog View Close Latest InterviewbeyondAdam NussdorfDavid EickFreeform 1 Beyond executive producers promise a smart sci-fi series you can binge with the family Tara Bennett SherlockSteven Moffat 1 Sherlock showrunner Steven Moffat on that Season 4 premiere shocker Nathalie Caron Best of 2016Star WarsMarvelCaptain America: Civil WarArrivalRogue Onedoctor strange 4 Our Top 10 Movies of 2016 Blastr Staff Rogue One: A Star Wars StoryStar WarsDarth Vader 1 Rogue One designer on the backstory for Vader's awesome castle Matthew Jackson Futuramafan filmfan-o-rama 2 That live action Futurama fan film has arrived, and it's as terrifyingly great as you’d imagine Trent Moore ColonyUSA 0 Check out the latest trailers for USA's alien occupation series Colony Nathalie Caron MechtechrobotPacific Rimscience 2 Watch this 13-foot tall, piloted, real-life mech take its first steps Trent Moore full metal alchemistanime 1 Images of the day: First pics from live action Fullmetal Alchemist film Trent Moore The ExpanseSyfy 1 The Expanse heads to Mars in first look at Season 2 premiere Trent Moore Ridley ScottBatman v Superman: Dawn of JusticeSuperheroesBlade Runner 6 Here’s what Ridley Scott really thinks of superhero movies and why he won’t make one Nathalie Caron TV This WeekbeyondGrimm 0 TV THIS WEEK: Beyond and Emerald City premiere, Grimm returns, new Sherlock, and more Trent Moore DC ComicsGeoff Johns 7 DC to announce another new TV series soon, but what will it be?

"Administrations in the last six months, historically, are loathe to impose costs," former US National Security Council Director for Asian Affairs Michael Green said, addressing the possibility of a US response to alleged Chinese and Russian cyberattacks. Green explained that presidents are not likely to levy new costs in foreign policy at the end of their term that might "risk creating a crisis" for their successor, or that could "ruin [their] legacy" if the affected nation retaliates. Next week, Obama is expected to meet individually with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Xinping on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Beijing. It is likely that Obama will raise ongoing US concerns over alleged Chinese cyber espionage and recent attacks on US institutions, informally attributed to Russia at those meetings. "I certainly hope President Obama raises the cyber question," former State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for Eurasian Affairs Heather Conley said. © AP Photo/ Gerald Herbert Obama Fears China, Russia Approaching US Cyber CapabilitiesConley warned that the longer the United States debates the issue of imposing costs for malicious cyber activity, "our lack of resolve then messages to those using these tools… there is really not that cost imposition." Russian officials have denounced as "absurd" US accusations that it is using cyber activity to meddle in the US presidential election. US officials have yet to issue firm attribution for recent attacks on the Democratic National Committee, local voter registration databases, and think tanks. In 2015, Obama issued an executive order enabling the use of economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber actors. ...

Testing The Open-Source "RADV" Radeon Vulkan Driver vs. AMDGPU-PRO Written by Michael Larabel in Display Drivers on 30 August 2016. Page 1 of 6. 72 Comments With word coming out last week that the RADV open-source Vulkan driver can now render Dota 2 correctly, I've been running some tests the past few days of this RADV Vulkan driver compared to AMD's official (but currently closed-source) Vulkan driver bundled with the AMDGPU-PRO Vulkan driver. Background: Even months before the formal release of the Vulkan specification, AMD communicated that they would be initially releasing a closed-source Vulkan Linux driver that would later be open-sourced. We are 6+ months past the Vulkan 1.0 release, this Vulkan Linux driver has yet to be open-sourced nor has AMD communicated when that code drop may actually take place. In the absence of the open-source Radeon Vulkan driver, David Airlie and Bas Nieuwenhuizen set out to develop their own "community" based Radeon Vulkan driver at least as an interim solution and potentially to pressure AMD to get out their official Vulkan driver. Bas Nieuwenhuizen is an independent contributor while David Airlie is the DRM subsystem maintainer and Red Hat developer who has long been involved in open-source AMD/ATI Linux driver efforts. This new driver, RADV, is housed within the Mesa Git tree. RADV re-uses the AMDGPU LLVM compiler back-end, makes use of Intel's work on NIR within Mesa, and interfaces with the AMDGPU kernel DRM driver. Airlie explained in his original RADV announcement that this Radeon Vulkan driver is based upon Intel's "ANV" open-source Vulkan driver while the winsys to interface with the AMDGPU DRM kernel code is ported from Gallium3D. The RADV approach basically goes from SPIR-V through the NIR intermediate representation to LLVM IR for consumption by the AMDGPU LLVM back-end. There isn't any "Vulkan state tracker" for Gallium3D with this Khronos API being too low-level for implementing on top of Gallium. Current Status While the RADV driver was just started this summer, as of last week they already have it running with clean rendering on Valve's Dota 2 game. The bring-up of RADV was very brisk due to being able to re-use a lot of existing open-source Linux driver code and the fact that Vulkan drivers are much lighter/thinner than OpenGL drivers. Much of the RADV testing/development has happened from Tonga (e.g. R9 285 / R9 380) and Fiji (R9 Fury) hardware and that seems to be where you can get the best mileage from this open-source Vulkan driver. There were some regressions recently for Radeon RX 400 (Polaris) hardware, but with the latest Git code as of Monday it seemed to be working fine for at least my RX 480. Assuming RADV doesn't get killed off by an official AMD Vulkan code drop, there are plans to get RADV working for other AMD GCN GPUs. My tests for this article happened with a Radeon R9 285, R9 Fury, and RX 480. The Talos Principle and Dota 2 are the current main Linux games available with Vulkan renderers, not counting vkQuake or the light demos. Most of the RADV efforts so far have been around Dota 2 and the Vulkan conformance tests and other popular Vulkan code samples. The Talos Principle Not for benchmarking, but in curious to see how far RADV is with The Talos Principle Vulkan renderer, here are some pictures when trying the Git code: Not pretty, but then again they are most of the way there and given the speed at which RADV has been advancing, it wouldn't be too surprising if this game is playing with this open-source Vulkan driver in a matter of days or weeks.

The seventh-generation new Intel Core enhanced 14-nanometer-plus processor, called Kaby Lake, is its “strongest and fastest ever,” Intel said in a statement, and aims to meet the demands of increased connectedness and internet use, and growing consumption of high-quality video, ultra-high-definition (UHD) premium and user-generated content, 360-degree video formats, Virtual Reality and digital sports content. It will power ultra-thin notebooks and two-in-one laptop-tablet hybrids. Built on the foundation of the Skylake processors, which Intel launched last year and were also led from Israel, the Kaby Lake processors are more than 70 percent faster than a 5-year-old PC and 3.5 times better in 3D graphics performance, the company said in a statement. The new processors will have a longer-lasting battery — 9.5 hours of 4K video playback — and better security, and will enable more natural and intuitive interactions of users with their PCs, Intel said. “The seventh-generation processors push our performance forward,” Ran Senderovitz, general manager at Intel Israel Development Centers, said in a phone briefing with reporters. The Israeli team, with its colleagues worldwide, has pushed the boundaries of “global technology to new places,” he said. “We are talking about amazing technologies, technologies of 14nm. So it is like taking a hair and dividing it by 8,000.” Intel’s team in Haifa (Courtesy Mor Mazor) The new processors increase productivity with an up to 12 percent faster speed for application processes compared to the previous, sixth-generation, Intel processors, and an up to 19% faster speed for internet use, Senderovitz said. “To present year after year a double-digit performance improvement requires a lot of innovation and determination,” he said. The challenge of the Israeli team, which led the efforts and worked in collaboration with Intel’s other global developers, was to make these processors faster and more energy-efficient and also support high-quality video and virtual reality, as required by users today. “Today computers are at the center of our creativeness,” Senderovitz said, used for everything from editing music to viewing and creating UHD video content and gaming. Israel has traditionally been an important development center for Intel, with local teams coming up with some of the company’s most important products – among them the Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge processors, and last year’s Skylake, which are in many of the computers currently in use. Ran Senderovitz, general manager at Intel Israel Development Centers. (Courtesy) Kaby Lake will allow computers to dispense with a fan and have a small battery, making them light and thin, some of them just 7 millimeters thick and weighing 1.3 kilograms. “We are getting closer to a level in which computers are becoming as thin as smartphones,” Senderovitz said. The first computers with the new processors are expected to hit the market in September and will be aimed initially at private customers and small and medium businesses. Intel expects to see over 100 computer designs using the Kaby Lake in the fourth quarter of the year. Additional products, targeted at enterprises, workstations and enthusiasts’ notebooks and desktops, are expected in January, Intel said. The processors will be included in a variety of designs and price ranges, which may also include features like hassle-free facial recognition and Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 technology, a single-wire USB Type C connection that supports up to 40 Gpbs transfer speeds. The processors will also allow some PCs to offer users touch, voice and stylus interaction, Intel said. Intel has been operating in Israel since 1974 and directly employs around 10,000 workers in its Kiryat Gat production center and in four development centers, in Haifa, Yakum, Jerusalem and Petah Tikva. The Haifa center is Intel’s largest outside the US.

The family provides the first indication of what more modest product advances may look like as Intel stretches Moore’s law to cover with one process node multiple generations of chips. Kaby Lake processors gain a 12% improvement from enhancements to Intel’s 14nm process. They also include a modestly updated media engine with hardware support for decoding VP9 video and encoding and decoding 4K 10-bit HEVC video. Otherwise, the chips use the same architecture as the previous Skylake generation, including the existing Skylake x86 pipeline. The new generation is the first to break Intel’s tick-tock cadence of alternating between a new process node and a new microarchitecture every year. With the increasing complexity and costs of pursuing Moore’s Law and a slowing PC market, Intel decided to stretch one process generation across three years and three families of chips. The 14+nm process delivers transistor-level enhancements such as taller fins and improved gate pitch, interconnect speed and aspect ratio to deliver 12% better performance. At its Intel Developer Forum earlier this month, the company said it plans to make product families in three generations of its emerging 10nm process. At the systems level, Kaby Lake should enable 19% faster browsing and photo editing. Systems should deliver 4K resolutions for games running at 35 frames/second and support 4K movie playback for up to 9.5 hours. Intel updated two blocks on the Skylake media engine focused on video acceleration. (Image: Intel) Mobile Kaby Lake processors running at 4.5W-15W are shipping now with systems using them expected this fall. Higher-end notebooks and desktops with up to 65W processors will follow early next year. Many of the systems will sport innovations not directly related to the new processors. For example, as many as 120 designs are expected to use the Thunderbolt 3, a 40 Gbit/second link using the USB Type C connector. More than 50 systems are expected to adopt 4K panels and fanless notebooks such as the Asus Transformer 3 are expected to measure less than 7mm in thickness. Intel said the new systems will deliver “more than 70 percent faster mobile productivity than a 5-year-old PC and 3.5x better 3D graphics performance than a 5 year old PC.” The comparisons deflect attention from the lower performance numbers compared to last year’s 14nm Skylake chips. They also hope to encourage upgrades from users holding on to their systems longer than in the past.

An anonymous user recently uploaded some benchmarks for Intel’s upcoming 7th Generation Core Processors, codename Kaby Lake, to the SiSoft benchmark database. The benchmarks that were uploaded come from an Intel Core i7-7700K processor running on an ASRock Z270 Extreme 4 motherboard. Interestingly enough, it also reports that the CPU was paired with “2x 4GB Fujitsu TEAMGROUP-D4-3866 DIMM DDR3 PC3-34100” which is plausible as Kaby Lake, just like Skylake will support both DDR3 and DDR4 memory. The two benchmarks that were uploaded include SiSoft Sandra’s Processor Arithmetic Benchmark and Processor Multi-Media Benchmark. In the benchmarks, the Intel Core i7-7700K scored 151.94GOPS in the Processor Arithmetic Benchmark and 379.08Mpix/s in the Processor Multi-Media Benchmark. Here’s a look at a comparison between the leaked Intel Core i7-7700K benchmarks and benchmarks uploaded from the Intel Core i7-6700K. In both benchmarks, we can see that the Intel Core i7-7700K crushes the Intel Core i7-6700K. The Intel Core i7-7700K saw performance gains of ~10% in the Processor Arithmetic Benchmark and a whopping ~33% in the Processor Multi-Media Benchmark. Of course, it’s important to keep in mind that we’re comparing one benchmark run of an unreleased Intel Core i7-7700K against the average performance of the Intel Core i7-6700K so I wouldn’t put much faith in the accuracy of these results. However, if these numbers do end up being close to the actual performance, Kaby Lake could be rocking a huge improvement in performance that we typically don’t see too often between processors that utilize the same manufacturing process. Additionally, if this benchmark is in fact leaked from an actual Intel Core i7-7700K, we also have a few more concrete details about its specs as well. Here it shows that there’s 4 cores, 8 threads as expected and a core clock of 4.20GHz, which is likely the maximum turbo boost frequency. There’s also 4x 256kB L2 cache and a 8MB shared L3 similar to what we have in current generation Skylake processors. Intel’s upcoming Kaby Lake processors are expected to launch sometime in 4Q2016.   Source: SiSoftware Share this: Reddit Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Related Posted In CPU, Intel, News Tags CPU, Intel, Kaby Lake, Rumors CPU, Intel, Kaby Lake, Rumors About The Author Sam Chen Hardware and Technology Enthusiast. SSD Evangelist. Editor-in-Chief. You can find Sam's full biography here Matt Black It’s will likely be about %10 better performance same as always, the problem here is still 4 cores. If zen gets even within a stone’s throw performance but is offering 8 cores for the same price, it’s going to be such a better deal. Come on intel, workloads are threaded now, they have been threaded for a long time, christ you can get 8 core phones. I hate to say it but I might go AMD this round, which is something I haven’t said in a long time. Freeman4096 Everytime you add another core, you sacrifice a bit on singlecore performance. Intel simply believes that current consumer usage need 20 percent better Single core perf. Over double the core count. They are not wrong until dx11 finally dies.

Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, a senior leader within the Islamist militant group, died in the Syrian city, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks potential jihadist activity on the internet. SITE said the news was reported by Amaq Agency, a news operation set up by ISIS in 2014. According to SITE, ISIS announced his death in Arabic and English Tuesday on its channels on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app. More from SITE: In comm on #ISIS spox 'Adnani's death, ISIS threatened revenge with a generation born in ISIS territory & that "loves death more than life" — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) August 30, 2016 Al-Adnani’s death has not been independently confirmed. The nature of his death is not yet clear. It was Al-Adnani who announced the establishment of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in an audio recording in June 2014. He was considered one of ISIS’s most senior members, and believed to have planned the group’s operations outside of the two countries. He led the terrorist organization’s intelligence unit known as Emni. Rukmini Callimachi, The New York Times reporter known for her coverage of ISIS and terrorism, described Al-Adnani’s role on Twitter after news of his death: 10. But for me, the most detailed confirmation came from the jailhouse interview I was able to do with German member of ISIS Harry Sarfo — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) August 30, 2016 (Read about that interview in Callimachi's story from earlier this month here.) 11. It's Harry who spelled it out for me: Adnani, he said, is head of the Emni, ISIS' secret service. He is also the head of propaganda — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) August 30, 2016 12. He described how Adnani chaired a monthly meeting where ISIS reviewed all the gory videos they had shot and decided which to promote — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) August 30, 2016 Al-Adnani was born in Syria in 1977, according to the U.S. State Department. The U.S. government has offered a $5 million reward for his capture.

Most Popular Presented by Ian Allen My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next In the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. Continue Reading Marc Burckhardt The Unbelievable Tale of Jesus’s Wife Ariel Sabar A hotly contested, supposedly ancient manuscript suggests Christ was married. But believing its origin story—a real-life Da Vinci Code, involving a Harvard professor, a onetime Florida pornographer, and an escape from East Germany—requires a big leap of faith. On a humid afternoon this past November, I pulled off Interstate 75 into a stretch of Florida pine forest tangled with runaway vines. My GPS was homing in on the house of a man I thought might hold the master key to one of the strangest scholarly mysteries in recent decades: a 1,300-year-old scrap of papyrus that bore the phrase “Jesus said to them, My wife.” The fragment, written in the ancient language of Coptic, had set off shock waves when an eminent Harvard historian of early Christianity, Karen L. King, presented it in September 2012 at a conference in Rome. Never before had an ancient manuscript alluded to Jesus’s being married. The papyrus’s lines were incomplete, but they seemed to describe a dialogue between Jesus and the apostles over whether his “wife”—possibly Mary Magdalene—was “worthy” of discipleship. Its main point, King argued, was that “women who are wives and mothers can be Jesus’s disciples.” She thought the passage likely figured into ancient debates over whether “marriage or celibacy [was] the ideal mode of Christian life” and, ultimately, whether a person could be both sexual and holy. Continue Reading Edmon de Haro The War on Stupid People David H. Freedman American society increasingly mistakes intelligence for human worth. As recently as the 1950s, possessing only middling intelligence was not likely to severely limit your life’s trajectory. IQ wasn’t a big factor in whom you married, where you lived, or what others thought of you. The qualifications for a good job, whether on an assembly line or behind a desk, mostly revolved around integrity, work ethic, and a knack for getting along—bosses didn’t routinely expect college degrees, much less ask to see SAT scores. As one account of the era put it, hiring decisions were “based on a candidate having a critical skill or two and on soft factors such as eagerness, appearance, family background, and physical characteristics.” The 2010s, in contrast, are a terrible time to not be brainy. Those who consider themselves bright openly mock others for being less so. Even in this age of rampant concern over microaggressions and victimization, we maintain open season on the nonsmart. People who’d swerve off a cliff rather than use a pejorative for race, religion, physical appearance, or disability are all too happy to drop the s‑bomb: Indeed, degrading others for being “stupid” has become nearly automatic in all forms of disagreement. Continue Reading NBC Seth Meyers Proves He's the Anti-Fallon David Sims The Late Night host ripped into Donald Trump’s history with the birther movement, just days after his NBC colleague’s softball interview with the candidate. When Jimmy Fallon talked to Donald Trump on The Tonight Show last week, he ruffled the presidential candidate’s hair. Seth Meyers, the host of Fallon’s former show Late Night, had a slightly different message for the Republican presidential candidate last night. “Obama was born in the United States, period?” he asked mockingly, repeating Trump’s recent specious assertion that he was no longer a believer in the “birther” movement. “Fuck you, exclamation point!” Sadly, Meyers couldn’t say this to Trump’s face—in fact, until last week, the late-night host had jokingly banned the candidate from appearing on the show as a response to Trump’s ban of The Washington Post from his press events. He recently lifted that ban after Trump did the same, but joked to The Huffington Post that Late Night was “pretty booked up” on guests from now through November. But even if he were invited, it’s hard to imagine Trump appearing on Meyers’s show, which has become an appreciable counterbalance to the much more light-hearted antics of his hair-ruffling network partner. Continue Reading Olaf Blecker The Binge Breaker Bianca Bosker Tristan Harris believes Silicon Valley is addicting us to our phones. He’s determined to make it stop. On a recent evening in San Francisco, Tristan Harris, a former product philosopher at Google, took a name tag from a man in pajamas called “Honey Bear” and wrote down his pseudonym for the night: “Presence.” Harris had just arrived at Unplug SF, a “digital detox experiment” held in honor of the National Day of Unplugging, and the organizers had banned real names. Also outlawed: clocks, “w-talk” (work talk), and “WMDs” (the planners’ loaded shorthand for wireless mobile devices). Harris, a slight 32-year-old with copper hair and a tidy beard, surrendered his iPhone, a device he considers so addictive that he’s called it “a slot machine in my pocket.” He keeps the background set to an image of Scrabble tiles spelling out the words face down, a reminder of the device’s optimal position. Continue Reading Sara Wong / The Atlantic No Spanking, No Time-Out, No Problems Olga Khazan A child psychologist argues punishment is a waste of time when trying to eliminate problem behavior. Try this instead. Say you have a problem child. If it’s a toddler, maybe he smacks his siblings. Or she refuses to put on her shoes as the clock ticks down to your morning meeting at work. If it’s a teenager, maybe he peppers you with obscenities during your all-too-frequent arguments. The answer is to punish them, right? Not so, says Alan Kazdin, director of the Yale Parenting Center. Punishment might make you feel better, but it won’t change the kid’s behavior. Instead, he advocates for a radical technique in which parents positively reinforce the behavior they do want to see until the negative behavior eventually goes away. As I was reporting my recent series about child abuse, I came to realize that parents fall roughly into three categories. There’s a small number who seem intuitively to do everything perfectly: Moms and dads with chore charts that actually work and snack-sized bags of organic baby carrots at the ready. There’s an even smaller number who are horrifically abusive to their kids. But the biggest chunk by far are parents in the middle. They’re far from abusive, but they aren’t super-parents, either. They’re busy and stressed, so they’re too lenient one day and too harsh the next. They have outdated or no knowledge of child psychology, and they’re scrambling to figure it all out. Continue Reading Phelan M. Ebenhack / AP What Americans Don’t Get About Nordic Countries Anu Partanen When U.S. politicians talk about Scandinavian-style social welfare, they fail to explain the most important aspect of such policies: selfishness. Bernie Sanders is hanging on, still pushing his vision of a Nordic-like socialist utopia for America, and his supporters love him for it. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is chalking up victories by sounding more sensible. “We are not Denmark,” she said in the first Democratic debate, pointing instead to America’s strengths as a land of freedom for entrepreneurs and businesses. Commentators repeat endlessly the mantra that Sanders’s Nordic-style policies might sound nice, but they’d never work in the U.S. The upshot is that Sanders, and his supporters, are being treated a bit like children—good-hearted, but hopelessly naive. That’s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too. A Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I’m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I’m told, because they are small, homogeneous “nanny states” where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family. This, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don’t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I’m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good. What this is mostly taken to mean is that Americans will never, ever agree to pay higher taxes to provide universal social services, as the Nordics do. Thus Bernie Sanders, and anyone else in the U.S. who brings up Nordic countries as an example for America, is living in la-la land. Continue Reading Yuri Gripas / Reuters Democrats Have a Religion Problem Emma Green A conversation with Michael Wear, a former Obama White House staffer, about the party’s illiteracy on and hostility toward white evangelicals. There aren’t many people like Michael Wear in today’s Democratic Party. The former director of Barack Obama’s 2012 faith-outreach efforts is a theologically conservative evangelical Christian. He is opposed to both abortion and same-sex marriage, although he would argue that those are primarily theological positions, and other issues, including poverty and immigration, are also important to his faith. During his time working for Obama, Wear was often alone in many of his views, he writes in his new book, Reclaiming Hope. He helped with faith-outreach strategies for Obama’s 2008 campaign, but was surprised when some state-level officials decided not to pursue this kind of engagement: “Sometimes—as I came to understand the more I worked in politics—a person’s reaction to religious ideas is not ideological at all, but personal,” he writes. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters 'He Was the Nationalist Candidate' Emma Green The editor of First Things on Donald Trump and the limits of multi-cultural democracy As Donald Trump prepares to take office, R.R. Reno of First Things is feeling “guardedly optimistic.” The editor of the conservative, religious magazine cautiously supported the Republican’s candidacy. Reno does not believe Trump will fix what he sees as America’s frayed social contract. But he does think the incoming president will disrupt the current political system, which he considers deeply flawed. I spoke with Reno about his outlook for the coming administration. We discussed Reno’s reasons for supporting Trump (“I was as much voting against the fantasy of open borders as I was voting for [Trump’s] policies,” he said); the alt-right (a kind of performance art, he argues); and how Christian principles should influence policy (“Americans are uniquely tempted to imagine that we are a church … This is one of the reasons why we’re such a dangerous country,” he said). At its center, though, our conversation was about the possibilities and limits of multi-cultural democracy—what makes a nation, and what’s happening to visions of a global, open-borders world. Continue Reading Mitch Dumke / Reuters The Dangerous Myth That Hillary Clinton Ignored the Working Class Derek Thompson To many white Trump voters, the problem wasn’t her economic stance, but the larger vision—a multi-ethnic social democracy—that it was a part of. Perhaps the clearest takeaway from the November election for many liberals is that Hillary Clinton lost because she ignored the working class. In the days after her shocking loss, Democrats complained that Clinton had no jobs agenda. A widely shared essay in The Nation blamed Clinton's "neoliberalism" for abandoning the voters who swung the election. “I come from the white working class,” Bernie Sanders said on CBS This Morning, “and I am deeply humiliated that the Democratic Party cannot talk to where I came from.” But here is the troubling reality for civically minded liberals looking to justify their preferred strategies: Hillary Clinton talked about the working class, middle class jobs, and the dignity of work constantly. And she still lost. Continue Reading How to Turn Anxiety Into Excitement Jeremy Raff and Olga Khazan It takes three words.

(Source: GlobalFoundries) AMD deal a big boost for GlobalFoundries 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Malta GlobalFoundries' Fab 8 will supply Advanced Micro Devices with its leading-edge computer chips through at least the end of 2020, under an amended agreement announced by AMD Wednesday. The extension assures a long-term market for GlobalFoundries. "This is a five-year extension," said Thomas Caulfield, general manager of GlobalFoundries' Fab 8 semiconductor plant, which has 3,000 employees. "We've never done one of that length in the past." The extension comes as AMD rolls out its newest microprocessors and graphics chips, which have been getting positive reviews. Last month, at a demonstration in San Francisco, AMD's new Zen processor, produced at GlobalFoundries, outperformed rival Intel Corp.'s most powerful chip. News of the event boosted AMD shares by 10 percent. Fab 8 is producing processors at the 14-nanometer level, but expects a move to processors with transistors of 7 nanometers. "This deal cements our next-generation technology of seven nanometers," Caulfield said of the amendment. How small is 7 nanometers? A thousand 7-nanometer transistors could fit on a cross-section of the human hair, Caulfield said. The agreement also has advantages for AMD. "The five-year amendment further strengthens our strategic manufacturing relationship with GlobalFoundries while providing AMD with increased flexibility to build our high-performance product road map with additional foundries in the 14 nanometer and 7 nanometer technology nodes," said Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO. "Our goal is for AMD to have continued access to leading-edge foundry process technologies enabling us to build multiple generations of great products for years to come." AMD spun off its manufacturing operations in 2009, creating what became GlobalFoundries. Foundries execute the designs produced by fabless companies such as AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia. As part of the amended agreement, AMD will pay GlobalFoundries $100 million by late 2017, as well as continuing quarterly payments beginning in 2017. GlobalFoundries' execution of 14-nanometer production is expected to benefit its other customers as well. "We have numerous customers here enjoying the success of 14-nanometer technology," Caulfield said. "Fab 8 is one of the few places in the world you can do this technology. It's not a very crowded field. "It means we're a viable business," Caulfield added when asked about the supply agreement's impact on possible job growth. "And iable businesses get to play another day." eanderson@timesunion.com • 518-454-5323 Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Disney Princess Girls' Puffer Coat for $18 + pickup at Walmart WalmartPosted 15 hr 41 min ago SHOP NOW Rollback Cell Phones at Walmart: Up to 67% off + free shipping...

It's new Yoga Book instead has a second large touchscreen that can turn into a touchscreen keyboard when needed. It can also be written on with a finger or stylus - or simply act as a second screen, or be folded away. Scroll down for video  Instead of a physical keyboard, the $500 Yoga Book unveiled in Berlin instead has a second large touchscreen that can turn into a keyboard when needed. IS IT A LAPTOP OR TABLET?  Although Lenovo calls Yoga Book a tablet, the keyboard part isn't detachable, making the device a laptop.  The keyboard, though, can fold all the way to the back to make the device feel more like a tablet. The machine will also be available in two versions, an Android version costing $500, and a $600 Windows one. 'We set out to redefine the tablet category conundrum, namely that consumers no longer separate their activities into productivity and entertainment – it all blends together, and so should the device they use,' said Jeff Meredith of Lenovo. 'The Yoga Book introduces keyboard and handwriting input capability in an elegantly simple, unconventionally slender tablet design.  'We believe our unique design will offer tablet, 2-in-1 and traditional notebook buyers a first-of-its-kind option for evolving usage trends.' The launch comes as Apple, Samsung and other tablet makers are pushing professional tablet models with keyboard accessories.

Share this article Share 13 shares Those companies are hoping to appeal to businesses and individuals looking to replace their laptops. Meredith admitted the Yoga Book might not be appropriate for extensive typing, but should be suitable for people - especially younger people - who now use the phone's touch screen to respond to email at night or even take notes in classrooms. YOGA BOOK SPECS  Intel® Atom™ X5 processor and 4GB of memory. 9.6mm closed, tapering to 4.05mm at its slimmest edge Lightest 2-in-1 in the world at 690 grams (1.52 pounds) 15-hour battery life  Watchband hinge that folds 360 degrees.  10.1-inch IPS FHD screen, high-quality sound enhanced with Dolby Atmos and 64GB of memory. He added that when BlackBerrys were still popular, people couldn't imagine getting rid of physical keyboards on their phones, either. The 10-inch Yoga Book retains the clamshell design of the laptop, but puts a second touch screen where the keyboard normally goes. People can type on a touch-screen keyboard there, or just write or draw on that second screen with an included stylus.  You can even use a regular pen or pencil, though you'd want to put a sheet of paper over the screen to avoid damage. Although Lenovo calls Yoga Book a tablet, the keyboard part isn't detachable, making the device a laptop.  The keyboard, though, can fold all the way to the back to make the device feel more like a tablet. People can type on a touch-screen keyboard , or just write or draw on the second screen with an included stylus 'Up until now, we've been using tablets in ways we weren't meant to: for productivity, for example, which becomes painful when typing or applying a stylus onto a touch screen that you're using on-the-go,' the firm claims.  The Yoga Book will start shipping in the coming weeks.  An Android version will cost $500, and Windows will be $600. The unveiling came hours after rival computer maker Acer unveiled what it calls the world's first laptop to measure less than a centimeter.  HOW THE HALO KEYBOARD WORKS  The so-called 'Halo' keyboard, is a full touch screen backlit keyboard made with glass chosen to give a rough, matte feel and finish, along with anti-glare coating to ensure the best possible touch-typing experience.  The keyboard lacks any physical keys, showing up as a solid white outline on the Yoga Book's second panel only when it's needed.  It also has built-in, sensitive haptic technology, which enables touch feedback to guide typing and reduce mistakes.   Users can also write with the real-pen accessory that holds real ink tips onto a piece of paper or notepad covering the multi-use keyboard panel, or as a stylus when applied straight onto the panel. The real-pen accessory can draw with the precision of a pencil or paintbrush, with 2,048 pressure levels and 100-degree angle detection.  The Swift 7 is 9.98 millimeters (0.39 inch) to be exact.  But Lenovo says the Yoga Book is thinner, at 9.6 millimeters, or slightly more than the thickest iPad at 7.5 millimeters. Acer, meanwhile, unveiled a laptop with a curved screen, something traditionally limited to computer monitors for desktops.  The Predator 21 X is designed for video games and comes with eye-tracking technology that promises to let players aim, identify enemies and take cover by gazing at the screen.       Share or comment on this article e-mail 13 shares Most watched News videos Mariah botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage Heart-warming moment woman plays piano and sings in cathedral Man goes crazy when he catches another guy in bed with his wife Man finally talks to wife after over twenty years of silence Woman takes seven minutes to parallel park car in double space Passenger insults flight attendant before being led away by police Disturbing moment pitbull kills small dog in front of its owner Mass brawl erupts between customers and restaurant staff Dog shows off its incredibly efficient banana-eating technique Bottles and furniture thrown during terrifying NYE fight Spooky!
